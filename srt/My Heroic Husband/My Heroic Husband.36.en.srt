[Episode 36]

3
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,920
Is there a shortcut that can lead us to the capital of Jing?

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,979
There is a mountain road in the northeast. We can get there a day earlier.

5
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,199
If we set out now, we can arrive the day after tomorrow.

6
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay.

7
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,919
Let's go now!

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,939
Hold on. Let's pick up someone first.

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,199
Qin Si Yuan.

10
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,240
Qin Si Yuan.

11
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,860
How dare you bring up the late Emperor's will!

12
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,380
You're not asking me to think twice.

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,039
You're clearly giving me an ultimatum.

14
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,420
Your Majesty.

15
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,778
There is someone outside the hall who wants to see you.

16
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,179
Who is it?

17
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:50,739
The visitor introduced himself as the Chief Commander of the Secret Investigation Department,

18
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,640
Ning Li Heng.

19

[Jin State Capital]

20
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,310
My greetings to you, Lord He.

21
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,119
Lord Lu.

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,639
Where is Lord Qin?

23
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,198
Escort Lord Qin to the Hall of Mental Cultivation.

24
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,039
Serve him well!

25
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,959
Lord Lu.

26
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,740
Please take me to His Majesty to present him the peace agreement.

27
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,999
No hurry.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,580
It's been a tiring journey.

29
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,579
Come with me to the palace for rest today.

30
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,119
We will see His Majesty tomorrow.

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,620
Come.

[Border of Wu Dynasty and Jin State]

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,278
General, look!

34
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:33,600
Xinggu Pass in ahead of us.

35
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,958
On my command!

36
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,198
Speed up the march!

37
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,978
Yes!

38
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,879
Speed up the march!

39

[Wu]

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,599
Following the will of the late Emperor,

41
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,719
we worshiped peace and harmony for generations.

42
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,359
In order let civilians live in peace,

43
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,658
I've always thought about a truce to keep them safe.

44
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:09,039
Why would I want to wage a war?

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,719
I'm lucky to rule the kingdom and to be a parent.

46
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,139
So peace is what I've always wanted.

47
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,259
I hope the two nations will stop fighting now,

48
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,559
so we can both rest and recover.

49
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,479
The Wu Dynasty is willing to provide, starting from the fifth year of Jinghan's reign,

50
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,119
a tribute of 200,000 bolts of cloth, 500,000 bolts of spun silk,

51
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,339
and 5 million taels on an annual basis to Jing.

52
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,838
I hope the two countries will become good friends

53
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,360
and enjoy thousands of years of peace.

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,539
Your Majesty is blessed!

55
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,679
Jing State will prosper and thrive under Your Majesty's rule.

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,178
He Yuan Chang,

57
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,879
how dare you come?

58
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,479
Your Majesty, I am at your disposal.

59
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,518
I've asked the Wu Dynasty for these terms of peace.

60
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,559
You are at my disposal?

61
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,119
Wu Dynasty's 200,000 troops have arrived at Xinggu Pass.

62
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,019
What kind of peacemaking is this?

63
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,939
What? That's impossible!

64
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,999
The Wu Dynasty is determined to make peace.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,159
They won't start another war.

66
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,540
Are you saying I'm a liar?

67
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,660
No, no.

68
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,759
That's not what I mean.

69
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,000
I mean perhaps the war report is wrong.

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,238
Your Majesty, I have been loyal to you.

71
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:30,979
I'll never...

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,659
Take his head to Xinggu Pass and hang it on the city tower.

73
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,200
The Wu Dynasty wants a fight?

74
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,398
Let's give them one!

75
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,799
Yes.

76
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,138
Your Majesty. The peace envoy of the Wu Dynasty wants to see you.

77
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:52,799
Another one?

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,799
The envoy's surname is Ning, and courtesy name Li Heng.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
He has a peace agreement to show you.

80

[The six provinces near Qingyun have always belonged to Wu Dynasty and it was occupied by Liang Jing]

81
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,919
Your Majesty, greetings from Ning Liheng, peace envoy of Wu Dynasty.

82
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,199
Peace envoy.

83
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,580
How dare you come at this time?

84
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,460
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,799
I'm sure you already know that our army is heading to Xinggu Pass.

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,278
But that's Dong Dao Fu's own intention.

87
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,300
We are on the verge of war.

88
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,078
The Emperor of Wu sent me here especially

89
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,579
to discuss the strategy to stop the war.

90
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,039
Your army is reaching the city gate.

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,078
You treat us like dirt!

92
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,439
There is no way to stop the war now.

93
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
I have a solution.

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,999
Tell me about it.

95
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,840
Your Majesty,

96
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,000
you only need to give us back

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
the six provinces near Qingyun.

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,420
Your Majesty.

99
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,280
Why don't you let me finish?

100
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,259
It's not too late to kill me If my plan doesn't work.

101
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,380
Give me a reason not to kill you.

102
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm actually a cloth merchant in Jiangning.

104
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,158
I don't know much about leadership.

105
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,938
I only know how to do business.

106
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,279
So I came today

107
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,979
to do a business with Your Majesty.

108
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,439
You want to do business with me?

109
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,940
Yes.

110
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,518
The six provinces near Qingyun are Wu Dynasty's border land.

111
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,999
It's adjacent to Jing State.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,278
If you are willing to return them to us, the Wu Dynasty hereby promises to

113
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,479
make the six provinces near Qingyun

114
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,440
a permanent free trade area.

115
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,839
Your Majesty, In the six provinces near Qingyun,

116
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,019
an independent judicial and monetary system will be set up.

117
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,040
Ten years of tax will be exempted.

118
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,420
By then businessmen from both nations can do business here.

119
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,379
Jing State has a barren land with mineral scarcity.

120
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,778
Yet there is an urgent need to export horses and spices.

121
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,540
If the trade can be normalized, you can make up for deficiencies.

122
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,638
By then, your nation will be strong and powerful with abundant food

123
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,639
and people living in contentment.

124
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,160
You don't have to conquer territory by then.

125
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,319
My army has been marching south.

126
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,940
We'll wipe out

127
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,000
the Wu Dynasty in a few day.

128
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,680
As such,

129
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,119
I don't think there's any point in that.

130
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,259
Your Majesty,

131
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,399
because I suppose you don't dare.

132
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,239
Did you say I don't dare?

133
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,879
If you do,

134
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,879
why are you discussing this with me?

135
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,560
In the battle of Liang and Jing, your state has suffered great loss.

136
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,640
If you use all of your national power to strike a war with the Wu Dynasty,

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,019
the remainder of Liang must be lurking about no matter if you win or lose.

138
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,658
You don't dare to take the risk and bet on a single throw.

139
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:39,940
So peacemaking is your best option.

140
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,599
Your name is Ning Li Heng?

141
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,499
Yes.

142
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,479
What rank are you in Wu Dynasty?

143
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,359
Your Majesty,

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,399
I don't have any rank.

145
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,240
Can you represent the Wu Dynasty?

146
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,940
I can't.

147
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,120
But he can.

148
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,560
What did you say?

149
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,199
You have a solution to solve the dilemma?

150
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,399
Yes.

151
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,000
Your Majesty. Well...

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,899
You can speak freely. I won't blame you.

153
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Then I will be frank with you.

154
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,380
Have you ever thought about why the late Emperor could

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,859
make Dong Dao Fu call for war only with the testamentary edict,

156
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,479
and nobody dared disobey?

157
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,878
Your Majesty, you have inherited the throne for 5 years.

158
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,859
Yet the officials in the court still act according to the late Emperor's edict.

159
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:58,818
You need an opportunity to prove your ability to lead the country.

160
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,099
Why don't you take this opportunity

161
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,000
to head north with the army and recover the six provinces near Qingyun?

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,219
By then, you will win all the officials' worship and the citizens' respect.

163
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:09,359
You won't need to worry about your credibility.

164
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,039
You don't think I want to

165
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,980
recover the six provinces near Qingyun?

166
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,899
I've been thinking about it every day.

167
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,039
But Jing has taken over Xinggu Pass.

168
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,040
If the war starts,

169
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,259
I'm afraid Wu will be in great trouble.

170
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,999
Your Majesty.

171
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:38,179
What if we stop the war?

172
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:39,700
Stop the war?

173
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,540
I have a plan. It may be possible to subdue them without starting a war.

174
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,359
It's just that I'm afraid the following days will be tough for you.

175
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,639
The emperor of Wu Dynasty has come all the way here to make peace.

176
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,120
Your Majesty.

177
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,720
My emperor has come here

178
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,399
because he knows you're a man of noble character

179
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,259
and you never repay kindness with grievances.

180
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,360
Now that there's a way to make peace,

181
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,100
why do we have to meet on the battleground?

182
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,999
Envoy Ning, you're quite right!

183
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:18,240
Besides, the Emperor has come here in person.

184
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
He has shown his sincerity.

185
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,720
I

186
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,760
agree to your proposal,

187
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,480
but I have two more conditions.

188
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,559
If you disagree, then the offer will be off the table.

189
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,779
Your Majesty?

190
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,559
Your Majesty, please go on.

191
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,740
First,

192
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,439
the Emperor of Wu Dynasty has to stay in Jing State as a captive for 5 years.

193
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:58,338
Your Majesty, since we are doing business, we should trust each other!

194
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,319
How can you kidnap your business partner?

195
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,400
If not, I won't rest assured.

196
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,799
And how could I return the six provinces near Qingyun to you?

197
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:15,099
The Wu Dynasty will give the prince as a hostage.

198
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,059
That's the Wu Dynasty's Emperor!

199
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,220
So determined!

200
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,380
And one more thing.

201
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,459
That Qin Si Yuan.

202
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,919
He must be decapitated.

203
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,519
Your Majesty.

204
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,459
Master Qin is in his sixties. He will retire soon.

205
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,460
I vouch for him with my life.

206
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,759
Qin Si Yuan will never walk into the court again.

207
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,180
Qin Si Yuan has always wanted a war.

208
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,500
If he doesn't die,

209
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,280
it will be difficult to placate the millions of soldiers in my state.

210
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,899
Your Majesty,

211
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:54,179
please think twice!

212
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,379
If you don't agree, I'll meet you on the battlefield.

213
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,920
Your Majesty.

214
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,759
Ning Li Heng, you did a great job!

215
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,000
You have my word.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,799
As long as I take back the six provinces near Qingyun,

217
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,199
when this ends, no matter its official rank or wealth,

218
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,459
I will give you whatever you want.

219
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,459
Thank you, Your Majesty. But I have nothing else to ask for.

220
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,939
All I ask is to keep Master Qin's life.

221
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,220
Baili Hongji sounded very resolute.

222
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,659
I'm afraid

223
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,278
there is no other option.

224
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,079
Your Majesty, Right Chancellor Qin is the pillar of our nation.

225
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,759
If he dies in Jing State, Wu's reputation will be at risk.

226
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
I know.

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
But for the sake of the Wu Dynasty,

228
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,939
and for the six lost provinces near Qingyun,

229
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,320
There is no other choice for me now.

230
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,699
Perhaps,

231
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,579
for Right Chancellor Qin,

232
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,279
this is the best ending.

233
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,100
I see.

234
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,760
Your Majesty, please have a good rest.

235
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,480
I'll take care of the rest.

236
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,120
Go ahead!

237
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,459
Help me achieve this great ambition!

238
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,400
His Majesty has given up.

239
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,039
But I haven't.

240
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,319
You are here. Have a seat.

241
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,559
Talking about the game of Go... I have played it for many years.

242
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,999
This stalemate has confused me for five years.

243
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,680
It's a shame!

244
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,539
Master Qin,

245
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,820
let me try.

246
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,918
Well, you always like confusing and risky moves.

247
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:02,239
But they're also smart moves,

248
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,140
Excellent! They're also smart moves.

249
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,359
In this way, just by giving away one piece,

250
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,979
you can turn the tables now.

251
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,200
Although this move is risky,

252
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,759
if I fight for my life,

253
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,359
I may still have a chance of survival.

254
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,019
Such a stupid move!

255
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,880
You're really wrong to make this move.

256
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,918
You were clearly winning. If you insist on saving this piece,

257
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm afraid you will lose.

258
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,420
Master Qin,

259
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,260
this is not the first time you've known me.

260
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,419
I am a stupid man.

261
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,060
So are my moves in the game of Go.

262
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,959
I have to win the game.

263
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:00,600
I must also keep this piece.

264
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,159
If someone wants to stop me, then we can die together at the worst.

265
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,539
Stop now.

266
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,659
The more pieces you provide, the more you'll lose.

267
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,039
The game is not finished.

268
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,659
How can I give up so soon?

269
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,740
If you keep going,

270
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,960
there will only be a dead end.

271
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,099
Take my advice.

272
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,899
Don't struggle for anything. Focus on the big picture.

273
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,679
If I can't save this piece,

274
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,420
even if we lose the big picture, so what?

275
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,330
I know you really want to save me.

276
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,850
But have you ever thought about it?

277
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:23,699
Even if you save me now, when I get back to the Wu Dynasty I will die, too.

278
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,380
You are a merchant.

279
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,380
You should know that everyone in the world pursues profit.

280
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,978
I gave the secret edict to Dong Dao Fu. It's over His Majesty's bottom line.

281
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,999
His Majesty won't keep me.

282
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,680
If I were to be punished, people would stand up for me.

283
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,079
By then, more turmoil would arise, and more trouble would follow.

284
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,819
The Emperor's authority would be doubted.

285
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:55,520
If you'd just follow the tide and just let Baili Hongji kill me,

286
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,079
it would be of great benefit to His Majesty.

287
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,939
Likewise, Baili Hongji also seeks interests for his state.

288
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,700
Between the choices of two emperors,

289
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,039
I'm already an abandoned piece.

290
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,760
At least my worthless life can facilitate

291
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,900
the permanent peace between the two nations.

292
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,040
You should be able to figure it out.

293
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,599
Don't feel pity for me. It is a worthy death.

294
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,559
I can finally rest in peace.

295
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
I see.

296
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,940
Master Qin,

297
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,220
I lost.

298
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,480
Remember to take good charge of the Secret Investigation Department.

299
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,760
You have to give priority to the court.

300
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,839
You mustn't use the public resources for your own benefit or go against the law.

301
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,980
Go visit Shaoqian for me during the Qingming Festival.

302
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,699
I have nothing more to ask.

303
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,720
Take care of yourself in the future.

304
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,820
Take care.

305
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,940
Take care.

306
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,330
[Jing]

307
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,399
Hold on!

308
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,279
I'll do it myself!

309
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Pass my words to the three armies.

310
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,399
Withdraw the troops!

311
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:36,738
Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor!

312
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,580
General, the army is very tired now.

313
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,458
How about we set up a camp here and then we can attack at night?

314
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,240
No time to lose.

315
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,539
Let's fight a quick battle!

316
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,040
Yes.

317
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,259
Three armies, take my orders!

318
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,399
Take Xinggu Pass before sunset!

319
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,240
Yes!

320
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,318
General, listen.

321
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:10,260
It is the sound of a horn.

322
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,520
Report!

323
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,718
Genera, Jing's army is retreating.

324
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,498
The news from the north said our dynasty has agreed to a peace treaty with Jing State.

325
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,899
Xinggu Pass and the six provinces near Qingyun have been taken back by our dynasty.

326
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,040
General...

327
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,300
[One year later]

328
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,120
[Wudu]

329
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,419
Long live the Emperor!

330
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,700
As you were.

331
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

332
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,339
I have something urgent to report.

333
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:12,319
Is there anything wrong with the six provinces near Qingyun under your jurisdiction?

334
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,279
Your Majesty, nearly one year since the setup of the six provinces near Qingyun,

335
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,820
business contacts between our nation and Jing State have multiplied.

336
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,598
Cities in the six provinces swarm with businessmen.

337
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,118
People of both nations have gained huge profits as well.

338
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,679
Tax revenue has boosted more than ten times.

339
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,598
Just recently, there are a few matters for Your Majesty to decide.

340
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,380
Go on.

341
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,739
First, the remainders of Liang State have become bandits,

342
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:42,159
plundering our caravans frequently.

343
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,558
When our army tried to catch them, they fled to Jing's territory.

344
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,000
There's nothing we can do.

345
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,080
In the long run, it will certainly affect the trade of caravans.

346
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,158
Second, in recent years,

347
00:28:57,158 --> 00:29:00,078
many forged porcelains were found in the market.

348
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,820
It continues despite repeated prohibition.

349
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,439
The source is suspected to come from Jing State.

350
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,118
Third, the cavalry has recently caught some

351
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,299
scouts from the western regions.

352
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,978
These all started half a year ago

353
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:21,698
when we signed the Supplementary Trade Agreement with Jing State.

354
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:23,520
At the time,

355
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,918
it was Ning Li Heng, the Commander of the Secret Investigation Department, who took charge of it.

356
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,039
Go to him and consult him.

357
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

358
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:06,458
When Lady is sitting, you're lying down. When she's busy, you are idling around.

359
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,339
You don't get to eat it. I'll give it to my Lady.

360
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:12,539
Why don't you go ask her? I've told her to rest. But what is she doing?

361
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,899
Lord Commander.

362
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,620
Why do you come here again?

363
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,780
Nothing good happens when you come.

364
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,380
What's wrong?

365
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,300
Some trouble arose in the six provinces near Qingyun.

366
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,740
General Dong asks for you to help decide what to do.

367
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,539
I see.

368
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,519
Are you available tonight? Let's have a drink.

369
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,898
I still have work to do. I'm sorry that I can't.

370
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:47,758
I might as well resign. At least we can still drink together.

371
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:51,058
I'm off the day after tomorrow. I'll come and join you.

372
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,679
You can go.

373
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,459
Something else has happened with the six provinces near Qingyun.

374
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,459
Even the scouts from the western regions are there.

375
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:32,759
So, we still need to add more people.

376
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:35,679
At the end of the year, we will add some more laws.

377
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,099
After all, it's a place for us to do business.

378
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:42,259
All people going there must follow my rules.

379
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,039
Since you already have a solution, you don't need to ask me at all.

380
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,180
Here you are with the wine and meat.

381
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,000
Are you sending me to Qingyun?

382
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,579
Who else could go if you don't? Nobody but you can deal with it.

383
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:59,219
Besides, you're the only one who I can talk to about this. Who else can I talk to?

384
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,579
The old man has stopped dealing with this for more than a year. He doesn't care about anything!

385
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,920
What do you mean by that?

386
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,140
Who says I don't care about anything?

387
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,339
Your Majesty, Envoy Ning has come.

388
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,259
Your Majesty.

389
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,299
As you were.

390
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

391
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,700
I heard you want to see me. What is it about?

392
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,900
It's only between you and me.

393
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,258
Your Majesty. Well...

394
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:04,640
Leave now.

395
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,099
Yes.

396
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,739
Go on.

397
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:19,200
Your Majesty, you don't really want to kill Master Qin.

398
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,558
It is Master Qin's intention to have the army approach Xinggu Pass.

399
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,630
Even if you let go of him

400
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,480
after he goes back, he is still doomed.

401
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,819
But if Master Qin dies in Jing State,

402
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,720
Qin's disciples in the court

403
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,619
and the whole Secret Investigation Department won't let it go so easily.

404
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,179
That peace between the two nations and the six provinces near Qingyun

405
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,279
will all go up in a puff of smoke.

406
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,319
Your Majesty, the reason why you want to kill Master Qin

407
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:48,099
is because the soldiers of Jing State

408
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:51,178
all desired to kill him.

409
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:53,018
If you execute him in public,

410
00:33:53,018 --> 00:33:57,220
you will show your authority and also comfort the army.

411
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,859
Tomorrow, at the time of the execution

412
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,699
you can keep his life secret.

413
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:05,458
I'll send him back to Wu Dynasty secretly.

414
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:09,038
This way, to my Emperor, he will be a dead man.

415
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:11,578
If he shows up again, then he will commit the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

416
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:15,459
But to Qin's adherents, he's just retired.

417
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:18,678
He will give up on national affairs, just living in peace for the rest of his life.

418
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:21,919
In this way, all the demands of multiple parties will be met.

419
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,059
Only then can both nations enjoy true peace.

420
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:30,280
Why do you think

421
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,860
I'll listen to your words?

422
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,640
Because of Your Majesty's vision and foresight.

423
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,820
I barely know Your Majesty.

424
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,418
But it is clear that you're thinking of the bigger picture.

425
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,780
You don't really care about small losses like a city or a province.

426
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,660
Instead, what you care about is the long-lasting peace of Jing State.

427
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,019
So today,

428
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,339
I have been bold enough to come and offer my advice.

429
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,539
Your Majesty, for the sake of the two nations' military and civilians,

430
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,199
please consider my advice!

431
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,299
I never expected that

432
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,679
you would go to Baili Hongji.

433
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,579
In fact, it was you who reminded me.

434
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:28,699
You said everyone in this world pursues profit.

435
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,220
Baili Hongji is the best profit-seeker.

436
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,740
The reason why he agreed to the plan for the six provinces near Qingyun

437
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,139
is because he wanted to take this opportunity to recover and strengthen the national power.

438
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,700
Killing you has no benefit other than comforting his troops.

439
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,099
So why would he do that?

440
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:53,999
That's why you used your last piece to create a win-win situation

441
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,900
on the chessboard.

442
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,499
Then you deliberately admit defeat.

443
00:35:57,499 --> 00:36:02,559
You were implying that you'd found the way to convince Baili Hongji.

444
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,079
Yes.

445
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,579
Aren't you afraid that I wouldn't understand?

446
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,940
The best thing about a win-win situation

447
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,979
is not to let both survive.

448
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:17,499
Instead, it is so that both can share the profit.

449
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:19,260
You can't rush for the profit.

450
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,599
Whoever rushes will die first.

451
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,700
Actually, it's the same as the game between two countries.

452
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,979
Not only are there conflicts, but also peaceful coexistence.

453
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,920
This is the way to maximize the benefit.

454
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,399
Master Qin, you have been playing Go all your life.

455
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:40,420
If you can't even understand this, you've wasted all those years.

456
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,959
This is co-existence and win-win. Benefit other people as well as oneself.

457
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,340
I hope the peace that we've won over could last longer.

458
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:56,939
I just feel sorry for the Crown Prince.

459
00:36:56,939 --> 00:36:58,940
Yes.

460
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,599
I wonder how he's doing over there.

461
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,439
Give me back! Give it back! Stop!

462
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:12,179
- Slow down. Be careful.
-You wish!

463
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:17,979
How dare you steal my jade pendant! That's a birthday gift from my Father.

464
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,538
Stop dreaming. You're not one of us.

465
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,380
No one will celebrate your birthday.

466
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,159
That's right! You don't even have a father.

467
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,580
Don't you ever try to steal our father!

468
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,139
Greetings to Father.

469
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:30,739
As you were.

470
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,958
Let's go. Let's go there for fun.

471
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,439
What's going on?

472
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:40,928
They threw away my jade pendant, and they said I don't even have a father.

473
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:44,399
It's okay. I'll reward you with another one.

474
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:46,699
They also said I'm not one of them.

475
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:50,059
Why hasn't my father come to take me back? I want to go home.

476
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,419
Your father won't come.

477
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:55,019
From now on, this will be your home.

478
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:58,339
I'm your father.

479
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,360
Call me father.

480
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,980
Father.

481
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,060
Go have fun.

482
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,780
To think about it, the Crown Prince has been here for more than a year.

483
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,900
He may have forgotten where he's from.

484
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,759
During the past year, we have gained huge profits from the six provinces near Qingyun.

485
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:37,800
Our national power has strengthened greatly.

486
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:43,499
So now we can carry out the plan.

487
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,450
In less than a year,

488
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,260
the Wu Dynasty will be destroyed.

489
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,580
[In less than a year, the Wu Dynasty will be destroyed]

490

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,140
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

504
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,800
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

505
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,470
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

506
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,040
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

507
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,430
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

508
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,100
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

509
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,950
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

510
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:38,830
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

511
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,930
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

512
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,260
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

513
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,260
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

514
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,650
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

515
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,670
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

516
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,090
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

517

♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

518
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,410
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

519
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,420
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫
