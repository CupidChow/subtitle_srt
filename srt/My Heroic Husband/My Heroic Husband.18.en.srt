[My Heroic Husband]

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,900
If we can successfully occupy the South Gate,

4
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,400
then, the four crossings of

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,800
the two main roads of West Street and East Street

6
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,900
will become our highest priority.

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Hurry and run! Run away!

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Bandits are here!

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Four crossings...

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Here.

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,500
- Here.
- Here.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And here.

13
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Liu Xigua, you were slow this time.

14
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I clearly came here first.

15
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,500
Then let's see who is quicker this time.

16
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Our final branch will then be

17
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
located in front of the local government of Lin'an City.

18
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,300
What's wrong?
[Local Goverment]

19
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,000
My Lord, we are in big trouble.

20
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,900
A group of bandits suddenly broke into the North Gate.

21
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,200
Once entered, they have been pillaging, burning, and killing.

22
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
They are now going to attack us, the prefectural magistrate's local government.

23
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Hurry and go inform Wude Camp to hold out against the attack

24
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,600
and at the same time that they must protect the powder magazine!

25
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,900
Yes.

26
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
- Kill!
- Kill!

27
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,200
Kill them!

28
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,100
Hurry and kill!

29
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,890
Kill them!

30
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,800
It's just a matter of time

31
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
before we will capture the market of Lin'an.

32
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,500
- Come on!
- Come!

33
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,400
Brother Ning, Brother Ning.

34
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,500
Cheers! Cheers!

35
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,700
Brother Ning, as one of the founding members of the newly established Zhu Ji,

36
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,200
I am quite knowledgable

37
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,900
regarding managing and opening shops.

38
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,000
If you hand over Lin'an's Zhu Ji shop to me,

39
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will definitely make it a vivid and dazzling place!

40
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
- Brother Li, that's a bad idea.
- Where is it bad?

41
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,800
As one of the founding members, I, Feng, am also a founder!

42
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
- The way I, Gao Qiu, do business…
- All right. That's enough!

43
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
All of them are impulsive.

44
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Brother Ning, even the dinner of the royal family was started from scratch.

45
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,800
- You're the hothead!
- You're the hothead!

46
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,700
My brothers!

47
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,600
As for the manager of Lin'an's Zhu Ji division,

48
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I've already thought of the best candidate.

49
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on. Let's hear about Brother Ning's plan.

50
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,100
Come on. Let's hear about Brother Ning's plan.

51
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,000
He is the one who traveled around the world alone with a horse holding a sword,

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,600
living a satisfying, avenging a life of knives covered with blood,

53
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,300
Geng Zhi, Guard Geng.

54
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,500
You're teasing me, Young Master.

55
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,200
How could Zhu Ji be left in my hands?

56
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,100
Come on.

57
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,800
Brother Ning was joking.

58
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Old Geng,

59
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
when have I ever lied to you?

60
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,200
When have I promised anything that I didn't keep?

61
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,300
Remember one thing!

62
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
If you follow me,

63
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,300
you will have a good life. What you want is what you will get.

64
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm now fulfilling my promise.

65
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Do you have a complaint about it?

66
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
No...

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
Young Master, I…

68
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,600
Old Geng, I read the novel you wrote.

69
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Although it's quite short having only three pages,

70
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
do you know what I saw from it?

71
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,000
An extraordinary talented writing genius!

72
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
But, if you stay in Su Family

73
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
and work as a guard for the rest of your life,

74
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
the novel will have a poor finish.

75
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Without rich experiences or challenges of society,

76
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
how could you finish the novel?

77
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
You wouldn't be able to even write your story any further.

78
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,800
So, I specially assigned you to Lin'an to be a manager.

79
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The people you will meet and send off every day

80
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
will help enrich your experiences.

81
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,700
I trust you.

82
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,600
I am waiting to see how the story progresses.

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
What do you think?

84
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Is there anyone who objects to Old Geng's being the manager?

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,700
No objection. I support him!

86
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll listen to Brother Ning's arrangement.

87
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
- I'll listen to you.
- Come on.

88
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Come.

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Young Master, I didn't expect you would be so concerned about me.

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,700
I-I'm clumsy of speech and can't say fine words.

91
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,600
That's enough.

92
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Old Geng, you're not young anymore.

93
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
You should consider yourself more.

94
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,700
Go and marry the person in your heart.

95
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,100
Young Master, a toast to you!

96
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Wait!

97
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,100
I will drink this all up!

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If you want to drink the whole kettle of liquor, then we shall do it together.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Come drink with us!

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,529
- Chan'er, Chan'er
- Come on, let's drink together.

101
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,789
Keep your voices down!

102
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
My Lady is sleeping. So noisy…

103
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,400
So what if she's sleeping?

104
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,500
Wake her up if she's sleeping!

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,600
Brother Ning is really special!

106
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,500
- For Zhu Ji!
- For Zhu Ji!

107
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,600
- For Lin'an!
- For Lin'an!

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,900
Lower your voice!

109
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

110
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Bottoms up.

111
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Everyone keep your voice down! Voice down!

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,300
Minister, you must be in a good mood tonight that you even have time

113
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,200
to invite me to appreciate the moon and stars in this yard.

114
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,300
It's already late.

115
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,600
Minister, don't you want to have a rest now?

116
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,000
It's such a beautiful night sky that I have a hard time falling asleep.

117
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Sorry, sorry!

118
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Why is he sleeping on the road in broad daylight?

119
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Did you two drink together?

120
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Can't you drink less?

121
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You will feel awful waking up drunk in the morning.

122
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,600
What are you... are you mad?

123
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
Not looking where you're walking because of the early morning?

124
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Manager,

125
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,600
what are you selling?

126
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,200
Let me see.

127
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
These big steamed buns look good!

128
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,300
I want a few.

129
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Are you going to do your business?

130
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Sleeping in the early morning?

131
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,300
I will take them myself then.

132
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't run!

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
Stop! Stop there!

134
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,500
Don't run!

135
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,310
- Give it back!
- Let go!

136
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,900
Give it back!

137
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Give it back!

138
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Give it back!

139
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Give it back!

140
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
Was she heading here just now?

141
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
She was going right here.

142
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Where is she?

143
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Forget it. Let's go.

144
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Let's go.

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,500
- Don't kill me.
- Shut up!

146
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Don't run!

147
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
- Stop running!
- Don't kill me!

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Who is it?

149
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,500
Master Ning, it's me.

150
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Lady Lou?

151
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Why are you here?

152
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
Sister Shuwan, why are you here?

153
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,400
Bandits are hunting down merchants in the city.

154
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,600
Your identities are sensitive.

155
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,500
I was worried that you can't go out to find food,

156
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,300
so, I took these from my home to give to you.

157
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,000
Sister, the city is in turmoil.

158
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,700
What if you had run into danger?

159
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,800
It won't.

160
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
The place you live is only 500 meters from my home.

161
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,700
I grew up in this area.

162
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,800
It would be harder to catch me in the narrow alleys than to climb to the skies.

163
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Hurry! Let everyone come and eat something.

164
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
Xiao Chan.

165
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,700
You'll need to go into hiding for now.

166
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Young Master Ning,

167
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
I heard that these bandits are extremely heinous.

168
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,500
On my way here, I saw them pillaging, looting and searching for rich merchants everywhere.

169
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,400
Even though Wude Camp spared no effort in resisting, it had little effect.

170
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't think they can withstand for much longer.

171
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
So, you must not go out.

172
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,400
What you are saying is

173
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,000
Lin'an has most likely fallen into enemy hands.

174
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Lady Lou, do you know if there's any way to get out of the city?

175
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
All four city gates have been seized by the bandits.

176
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
There's no way of leaving the city.

177
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Boss, I just saw them!

178
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
They are in the courtyard!

179
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Break the door and go search inside!

180
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
If you catch and give them to Commander Bao,

181
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
- you'll be heavily rewarded!
- Yes.

182
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,600
General Yuan!

183
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,300
My boy Ning. Why are you here?

184
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,400
Come inside to talk!

185
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,900
General Yuan, how's the situation in Lin'an?

186
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,400
The number of bandits are numerous.

187
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
Capturing the city will only take at most a day's time.

188
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,700
These bandits support Fang Tianlei, who is terrorizing the southwest.

189
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,200
They are extremely troublesome.

190
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,000
To tell you the truth, we've received an order

191
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
to turn from the offensive to the defensive.

192
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Defend Lin'an City to the greatest extent and evacuate the refugees.

193
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,200
General Yuan, you are saying evacuation is still possible?

194
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
There is a wharf not far from the north of the city,

195
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
where a boat will be to provide rescue.

196
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
You can leave through the narrow gate west of the city.

197
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,100
Wude Camp will protect everyone's safety

198
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,800
in escorting the common people.

199
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Hurry and go pack!

200
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Thanks, General Yuan.

201
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,300
Hurry!

202
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,200
Pack up all the valuables!

203
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's get ready for the evacuation.

204
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay.

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Thanks, General Yuan.

206
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, General Yuan.

207
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay.

208
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
We can finally go home.

209
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,400
My hands are getting itchy these days

210
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,700
since I haven't been giving my wife a foot massage.

211
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Useless!

212
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,200
A massage on the shoulders and back is the most comfortable.

213
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
All right.

214
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Hurry and go pack your luggage!

215
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Hurry!

216
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
Then, I'll go back now, too.

217
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Sister Shuwan, leave with us.

218
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,600
No, thanks.

219
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
My brother and father are still at home.

220
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
How about this?

221
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,100
You leave with General Yuan first.

222
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,800
I will meet you at the wharf after I pick up my family.

223
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Be careful on the way.

224
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
- We will wait for you at the wharf.
- Don't worry.

225
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,300
General Yuan, I will trouble you to escort Lady Lou home.

226
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,000
- Okay. I'll accompany you.
- Thank you.

227
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,100
Tan'er, we should also pack up.

228
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Move!

229
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
Hurry up! Walk!

230
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
Hurry up!

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,700
Hurry up!

232
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
Liu… Commander Liu.

233
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I can let it be that you don't recognize my sword,

234
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
but you don't even recognize me now?

235
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,500
I have committed a great offense.

236
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,200
I ask Commander Liu to forgive my sin!

237
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
I won't intervene with you robbing things,

238
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
but why are you taking people?

239
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We're only acting under orders.

240
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
You also know

241
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,000
that Commender Bao likes this.

242
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,600
- Let them go.
- Okay.

243
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
You guys, hurry and set them free!

244
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,100
Hurry!

245
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Where is Bao Wenhan? I want to see him.

246
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes! Yes!

247
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,300
[Lin'an Xuanwei Camp]

248
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,700
Drink!

249
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,400
Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

250
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Open your mouth!

251
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,900
Not bad!

252
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
Drink some more!

253
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,900
- Drink this cup!
- Open your mouth!

254
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,800
Drink!

255
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
A sip!

256
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Drink it!
[Bao Wenhan]

257
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Drink this cup!

258
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Not satisfying enough, right?

259
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Open your mouth.

260
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
Get up!

261
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Get up and dance for us!

262
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Continue dancing!

263
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,200
Pillaging and looting as soon as you entered the city.

264
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Who told you to do this?

265
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,700
It was Commander Bao.

266
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,200
But I'm the one in charge of public security.

267
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Get out.

268
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
Uncle.

269
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,300
Be quiet! Don't talk nonsense.

270
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Are you a bad person?

271
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,100
Hero, she's just a kid.

272
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
Please, I'm begging you, don't hurt her!

273
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Please, I'm begging you, don't hurt her!

274
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,500
Please.

275
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Kid, what did you just call me?

276
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,500
Uncle.

277
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
I will teach you this once.

278
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,600
You can call a man like your father uncle.

279
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
But for a man as handsome as me, you should call him brother.

280
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Understand?

281
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,200
Yes.

282
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Good girl.

283
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Lock your door.

284
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,200
Don't go out.

285
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,300
Store more food up.

286
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Okay.

287
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,600
You must protect the safety of your Lady.

288
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,900
Remember. Even if I'm gone, you must protect her well.

289
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,100
Ning, we're ready.

290
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,000
We're running for our lives, not for travel.

291
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
What are you doing with all those bags?

292
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
Drop them.

293
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
There are bandits outside.

294
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Well, do you have any proper weapons with you?

295
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
Yes.

296
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,400
Feng Yuan, I can live with Shen Miao's ladle,

297
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,600
but what the heck are you holding?

298
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
A steamed bun.

299
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,300
It can be used to hit people and fill my stomach as well.

300
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,000
It's quite proper.

301
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
How about I ask Geng to cook some chicken legs for you?

302
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Enough.

303
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,389
Get out.

304
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,200
Come here.

305
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,900
Stop.

306
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,500
I've told you many times that

307
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,100
you should be fond of women.

308
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,800
If you destroy such a pretty face,

309
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,100
it will be a waste of beauty, right?

310
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,800
Take her to the back yard.

311
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,600
Starve her for three days.

312
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,700
No.

313
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,800
Please. Please put me down.

314
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,200
Put me down.

315
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,700
Hunger is the best cure.

316
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,400
People can agree to any requirements just for food.

317
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Those who never suffer from hunger can never understand.

318
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
- Right?
- Yes!

319
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Do you want to try it, too?

320
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
No.

321
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
Then, keep dancing!

322
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Come on.

323
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,600
That's quite an entrance.

324
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
Here comes Commander Liu.

325
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,400
Commander Bao is in such a great mood

326
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,200
that you are even watching the opera.

327
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,700
Tell me,

328
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,400
why are you pillaging all the girls on the streets?

329
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,900
Do you want to give each of your people in Xuanwei Camp a wife?

330
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,300
Let me tell you,

331
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,100
I opened the gate to let you in, not to loot and plunder.

332
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,800
Lin'an is our base camp.

333
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,000
Now that you took away their money and daughters

334
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
and they are boiling with resentment,

335
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
how are we supposed to keep a foothold?

336
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,200
You can't blame me for this.

337
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
We agreed on it.

338
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Your Badao Camp will take charge of public security.

339
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,300
Our Xuanwei Camp will collect the money and valuables.

340
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,200
We are not responsible for the mess on the streets.

341
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,600
Okay.

342
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,000
Then I will teach anyone who creates the mess a lesson.

343
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Liu Xigua,

344
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
you can't run wild here

345
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
just because you're the adopted daughter of Holy Master.

346
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm telling you,

347
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
my actions were all ordered by the Holy Master.

348
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,100
He will arrive here tonight.

349
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Ask him to punish me, if you can.

350
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Use the time wisely.

351
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,500
Tan'er, the situation is urgent.

352
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,900
You take the knife in case you need it.

353
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
I don't know how to use it.

354
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,200
If it falls into the enemy's hands, they may use this against me.

355
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
You keep it.

356
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
I'll take a look at the yard.

357
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Ning, why do you have this knife?

358
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,600
A friend of mine gave it to me when I left Jiangning.

359
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,100
May I know if his family name is Qin?

360
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,300
Yes, it is.

361
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,600
We are so close, but he just gave me this little knife.

362
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,600
Greetings from Yuan Dingqi, Captain of the Secret Investigation Department of Lin'an City,

363
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
Commander Ning.

364
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,000
General Yuan, get up please.

365
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,900
What… What does this mean?

366
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,800
What department?

367
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,600
This knife is from the Right Chancellor Qin Siyuan.

368
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,000
It also stands for Commander in Chief of the Secret Investigation Department.

369
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,600
All the people in this department swore to this knife

370
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
that they would protect Wu Dynasty's safety.

371
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Ning, if Right Chancellor Qin really gave this to you,

372
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,100
it means you're the hope of the Secret Investigation Department.

373
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,500
Now, Lin'an City is on the verge of destruction.

374
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
We are in a state of disunity.

375
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,400
I beg you to stay and lead us to take back Lin'an altogether!

376
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,500
General Yuan, I can't. I really can't.

377
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm just a matrilocal husband.

378
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,800
Ning!

379
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,900
The Secret Investigation Department… I…

380
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Oh no.

381
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Get out of the way.

382
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,300
It's Chen Damu.

383
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,200
That seems to be Taiping alley.

384
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
That b*stard!

385
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,600
Let's go.

386
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,900
Chen Damu is dead now?

387
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,300
Interesting.

388
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Goodbye, brother.

389
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,800
Withdraw!

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,300
[Chen Damu]

391
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,000
[Xuanwei Barracks]

392
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,500
What's wrong, General?

393
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
This is the Right Commander of those bandits.

394
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
The vice general of Bao Wenhan.

395
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,100
He just released a signal.

396
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,200
I guess all the bandits in the city are heading towards us.

397
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
There are many citizens in Tailing Alley.

398
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,200
If there's a fight, casualties will be inevitable.

399
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,600
Tell all the citizens nearby to go to the wharf right away.

400
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

401
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,400
General, if you are going to withstand the bandits in the whole city

402
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
with so few of you, isn't it suicide?

403
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
The longer we can hold them back for,

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,700
the more of our citizens will survive.

405
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,300
Don't worry about us, Ning.

406
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
I'll have your family and you escorted.

407
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,300
Time to leave.

408
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
General,

409
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,600
did you just kill them with gunpowder?

410
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,300
- Yes.
- Do you have more?

411
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,200
The main weapons have been taken.

412
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,700
I only have some left on the carriage.

413
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
Wait for me.

414
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,800
What's wrong?

415
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,900
You go to the wharf first.

416
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,500
I'll meet you in a minute.

417
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,400
Are you going to stay to stop the bandits?

418
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,700
If you stay, I won't leave, either.

419
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
If we fail to keep this place,

420
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
every one of you won't be able to escape.

421
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You go there first.

422
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
I will catch up.

423
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
No, it's too dangerous.

424
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
- Geng.
- Yes.

425
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,200
- Take your Lady away.
- Yes.

426
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
How dare you!

427
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
My Lady, let's go!

428
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Ning Liheng!

429
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,900
My Lady, let's go!

430
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Attention, Wude Camp!

431
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,600
Gather all of our people here.

432
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Let's fight the bandits!

433
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
Yes.

434
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm warning you b*stards with your empty words.

435
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
Now we should carry out the north expedition while Jing is still weak.

436
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
If not now, when?

437
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,600
You have no idea about state affairs.

438
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Stop all this nonsense.

439
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Jing just destroyed Liang. Its army is powerful right now!

440
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,300
If we go against them rashly,

441
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,600
we will burn ourselves and have our people in danger!

442
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Now that the bandits in Lin'an haven't been wiped out,

443
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300
yet they are pillaging and looting, waiting to expand their strength.

444
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
If we are between a hammer and anvil,

445
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Wu will be put in great danger!

446
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
You're talking nonsense!

447
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
The Secret Investigation Department has received a message that

448
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Jing has lost half of their elite force.

449
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
They can't be powerful right now.

450
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,700
You must have taken their bribes.

451
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,800
Your Majesty,

452
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,100
the courtiers have been waiting for a long time.

453
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,800
I wonder when you will be available for discussion.

454
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,400
No hurry.

455
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
Allow me to think about it.

456
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,800
I wonder if you are hesitated about the…

457
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,300
I have issued a decree to attack Jing.

458
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,800
Now, the whole world knows.

459
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
If I suddenly go back on my word,

460
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,200
the world will mock me.

461
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,500
But now

462
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,800
Lin'an is being occupied by some bandits.

463
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,100
Lin'an is our Wu Dynasty's military stronghold

464
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
and also a granary for the country.

465
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,600
If there is a mishap that occurs,

466
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,800
let alone the north invasion on Jing,

467
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,600
there would be effects on having a full meal.

468
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,200
The war in Lin'an is not over.

469
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,800
I dare not rashly send out troops to the northern invasion.

470
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,700
I ask Your Majesty to rest assured.

471
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,700
Lin'an is full of elite soldiers from the Secret Investigation Department.

472
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,600
At the same time, Wude Camp is supresssing the bandits.

473
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,000
Within the next few days, the situation can be stabilized.

474
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,100
It will in no way affect our plan to invade the north.

475
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,000
In addition, I have a surefire plan.

476
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
What is it?

477
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Jing has just merged with Liang.

478
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Its strength is greatly damaged at this time.

479
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,200
I suggest Dong Daofu lead the main army to go north.

480
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
At the same time, two small generals will be sent to lead the forbidden army to the south

481
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,000
to cooperate with our troops in Lin'an City.

482
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,600
In less than a month, we can get rid of the bandits.

483
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Then all the gunpowder and firearms will be taken up north

484
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,500
to join General Dong.

485
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,600
Jing will definitely be defeated.

486
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,600
You're very thoughtful.

487
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,300
You are deserving of the trust the late Emperor placed on you.

488
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,300
It's just that court is dismissed today.

489
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
No state affairs shall be discussed.

490
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Your Majesty!

491
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You may leave now.

492
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,000
Minister.

493
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,200
- Minister, today the Emperor...
- I know.

494
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Today there was no court for discussion.

495
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Of course, everything that happens in court doesn't escape your discerning eyes.

496
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,100
Hearing about the attack in Lin'an,

497
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,200
the Minister of Personnel and Minister of Defense came out all a sudden

498
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,700
and opposed the north expedition.

499
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,800
Tong Ke and Li Gang even

500
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,200
had a fight outside the Imperial Study.

501
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,800
It was quite a sight!

502
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,600
You just want to watch them fight!

503
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,000
But do you know Qin Siyuan talked to His Majesty

504
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
privately for two hours in the Imperial Study?

505
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,789
He did go to meet the Emperor.

506
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,000
But I heard from Eunuch Li that he had a gloomy complexion and knitted brows

507
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,600
when he came out.

508
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,900
The Emperor didn't issue any decree, either.

509
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,800
That means the Emperor hasn't made up his mind as well.

510
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I ask Minister to not be worried.

511
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,000
One needs to prepare beforehand

512
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,900
and not be making last-minute efforts after it occurs.

513
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,400
If I were as careless as you,

514
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,000
I reckon I would have already lost my position and had my property confiscated by Qin Siyuan.

515
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,600
Minister is correct in teaching me.

516
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Send someone to buy a sweet red bean cake

517
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,500
at Huaxiang Restaurant in the east of the city.

518
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,000
Use the biggest tapestry box to package it.

519
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
It's hot today.

520
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Add some ice to it.

521
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Don't let it melt.

522
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
Yes, Minister.

523
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
Go ahead.

524
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,200
Are there only these few boxes?

525
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,800
There is a large number of bandits, so these are being depleted quickly.

526
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
These four boxes are all we have.

527
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,900
Just with these four boxes is far from enough.

528
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
Unless…

529
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
Catch them!

530
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Brother Li, stop trembling or else they will find us!

531
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm not trembling. Shen Miao is!

532
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm not! It's your heart that is trembling.

533
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,100
You're trembling too much!

534
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
I… I…

535
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,400
Everyone, come! It's safe now. Let's go.

536
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
My Lady, let's go.

537
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,100
Hurry and hide!

538
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,800
- Hide!
- Let's go!

539
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,500
Catch them!

540
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,500
Hey! You!

541
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,700
If you have the skill, come and fight me!

542
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
Arrogant!

543
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Let's meet at the wharf. Hurry and run!

544
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
My Lady, they...

545
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We should hurry and go.

546
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,700
Let's go.

547
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,300
Stop!

548
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,400
Young fellow, is my vice general, Chen Damu, in your hands?

549
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,400
Do any of you have any manners?

550
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,700
I'm eating noodles right now!

551
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,100
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

552
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,900
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

553
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,600
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

554
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,200
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

555
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,600
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

556
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,200
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

557
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,100
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

558
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:12,000
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

559
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

560
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

561
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

562
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,700
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

563
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

564
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,200
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

565
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

566
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,400
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

567
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

568
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

569
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

570
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,200
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

571
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

572
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

573
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,600
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

574
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:15,300
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
