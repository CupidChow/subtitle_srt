[Episode 24]

3
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,800
Old man, if we change this into a curved handle,

4
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
won't it be easier to hold?

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,800
You're way more proficient in

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,600
making better weapons than I am.

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Look at you, you know how to talk.

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
At the begining you were messing with me.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Holy Master,

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have one more piece of weapon that I'd like to show you.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
One more?

12
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,100
Let me see.

13
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
This way, Holy Master.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,600
Brother, be careful of this.

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
Why don't you open it?

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
What do you mean?

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,400
I've spent all my life making weapons.

18
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
I didn't understand till this moment that

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,800
the most powerful weapon in Wu Dynasty

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
is people!

21
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,500
Kill them!

22
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,500
Zheng Biao, protect Xian Ying!

23
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,970
- Take her down!
- Yes.

24
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,200
Go chase her!

25
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Yes!

26
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
Stop!

27
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

28
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
I have nothing to do with this.

29
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Shut up!

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Do you see that?

31
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,400
You will not eat, drink or sleep next few days.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,300
And you will fix all these blown-up blunderbuss for me!

33
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,800
As I said, one thousand blunderbuss.

34
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Otherwise, I'll kill a man for every blunderbuss short.

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Let's go, my dear.

36

[Lin'an Suburb]

37
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,300
Father, we've been walking for so many days,

38
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,700
but not a soul has been seen.

39
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,700
That's where the wheel marks go.

40
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,800
Hold on a little longer.

41
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Trust me. I won't put you in trouble.

42
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Father, I can't walk anymore.

43
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,500
I... I'm starving to death.

44
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Just hang on a moment.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,900
Hang on.

46
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
We're about to find something to eat.

47
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,300
There's food here.

48
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Father, I think we should stop looking.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's get back to Jiangning.

50
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
We can't.

51
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,800
We're broke now.

52
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
They stole our carriage, too.

53
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,300
We won't be able to get back to Jiangning.

54
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,100
If we keep going, I will die from hunger soon.

55
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
We won't be able to go back now, but Lin'an is so close.

56
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
I think they were heading towards Lin'an.

57
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
Lin'an is full of bandits.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Father, are you crazy?

59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Bandits or starvation,

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
which do you choose?

61
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,700
Bandits.

62
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,400
Then start moving.

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,600
We won't get in if it's too late.

64
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
Father.

65
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
My stomach hurts.

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Now that you mention it, I think mine hurts, too.

67
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Come on!

68
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,500
Oh, no! Father!

69
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,300
Don't aim your butt at me!

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,100
- Father, a snake!
- Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

71
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,600
Did it bite you?

72
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Where did it bite you?

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,700
My left butt.

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Snakes are poisonous.

75
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,900
Here, it's wrapped up.

76
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
- Come again.
- Okay.

77
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Here you are.

78
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Father.

79
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Is your way going to work?

80
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,700
Do you know why I want you to force her to comply?

81
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,400
I don't.

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,400
She's closer to me than you.

83
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
You pushed her first.

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Then I acted like a good guy

85
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
so she wouldn't be suspicious.

86
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,800
I've cleared this with the people of Xuanwei camp.

87
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
They'll come and catch us soon.

88
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
At that time, in order to save us,

89
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,000
she'll be willing to go to Xuanwei Camp.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Otherwise, Shu Wan has a strong personality.

91
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
If we're too tough on her,

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and she commits suicide in a river,

93
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
it will do more harm than good.

94
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,000
Father, you are so clever.

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
If it hadn't been for her birth, your mother wouldn't have been severely ill.

96
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,200
She could've lived longer.

97
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,000
These years, I kept her in the family

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
only because she's good at business

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and she can make us money.

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If not, she would've been kicked out ages ago.

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,090
Now the chaos in Lin'an

102
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,800
is not going to stop for a while.

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,200
If we send her to Leader Bao,

104
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,100
not only can we save our lives,

105
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,800
we can also get some money, too.

106
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Then I can also stop pretending to be a loving father.

107
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Counselor.

108
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
That...

109
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,129
Counselor, send this out.

110
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,369
- This...
- Counselor.

111
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:17,049
Commander Chen, what are you doing? I'm working right now.

112
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,710
Well.

113
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,130
Counselor, the medicine you gave me last time...

114
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,708
What's wrong?

115
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,688
Nothing. I take it every day under your instruction

116
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:27,929
and I eat and sleep well.

117
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,250
Every day, I can sleep more than ten hours.

118
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,129
To tell you the truth, If you didn't give me this medicine,

119
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,870
I would've really thought someone drugged me with knockout drug.

120
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,929
This medicine looks the same as the knockout drug.

121
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,970
They're extremely similar.

122
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,488
You're joking. How can they be knockout drug?

123
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,989
Isn't that good? What's the problem with it?

124
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,310
It is very good.

125
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,790
But... I almost finished those you prescribed for me.

126
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,849
Since I need to take it a full month to avoid the doomed romance,

127
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:59,300
I'd like to ask for some more from you.

128
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,560
Why didn't you say that earlier?

129
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,460
- You want that medicine, right?
-Yes.

130
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,468
I don't have it on me now. I'll go back and get it for you.

131
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,329
- Let's go back together.
- No, no!

132
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,049
Why don't you stay and distribute the food?

133
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,529
- You guys follow Leader Chen's order.
- Understood.

134
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,429
Thank you, Counselor.

135
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,369
Lady Lou!

136
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,010
Lady Lou! What are you doing?

137
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,209
Lady Lou, why did you commit suicide?

138
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,510
Did someone hurt you?

139
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,809
It must be.

140
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,650
The one who deserves to die should be the one who hurt you.

141
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,169
Why did you punish yourself for other people's mistake?

142
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,470
Listen.

143
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,649
Death

144
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,790
is a kind of escape.

145
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,589
You just want to escape, but it can bring nothing but regrets.

146
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,729
Why would I have any regrets?

147
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:31,309
Don't pretend that you don't care about anything.

148
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,828
Since the day I entered Lou's Cloth Store,

149
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:37,608
I have noticed your creative ideas and innovative marketing strategies.

150
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:41,169
I knew that you are a person who loves life and loves your work.

151
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,349
You're not those who will commit suicide randomly.

152
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,450
There's nothing worth

153
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,729
feeling reluctant before death.

154
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,269
How come?

155
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:54,628
How about Tan'er? Isn't she worth feeling reluctant?

156
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,029
And me! And all your friends.

157
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,350
No one wants to see you die.

158
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,488
If you die like this, your store will be a flash in the pan.

159
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:06,549
If you die like this, those who hurt you will never get the punishment they deserve.

160
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:11,149
If you die like this, you'll never know what kind of person you're going to become.

161
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,550
What kind of person can I be?

162
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,390
Life is tough indeed.

163
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,850
But it's even more difficult to know how to live.

164
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,289
But it's the difficulties

165
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:27,989
that make our life even more meaningful.

Okay.

Like what I said, come to me if you have any problems.

I'm in Badao Camp.

- Thank you.
- I'm leaving.

Have you searched carefully?

176
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,489
The front and the back alleys. I've also searched all the places she often visits.

177

Oh no!

Don't worry, Father.

The people in the east city can just get by.

But in the west, there are too many poor households.

Why are you still worried about food?

It's all because of Bao Wen Han.

Why did you ask me to prescribe this for you?

Take it easy. Hear me out.

302
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,909
Yes, when your love shows up, we can't stop or change it.

I don't follow.

305
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:40,010
Think about it. You're getting up later and later now?

306
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,848
You used to get up even before the sun rises.

307
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,869
Do you often sleep till noon now, sometimes even afternoon?

308
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:48,270
Yeah.

309
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,290
Sometimes...

310
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,268
Sometimes I can sleep until another day's night.

311
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:53,189
That's right.

312
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:56,209
This means the medicine works.

313
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:59,009
Think about it. You used to get up in the morning.

314
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,988
If you keep doing that, as soon as you get out of the camp,

315
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:03,829
it's very likely that you'll meet your destined love.

316
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:05,228
But when you take the knockout drug,

317
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:08,429
you can't get up at noon, afternoon, or even at night.

318
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:10,209
So you won't get out of Badao Camp.

319
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,829
There is no chance for you to meet your destined love.

320

Every living thing in this world has its enemy.

324
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,328
The cause and the result are transformable.

325
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,468
The reason why I didn't tell you it was a knockout drug is that

326
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:29,068
I was afraid you would be against it.

327
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:32,189
You might think since this is a knockout drug, you'll take less today.

328
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:34,530
And if you take less, you'll get up in the morning.

329
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,349
You'll meet the girl from the noble family when you go out.

330
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:38,049
Soon you'll marry her.

331
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:39,408
Look at you!

332
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,589
I've been so considerate!

333
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,028
How dare you question me?

334
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:43,109
Okay, fine.

335
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,608
Don't take the knockout drug.

336
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,389
I wish you would marry a fair lady from a noble family

337
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:49,149
and live happily ever after.

338
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,828
Remember to invite me to your wedding. Okay?

339
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:51,909
No, no, no!

340
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,468
Counselor, give me the medicine.

341
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,189
I... I...

342
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:58,210
What do you want to say?

343
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,268
I was wrong.

344
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,029
I shouldn't suspect you.

345
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,328
I'll help you move the grain.

346
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,408
You should've helped me earlier.

347
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:05,049
Come on, come on, come on.

348
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,950
What is inside this?

349
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,788
- So heavy!
- Grain.

350
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,409
- Grain?
- Yes.

351
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,009
Didn't you say you had nothing left?

352
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,969
Come on.

353
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,769
Where did you get these?

354
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,589
Don't mind where I got them.

355
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,109
You're not supposed to know it.

356
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,610
It's not going to be fun if you keep asking.

357
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,349
That's my Counselor.

358
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,750
Clever!

359
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,349
Let's distribute them now.

360
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,068
Not today.

361
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:32,229
Let's try something new.

362
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,650
Do you see all this?

363
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,830
Keep your eyes open.

364
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,510
If they dare to distribute the grain, go tell on them to Holy Master.

365
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,410
See what they'll say about this.

366
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,389
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

367
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:01,990
We...

368
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,669
are selling grain!

369
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,068
Don't miss the chance.

370
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:10,809
You can have a nice meal tonight.

371
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,690
Nothing compares to a full belly.

372
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,090
You can have a look even if you're full.

373
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,070
I'll buy it. I'll buy it!

374
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,509
Come on, come on!

375
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,749
I'll buy it. I'll buy it!

376
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,090
Counselor,

377
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,529
what are you doing now?

378
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,149
We gave them food for free before.

379
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,308
Now you even raised the food price to sell them.

380
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:32,829
How are we any different from Bao Wen Han?

381
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,910
Of course there is a difference.

382
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,429
We sell it at a cheaper price.

383
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,669
15 taels?

384
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,168
How dare they sell grain to make money like us?

385
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:45,949
Calm down. One by one.

386
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,790
This is the money we should've made.

387
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,589
- Here you are. Take it.
- Let's go.

388
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,670
We'll report to Leader Bao.

389
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,089
Here's all the money from the past few days.

390
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,950
We didn't even sell one bag of grain.

391
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,849
Why are there scores of liters missing?

392
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,129
It's only been ten days.

393
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:18,610
The camp has already eaten thousands of kilograms of food.

394
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,689
You've seen it, too.

395
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:22,988
No one is coming here.

396
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:24,750
If...

397
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,268
If you don't eat it, it will go bad.

398
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,509
You should be stuffed!

399
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,789
From tomorrow, no one is allowed to eat.

400
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,429
Leader Bao, bad news.

401
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:41,550
Badao Camp is selling grain in public.

402
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,589
What?

403
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,749
- They're selling grain too?
- Yes, it's really true.

404
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:46,729
Many refugees have gathered at their gate.

405
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,710
They are lining up to buy grain.

406
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,229
Lining up to buy?

407
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,050
How much does he sell it for?

408
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,060
15 taels of silver each peck.

409
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,140
For God's sake!

410
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,589
Wang Jin,

411
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,149
change the price!

412
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,370
Let's sell it at 12 taels.

413
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,709
Okay.

414
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,220
[Grain sells: 10 taels each peck]

415
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,268
I heard there's a price reduction there.

416
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,748
Then we'll reduce the price, too.

417
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:29,669
10 taels each peck of grain!

418
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:31,830
10 taels each peck!

419
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,629
Come on! Come on, come on.

420
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:35,149
Line up. Line up.

421
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,788
Come on, come on.

422
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,909
12 taels each peck. I want it!

423
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,050
12 taels each peck! Come on!

424
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,510
What?

425
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,229
10 taels?

426
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,909
Let's reduce the price, too. 8 taels!

427
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,748
8 taels!

428
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,090
Our price is 8 taels!

429
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,510
Hey! 8 taels!

430
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,589
Line up. Don't rush.

431
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,869
5 taels each peck.

432
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,850
Take it back with you!

433
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,289
5 taels each!

434
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,489
Line up, line up, line up!

435
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,390
Take it easy, easy!

436
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,129
4 taels! Come on!

437
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,928
4 taels each peck! 4 taels!

438
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:10,829
Come on, come on, come on.

439
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:12,269
You came at the right time!

440
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,648
3 taels, there you go!

441
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,830
3 taels each peck!

442
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,809
Come on, come on!

443
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,350
Line up. Line up.

444
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,370
- Line up
- Come on, come on.

445
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,070
Reduce the price!

446
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,428
1.5 taels.

447
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,228
1.5 taels! Only 1.5 for the fine grain!

448
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,629
1.5 taels!

00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,849
Only 1.5 taels now!

450

00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:34,509
Only 1.5 taels.

452
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,790
Dear my customers, you can get 1 peck of rice with only 500 cash.

453
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,190
Line up. Line up. Line up!

454
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:46,390
You can all take some home!

455
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,848
100 cash!

456
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,150
It's cheap. Cheap.

457
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,089
100 cash!

458
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:55,630
Come on, come on!

00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,909
Buy! Buy it!

460
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,930
It's cheap. It's cheap!

461
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,270
Buy it!

462
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:08,009
It's time to end this war without smoke.

463
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,190
Next, our final big discount

464
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,210
will be announced by Leader Chen.

465
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,130
Listen, you all!

466
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,269
Today, Badao Camp is giving a big discount.

467
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:23,369
A cash per peck!

468
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,689
Leader, it can't go any lower.

469
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,510
Their price is 1 cash per peck.

470
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,130
What?

471
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,389
They've gone too far.

472
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,069
Buddies, let's go.

473
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,969
Let's go!

474
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:53,660
100 cash!

475
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,190
There he is.

476
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,949
Ning Yi, how dare you!

477
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:16,649
How dare you sell grain in Badao Camp!

478
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,150
Give me all your grain!

479
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,669
Leader Bao,

480
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,710
is it because you have too much grain in Xuanwei Camp?

481
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,909
Don't you have anything else to do?

482
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:32,630
When did you see me selling grain?

483
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,288
My people saw it with their own eyes. You were constantly lowering your price.

484
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,229
At the end, your price was one cash for each peck.

485
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:39,249
Deny it all you want!

486
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,329
Yeah?

487
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,508
Do you have any evidence?

488
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:45,449
The evidence is all around you, boy.

489
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:49,068
All the grain should be kept in my Xuanwei Camp.

490
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,189
Where did you get all your grain?

491
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,569
Come, Leader Bao!

492
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,390
Let me show you.

493
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,949
You said this was grain.

494
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,750
Come on.

495
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,730
Is this grain?

496
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,529
Take a closer look.

497
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,869
These are sawdust and gravel.

498
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,969
Last night, we in Badao Camp transported it from outside the city overnight.

499
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:17,189
We're responsible for reinforcing the city walls.

500
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:20,308
Xuanwei Camp is responsible for the distribution of the grain.

501
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:25,168
No matter how much you want to sell it, it's none of my business.

502
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:28,130
You can't take care of all the business in the world.

503
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,870
Will you even stop a cart shipping the shit and taste it?

504
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,010
Seriously, really?

505
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,950
Leader,

506
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,608
the granary has sold most of the grain. It's very profitable.

507
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:44,189
We've already made a few thousand taels.

508
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,169
Leader Bao, with so much grain, but you
only sold a few thousand taels.

509
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:57,148
Are you a charitarian? Are you doing for charity?

510
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:02,290
That's exactly why I specially embroidered a silk banner for you.

511
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,449
I'm giving it to you on the behalf of the citizens in Lin'an.

512
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,609
Thank you for your contribution.

513
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,610
Leader Bao,

514
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,289
it's you who picked a fight first.

515
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:26,589
If you dare to take one more step,

516
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,050
I'll blow your brains out.

517
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,230
Leader Bao,

518
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,810
right now, are you going to leave by yourself,

519
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,930
or wait for Holy Master to order you to leave?

520
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,470
Ning Yi,

521
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,590
Liu Da Biao,

522
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,230
just wait.

523
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,209
Counselor, you really have my respect.

524
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,968
You only have a few buddies, women, children and the old.

525
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,749
Yet you played tricks with the grain and you managed to fool them all.

526
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,470
Amazing!

527
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,250
Your Ladyship.

528
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,909
What are you thinking of today?

529
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:06,968
Why are you working on the documents yourself?

530
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,588
Thanks to you this time The people of Lin'an won't starve to death.

531
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:13,168
I thought about it. What Chen Fan said makes sense.

532
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:15,289
I can't let you deal with these meaningless trivial matters.

533
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,008
You should do something bigger.

534
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,008
All right. Please bring my gratitude to Brother Fan for me.

535
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:24,390
Also, thank you, Your Ladyship.

536
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,850
Well, since we are content with the results,

537
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,729
I'd like to invite you to a meal.

538
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:36,189
Would you do me the honor?

539
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,450
Invite me to a meal?

540
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,408
It's been tough to collect food recently.

541
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:48,930
This meal is to reward ourselves,

542
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,760
and also to celebrate

543
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,590
that I don't have to deal with documents anymore.

544
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:57,769
I'll think about it.

545
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:59,448
Okay. Take your time.

546
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:02,928
I've booked the restaurant. It's at Tori restaurant.

547
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:07,010
See you tomorrow.

548
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,550
There is a big one there.

549
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,028
One is enough for both of us.

550
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:40,029
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,450
There's another one over there.

552
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,370
A little higher. To the left.

553
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,729
Yeah, yeah. A little higher, a little higher.

554
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:00,730
Good.

555
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,948
It's gone. Argh!

556
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:09,448
Father, I was trying to hit the birds. Yet you talked so much. You scared the birds away.

557
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,649
Did I scare them away?

558
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,869
I said that in such a low voice. How can I scare them away?

559
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,850
What else can you do?

560
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,649
Why are we so unlucky during the whole trip?

561
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:22,471
Father, before you left the house, did you check the almanac?

562
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:27,868
I didn't see it clearly enough since I was in a rush. It can't be reliable.

563
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:30,310
What did it say in the almanac?

564
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,090
The Chamber Star presides.

565
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,150
Fortune favors the North. Come on, let's try to hit some other things down.

566
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,810
Fortune favors the North. We've been heading towards the south.

567
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,508
What's done is done. Hold on a little longer.

568
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:47,209
We are almost in Lin'an. Go, go, go.

569
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:51,628
Let's go get some other animals. Hitting birds is not the thing for us.

570
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,489
A father shouldn't do this to his son.

571
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,600
[Xuanwei Camp]

572
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:17,669
Leader, please.

573
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:18,828
Useless!

574
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:21,429
Who told you to sell all the grain?

575
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,808
Why did you fall for their gimmick? You idiot!

576
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:30,210
W-Why do I have such a stupid follower?

577
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,929
Leader, I-I was really afraid of losing too much,

578
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:35,529
so I tried to sell quickly.

579
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:36,729
Talk back?

580
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,149
Please don't hit me, Leader. Please!

581
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:40,150
Talk back?

582
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,729
Show me your face.

583
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,289
Leader Bao.

584
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,809
Get out! Report to me tomorrow.

585
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:49,230
But you really need to know this now.

586
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,289
Please don't hit me anymore.

587
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:58,929
We found the girl you're looking for.

588
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:31,429
I heard that you're looking for me.

589
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,030
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

590
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,700
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

591
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,370
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

592
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,930
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

593
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:17,270
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

594
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,990
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

595
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,810
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

596
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:31,730
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

597
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,780
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

598
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,140
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

599
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,100
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

600
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,520
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
