[My Heroic Husband]

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,789
- Where is water? Water?
- Ning Yi!

4
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,269
You are filthy! Ning Yi Heng!

5
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,030
- I'm so thirsty.
- You're disgusting!

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,849
- I'm feeling unwell.
- I want to have a sip.

7
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,510
I want to take a sip. Give me some!

8
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,100
- I'm drinking it right now, you–
- I need to drink, too!

9
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,809
Letter of Divorce?

10
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,950
What are you doing?

11
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,409
Ning Yi is temporarily the matrilocal husband in the Su Family.

12
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,889
The marriage shall end

13
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,188
when Su Tan'er gets the Family Representative Seal.

14
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,168
Stop reading.

15
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,768
Su Tan'er will divorce Ning Yi

16
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,409
and two will live separately thereafter.

17
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,830
- Stop reading.
- The world is big.

18
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,608
They should seek what they want

19
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:42,329
and not bother each other anymore.

20
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,049
Ning Yi shall leave Su Manor

21
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,868
the day after she gets the seal.

22
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,549
No delay shall be tolerated.

23
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,369
Are you finished reading?

24
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,588
Why did you read this?

25
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:00,169
Why couldn't I read it since it's already written?

26
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:03,329
I've got the seal.

27
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,409
Will you leave tomorrow?

28
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,970
Well… I will leave then.

29
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,929
In short,

30
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,549
when you get the seal,

31
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,210
I'll have my freedom back.

32
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,210
It's a deal.

33
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,048
To help you is to help myself.

34
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,509
The sooner you get the seal,

35
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,529
the sooner I will become free.

36
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:39,009
So, congratulations in advance.

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,840
You're one step closer to getting the seal.

38
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,449
Did you mean it?

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,980
Did you really think so?

40

♫  Even if there is no fear, why fear right from wrong  ♫

42
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,400
In the box is my personal property.

43
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,929
I have the store, title deed and money.

44
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,309
It's not much but I'll give you half of it.

45
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:27,309
You're free now.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,588
This is the evidence of debt before.

47
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,809
You volunteered to become the matrilocal husband of the Su Family.

48
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,449
All the debt will be written off

49
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,030
when I get the Family Representative Seal.

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,289
If you make any trouble during this time,

51
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,169
I will bring you to justice.

52
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,489
Say,

53
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,800
I was wondering how such a rich and beautiful girl would marry Ning Yi.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
Fine.

55
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
Put it away.

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,540
I'll leave like when I came.

Xiao Chan, where's Young Master?

75
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,289
He went out in the early morning.

76
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,170
To where?

77
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,770
I don't know.

78
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,190
What are these?

79
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,209
Why does he always draw something strange?

80
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,550
Xiao Chan,

81
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,230
don't tell him I came to look for him.

82
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,129
Interesting. It's fun. It's really fun.

83
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,009
What did you say this was called again?

84
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,629
This?

85
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,289
Horse Ball on the Ground.

86
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,089
Go horse ball on the ground.

87
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,308
No, Grandfather.

88
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,268
It's called Horse Ball on the Ground.

89
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,669
Horse Ball on the Ground.

90
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,489
It's a pity.

91
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,428
If I hit the ball far away,

92
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:31,350
I'll have to get a new ball.

93
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,409
It's kind of a waste.

94
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,309
Can I try it again?

95
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,449
Grandfather, here's the thing.

96
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:42,940
When you hit it, you need to use less strength.

97
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,350
For example, you can hit it into that hole.

98
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,009
I did use a lot of strength.

99
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,049
It's okay.

100
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,950
- One more time.
- One more time!

101
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,209
You're still hale and hearty.

102
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:00,790
Okay.

103
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,569
- Nice shot!
- It went in! It did!

104
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,170
It's so fun!

105
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,469
Boss Su,

106
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,368
long time no see.

107
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:26,269
Well, how have you been?

108
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,069
Procuress Yang, I'd like to invite Miss Yuan

109
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,849
to do a performance for the Su Family

110
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,369
at the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting.

111
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,248
Boss Su, I'm terribly sorry.

112
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,149
But Miss Yuan has been booked by Wu's Cloth Store.

113
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,109
The Wu's?

114
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:44,570
But Miss Yuan has performed for us for years.

115
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,629
To tell you the truth,

116
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,569
Boss Wu's paid a high price

117
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,749
to book all these girls.

118
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:55,150
Why did he need so many performers?

119
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,368
Well, that isn't for me to say.

120
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,688
But Boss Wu offered a nice price.

121
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:04,348
We're all businesswomen. I believe you can understand me.

122
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:07,510
I have to feed all the people here after all.

123
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,809
So I'm extremely sorry, Boss Su.

124
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,189
I'm going back to work then.

125
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,388
Master Wang, this way, please.

126
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,249
It's okay. We'll take our time to find another performer.

127
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,890
We can always go to other places.

128
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,489
Yes, Miss.

129
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,290
Let's go.

130
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,108
Mother-in-law, this is a gift I prepared for you.

131
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:41,290
I hope you'll like it.

132
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:45,650
What is this?

133
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,790
It's called a "facial mask."

134
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,650
Steamed bread? (she is interpreting the pronunciation as an edible food instead of a facial mask)

135
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,730
This... This is edible?

136
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,229
No. It's not like that.

137
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:03,610
You apply this mask after you cleanse your face.

138
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,650
It can improve your looks and beauty.

139
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,529
Your beauty will become timeless.

140
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,009
Timeless beauty?

141
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,270
So magical?

142
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,849
Try it.

143
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm sorry. We have signed a contract with the Wu Family.

144
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,010
So, there's no way we can provide any performers for you.

145
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,110
Let's go, Miss.
[Drunkard House]

146
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:56,409
At that day, you didn't accept me.

147
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,769
Nor did I serve you new tea.

148
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,630
I'll serve again today.

149
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,930
Please kindly accept it.

150
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,248
My daughter could cut fabric with a scissors at five,

151
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,790
and knew how to dye at seven.

152
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,648
She's extremely talented that even a man cannot reach her.

153
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:57,089
It'd be fine if she was just like a normal girl assisting the husband and bringing up children.

154
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,349
I could beat the b*stard to death

155
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:03,989
and support her if she had an unhappy marriage.

156
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:14,229
But I didn't expect that I'd worry about her like this every day.

157
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:20,710
I'm grateful that you helped her get the Family Representative Seal for her.

158
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,250
But please remember your words.

159
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,129
You're even now and she's free to marry anyone.

160
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,909
Father-in-law,

161
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,530
actually,

162
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,169
I can see you really love your daughter.

163
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,729
You don't care about if she's divorced.

164
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:43,390
What you care about

165
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,730
is if she can find the right one for her.

166
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,689
I've seen so many old-fashioned fathers like you.

167
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:58,908
Actually, you are worried about your daughter.

168
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:02,390
But you just won't express your love.

169
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,490
Stop, stop, stop.

170
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,950
What do you mean?

171
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,369
This book is a gift I prepared for you.

172
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:16,190
You can read it in your spare time.

173
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,689
If you act according to the book, the problems between you and her

174
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,969
will vanish.

175
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:29,209
I will take my leave now.

176

[Who Can Be A Natural Father?]

177
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:47,608
Father, we can wait. There's still time.

178
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:51,828
I will find a way to make Su Tan'er give us the seal.

179
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,809
You're really confident.

180
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,329
- Is it tea time?
- What do you want?

181
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,009
Brother-in-law, don't get overexcited.

182
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,049
I'm here to give you a gift.

183
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,949
The weasel said happy New Year to the rooster. Who knows what you're up to? (the weasel and the rooster is a famous Chinese folk saying that means someone is up to no good)

184
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:13,929
Well, I'm not the weasel.

185
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:18,149
But I can't stop you from saying you're the rooster if you insist on it.

186
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,049
Ning Yi Heng!

187
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,770
Here. Su's Account Book.

188
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,388
The shopkeeper and staff may deceive you.

189
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:31,009
But math will neve, because that's how math works.

190
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,870
I have made some tables by adopting mathematics

191
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,208
and some basic theories of accounting in the book.

192
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,510
You won't understand if I make it more complicated.

193
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,829
Anyway, just read it as much as you can. It will help you keep accounts.

194
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,870
I'll leave. Please take care of yourself.

195
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,270
And you... Don't put your father on edge.

196
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,310
What the heck is this? We don't want it.

197
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,910
I want it! Who said we didn't want it?

198
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,269
How inexperienced and ignorant are you!

199
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,129
Why do I have such a superficial son?

200
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,009
What did I do, Father?

201
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,250
[Silky Seal]

202
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,489
Lady, this one also was booked by the Wu Family.

203
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,408
It seems the Wu Family is determined to push us over the edge.

204
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,609
How about we go back to Young Master for help?

205
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,050
He has a lot of friends and may have another way.

206
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,589
Young Master, are you here for Miss?

207
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,210
She went out early in the morning.

208
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,930
Did she go to my room in the morning?

209
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,450
Fine.

210
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,429
If she asks you if I was here, just tell her I wasn't, okay?

211
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,949
Miss, you're back? He has been waiting for you for a long time.

212
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,609
Ning Yi?

213
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,769
Why are you here?

214
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:34,069
Boss, you must have known.

215
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,189
Wu Qihao has contracted with all the sing-song houses in Jiangning.

216
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,050
No performers can work for other stores.

217
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,830
Jade Garden Poetry Meeting is tomorrow.

218
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,709
He's made it clear that he's against the Su Familiy.

219
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,529
I should have known it earlier.

220
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,350
I was careless.

221
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,209
Boss, it's not your fault. No one expected he'd be so despicable.

222
00:17:56,209 --> 00:18:00,549
Now we have the silk, but we don't have any performers.

223
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,930
No one would present the fine fabric we have. It's useless.

224
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,989
Go back now.

225
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,369
Miss,

226
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,710
how about I do it?

227
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,330
Young Master. Young Master. Young Master.

228
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,008
I finally found you. Where did you go? Help us, please.

229
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:50,729
The Wu Family has booked all the performers in Jiangning.

230
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,628
Miss and Manager Xi are so worried right now.

231
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:00,889
Wu Qihao told me to wait and see and he'd show me what he had.

232
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,009
So, this is what he's talking about.

233
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,669
Lao Geng,

234
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,810
don't worry.

235
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,788
It was partly my fault.

236
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:20,069
I'm responsible for it.

237
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,550
I'll help you think of a way.

238
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,250
Come to my room.

239
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:37,449
Miss, do you think I'll humiliate the Su Family?

240
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,449
No.

241
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:45,808
You just need to recite it after you go up onto the stage.

242
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,049
Don't think of anything else.

243
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,368
Wait for me here. I'll go find a tailor to cut out your clothes.

244
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,010
Okay.

245
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,090
Miss.

246
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,269
You're home.

247
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:14,349
I haven't seen you in days.

248
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,540
Are...

249
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:19,109
Are you leaving?

250
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,730
Do you have anything to tell me?

251
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,649
I've known about the Poetry Meeting.

252
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,169
Don't worry.

253
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,470
Enough.

254
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,390
I know what I'm doing.

255
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,589
Have a safe trip.

256
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,449
She's kind of strange today.

257
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,130
Right.

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,189
Let's go. Go, or we will be late.

Young Master.

260
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,810
This is huge issue. Can we make it?

261
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,450
Of course we can't.

262
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,430
But I'm searching for a way.

Everyone,

267
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,908
tonight is the once-in-a-year Jade Garden Poetry Meeting.

268
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,230
Everything is ready.

269
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,790
My aim is to strike down Ning Yi

270
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,409
and disgrace him.

271
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,369
I'll let all the people in Jiangning know who's

272
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,110
the most powerful one.

273
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,149
You have to get your act together.

274
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,350
Got it?

275
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,050
Yes.

What are you doing?

Brother Ning? Come, come, sit here. I'll make room for you.

279
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,710
I heard your voice in the distance.

280
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,768
Since you are all here,

281
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,429
I won't need to look for every one of you.

282
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,990
I'd like to ask for a favor from you

283
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,549
for the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting.

284

I really admire you.

If you need anything, I am at your service.

286

What's wrong? Why do you admire him so much?

287
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,389
Brother Ning is allowed to take charge of the family affairs by his wife.

288
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,928
Since the day I became a matrilocal husband,

289
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,529
I haven't seen any one like me

receive such support from his wife.

291
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,889
It reminds of the days

when I was in my prime.

293
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:34,870
Weren't you a storyteller at the tea house?

294
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,288
Your wife couldn't sleep at that time.

295
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,610
And she'd feel sleepy listening to your stories.

296
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,750
That's why you got to marry into a noble family.

Y-You– It's none of your business.

I-I... anyway, Brother Ning is my role model.

Brother Ning, what do you need? Just tell me.

Why haven't you gone back home after school

and let your wives know you're safe?

307
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,150
Is it because your wives haven't come here?

308

My wife is at her parent's house.

495
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,170
Bravo! Bravo!

496
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,568
Su's matrilocal husband is amazing.

497
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,849
He has surprised us.

498
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,169
This Poetry Meeting, Su Family is in second place.

499
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,528
No one will dare be number one!

500
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:28,609
- Right.
- That's right.

501
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,529
It's a great show. Su's performer is amazing.

502
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,528
Miss Nie...

503
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,288
Your dance is great. I like it!

504
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,589
- Miss Nie, you're amazing.
- Calm down.

505
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,969
Please calm down. Calm down.

506
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,410
Don't come over. Calm down.

507
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,289
You like it?

508
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,229
Young Maste, the colorful lights were so beautiful.
[Su Manor]

509
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:02,370
How did you do it?

510
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,449
Those are special lanterns made by me.

511
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,069
I added some brass wires and black cloth to it

512
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:08,848
so as to focus the light.

513
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:11,848
And I covered it with colorful silk cloth.

514
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:14,970
That's why the color changed.

515
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:22,509
Young Master, Young Master, how did you make Miss Nie fly over here and there?

516
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,290
Can she really fly?

517
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,888
Of course not.

518
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,608
I used tough steel wire

519
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,729
which could carry most of her body weight

520
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:33,049
and make her fly.

521
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,529
Actually, it's called wire fu. (Wire Fu: technique use in Kung Fu movies during fight scenes to give the illusion of super-human ability)

522
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:39,310
Wire fu?

523
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,670
What is that?

524
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,209
What on earth is that?

525
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:46,289
Young Master, you're so capable.

526
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,349
It's no big deal.

527
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,609
Miss has come back already. Let's leave, so she can rest.

528
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:59,200
Yes. Let's leave.

529
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:16,429
Tan'er, I've been so busy these days.

530
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,870
I prepared a shaft for grandfather.

531
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,950
I also prepared gifts for your parents.

532
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,929
I even prepared one for second uncle.

533
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:27,809
But I just couldn't figure out what to give you for a gift.

534
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,409
You lack nothing.

535
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,268
Fortunately, I can cook this.

536
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:34,069
Cherry shaved ice with cheese.

537
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,210
One and only in the Wu Dynasty.

538
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,630
Try it out.

539
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,929
It's not that bad.

540
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:46,649
You don't even want to try?

541
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,209
One and only in Wu Dynasty.

542
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,689
You can't find anything like this outside.

543
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,609
I'm not making it for others.

544
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,870
It's only for you.

545
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,370
You're so considerate.

546
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,768
I didn't notice it.

547
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:13,170
Maybe my hand got scraped in the rehearsal.

548
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,870
Okay.

549
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:25,309
Well... I have to tell you.

550
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,569
I lost

551
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,910
the Letter of Divorce,

552
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,129
but I didn't do it on purpose.

553
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,669
I just couldn't find it in the morning.

554
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,528
I thought you took it away.

555
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:37,808
But I asked Xiao Chan.

556
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:40,350
She said you didn't go to my room at all.

557
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,129
I got excited for nothing.

558
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:45,729
Here's what I thought.

559
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:48,770
I lost the Letter of Divorce anyway.

560
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,509
And we don't need to write a new one.

561
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:51,929
It'll be too much hassle.

562
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,549
I am still of use to you anyway,

563
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:57,150
and I can manage the store for you.

564
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,870
I can cheer you up

565
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,488
and make shaved ice for you.

566
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:03,028
The most important thing is I don't eat too much.

567
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,550
And I…

Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

578
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,860
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

579
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,500

♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

581
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:12,010
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

582
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,180
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

583
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,990
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

584
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:27,980
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

585
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.

♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

587

♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
