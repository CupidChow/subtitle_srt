You see… I've brought my daughter here.

00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:36,000
Is it possible for us to not hand in 10,000 taels of silver each month?

6
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,399
That's easy. It's not a big deal.

My Lord. My Lord. We run a cloth business.

We can help to make some bedding and clothing for you.

It's midnight. I'm afraid they're all asleep.

We should make do with sleeping here for a night.

We can think about how to get in tomorrow.

During the one month I'm in Lin'an, I have only seen people run out of the city.

You're the only ones who ran into the city.

He is our Counselor in Badao Camp.

Hero, please listen to me.

166
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,440
Hurry. Let's go.

167
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,000
- One last shot.
- Cheers. Come on!

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,638
Thanks for your promotion.

169
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,858
I'll be your backup!

170
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,699
- You have me!
- Fan.

171
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,599
- Coming!
- Come! Drink!

172
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,158
- Cheers!
- Drink.

173
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:34,578
I can't.

174
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm drunk.

175
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,179
Fan, good liquor should be drunk on the good time.

176
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,619
He is getting older, while his tolerance is getting lower.

177
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,220
I want to ask you.

178
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,378
Why would you suddenly help me?

179
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:03,039
You still care about the citizens in Lin'an.

180
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,180
So, I helped you.

181
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Xi Gua!

182
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,138
- Xi Gua.
- Aunt?

183
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,419
Counselor Ning is here, too.

184
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,079
I've looked for you in the camp for a while.

185
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,638
I just know you came here after I asked someone.

186
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:23,518
You didn't like the one I introduced to you last time.

187
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:25,719
So, I've found a better one for you.

188
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:30,879
This is the best soldier in Fang Qiong's team.

189
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,138
Enough, Aunt.

190
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,278
I haven't avenged my father.

191
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,918
I won't marry anyone.

192
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,059
You're being silly.

193
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Who's going to marry?

194
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,158
Madam.

195
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,658
Xi Gua doesn't like this kind of person!

196
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,339
What the heck is he doing here?

197
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,580
Don't make her do this anymore.

198
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,699
He's drunk! Let's go.

199
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,539
Watch the stairs. Slowly. Slowly.

200
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,020
Xi Gua.

201
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,440
Come on, have a seat. Take a rest now.

202
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,719
Yeah, you should drink.

203
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,839
The more liquor you drink, the younger you'll become.

204
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,159
You'll find nobody malicious after drinking it.

205
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,859
Your worries will be all gone after you finish your wine.

206
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,460
I, Chen Fan,

207
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,619
have traveled all over the world and lead an unrestrained life.

208
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,219
There are countless girls who have crushes on me.

209
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,420
Why should I have to

210
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,140
put all my eggs in one basket?

211
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,139
You're right.

212
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
No more words.

213
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:12,599
Brother Ning, I've been taking

214
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,018
the medicine you gave me.

215
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,479
Have I successfully avoided my doomed love?

216
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,219
Almost.

217
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,939
Because it's your destiny to fall in love with someone.

218
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,119
If you want to change your destiny,

219
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,239
you have to go through another five courses.

220
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:32,059
But if I take of this medicine often,

221
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,138
I will get weak limbs in the morning.

222
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,579
This is… too troublesome for me.

223
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,398
You don't understand.

224
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,939
Good medicine usually takes slow effects,

225
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,378
because it never hurts your health.

226
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,699
Come on, I will feed you the medicine for today.

227
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,018
Take it with the wine.

228
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,199
It will be more effective.

229
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,038
It's said that the more knockout powder with liquor,

230
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,758
the sooner you become richer.

231
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,059
It not only helps change your marriage,

232
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,260
but it also removed all of your worries.

233
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:17,858
Miss Xi Gua, it's the first time we met.

234
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,019
I'm Yang Da Lang.

235
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,858
Nice to meet you.

236
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,959
Miss Xi Gua?

237
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,618
Sorry.

238
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,100
I'm not the miss.

239
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,459
Brother Ning.

240
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,798
How did you get out?

241
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,300
We pretended we were drunk and walked out one by one

242
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,858
saying we'd like to use the toilet.

243
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:44,739
Commander Liu is busy with her blind date.

244
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,019
She doesn't have the time to watch us.

245
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,278
What about the other two?

246
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:49,099
Over there.
- Let's go. Here.

247
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,720
Let's go. Let's go.

248
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,118
Let's go.

249
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,259
Chen Fan is asleep.

250
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,779
Let's go now.

251
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,358
Brother Ning, you are so garish.

252
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,339
Everyone knows you. How can you get out the city?

253
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,638
Yeah. You might get us into trouble.

254
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,539
- What should I do then?
- It's okay, Brother Ning.

255
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,860
I will help you change your look.

256
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,739
You're even capable of that?

257
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
Let's go.

258
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,178
Aunt, I've got a lot to do in the camp. I have to go now.

259
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,759
Xi Gua, sit down!

260
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,679
Please don't mind it, Young Master Yang.

261
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,579
Xi Gua is really short-tempered,

262
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,178
but her character is quite good.

263
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,798
Girls always should be reserved, you know.

264
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:29,579
So, I hope you can forgive her.

265
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,858
Sure, sure. Miss Xi Gua.

266
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,399
Stop!

267
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,779
Don't call me like that.

268
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,119
My name is Liu Da Biao.

269
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:46,259
Miss Da Biao, it's an honor to meet you. I–

270
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,099
Aunt, I'm really busy with the affairs in camp.

271
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,639
I have got to go.

272
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,639
Where is my counselor?

273
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:56,140
Counselor Ning. Counselor Ning!

274
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,319
Xi Gua!

275
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,938
You told me that you like brave, battle-wise, plump and sturdy…

276
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,639
and tall men!

277
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,159
I'd searched several camps before I found him.

278
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,939
How can you change your mind so suddenly?

279
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,500
When did I say I like such guys?

280
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,899
That's what I hate the most!

281
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,659
Your Counsellor Ning told me.

282
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,339
Three days ago, he came to me and

283
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,358
asked me to bring him to meet you at noon.

284
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:29,159
He said it's to celebrate the grain battle.

285
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,798
So that we can have two happy events come at the same time.

286
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,239
Didn't you get dressed up for this occasion?

287
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,300
What nonsense was he…

288
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,899
Hey! Liu Xi Gua, where are you going?

289
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,358
Chen Fan. Where is Ning Yi?

290
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,319
Chen Fan.

291
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,640
Where is Ning Yi?

292
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,820
He… He… was here just now.

293
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,439
Fine. Fine.

294
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,078
You paid lip service to me.

295
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:17,539
Actually you still want to escape.

296
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,139
Stop! Stop the cart!

297
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:21,719
Get out! Go back!

298
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,580
The gate is closing.

299
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,659
No one's here. Let's go.

300
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,539
What are you doing?

301
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,499
Feng Yuan, is this the disguise you put on me?

302
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,259
Why am I feeling I'm garisher now?

303
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,798
Brother Ning, that's all we got.

304
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:40,798
Besides, I only knew this one hairstyle.

305
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,880
You should've told me earlier. You… Let's go.

306
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,658
Great.

307
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:55,959
As long as we can escape, we won't need to cook soup, massage

308
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,019
and serve those bandits!

309
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,379
Stop the cart! Get out! Go Back!

310
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,518
If we get caught, it won't be as easy as cooking soup.

311
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:04,819
We would be torn in to pieces and made into steamed meat buns.

312
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,779
Shut up!

313
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,639
You two! Close the gates!
- Yes.

314
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,618
Hurry up!

315
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,479
The gate is closing. Let's go.

316
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:13,119
Let's go. What are you looking at? Let's go!

317
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,339
Isn't that the maid of your wife?

318
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,378
Haven't you sent them out of the city?

319
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,279
Why is she still here?

320
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,360
- You guys go first.
- Brother Ning. Brother Ning.

321
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,378
We can't just run out and leave Ning alone.

322
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,000
Maybe… Maybe we could.

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,619
You are a friend who sells friends! Traitor!

324
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,398
- I won't leave Brother Ning alone.
- Fine.

325
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,358
A friendship recognized by a scholar shall last forever.

326
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,618
We should hold on to the last.

327
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,519
But, you…

328
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
Let's go. Let's go.

329
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,738
Xiao Chan!

330
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:07,539
It's me.

331
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,680
Young Master.

332
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,300
Xiao Chan, why are you still here in Lin'an?

333
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,000
Where is Tan'er?

334
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:24,240
Young Master, why did it take you so long?

335
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
Why did it take you so long?

336
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
Young Lady... Young Lady...

337
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,760
I lost her.

338
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,779
Young Master,

339
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,439
I haven't found her. Did you find her?

340
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,700
Get up. Get up!

341
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,738
- Old Geng.
-Young Master, I lost my Lady.

342
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:37,780
It's not your fault.

343
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,199
Let's find her back together.

344
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,960
I lost my Lady.

345
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,900
I lost her!

346
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,900
I'm going go back and find him.

347
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,150
We managed to get off the boat,

348
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,130
All we saw were corpses.

349
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,339
She was so scared.

350
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:32,259
But luckily, we didn't find yours.

351
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,978
My Lady, Young Master is not here.

352
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:53,819
I didn't find him, either.

353
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,600
Not here?

354
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,779
Great.

355
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,699
Great! Great!

356
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:05,178
My Lady, let's go find him somewhere else.

357
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:06,618
Okay. Okay.

358
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:07,999
Let's go, My Lady.

359
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,078
Since then, we have been living in this house.

360
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:16,640
We wanted to find you and go back to Jiangning together.

361
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:32,979
My Lady, it's remote and safe here. Let's stay here for now.

362
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:36,280
We will go back to Jiangning together after we find Young Master.

363
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:03,458
She went to the street every day to inquire about your information.

364
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,580
But it was gain-less.

365
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,499
Miss, excuse me. Have you seen the person in the portrait?

366
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:10,619
No.

367
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,939
Hello. Excuse me. Have you seen the person in the portrait?

368
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,258
No.

369
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:19,079
Have you seen the person in the portrait?

370
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,700
No.

371
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,558
What should we do?

372
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,358
- Where is he?
- Still no clues?

373
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:26,859
- Let's go ahead.
- Let's go.

374
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,098
Misses, excuse me. Have you seen the person in the portrait?

375
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:33,000
No.

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,038
Have you seen the person in the portrait?

377
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:36,539
No.

378
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,199
Let's go.

379
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:49,959
Excuse me. Have you seen the person in the portrait?

380
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,140
No.

381
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,419
Hello, have you seen the person in the portrait?

382
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:54,919
No.

383
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,318
Let's go. Let's go.

384
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:00,200
What-What's happening ahead?

385
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,738
Let's go take a look.

386
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:04,219
- Let's go.
- On that day, My Lady and I were inquiring about you.

387
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:07,739
But suddenly we saw bandits and you were together.

388
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,358
My Lady, that guy looks like Young Master.

389
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:14,520
Hubby!

390
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,639
My Lady, you can't go there like this.

391
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:20,118
There are bandits in front. If we just go there like this, we will be in danger.

392
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,258
He is leaving if we don't.

393
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:22,959
My Lady.

394
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,339
Let's go.

395
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,659
- Let's go, my Lady.
- Let's go, my Lady.

396
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:32,518
My Lady, if that guy is Young Master, then he is pretending to be loyal to them.

397
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,640
Given his moral quality, he won't betray us.

398
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,720
I trust him.

399
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,390
But if he is in the bandits' team,

400
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,600
how can we find him then?

401
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,859
So we started to collect information about bandits' camp

402
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,359
in order to make sure if it was you.

403
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:01,519
Young Master. Ning Yi.

404
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,219
- Ning Yi.
- My Lady!

405
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:14,700
- Young Master!
- Ning Yi.

406
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,739
- Young Master!
- Make room. Make room.

407
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:20,519
- Young Master!
- Ning Yi! Ning Yi!

408
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,739
Lady didn't catch up with you when you went out of the city gate.

409
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,900
She was quite depressed.

410
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,619
Later, we haven't been able to find you when we looked for you on the street.

411
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,639
Until one day…

412
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,439
My Lady, I've seen him.

413
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:43,258
- Where is he?
- He's selling grain on the street.

414
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,298
My Lady, he's over there.

415
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,419
I never expected she would be kidnapped.

416
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,259
If I had thought of it, I would have gone to you and stopped her.

417
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,219
I would have prevented her from danger.

418
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,740
I never found out she was so close to me.

419
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,878
Brother Ning, don't worry. It hasn't been long since she disappeared. I'm sure we can get her back.

420
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:09,039
Nothing is difficult as long as we work hard.

421
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,340
Given your intelligence, there must be a way.

422
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,860
Old Geng, do you still remember what the abductors look like?

423
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,339
Not really.

424
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:26,000
But when I fought with him, I cut his right arm with a dagger.

425
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,258
His wound wouldn't have been healed in such a short period.

426
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:31,900
Then, they are not common people

427
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,539
since they could even fight against you.

428
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,859
They must be from the Badao Camp.

429
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,738
Brother Ning, we left with you.

430
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:43,440
We should go back together.

431
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,979
It was not easy for you to escape. No need.

432
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,499
Many hands make light work. We will help you get your wife back.

433
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,839
In all great stories, there is always the strong bond of friendship.

434
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,939
Young Master!

435
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,978
Young Master, please take me with you.

436
00:30:56,978 --> 00:31:01,878
I lost my Lady. I want to find her back with you.

437
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,900
Let's go.

438
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,830
[Wu's Capital]

439
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:47,379
I really don't understand why you like this porridge made of stinky preserved eggs.

440
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:50,219
Don't be fooled by its appearance.

441
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,518
It adds a special favor to some dishes.

442
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:59,639
I don't like it. Please just give me some white porridge next time.

443
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,059
It's dark and stinky to eat.

444
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,839
It's not because you don't like it.

445
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,758
It's because you can't eat anything now.

446
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,100
I'm not like you.

447
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,439
Mo Ying failed to assassinate Fang Tian Lei.

448
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,379
The situation in Lin'an City is complicated.

449
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm not in the mood for porridge!

450
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
If so,

451
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,640
if I tell you a good news,

452
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,920
can you eat a bowl of porridge with me?

453
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,878
Good news? What good news?

454
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,318
Qingde County near Lin'an reported a message.

455
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:42,659
Someone has collected 500 dans of grain

456
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,500
from several counties in one night and delivered it into Lin'an.

457
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:49,699
There are still people transporting food into the city?

458
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:52,699
They must be from the bandits.

459
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,019
No way.

460
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:59,759
If they were bandits, they would have been caught by the local government.

461
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,658
The Magistrate in Qingde County said

462
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:05,100
that the guy leading a group of rabble

463
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,039
went to the local government with my knife,

464
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,979
claiming to be Ning Li Heng.

465
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:14,759
The matrilocal husband in Jiangning?

466
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,859
Don't you think this is a favor from the heavens?

467
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,620
Just him alone?

468
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,219
Is he really that capable?

469
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:25,939
One stinky preserved egg

470
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:31,319
can also bring a huge difference to a bowl of white porridge.

471
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Go on.

472
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,900
The army led by General Dong should have arrived at Lin'an now.

473
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah.

474
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,200
If we can seize the opportunity to

475
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
help General Dong win the first battle,

476
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,200
then they can go north right away.

477
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,600
I hope everything is as you wish.

478
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,200
Did you find him?

479
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,700
Commander, so far we have no further information.

480
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,000
The men who guarded the gate said

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,700
they are sure that they have not left the city.

482
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
So, they must still be in Lin'an.

483
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,000
- Keep searching!
- Yes.

484
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
You were so drunk yesterday.

485
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,500
I get drunk easily.

486
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,200
Seriously, I haven't seen anyone lamer than you!

487
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,900
Indeed.

488
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,080
Do you still remember how you came back?

489
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,300
Your Ladyship.

490
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,600
Commander.

491
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,400
You got up so early.

492
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,200
Were you in the camp all the time?

493
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,400
Yeah.

494
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
We drank too much yesterday.

495
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,400
So we went back after we were done.

496
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,500
As you can see here, we're drinking tea to sober us up.

497
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,600
Where is Chen Fan?

498
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,400
He's sobering up, too.

499
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Go tell Chen Fan that he can stop searching.

500
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,900
Yes.

501
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,400
What's wrong, Commander?

502
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,500
What are you looking for? We can help you with it.

503
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
It's my business.

504
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
You don't need to know it!

505
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah, sure.

506
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
Well, then, we'll continue.

507
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
You want to join us?

508
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,000
No, thanks. You guys continue.

509
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Okay.

510
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,600
Come on.

511

Have a seat.

Counselor Ning.

513
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,200
Commander asked me to come here to deal with something. Open the gate.

514
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,700
Yes.

516

What do you want me to do, Counselor Ning?

517
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,400
Nothing. Commander asked me to deal with something here. Leave me alone.

518
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,200
Yes.

519
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,300
Are you looking for someone?

520
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,200
You can tell me who you want. I can help you with it.

521
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,600
No need. You can go back now.

522
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,400
Is there any other dungeon here?

523
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,900
This is the only one in Badao Camp.

524
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,700
That is to say,

525
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,300
she was kidnaped by some other camp.

526
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,900
Let's go to the drill ground.

Father.

528
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,500
I think I heard Ning Yi's voice just now.

529
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,300
Shut up.

530
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,899
I can hear his voice every day.

531
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,800
It's all illusion.

532
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,100
Nobody's there.

Holy Master.

535
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This is all the money we've collected since we came to city.

536
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
According to the old rule, we have exchanged it into gold.

537
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,700
That's 50,000 taels of gold for you.

538
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Please accept it.

539
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,100
Thank you, Brother Bao.

540
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,300
It's my pleasure.

541
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,600
That's what I should do.

542
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,800
Commander Bao,

543
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,000
there are many rich merchants in Lin'an.

544
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Each house should at least pay 50,000 taels of silver.

545
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Why is there only this little after it's exchanged into gold?

546
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,400
What do you mean, Madam?

547
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,300
We've worked so hard on it.

548
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,500
We tortured merchants cruelly and dug deep.

549
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,300
And that's all we could find.

550
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,000
I had no other way.

551
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Again, I was planning to clean out the rich

552
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,000
and cash in on the poor by selling the grain.

553
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,100
But I didn't expect that my plan would end up in vain

554
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,200
all because of Badao Camp.

555
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,200
If you think this is too little, you can't blame it on me.

556
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,000
All right.

557
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,300
I see.

558
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,600
You may leave, Brother Bao.

559
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Yes, Holy Master.

560
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Holy Master, he's getting more and more ignorant.

561
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Not his fault?

562
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,300
I'm afraid this is not even a drop in the bucket.

563
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,800
No worries, Madam.

564
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,900
I know what to do with him.

565

Buddies, roll up the sleeves of your right arm.

566

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
Hurry!

568
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,800
Come on.

569
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,100
Brother Ning, you're here.

570
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,600
Xi Gua told me about it. It was a misunderstanding yesterday.

571
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Don't mind it.

572
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,700
It's okay. I won't.

573
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,800
What are you doing?

574
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,700
- Looking for someone.
- Who?

575
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,300
To be honest with you,

576
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,200
my wife was kidnapped by someone.

577
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
Are you married?

578
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,200
No wonder you know so much about girls.

579
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,700
Wait.

580
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,100
Your wife was kidnapped?

581
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,800
To tell you the truth,

582
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I doubt the people who kidnapped my wife are here.

583
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
What?! How horrible!

584
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,000
Listen!

585
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,200
You have to cooperate with the Counselor!

586
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,700
If I know who kidnapped my brother's wife,

587
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,800
I will not forgive him!

588
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,600
Yes!

589
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,500
Brother Ning,

590
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,600
seldom have the people in Badao kidnapped any married woman.

591
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,300
I wonder if your wife is a beautiful woman.

592
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,400
Yes.

593
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,900
If your wife is beautiful and was hanging out,

594
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,780
it's very likely Bao Wen Han's kidnapped her.

595
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,440
You know him. He is such a lecher.

596
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,639
When we just came here, he assigned tasks to his men every day

597
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,500
just to kidnap several women on the street.

598
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,700
