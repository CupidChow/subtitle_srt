You decide.

I don't want this dagger anymore! Keep it to yourself!

It belongs to me after all.

Try it. See if it's handy.

You made the biggest contribution toward suppressing the rebellion in Lin'an.

This is a reward that you deserve.

52

This dagger is exquisitely made.

53
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,149
And it feels much lighter. It is better than that one indeed.

But if I accepted this dagger, I'd still have to work for you!

Not for me, but the Secret Investigation Department!

There you go again! It's always the Secret Investigation Department!

What on earth is it used for?

The Secret Investigation Department was established by the late Emperor.

Apart from carrying out secret investigations, the most important mission for us

That's not what I mean.

It's also necessary to recover our lost territory.

But we don't have to resort to force.

but she only wants to rescue you.

98
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,600
Just now, she gathered the people of Badao Camp

99
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
and was going to break into the jail.

100

He's agreed to my terms.

we'll let you walk out of here.

110
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,200
If Xi Gua knows that you are safe,

111
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
she won't come to seek her doom.

112

How can I know that you are not deceiving me?

113

If I tell you that,

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
then you can kill two birds with one stone,

115

taking down Xi Gua and Badao Camp altogether!

116

If I had wanted to capture Xi Gua,

117
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
do you think she would've been able to leave Lin'an?

118
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Staying in Wudu can be very dangerous to her.

- Greetings...
- Right Chancellor Qin, I'm tired now.

226
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,800
I've decided to

227
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
make peace with Jing State.

228
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Please go back.

229
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,400
I have a bold suggestion.

230
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,500
The North Expedition is a national plan.

231
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,200
General Dong will soon lead the army to the north with the firearms

232
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,900
to take back the six provinces near Qingyun.

233
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,300
Your Majesty, I must ask you to think again!

234
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Taking back lost territory is never easy.

235
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,500
I don't want to see the people and the soldiers suffer any longer!

236
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
Your Majesty, please think again!

237
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
Are you pushing me?

238
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I dare not!

239
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,300
But if we miss this chance to head north,

240
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,500
we'll lose our hope forever!

241

and know their terms for peacemaking.

265
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
they have one more requirement.

What is it?

267
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
Jing State demands Right Chancellor Qin go with me

268
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,300
and keep him as a hostage in Jing forever!

269

Right Chancellor Qin.

270
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,100

272

273
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
I hope you don't mind.

If we can make peace with Jing State,

277
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,800
then there will be no need to start a war.

278

280

of taking back the lost territory.

So, I'm here to ask if you can

283

give up on the stubborn loyalty

284
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,000

Call back the diplomatic convoy,

335
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,400
and send our army to go on an expedition to Jing State!

Right Chancellor Qin,

340
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,400
even to this day, you can still remain calm.

341
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,600
There's really nothing that makes you reluctant to leave this world

342
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,800
or are you just pretending?

343
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Minister, why do you say that?

344
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,600
And why should I pretend?

345
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,800
When you arrive in Jing State,

346
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,000
you don't know what will happen.

347
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,400
Only God knows if you can survive.

348
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Aren't you afraid of death?

349
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,200
Of course I am.

350
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,900
If you are,

351
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,200
why did you come back from Jiangning

352
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,300
instead of living in retirement there?

353
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,500
Speaking of Jiangning,

354
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,800
it is quite a nice place to spend your retirement.

355
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,200
But it is not too late to enjoy it

356
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,800
after the six provinces near Qingyun

357
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,200
are taken back.

358
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Right Chancellor Qin, you are so concerned about our nation!

359
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,300
I understand.

360
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,500
Staying in a peaceful city far away

361
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,900
can be torturous to a person like you.

362
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,200
However, nothing changes even if you come back.

363
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,800
The peacemaking has been decided.

364

Before long,

365
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,600
you'll become a disposable and worthless prisoner.

366
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,800
The six provinces near Qingyun will never be taken back.

trying to catch up with the diplomatic convoy.

But the convoy had already passed the northern border and entered the territory of Jing.

Before Right Chancellor Qin left,

378
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,200
he asked me to give this to you.

When the late Emperor passed away,

380
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,400
he actually passed two edicts.

381
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,000
One is to order the Secret Investigation Department to develop firearms in Lin'an

382
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
and take back the six provinces near Qingyun,

383
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,000
and the other is the one you're seeing right now.

384
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,900
Did Right Chancellor Qin say anything else before he left?

385
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
Right Chancellor Qin said

386
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,500
there is nothing on his mind now

387
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,000
and no need to worry about his safety.

388
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,800

Then where are the Imperial Guards?

If he does that, Right Chancellor Qin will…

427
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,300
Before Right Chancellor Qin left, he told General Dong

428

not to worry about his safety anymore.

Let me think!

00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,600
Jing State has been stationed at Xinggu Pass for a long time now.

436
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,400
Even if Dong Dao Fu has firearms,

437
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,800
his odds of winning will still be 50-50.

438
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,600
If the Wu Dynasty wins,

439
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,200
we'll take back the six provinces,

440
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,400
but Right Chancellor Qin would be killed.

441
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
If we lose,

442
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,400
the people of our nation would suffer greatly,

443
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,000
and Right Chancellor Qin will still die.

444
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Therefore, we can't have a fight.

445
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,000
Peacemaking is the only option!

446
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,200
Then what about the six provinces?

447
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
Is there a shortcut that can lead us to the capital of Jing?

448
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You can get there one day earlier by taking the mountain road in the northeast.
