1
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,439
During the four years of retirement,

2
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,960
I made gunpowder without your permission.

3
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,430
I've committed an arrogation and deceived you.

4
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,309
I should be killed for my crimes.

5
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:03,450
As the Right Chancellor, I should be more harshly punished

6
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,480
and my whole clan should be implicated.

7
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,260
Teacher, His Majesty truly wanted to make an issue of the gunpowder.

8
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,250
Even if I would be smashed to pieces tomorrow,

9
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,770
I'd try my best to persuade him.

10
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,160
I won't let His Majesty hurt you.

11
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,360
It's fine.

12
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,100
If His Majesty wants to suppress me, I'll let him do it.

13
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,290
Tomorrow, I want you to try as much as you can

14
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,400
to support He Yuanchang's proposal of my impeachment in the court.

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,630
Only in this way

16
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,390
will I have a glimpse of hope for survival.

17
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,460
A crime of deceiving me.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,170
Implicate your whole clan.

19
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,770
Now what?

20
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,600
In Right Chancellor Qin's mind,

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,039
I was a man who confused right and wrong, truth and falsehood, right?

22
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,160
Your Majesty, I dare not.

23
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,310
As you were.

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

25
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,730
I do suspect you of deceiving me.

26
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,240
But the gunpowder magazine in Lin'an and three hundred cannons

27
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,910
are all for the Wu Dynasty's prosperity and future achievements.

28
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,090
As far as I can see,

29
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,929
I'll fine you three years' salary and your official rank will be degraded in half.

30
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,270
Thanks for not taking my life, Your Majesty.

31
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,910
I'm tired. Now you can all leave and have a rest.

32
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,220
The court is dismissed.

33
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,289
Your Majesty, the North Expedition admits of no delay!

34
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,430
Long live Your Majesty.

35
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,829
Go over there and have a look.

36
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,930
Let's go.

37
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,170
I haven't seen these before in Jiangning.

38
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,910
Amazing. Is Lin'an lively like this every day?

39
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,759
We came here at the right time.

40
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,540
Today happens to be the first day of market opening in Lin'an City.

41
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,300
You can see the most prosperous scene in Lin'an City.

42
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
It's great.

43
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,120
What is that tree?

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,500
Maybe we can make a wish.

45
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,840
Lady, you smile like a flower.

46
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,070
Young Master, you're imposing.

47
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,640
How about drawing a painting on such a lovely day?

48
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,900
You can draw your lover with only five coins.

49
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,389
What do you think? I'll draw a painting for each of you.

50
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,360
He has a way with words.

51
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,840
All right.

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,560
We'll give you ten coins rather than five.

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,109
You don't need to draw paintings for us. We'll draw them for ourselves.

54
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:23,910
Okay. Please sit down.

55
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,640
I don't love anyone

56
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,300
and I'm not good at drawing, either.

57
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,920
Just draw whatever you like.

58
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Try it.

59
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,420
♫ I often think of the moments with you ♫

60
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,990
♫ Following closely behind as you walk ♫

61
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:55,260
♫ Devotion to you and protecting you silently ♫

62
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,490
♫ Love is the warmest giving in the world ♫

63
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,430
♫ A gift for a lifetime ♫

64
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,590
♫ In order to be your little husband ♫

65
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,260
♫ I will only surrender to you forever ♫

66
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,750
♫ With the most gentle identity ♫

67
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,070
♫ Work hard in exchange for the title of love ♫

68
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,150
♫  In order to be your little husband  ♫

69
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,480
♫ I don’t want to be famous in this life ♫

70
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,479
Young Master, have you ever learned drawing from a professional?

71
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,580
The lady you drew has come alive,

72
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,670
and it's so amorous and lifelike.

73
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,790
Even the lines between her gussets

74
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,039
are natural like drifting clouds and flowing water.

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,510
It's a good painting.

76
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,430
I'll give you another ten coins.

77
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,170
Thanks, Young Master.

78
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,560
It doesn't count.

79
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,900
I'll check it personally.

80
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,490
I haven't colored it yet.

81
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,400
Let me have a look.

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,960
What is this?

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
It looks like a portrait of a suspect who has a long face

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
on the wanted poster.

85
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,800
It's not my fault.

86
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,639
You didn't smile too often and you were cold to my jokes.

87
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,131
But the hair accessories are wrong, too. Didn't they smile?

88
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:13,839
Hair… You sat towards there. I couldn't see them.

89
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,340
It's not good, anyway.

90
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,760
Don't always judge me.

91
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,170
I don't know what I look like in your painting. Let me see.

92
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,850
- I...
- Let me see.

93
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,329
It is way better than yours. Look at it.

94
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,600
It is much better than yours.

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
I didn't think that…

96
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,840
With just a few strokes,

97
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,120
a handsome, elegant,

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,999
gentle and lovely Young Master appears vividly on your drawing.

99
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,799
Such a good Young Master.

100
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:47,120
What a lucky girl she is that she can marry him!

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,050
Someone is being shameless.

102
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,040
How is it? My drawing skill is quite good, right?

103
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,199
Much better than yours! What is that?

104
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,930
Yes, yours is quite good.

105
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,490
But my dear,

106
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,210
we both drew pictures well.

107
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,320
There is no need in comparing.

108
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,540
Let's have a look at Xiao Chan's.

109
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,080
What is it?

110
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,670
Xiao Chan. is this your self-portrait?

111
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,650
My Lady, look at him!

112
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,989
Xiao Chan, is it your husband in your heart?

113
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:18,730
My Lady, I told you I'm not good at drawing.

114
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,630
How about…

115
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,320
Let's have a look at Old Geng's.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,420
What an idea, Xiao Chan!

117
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,180
- What are you drawing?
- Who is she?

118
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,559
What are you doing?

119
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,579
Come on. Let's see it. Who was that?
- Let me see it.

120
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,799
You didn't say that we would see each other's drawing.

121
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,310
I'm saying it right now.

122
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,499
Your Lady wants to see it.

123
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:48,749
- I haven't finished it yet.
- We're a family.

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,260
I seem to have met the girl in the portrait.

125
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,910
My Lady, the weather is so hot. I'll buy an iced drink for you.

126
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,249
- Yeah. I knew her, too.
- Is she…

127
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,800
- She is in Jiangning…
- Young Master will go with me.

128
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,539
- Jiangning?
- Who is she, My Lady?

129
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:10,600
Which one in Jiangning?

130
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,360
Come on.

131
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,220
Why did you blush?

132
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,750
We were right?

133
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,669
Is she…?

134
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,319
Let's go.

135
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,200
Master Qian is distributing alms.

136
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,879
Master Qian is distributing alms.

137
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
Master Qian is distributing alms.

138
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,160
Hurry up, hurry up.

139
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,000
Master Qian is distributing alms.

140
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,520
What are they doing?

141
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,719
Don't know.

142
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,620
Let's have a look.

143
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,779
Vegetables! Vegetables here! Have a look!

144
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,020
This Old Master is distributing porridge and food.

145
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,349
Do you know him?

146
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,250
No.

147
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,699
Young Master, excuse me.

148
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,450
Do you know who the Old Master is?

149
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,750
That one?

150
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,860
You must come from somewhere else.

151
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,770
He is Qian Xi Wen, the big shot in Lin'an.
[Qian Xi Wen]

152
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,199
He is a noble man with a high prestige.

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,280
He distributes alms to the poor on New Year's Day and other festivals.

154
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,530
Thanks a lot.

155
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,010
So, he is Qian Xi Wen.

156
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,560
Do you know him?

157
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,950
I've read his books before.

158
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,180
We've never met each other.

159
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,800
Did he write love novels?

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,280
Of course not.

161
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,250
He wrote sinology editorials.

162
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,690
- Can you understand?
- Of course.

163
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,010
People who are literate in the Wu Dynasty all have read his books.

164
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,560
- It enlightens… enlightens what… enlightens…
- Enlightens the benighted!

165
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,390
Yeah. It must be him.

166
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,879
- You won't understand it.
- I do.

167
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,769
Let's go. Let's buy some curd cheese. Let's go.

168
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,920
My dear. My dear. Stop drawing.

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,609
You came back. You've been gone for a long time.

170
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:49,939
I found this specially for you.

171
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,240
Watermelon curd cheese.

172
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,140
Try it. Is it delicious?

173
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,840
Good.

174
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,630
But it's not as good as the cherry curd cheese you made before.

175
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,970
I'll make it for you next time.

176
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,830
I think it's getting late.

177
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,960
We need to find a place to have a rest.

178
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,820
If you want to hang out later, we can go to the Qingyue Mountain and Hui Lake.

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,400
These are good places to go.

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,639
My dear, you can hang out with Old Geng later.

181
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,100
I have an appointment with someone.

182
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,180
You made a new friend in such a short time?

183
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I grew up in Lin'an City.

184
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
She is an old friend of mine.

185
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,440
We've written letters for many years.

186
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,380
So, I want to meet with her and have a chat.

187
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,630
Okay.

188
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,490
Come back early.

189
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,500
Then we'll leave now.

190
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,700
Let's go, Xiao Chan.

191
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,839
Young Master.

192
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,950
If you still feel worried, we can follow them.

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,829
Who feels worried?

194
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,599
Who feels worried?

195
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,209
I'm not worried at all.

196
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,109
Old Geng, I'm telling you, trust and some space

197
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:19,250
are most important between a couple.

198
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,839
Young Lady, come and look.

199
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,079
Here, Young Lady, have a taste of it.

200
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,179
War-horse special drink.

201
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,079
To refresh and replenish yourself.

202
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,160
It works very well.

203
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,840
Young Master, what about space and trust?

204
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,719
We still have some space.

205
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,059
Boss, do you have some good newly-released books?

206
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,279
Yes. Yes.

207
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,799
- Is it newly released?
- Yes.

208
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,470
- Why does she buy books here?
- I'll take it.

209
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,330
Xiao Chan, pay the bill.

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,599
- Okay, thanks.
- See you.

211
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,870
- Come here.
- Filigree for sale.

212
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,950
What did those two girls buy?

213
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,829
Come on, ladies.

214
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,909
- This way, please. This way.
- Chan.

215
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:35,599
This way, please, Masters. This way, please.

216
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,519
This way.

217
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,960
Guests, see you next time.

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,060
Take care.

219
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,619
Old Geng, do you know the background of Lou's Cloth Store?

220
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:59,029
Lou's is the leading cloth store in Lin'an City.

221
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,809
Lou Shu Heng and Lou Jin Lin are the masters of the family.

222
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,569
They are close to Su's.

223
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,860
But in these years, the Elder Master Lou has set foot in other industries.

224
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,149
The Cloth Store is now managed by Lou Shu Heng.

225
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,890
My Lady came back this time to see how they are managing it.

226
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,639
Why did you know so much?

227
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,719
Because they were merchants appointed by royalty.

228
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,279
The tributary cloth that Wu Dynasty offered to Jing

229
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,519
was all from here.

230
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,769
They are awesome.

231
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,689
Oh, right!

232
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,170
I remember when the Lady was young, she lived in Lou's Family.

233
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,450
Her old friend must be Lou Shuh Heng.

234
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,739
No way.

235
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,349
What…

236
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,479
Young Master, look.

237
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,049
- They have a parking lot, too.
- Back.

238
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,620
- Did the Lady tell them?
- Back.

239
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,009
Young Master, it looks so similar to our Su's Cloth Store.

240
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,649
You see. The products were placed in different areas.

241
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,319
Here is the high price area, and there is the low price area.

242
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,639
They have no counter.

243
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,079
They have the clothing display.

244
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
There is also one over there.

245
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,780
Old Geng,

246
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,130
your lady is quite good at helping others.

247
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,140
Clerk.

248
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,950
Clerk!

249
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,809
What?

250
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,039
Did you see a lady?

251
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,279
A lady?

252
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,480
Only ladies buy clothes here.

253
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,469
I didn't make myself clear.

254
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,519
A girl who's quite fair.

255
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Fair, right?

256
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,519
Look at her.

257
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,220
Is she fair?

258
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,530
And look at this one. Is she fair?

259
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,159
You just can't understand me, right?

260
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,499
I'm serious.

261
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,599
A girl in green went upstairs to the second floor.

262
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,009
She is fair with a book in her hands.

263
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,210
Did you see her?

264
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:22,890
You should have said that earlier.

265
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:24,689
You should have said that earlier. A girl holding a book?

266
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,929
I know her.

267
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,689
They just told me to select some clothes and send them upstairs.

268
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,369
Where did you send it?

269
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,170
The fitting room.

270
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,750
Su Tan'er?

271
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,770
With our Manager.

272
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,770
Lou Shu Heng!

273
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,680
Su Tan'er!

274
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,840
My dear, why did you come here?

275
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,690
You sent me away with an excuse

276
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,130
just to come here?

277
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,930
He is still in there?

278
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,400
I was wondering why you came to Lin'an.

279
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
You came to find your old friend?

280
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,330
You even changed your clothes?

281
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,450
He selected it for you?

282
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,040
Fine. Fine.

283
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,929
Boss Lou, come out!

284
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,990
My dear, what are you doing?

285
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,510
- Get out of the way.
- My dear, what are you doing?

286
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,129
Come out. None of your business.

287
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,960
I'm counting from 3 to 1.

288
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,889
I'll shoot you if you don't come out.

289
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,500
Three. Two. One.

290
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,240
[Lou Shu Wan]

291
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,150
[Lou's Cloth Store]

292
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,250
Someone is dead!

293
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,960
Run. Someone is dead.

294
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
Tan'er.

295
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,979
Tan'er. It's my bad, today.

296
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:45,839
But you didn't tell me.

297
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,719
I didn't know it's a female manager.

298
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,489
What are you thinking every day?

299
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,989
I haven't seen her for years.

300
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,609
I could have had a long chat with her.

301
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,759
You messed it all up.

302
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,989
Her business was messed by you, too.

303
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:59,209
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,519
It's all my fault.

305
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,229
But I was really worried about you.

306
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,039
Your worries made it worse.

307
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,399
Why did you worry about me?

308
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,119
I told you I was seeing my old friend.

309
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,861
I didn't know who she was.

310
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,621
- And you didn't tell me…
- You're Ning Yi, Young Master Ning?

311
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,210
Tan'er always mentions you.

312
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,510
I'm really sorry today.

313
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,639
It was a misunderstanding.

314
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,040
I didn't know that the blunderbuss would go off by accident.

315
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,449
I hurt your guest accidentally and scared the other guests away.

316
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,849
So… I'll pay for all the damage.

317
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,039
It's fine.

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,039
You did it for the sake of Tan'er.

319
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,940
I felt quite happy.

320
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,489
But I have to tell you,

321
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,119
Tan'er is my only young girlfriend.

322
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,510
If you dare to treat her badly, I won't let you get away.

323
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,649
Don't worry.

324
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,730
My wife and I are good…

325
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,180
If we were not good, how could I make a mistake like that?

326
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,879
Tan'er, you haven't come to Lin'an for long.

327
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,849
How about going to our home?

328
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,850
We can have a chat.

329
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,929
Okay.

330
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,729
I'll prepare the carriage.

331
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,730
It's very kind of you.

332
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,590
My dear,

333
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,230
I have already admitted my mistake.

334
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,119
Moreover, didn't you… teach how to prepare a parking lot to her?

335
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,609
It brought many guests to their Cloth Store.

336
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,989
Merits offset faults.

337
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,489
Just forgive me this time, will you?

338
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,449
Merits offset faults?

339
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,360
She came up with it herself.

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,159
Impossible. Parking lot. She…

341
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,649
Even the parking lot is her idea.

342
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,369
Clothing display and different areas of products

343
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,570
are all her ideas, too?

344
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,929
Ning Li Heng, let me tell you!

345
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,089
Although we exchanged letters,

346
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,469
we only talked about girls' private matters.

347
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:53,239
We never inquired about each other's business.

348
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,340
You think you're the only clever person here?

349
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,400
Is she…?

350
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,009
I've prepared the carriage. Let's go.

351
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:03,610
Okay.

352
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,859
Tan'er, I'm so happy you came this time.

353
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,509
Me, too, Sister Shu Wan.

354
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:35,139
In this place, she had such advanced ideas.

355
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,400
Is she…

356
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,019
Young Lady Lou.

357
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,190
I heard… the Lou's Family was the merchant appointed by royals in Lin'an City.

358
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,489
You must be extremely rich.

359
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,760
You're wealthy so your garden must be very big.

360
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,720
With the big garden… and the thick walls…

361
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,130
What's the Wi-Fi password in your house?

362
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,939
Young Master Ning.

363
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:16,119
You said… A wild horse?

364
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,559
It doesn't matter.

365
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,240
If you don't know the Wi-Fi password.

366
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,240
You must know the QR code.

367
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,209
The QR horse?

368
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,570
Do I scan your code or are you going to scan mine?

369
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,059
Young Master Ning, I do have horses at home.

370
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:42,160
But I didn't know those two kinds of horses you said.

371
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,510
I didn't know them, either.

372
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,389
It's fine.

373
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:52,470
Just two rare species from the Western Region.

374
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,220
Tan'er, you said that

375
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,549
Young Master Ning is knowledgeable and well-informed.

376
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,440
Seeing him, I think you're quite right.

377
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,259
He is not like that. Sister, you flatter him.

378
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,839
Where is my mobile phone?

379
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,130
Ning Li Heng,

380
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,669
why are you acting so weird? What do you want?

381
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,969
What're you talking about?

382
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,931
Young Master Ning, if you want to eat chicken, I can ask the servants to cook it for you.

383
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:22,800
Tan'er, would you like to have chicken soup or a roast chicken?

384
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,350
Sister Shu Wan, you're so kind.

385
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,840
I don't need chicken soup,

386
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,590
but my husband needs some nutrients.

387
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,890
♫ I'm like a fish in your pond ♫

388
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,200
♫ Waiting for the moonlight with you ♫

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,320
♫ The pond, the pond. Sing it slow ♫

390
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,010
You don't listen to music, right?

391
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,019
I'll change to another one.

392
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,200
♫ No gifts for this year ♫

393
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,470
♫ No gifts. No gifts. No gifts. No gifts ♫

394
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,910
♫ Only accept ♫

395
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,890
You didn't watch the ads, either.

396
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,590
♫ Palace jade liquor ♫

397
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,140
I know what you want to say. I know what you want to say!

398
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,210
Do you want to say 180 yuan per cup? Don't hold it back. Say it now.

399
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,540
I'll see how long can you hold out.

400
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,250
♫ 180 yuan per cup ♫

401
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,110
♫ How about the wine ♫

402
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,940
♫ Listen. Wait for my boast ♫

403
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,610
♫ I said it wrong ♫

♫ Huh-huh, it's still wonderful ♫

408
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,590

411
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,030
Ning Li Heng!

412
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,340
Sister Shu Wan, is it here?

413
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,720
Sister, let's go.

414
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,940
Tan'er, come.

415
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,530
Tan'er, look at this.

416
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,560
What is this?

417
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,210
It's Beanbag!

418
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,670
- Good, done.
- Sister, you're great.

419
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,140
When can I weave such beautiful cloth like the one you did?

420
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,000
like the one you did?

421
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,010
You and I can weave cloth together

422
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,250
and open the largest cloth store in the future, okay?

423
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,310
How large will it be?

424
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,010
Large enough to let all the Wu Dynasty's people wear the clothes we made.

425
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,889
- Pinky swear.
- Okay.

426
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:19,180
Pinky swear. We'll never change in 100 years.

427
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,750
The one who changes will become a pig.

428
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,130
Sister Shu Wan, if it weren't you,

429
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,920
I would have never known weaving clothes

430
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,390
is such an interesting thing.

431
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,540
When I was little, I thought it's a great thing

432
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,740
to become a person like you in the future.

433
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,720
A person like me?

434
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,780
What kind of person am I?

435
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,450
You know what you want.

436
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,610
Sister Shu Wan, do you remember that we made an agreement when we were little?

437
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,830
We would open the largest cloth store in Wu Dynasty.

438
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,060
I've made a decision after I came back to Jiangning.

439
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,750
I want to be a lady like you, and I would do it well

440
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,590
even though everyone didn't support me.

441
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,330
What are you looking at?

442
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,379
Young Master, you startled me. Why did you walk so quietly?

443
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:32,200
Was I being quiet or were you turning deaf ears to me?

444
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,800
Tell me.

445
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,200
- Who is the lady in the portrait?
- No one.

446
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,010
Come on.

447
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,630
Are you too shy to talk about her with me?

448
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,260
You are an adult now.

449
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,040
It's normal to fall in love with someone.

450
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,140
Still not telling me?

451
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,340
Fine.

452
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,490
Then I'll guess.

453
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,870
The girl who stays with you all the time,

454
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Xiao Chan?

455
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,870
She? She has a large forehead. I don't like it.

456
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,570
Well… Xiao Juan?

457
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,300
Xiao Xing?

458
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,960
Xiao Chun?

459
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,490
Xiao Xia?

460
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,650
Xiao Chu Ju?

461
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,779
Xiao Mei Lan?

462
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,920
Xiao Li?

463
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,620
Xiao Shen Yang?

464
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
- Wh-Who are they?
- None of them, probably.

465
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,899
So, who is she?

466
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,780
They are the only maids in Su Manor.

467
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,460
I didn't expect that

468
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,430
you're this kind of person.

469
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,759
Aunt Niu?

470
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,119
Young Master, you went too far.

471
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,409
- Am I right?
- Of course not.

472
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,270
Young Master, stop guessing.

473
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,769
She doesn't work in Su's Mansion. You won't guess it right.

474
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:03,229
She doesn't work in Su's Mansion. Where do you usually go?

475
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,210
Xinmen Brothel.

476
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,000
Madame Yang.

477
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,639
Young Master, Young Master! Be quiet. Be quiet.

478
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,390
I'm just a little Guard.

479
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,780
I'm not good enough for her.

480
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,230
I'll marry her when I gain enough money.

481
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,830
Keep the secret.

482
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,730
Seriously… Why didn't you tell me earlier?

483
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,290
Do you think I'll sell you out?

484
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,490
I was afraid of it.

485
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,700
Relax. I'll keep the secret for you.

486
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,730
Thanks, Young Master.

487
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,920
Xiao Chan.

488
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,790
- I'll tell you something funny.
- Young Master!

489
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,390
- Old Geng…
- Young Master!

490
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,939
Old Geng has fallen in love with someone now.

491
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,940
Who is she? Young Master.

492
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,559
No one. No one. You promised me!

493
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,000
Old Geng. We are friends, let me see.

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
[Lou She Heng]

495
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,239
I want to have a look. Just a look.

496
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,350
Let me look. Just a look.

497
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,870
I-I-I won't let you go...

498
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,390
I got you!

499
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,630
Let me have a look!

500
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,799
Tan'er, you came to Lin'an City without telling me in advance.

501
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,550
You must be punished to drink three cups of wine later.

502
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,390
Brother, why did you come? Young Master Lou.

503
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,100
Don't call me Young Master.

504
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,490
We grew up together.

505
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,910
I prefer you to call me Brother Shu Heng.

506
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,220
We haven't met in these years.

507
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,960
Yet you became more and more beautiful.

508
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,359
You came to Lin'an City and can live with us. Don't worry.

509
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,160
I'll leave everything on my hands behind

510
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,460
and show you around Lin'an City.

511
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,770
Brother, Tan'er came with her husband.

512
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,460
Their accommodation has been settled.

513
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
It's not suitable

514
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,150
to live with us.

515
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,009
I'm talking to Tan'er. Hold your tongue!

516
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,580
Why are you standing here?

517
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,430
Go back to the Cloth Store!

518
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,310
Stop being an eyesore in front of me.

519
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,650
And…Tan'er, you came to Lin'an City

520
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,420
without telling me in advance.

521
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,310
I would have had a preparation.

522
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,320
Otherwise, people will think the Lou's treats their guests badly.

523
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,579
Tan'er, I've arranged a welcome dinner in your favorite restaurant.

524
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,890
After a long separation,

525
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,449
we must have a long conversation and drink more wine today.

526
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,029
Young Master Lou, I just arrived at Lin'an. Seriously.

527
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,459
Then, you should drink more to relax yourself.

528
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:50,479
- Don't be too polite to me.
- I can't.

529
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:53,040
Are you Lou Shu Heng?

530
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,969
Move your dirty hands. I'll count to three.

531
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,320
Tan'er, is he the matrilocal husband?

532
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,610
He really lacks of discipline.

533
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,159
Well, today, I'll teach you what discipline is.

534
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,860
One.

535
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,699
- Do you know who I am?
- Two.

536
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,849
The whole Lin'an City belongs to our family!

537
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,260
- Three.
- Do you believe I can have someone break your…

538
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,470
Brother, are you okay?

539
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,610
Go on. I'm listening.

540
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,790
Break my what?

541
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,439
Young Master, what happened?

542
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:52,470
Nothing. I'm telling a rabid dog what discipline is.

543
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,059
Young Master Ning, you're a gentleman.

544
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,069
For the sake of the friendship between Tan'er and I, please have mercy.

545
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:08,170
If I didn't have mercy, your brother would have died now.

546
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,040
Tan'er, let's go.

547
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,220
Brother, are you all right?

548
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
Brother...

549
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,400
Brother!

550
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,900
Brother, don't be angry.
[Lou Manor]

551
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
- Brother, are you all right?
- Don't follow me!

552
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,800
Today, you should have stayed in the store and taken care of the business,

553
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,300
but you went out without permission,

554
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,300
and even brought this rude guy home.

555
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
You will stay at home from today.

556
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,600
The Cloth Store is not your concern anymore.

557
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
Brother...

558
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,000
Brother, I know I was wrong.

559
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,800
You know?

560
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,300
Okay.

561
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,600
Tomorrow, you should make an appointment with Su Tan'er alone

562
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,800
to the Tori Restaurant.

563
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,100
Brother...

564
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,100
Tan'er has been married.

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,800
It's not good to do this.

566
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,200
Do whatever I ask!

567
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,100
Cut the crap!

568
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
Steamed buns.

569
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
White and delicious steamed buns.

570
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,800
People can forget all the troubles by having nice food and wine.

571
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,200
Young Master, why don't you eat them?

572
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Look. It's the Xichuan's hot and spicy tofu.

573
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,300
Seven stewed vegetables from Jiujiang.

574
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,800
Steamed crabs from Liaodong.

575
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
We even have mushroom soup from Semu People.

576
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,400
It's a pity if you don't eat them.

577
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Lin'an... is an important town of commerce and trade connected to six cities.

578
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
It's also known as the nation's granary.

579
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
These are just like a drop in the bucket.

580
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,800
This hot and spicy beef is a real feature of Lin'an.

581
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
I really liked it when I was a child.

582
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,300
My dear, have a taste of it.

583
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,800
It's tender.

584
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Only Lin'an has this beef.

585
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
It's a pity that we can't take it back to Jiangning.

586
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,800
I think maybe we can open Zhu Restaurant in Lin'an.

587
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
We can manage it while having a trip.

588
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,500
Sounds good, right?

589
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,400
You don't really want to open a restaurant.

590
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
Instead, you want to have a trip here.

591
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
But dear, I do think it's a good idea.

592
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,000
Zhu Restaurant has its own characteristics.

593
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,700
The locals are very inclusive.

594
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,500
It will be warmly welcomed by them.

595
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,400
As for the Cloth Store… Let's just forget it.

596
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Your girlfriend Lou Shuwan is talented.

597
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,600
If we open the cloth store here we may not compete with hers.

598
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,200
Moreover, even if we can compete with her,

599
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,600
we'll take business away from her.

600
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
It's not appropriate.

601
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,200
Let's just sell preserved eggs.

602
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Masters and Ladies, someone asked me to bring this to you.

603
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Please enjoy it.

604
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
Who would it be?

605
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,900
No way, is it Lady Lou?

606
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Come down!

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
We are coming!

608

I knew it was you.

609
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,200
How have you been?

610
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Why did you come here?

611
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,700
Last time Master Geng told us how good Lin'an was.

612
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,200
So we came here to take a look.

613
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,820
We went here for a trip. But actually, we are looking for business opportunities.

My dear, why did you bring us to Taiping Alley?

616
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Take it easy.

617

What do you think about it?

622
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Do you like it here?

623
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,200

Rent?

625
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,200
I bought it for you.

You can live here if you want to come to Lin'an in the future.

I swear I'll buy a big manor like this for my wife, too.

630

You will spoil your wife.

- Come on!
- Come on!

659
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
- Bottoms up!
- One more shot.

660
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,500
- Can you drink more?
- Yes.

661
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,400
Sure.

662
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
- Don't force yourself.
- Are you kidding?

663
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
- Come with us, Xiao Chan. Xiao Chan.
- Xiao Chan.

664
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,600
Let's drink.

665
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,400
Come, come.

666
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,200
Cheers.

667
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,900
Drink it.

668
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm going to sleep.

669
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,600
Brother Ning, doing a small business is my biggest dream of my life.

670
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,400
I don't want to be that rich.

671
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I just want to have ample food and clothing.

672
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Don't worry about it.

673
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,500
I've made a very specific plan about our future.

674
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,800
Really?

675
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Brother Ning, you knew we'd come here?

676
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,900
Of course.

677
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,100
Take it out and show it to them.

678
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Go back to your sleep.

679
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,200
This is the map of Lin'an city.

680
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,800
As we all know, Lin'an City is the most important

681
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
commercial town in the Wu Dynasty.

682
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,600
If we win Lin'an's market,

683
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,700
we'll win half the market of the whole country.

684
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:06,000
So, I decided our first store will be located here.

685
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
The South Gate.

687
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Be quick.

688
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,700
Hurry up.

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,700
Take it easy.

690
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,900
A competition?

691
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
You go to the east and I, west.

692
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,100
That's what I thought.

[Menbei]

694
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,600
If we can easily occupy the South Gate,

695
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,600
then the four intersections of the two main roads

696
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,600
of West Street and East Street are of primary importance to us.

697
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,000
Run!

698
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Bandits are coming!

♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,300
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫
