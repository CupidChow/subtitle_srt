4
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,650
Kids.

5
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,860
Zhongkan, you will go on a tough journey.

6
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,339
Apart from our own guards, I've also hired some armed escorts for you

7
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,830
just in case of emergency.

8
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,869
Father, we're looking for people and it'll be a race against time.

9
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,349
If I take all of them with me, it'll certainly hold me up on the way.

10
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,729
If I go there late, Tan'er and Liheng may be put in danger.

11
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,719
There will be nothing we can do then.

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,919
- But–
- We've already decided.

13
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,469
Just let me and Wenxing drive a carriage with light packs.

14
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,859
Only in this way can we save more time

15
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,370
and have a better chance of finding them.

16
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,200
Okay. You have the final say this time,

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,729
but you have to be careful on the way.

18
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,350
Don't push yourself too hard

19
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,090
even if you can't find them.

20
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,750
Yes, I'll bear it in mind.

21
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,050
All right.

22
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,780
Second Master, sorry that I didn't pay much attention to you.

23
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,000
Please forgive me.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,079
That's an overstatement.

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,980
I know business is business, Lady Yunzhu.

26
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,540
I just regret that during this short period of time

27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,180
I never had a real position to contribute to Zhu.

28
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,360
Please wait for us to return.

29
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,360
I don't know

30
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,360
whether we can come back or not.

31
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,449
You are so benevolent and righteous.

32
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,780
God will definitely protect you and help you return safely.

33
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,799
I hereby swear that regardless of the result,

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Zhu will surely not let you down.

35
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,910
If you can bring Young Master Ning back safely,

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,670
I can even let you manage the Zhu Restaurant.

37
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,639
Now that you've said these words,

38
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,299
my son and I are ready to risk our lives to do it.

39
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,760
Be careful on the way. Please.

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,230
I'll leave now.

41
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,990
Grandfather.

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,029
Just leave, you all. You can leave now.

43
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:35,000
Go back. Go back.

44
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,720
Go back.

45
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,320
Let's go.

46
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,610
Father.

47
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,610
Father, we've put ourselves into this type of situation

48
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,650
and you can still laugh.

49
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,139
The sky is clear and the sun is shining brightly.

50
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,969
It's definitely a good day to travel.

51
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,190
What's there not to laugh about?

52
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,399
How can you call this travel?

53
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,300
We are obviously jumping into a fire pit.

54
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,890
Father, I just don't understand.

55
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,200
Isn't it a bit reckless of us to go to Lin'an at this time?

56
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
Lin'an?

57
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,339
The Lin'an City is full of bandits.

58
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,470
Why are we going there?

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,419
We are not going to Lin'an?

60
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,020
Where are we going, then?

61
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,310
Where did you get this from?

62
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,380
I found this in Guard Geng's room.

63
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,870
This is obviously a sketch they left when they were planning where to have fun.

64
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,220
Look. All their planned itineraries are on this drawing.

65
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,120
Sour prune soup?

66
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,200
Fanghuachi Hot Springs?

67
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,440
I didn't expect that!

68
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,429
While we were working so hard at Zhu,

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,190
they were enjoying themselves outside!

70
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,380
There's no need in being envious.

71
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,060
Since they can have a honeymoon, you and I can, too.

72
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,429
I've thought about it.

73
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,919
Let's follow this map and go all the way to the south.

74
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,210
We'll take a rest when we want to admire flowers and enjoy scenery.

75
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,430
Wouldn't that be nice?

76
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,469
Then… Are we not going to look for them?

77
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,740
We are. Of course we are.

78
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,419
When we find him, we'll take him back to get our reward

79
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,380
and take over Zhu.

80
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,590
Even if we cannot find him,

81
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,920
we can have a trip for a few days.

82
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,649
Before we head back, we'll make ourselves look shabby

83
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,810
and slightly exaggerate the hardships we've met along the way.

84
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,749
We'll be appreciated for our hard work if not merit.

85
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,110
By that time,

86
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,350
Nie Yunzhu wouldn't let us down.

87
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,119
Moreover, with our intelligence and wisdom,

88
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,520
we still can take over Zhu easily.

89
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,719
No wonder you insisted on not bringing those escorts and guards just now.

90
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,980
Turns out you've figured it out long ago.

91
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,940
You finally get it.

92
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,859
You are indeed wise, Father.

93
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,649
This is really an idea that kills two birds with one stone.

94
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,749
I really admire you.

95
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,360
Keep learning from me.

96
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,759
- Hurry up, let's go.
- Okay.

97
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,709
Why are you still wearing this?

98
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,510
Take it off, take it off!

99
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,390
Let me take it off for you, Father.

100
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,340
Why is there so little money?

101
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,399
Where did you hide all the money?

102
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,719
Your Highness, my life savings are all here.
[Lou Jin Lin]

103
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:34,649
Please have mercy on me and leave me some for my retirement.

104
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,459
Don't take them all away.

105
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,889
We are acting on the order of Leader Bao of the Xuanwei Camp.

106
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,869
Why are you still complaining since we just took this little money from you?

107
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,539
- Carry them away.
- No, no, no! Please.

108
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,769
You dare to stand in our way?

109
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,670
Beat them up!

110
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,670
Shuwan!

111
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,699
You…

112
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:50,989
Father, are you all right?

113
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,059
I'm all right.

114
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,660
Carry them away.

115
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Wait.

116
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,630
Come out from there!

117
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,869
- Spare my life, heroes!
- You even dared to hide!

118
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,079
Take them all back to jail!

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,720
No, no, no!

120
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,670
Heroes, I have silver.

121
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,169
You can take all of it.

122
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,800
As long as you don't put me in jail.

123
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,970
Right Chancellor Qin, the imperial decree came so abruptly

124
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,799
and it leaves us no room for discussion at all.

125
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,899
It was surely not my intention to send out the troops in such a haste.

126
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,590
General Dong, say no more.

127
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,280
Such being the case,

128
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,210
we have no other way now.

129
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,020
The significance of Lin'an City to the Wu Dynasty is obvious to all.

130
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,559
As for the war in the north, I'll send people there to take over your job.

131
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,260
I only ask you to fight a quick battle

132
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,730
and keep the military stronghold.

133
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,300
Rest assured, Right Chancellor Qin, I'll surely make it quick.

134
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,829
This is a plan I drafted to enter the city

135
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,470
and it could ensure that you take back Lin'an successfully.

136
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,219
Thanks for the efforts.

137
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm sure I'll live up to your great trust.

138
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,790
Go.

139
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,200
[South City Gate]
(T/N: Chengnan City)

140
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Set out!

141
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,450
Buddies, you must be tired for standing for so long.

142
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,770
Here, come on. How about a slice of watermelon?

143
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,590
Come on. Come on.

144
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,239
Fine.

145
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,950
It's icy.

146
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,270
Very sweet.

147
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,920
It has mushy pulp. Nice.

148
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,709
You've never seen it before, have you?

149
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,430
Watermelon.

150
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,400
There's no need in seeing me eating a watermelon.

151
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,359
I know the direction. Don't be afraid I'd get lost.

152
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,900
Go back.

153
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,760
Counselor, Leader Liu asked us to keep an eye on you.

154
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,910
Don't make fun of me.

155
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,699
Counselor, seriously? I didn't agree on it.

156
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,899
Leader?

157
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,920
Isn't she… just a little girl?

158
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,480
Are you serious?

159
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,630
As big, burly and stoutly built chaps,

160
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:10,650
why do you work for a young girl?

161
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,149
It looks weird.

162
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,559
We four, Sha, Ren, Chang, Ming,

163
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,509
were adopted and brought up by the elder camp leader.

164
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,430
We've been following Leader Liu since childhood.

165
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,270
Well, you guys are called Sha Ren Chang Ming.

166
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,239
It must be given by someone who's really bad at giving names.

167
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,920
Why don't you call yourselves Qian, Zhai, Huan, Qian?

168
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,900
The four buddies of Pay the Piper for the Pipes are over there.

169
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,769
Really? They are not as good as you.

170
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,729
Enough! Cut out the crap with him.

171
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,120
Buddies, don't get me wrong.

172
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,679
I don't have any evil intention.

173
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,330
I just want to go to the bathroom.

174
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,440
All right, stay here.

175
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,070
Do you have to do this?

176
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,510
Leader Liu asked us to follow you wherever you go.

177
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,280
Move!

178
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,409
Go!

179
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:39,810
If you look again

180
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,699
and move slowly, I will cut your head off!

181
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,100
Hurry up!

182
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,019
Hurry! What are you looking at?

183
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,620
Squat down!

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,130
Who can cook?

185
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,400
Me.

186
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
Take him away.

187
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,220
Who can do cleaning?

188
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,270
Why?

189
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Stand up! Go! Hurry up!

190
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,270
My sister-in-law is in poor health.

191
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,360
Who knows traditional Chinese medicine?

192
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
Me. Me.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,670
Why it's always you?

194
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,119
Squat down.

195
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,999
There's something you don't know.

196
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,600
I am the best student of Academy of Male Virtuousness in Jiangning.

197
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,919
Cooking, making soup, house cleaning,

198
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,149
TCM health care, massage, and chiropractic.

199
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,090
I can do all of them. Anytime.

200
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,050
Male Virtuousness?

201
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,780
It's a place where we are taught how to take care of people.

202
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,899
Haven't you heard of it?

203
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,819
To be a matrilocal husband, you need go to the Academy of Male Virtuousness. By regarding your wife as the standard...

204
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,149
You will know if you let me give you a massage.

205
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,070
Don't you dare get your hands on me! You want to die, right?

206
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,459
Heroine, spare my life!

207
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,151
I…I think you seem to be exerting strength from your neck and shoulders and your meridians are somewhat blocked up.

208
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,830
Is it because you have strained muscles in your neck and shoulders and blocked up tendons and veins?

209
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,239
Let me give you a massage. Give it a shot.

210
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,920
You can kill me if you don't feel comfy.

211
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,300
Heroine, what do you feel?

212
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,969
Much better, indeed.

213
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,570
You are skilled.

214
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,470
Thanks for your praise, heroine.

215
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,389
My fellow classmates are just like me, They can do everything.

216
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,589
Bah!

217
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,019
Who's just like you?

218
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,980
- We are not going to be traitors.
- You…

219
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,280
Then, kill them all.

220
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,589
Heroine, spare my life, spare my life!

221
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,069
We were wrong, we were wrong!

222
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,849
Let them go. Please spare their lives.

223
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,070
Heroine, I can do everything, too.

224
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,879
I can also cook, do the cleaning and give a massage. I can do them all.

225
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:22,370
I can write poems for you.

226
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,120
I…I can clean the house.

227
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,549
Take these ones inside and make them leave the marks on the indentures. Put the rest in jail.

228
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,120
- Yes.
- Thank you, Heroine.

229
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,520
Get up, go!

230
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,310
Move!

231
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
Hurry up! Move!

232
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,769
Hurry up! Quick! Hurry up!

233
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,119
Guys, you are all from noble families of Lin'an City.

234
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,729
You're scholars, farm owners, artisans and merchants.

235
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:59,029
Holy Master Fang Tianlei has arrived in Lin'an.

236
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,090
Now many things are waiting to be done.

237
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,800
We need your help.

238
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,970
Today, I gather you guys here

239
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,919
just to learn your attitudes.

240
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,860
Those who are willing to submit

241
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,360
can leave a fingerprint, and Holy Master will keep your family safe.

242
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,160
Those who have an evil intention and incite people to make trouble,

243
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,800
don't blame us for being tough on you.

244
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,380
Master Qian, I heard you are a big shot who's known far and wide

245
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,250
and you have a very high prestige.

246
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,849
How about you state your attitude first?

247
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,630
So that it'll be easier for them to speak.

248
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,519
Master Qian. Master Qian.

249
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,770
Old man, a wise man submits to fate.

250
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,150
I will not be easy on you.

251
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,509
Confucius advocates benevolence while Mencius advocates justice.

252
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,790
Benevolence only follows when justice is depleted.

253
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,250
You want me to persuade them into surrender?

254
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,720
You really flatter me.

255
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,530
If you want to take my life,

256
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,480
please do it.

257
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,160
We can't kill this damn old man yet!

258
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,459
Master Qian is right.

259
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:44,599
If we surrender, what's the point of a half life's education?

260
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,259
Yes, we will not surrender.

261
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,129
No surrender! We will not surrender!

262
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,829
No surrender!

263
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:52,270
No surrender! No surrender!

264
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,129
Did you start it just now?

265
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,030
Yes, and so what?

266
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,919
You bastard, just come to me if you want to take my life.

267
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,030
Don't hurt innocent ones.

268
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,120
Come here!

269
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,321
I…I…I… I surrender, I surrender!

270
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,699
Your Highness, we Lou family run a cloth store in the north of the city.

271
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,420
I surrender in real earnest.

272
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,320
Please give us a chance to survive.

273
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,319
We'll not go beyond your bounds and be absolutely loyal.

274
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,780
Your Highness. Spare my life, Your Highness.

275
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,389
Brother, Brother!

276
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,230
Get out!

277
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,479
Get on the boat quickly! Get on the boat!

278
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,350
Tan'er must be safe now.

279
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,020
I must get out of here as soon as possible and join them.

280
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,920
But…

281
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,500
Buddies,

282
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,040
it's getting late.

283
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,399
Please go back and have a rest.

284
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:17,200
Leader Liu asked us to keep an eye on you all the time.

285
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,919
I'm going to sleep.

286
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,390
Then, just sleep. We'll watch you fall asleep.

287
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,230
I can't fall asleep if you watch me.

288
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,249
Then, I'm not going to sleep.

289
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,959
Nor are we.

290
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,580
Catching me out, right?

291
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,300
Fine.

292
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,459
No sleep.

293
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,860
I'm going to stay up late with you.

294
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,320
Can I correct the writs?

295
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,389
Are you guys exam proctors?

296
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,799
I... I… I'm correcting the writs.

297
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,150
Why are you watching me?

298
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,560
I can't continue if you keep doing that.

299
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,840
I'll write them randomly.

300
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,940
Fine. Your name is Sha, right?

301
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,350
Sha will clean up the bathroom tomorrow.

302
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,840
Ren will sweep the cesspool.

303
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,530
Chang will clean away the horsesh*t.

304
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,620
Ming will wash everyone's socks in Badao Camp.

305
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Still watching me?

306
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,280
Staying up late is so easy.

307
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,310
I'll keep playing with you.

308
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,019
- Big or small?
- Big.

309
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,179
- Big, too.
- Big.

310
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,789
- Throw your coins here.
- Small.

311
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,500
Big.

312
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,749
- Small.
- Big.

313
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:47,959
Give it to me.

314
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,260
Big. Big.

315
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,030
Small.

316
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,910
Come on.

317
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,199
- Small, again.
- Small.

318
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,770
I'll choose the small again.

319
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,850
- Small.
- Big. Big. Big.

320
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,140
I was just being lucky.

321
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,910
One more time.

322
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,920
Big.

323
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,559
Still big. Still big. Big.

324
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,359
- Small.
- Big.

325
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,480
Small. Small.

326
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,389
If you listened to me, you would have won twice.

327
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,630
Join us or shut up.

328
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,439
I…I'll join you.

329
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,980
- Do you have money?
- I didn't bring any.

330
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,060
Nobody will play with you if don't have money.

331
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,460
Let's play first.

332
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,150
Wait and see it.

333
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,969
- Small.
- Small.

334
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,190
It's big, again.

335
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,500
I feel guilty.

336
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I can't a place to spend these pence.

337
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,439
You've been through a lot.

338
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,190
You even watched me at night and played with me.

339
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,430
Yet you lost all your money now.

340
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,880
I'm broke.

341
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,010
Well, I'll stop making fun of you.

342
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,280
Take back your money.

343
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,349
Do you still want to play?

344
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,599
Yes. Yes.

345
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,499
How many buddies are on the patrol?

346
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,500
About five or six.

347
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,950
Go call them to play with us.

348
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,969
- Come on. Come on!
- Big or small?

349
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,509
Big.

350
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,349
I choose small.

351
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,249
Small. Small.

352
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,029
Big.

353
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,150
Watch it carefully!

354
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,319
Come on. You drink.

355
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,120
Drink.

356
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,629
Cheer up. Cheer up!

357
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,600
You'll win next round.

358
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,799
Cheers.

359
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Let's go on.

360
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,229
- Come on.
- Small!

361
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:28,979
Small!

362
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:32,750
Big! Big! Big!

363
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,720
Big!

364
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,140
[Ba Dao Camp]

365
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,680
You are all having a good sleep.

366
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,600
Then I'll go home.

367
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,989
Let me tell you.

368
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,079
I got many good stuff yesterday.

369
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,269
Drinks are on me!

370
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,070
Okay. Great!

371
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,380
Counselor Ning, what are you doing?

372
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Wanna a rubdown?

373
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,550
What were you doing?

374
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,190
He almost escaped.

375
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,900
Actually, it's not entirely their faults.

376
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,169
- I just went for a run in the morning.
- Cut it out.

377
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,389
Leader Liu said you were not allowed to go out

378
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,750
if you don't finished these writs.

379
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,219
I've graduated for many years.

380
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,559
I do not want to do any homework.

381
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,629
You can ask Pay the Piper for the Pipes Gang

382
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,750
to come here if you feel sleepy.

383
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,850
If you dare to close your eyes at the Counselor's door,

384
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,120
I'll hold you responsible.

385
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,030
Yes.

386
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,450
Are you serving the Counselor or guarding a prisoner?

387
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,030
Now you're threatening me?

388
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,130
I'll ask Leader Liu to beat you up.

389
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,659
Do I have to say it again?

390
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,110
No. We had kept it in mind.

391
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,670
I'm going to kill you.

392
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,440
Go to hell!

393
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,500
Liu Dabiao, what are you doing?

394
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,580
Sorry, Leader Bao.

395
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,560
He is mine.

396
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,250
Don't ask for trouble.

397
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,990
It's you who're asking for trouble.

398
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,990
Leader, please have tea.

399
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,200
Get out!

400
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
Get out, all of you!

401
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,900
Leader Bao, Holy Master invites you to the Hall for a discussion.

402
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,149
Holy Master, the Family of Qian, Mu, Tang and Chang

403
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,079
have surrendered to you after seeing Lou's Family surrender,

404
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,619
except that old bones Qian Xiwen.

405
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,730
Why couldn't I just kill him as a warning to others?

406
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,140
We cannot rush a surrender.

407
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,219
Qian Xiwen has high prestige

408
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,739
and we just occupied the city.

409
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,959
If we went too far, they would start a riot

410
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,389
and that would make it harder.

411
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,679
It's okay. I'll deal with it.

412
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,679
Yes.

413
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,349
Holy Master, why do you care about those common herds so much?

414
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,629
They may not accept your kindness.

415
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,940
Even if we don't kill Qian Xiwen,

416
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,929
many people still think that our business cannot last long.

417
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,140
In my opinion, we should kill those who surrender insincerely.

418
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,470
Nobody will stand up because of fear of death.

419
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,810
You're rushing.

420
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,079
Do you think this is somewhere in the wild forest?

421
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,819
Lin'an is the stronghold of economy in the south.

422
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,310
How could you kill people at will?

423
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,579
Qian Xiwen has immense prestige in Lin'an.

424
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:15,479
If we persuade him successfully, we will keep a foothold accordingly.

425
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,109
You know nothing.

426
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,000
Listen.

427
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,319
If I give status and power to

428
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,200
the people in the City who can work hard, they'll be loyal to me.

429
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,570
If they can't, I'll kill them.

430
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,660
Liu Dabiao, I have a question.

431
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,480
What were you doing when we fought for the Holy Master in the city?

432
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,559
You were making friends with citizens on the street.

433
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,979
You sent steamed buns to them.

434
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,320
Do you think you're the Bodhisattva?

435
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,009
You stopped me from killing people.

436
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,459
Who do you think you are?

437
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:49,080
We occupied the Lin'an City and this will be our home from now on.

438
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,619
If we want to keep it and live here for a long time,

439
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:56,400
we should show our attitude to let them know that we have rules.

440
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,940
People from your Xuanwei Camp did too many awful things these days.

441
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,839
It's fine if you just took the gold and silver.

442
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,229
Yet you took their daughters and cut off the water transport.

443
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,149
If you continue this, we will lose Lin'an City sooner or later.

444
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,080
You are too young to teach me!

445
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,460
Now what?

446
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,630
Are you going to start a fight?

447
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,400
Let go of your hands!

448
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,720
Why do the people call us bandits?

449
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,030
Have you ever thought about it?

450
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,990
What a scandal!

451
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,900
Well...

452
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,200
Pass on my words.

453
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,280
From now on, anyone who kills people randomly

454
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,220
will be severely punished.

455
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,520
- Holy Master.
- Shut up!

456
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,559
Shouldn't you pay attention to your behaviors

457
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,270
as the Leader of the Xuanwei Camp?

458
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,240
Leave.

459
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,130
Back off.
[Fang Manor]

460
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,960
Don't stay here.

461
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:21,110
Let him out.

462
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,230
Free him.

463
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,080
Let Master Qin out.

464
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,101
You have no right to arrest him!

465
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:30,159
It's him. He wanted to kill Master Qin.

466
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,969
- Zheng Biao.
- Yes.

467
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,499
Remember those who are shouting.

468
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,339
Get them to a remote place and kill them.

469
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,529
- Don't let anyone see it.
- Yes.

470
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:44,560
Don't let the Holy Master know it.

471
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,590
Are you satisfied now, Xigua?

472
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,029
You've been waiting for the whole morning.

473
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,799
I thought there was an emergency.

474
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,890
I was not satisfied at all.

475
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,389
Didn't you tell me that you would teach him a good lesson?

476
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,069
But you just scolded him airily.

477
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,110
Now, you tried to fool me.

478
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,179
Xigua,

479
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:05,049
he is the Leader of Xuanwei Camp after all.

480
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,729
He has prestige in the Camp.

481
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,489
And now we need him.

482
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:10,880
If the Holy Master punished him more harshly,

483
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
he might become rebellious.

484
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,969
I know, Auntie.

485
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,410
You've said that thousands of times.

486
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,400
Xigua, come here.

487
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,209
Did you have a crush on any after you entered the City?

488
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,830
I'll asked Aunt Qiong to catch him for you.

489
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,820
No, thanks, Auntie.

490
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,239
The Young Master of Dou Minzhong's Family is quite imposing.

491
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,109
How about I take you there to have a look?

492
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,439
You'd better not.

493
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,419
Well, I still have something to deal with in the Camp.

494
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,529
I'm in a hurry. I need to go back first.

495
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,699
- Don't leave.
- Chen Fan. Chen Fan.

496
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,009
You're also old enough.

497
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,529
- Is there anything in the Camp?
- Xigua, listen to me.

498
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,209
- I have to deal with something in camp.
- Xigua...

499
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:46,219
- Aunt.
- Xigua!

500
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:47,619
- We'll leave now.
- Come here.

501
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,680
We'll leave first.

502
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,240
Holy Master,

503
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,109
Xigua is not young anymore.

504
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,760
She should think about her marriage.

505
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,289
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

506
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:00,170
Did she have a crush on someone?

507
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,419
She didn't.

508
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,439
But Chen Fan has always been following her,

509
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,099
and it seems they like each other.

510
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,479
No way!

511
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,069
They fight with each other every day.

512
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,350
How can they live together?

513
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,950
You're right.

514
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,149
Just forget it.

515
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,090
We'll talk about it later.

516
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,240
Holy Master!

517
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,860
I heard that you tried to escape.

518
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,220
What?

519
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,110
Did you feel wronged being my Counselor?

520
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,309
The repair of the South Wall you took charge should start right away.

521
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,279
It's said it will start in 10 days on the writ.

522
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,619
I'm afraid it's too late.

523
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:43,869
I'm not sure if you have you seen the weeds outside the city.

524
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,719
It has grown to a certain height.

525
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,869
I don't know what it will look like ten days later.

526
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,589
If someone knows it and utilizes this chance,

527
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,200
they can break into Lin'an City secretly.

528
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,239
I'm asking you. Did you hear me?

529
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,189
The Grain Distribution Team arranged by you in the east of city can come back now.

530
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,679
I read that it is full of corpses.

531
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,679
As far as I know, there are few rich families.

532
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,209
Most people are farmers.

533
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,919
They won't die of hunger even if they don't have extra grains.

534
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,149
So, you have to investigate Badao Camp.

535
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,439
It seems like someone is making use of

536
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,350
his position to feather his own nest.

537
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,969
There is an old man named Qian Xiwen in Lin'an City.

538
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:23,199
I heard Holy Master put him in the prison alone.

539
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,419
It is not good.

540
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:27,679
You have to arrange someone to take care of his life.

541
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,629
Master Qian is a noble saint with high prestige in Lin'an City.

542
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,829
If Master Qian is here,

543
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,679
people in Lin'an City will set their minds at rest.

544
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,439
By the way, the people who take care of him

545
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,870
shouldn't be the ones like Sha, Ren, Chang, Ming or Qian, Zhai, Huan, Qian or anyone like Fan.

546
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,629
Such fierce people will scare Master Qian.

547
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,759
Well. That's all.

548
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,700
Kill me or cut me into pieces. It's your call.

549
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,830
What do you mean?

550
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,590
Wha-What do you mean?

551
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,349
I don't have any other thoughts.

552
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,629
I just did what I should as a Counselor.

553
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,069
I have been busy these days.

554
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:05,240
I've been making inquiries around Badao Camp all the time.

555
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,800
But look at Brother Fan.

556
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,819
If Leader Chen hadn't given me a hard time,

557
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:10,689
I would've finished reviewing the writs earlier.

558
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,859
He confined me inside the room.

559
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,869
I thought you would kill and cut me into pieces

560
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,149
when you came here today.

561
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,710
You're so good at talking nonsense.

562
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,290
He wanted to escape,

563
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,419
and he blamed it all on me.

564
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:25,919
Liu Xigua, he is full of crap!

565
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,280
You want him to be your Counselor?

566
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,919
I decide who's the counselor in my Badao Camp.

567
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,740
None of your business.

568
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,389
What's more, didn't you hear that

569
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,480
he pointed out many problems directly?

570
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,629
If he can't be the counselor, can you?

571
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,059
- Review them if you can!
- Come on.

572
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:46,200
Look at what he has reviewed.

573
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,549
I am too tired to review them anymore.

574
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,480
I'll go out for a walk.

575
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
Chen Fan,

576
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,919
you are supposed to take charge of the security.

577
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,590
Why do you stay in Badao Camp every day?

578
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,580
I…

579
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,450
Wenxing, are you sure we can have sour prune drink here?

580
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,069
Go to the east about 10,000 meters and then head south about 7,500 meters

581
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,729
and go through a forest.

582
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:47,190
You will see a fairy village drifting in the clouds and mist.

583
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,309
It's right here, Father.

584
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,550
Sour prune drink is right here.

585
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,710
Is this sour prune drink?

586
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,280
No.

587
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,550
It should be here.

588
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,280
I know, Father.

589
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,619
Although it's the outhouse,

590
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,009
but no one says sour prune drink can't be made in an outhouse.

591
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,759
Make sour prune drink in the outhouse?

592
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,719
Are you crazy?

593
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,069
Father, many delicious foods are like this.

594
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,629
A bad smell but a good taste.

595
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,220
Like, stinky tofu.

596
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,729
Are they comparable?

597
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:22,000
You're such a fool!

598
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,280
It might be there.

599
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,070
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

600
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,840
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

601
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,440
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

602
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,020
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

603
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:39,320
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

604
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,050
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

605
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,810
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

606
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:53,800
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

607
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,880
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

608
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,170
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

609
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,080
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫
