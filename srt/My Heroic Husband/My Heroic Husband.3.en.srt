[Episode 3]

3
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,200
Boss, we have two hours to go.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
There is a long line waiting outside the store.

5
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Prefect Zhang and Magistrate Li are also on their way.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,500
What should we do now?

7
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,500
Mis, how about we dry them by fire?

8
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
It won't work.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,200
The Cloud Silk and Gauze is made from silks of different textures.

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
That's why it shows different colors

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
under the sunshine.

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,900
The fire would ruin the gauze.

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,100
It's such a pity to lose such fine gauze.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Er Hu.

15
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Boss.

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
How much of the Cloud Silk and Gauze are left now?

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
30 bolts all together at most.

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
30 bolts?

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
That's far from enough.

20
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,500
[Su Manor]
We can lose some cloth but we cannot break our promise.

21
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,600
Before the opening,

22
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Tan'er has been working in the shop day and night.

23
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
You know that.

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Yesterday, the Manager Xi and she checked everything carefully.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
No one expected the heavy rain.

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Yes.

27
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
I said that Tan'er is inexperienced.

28
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
It's rainy season now.

29
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
We should be even more careful.

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,600
We never made such mistakes in our shops.

31
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
It was my fault.

32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Please punish me.

33
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Manager Xi, please get up!

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
What are you doing?

35
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,400
Get up.

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,300
Get up, Manager Xi.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Yesterday, we checked the shop together.

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
We left after everything was in place.

39
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
I was also responsible

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
for this problem.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Please get up.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
We have no way but to delay our opening now.

43
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,599
Tan'er thought she was so smart.

44
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,300
Before the opening, she promoted the Cloud Silk and Gauze so much

45
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,600
that both Prefect Zhang and Magistrate Xu asked me

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
if they could order the gauze in advance.

47
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,200
If I had known it earlier, it would have been better for me to sell it.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Well, it's over now.

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,800
If Prefect Zhang and Magistrate Xu were disappointed,

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,400
what would happen to the future of our shop?

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,300
It is said that the warehouse was drowned in water.

52
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,900
Are they going to open the shop?

53
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,600
Can we buy Cloud Silk and Gauze?

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
- Yes.
- That's right.

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
You promoted the Cloud Silk and Gauze everywhere.

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
You said it is something we've never seen before.

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
I came here before dawn to get in line.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
I have been waiting all along.

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,400
They have nothing for us.

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Are they playing with us?

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Yes, they are!

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Boss, you have devoted a lot to the shop.

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
We all know that.

64
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,400
But now with 30 bolts Cloud Silk and Gauze and our production speed,

65
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
we still need ten days

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
to meet the demands all the customers.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes, he is right.

68
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,500
We can delay the opening.

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
What happened?

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Eldest Young Master, you should go back.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Go away.

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
How dare you!

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
No manners at all.

Go back to your work. Come.

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
The rain just ruined our warehouse.

77

Now you are here to see the fun.

78

You are such a know-it-all.

79

I care about you, Younger Sister.

80

It doesn't matter if I'm a know-it-all.

81

Grandfather also knows it.

82

How are you going to explain it?

83
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you going to open? Is it so hard to let us know?

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
If you keep dawdling like that, I will smash your shop.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
Yes. Smash your shop!

86

Calm down. You can't go in.

I promise I will help you deal with it.

90

You just need to stay at home.

91

You are just a matrilocal husband.

Why? You want to fight with me again?

I was careless last time.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Then, we are careless this time.

99

Where is our Cloud Silk and Gauze?

If we can't open the shop today, second uncle will be happy to see it.

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Young Master.

171
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
The Cloud Silk and Gauze is really beautiful.

172
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
This is just a trick.

173
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,500
This is our new item, Cloud Silk and Gauze.

174
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,600
You already have it in your hands.

175
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
Boss Su, introduce it to everyone here.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Really. It has two colors.

177
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
It's exquisite craftsmanship.

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
We make Cloud Silk and Gauze using silks of different textures.

179
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Under sunshine, it will show different colors,

180
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
as unpredictable as the changing clouds in the sky.

181
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
If it is used to make clothes, it will be as thin as a cicada's wings.

182
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
You will be cool in it and smell good in summer.

183
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
- How much will a bolt of it cost?
- Yes.

184
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Just 3,000 cash.

185
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
- So expensive!
- 3,000 cash?!

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So expensive!

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are robbing us.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Take it easy.

189
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,200
The final price isn't up to us, but you.

190
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,400
W-We want it for free.

191
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Who said free? Who said free?

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
You are exactly right.

193
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,200
If you participate in the activity,

194
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
you may really buy it for free.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
Really?

196
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
All staff, listen to me!

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,000
All of you start doing your job.

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Yes.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
[Sale]

200
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
[Sale]

201
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,400
[300 cash]

202
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
[500 cash]

203
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
[Thank you]

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Dear customers, sorry to have kept you waiting.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Welcome to our activity.

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,200
All those who want Cloud Silk and Gauze can join in the activity.

207
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,600
Everyone who wants to buy it can invite your friends

208
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,400
to help you join the activity.

209
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
Check out the turntable.

210
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
There are several areas with different discounts on them.

211
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,500
Stand outside the red line

212
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,800
and throw the scissors at the table.

213
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,790
If you get "100 cash off"

214
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,030
that Cloud Silk and Gauze worth 3,000 cash.

215
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,700
Then you can buy one-bolt gauze with only 2,900 cash.

216
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
On the other hand,

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you can invite up to five friends to help you get discounts.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,790
With one more friend,

219
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,500
you can get one more chance to throw.

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,800
The final price would be 3,000 cash minus

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,200
the total discounts your friends get.

222
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,700
Are you serious?

223
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,800
I have said a lot.

224
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
You have listened for a long time.

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,100
Who would like to try?

226
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Me!

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,700
This Young Lady. You look very kind.

228
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,800
Come and have a try.

229
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I will turn the table and knock the gong.

230
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Then you can throw the scissors.

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Well, come on.

232
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Ready. Go!

233
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
300 cash off.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Young Lady, you helped your friend to buy at 10% off the regular price.

235
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,000
If you want the Cloud Silk and Gauze from our shop,

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,200
you only need use 2,700 cash.

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,000
What about me?

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are helping your friend.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,800
If you want it, you can ask your friends for help.

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
I have four more friends to help me, right?

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
You are totally right.

242
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
What a bargain!

243
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
We will record your final price.

244
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Give the money to Boss Su.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,400
She will give you a receipt.

246
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,200
You can get the Cloud Silk and Gauze on the due day.

247
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I can't get it today.

248
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,300
Not today.

249
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,500
Everyone.

250
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,600
What are you thinking about?

251
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,900
With such good gauze, and such a generous discount,

252
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,200
can't you wait for a few more days?

253
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
It's good enough.

254
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,000
We've saved a lot.

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Boss, this is such an interesting activity.

256
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Do you have a name for it?

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
What's the name for it?

258
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,400
It is called, "Buy Together".

259
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,000
Buy Together.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I heard it for the first time.

261
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
It's interesting.

262
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,400
How can he come up with such a lame trick?

263
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,200
He thinks that people are all greedy for small advantages.

264
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
All right, don't talk any more.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,500
Call your friends to help you.

266
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,400
I want four.

267
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
You are greedy.

268
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
He…

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want that, too.

270
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,900
You b*stard.

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
My dear, put it down.

272
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's buy together.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
Come on.

274
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Darling, let's Buy Together.

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What Buy Together?

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Aim at a bigger discount.

277
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
I will buy you meat buns.

278
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Buy Together?

279
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's go have a look!

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,400
You just helped your friend save 300 cash.

281
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes, they are all my friends.

282
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
We are.

283
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Come on, Er Hu.

284
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,100
Start.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,200
500 cash off.

286
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
Great. Great.

287
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Come on. Congratulations.

288
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
This is the first one.

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
You have four more friends.

290
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Come on. Let's do it, Er Hu.

291
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
500 cash again.

292
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
I am getting dizzy.

293
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
You just got 1,000 cash off.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Well, the third one.

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Start.

296
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
Start.

297
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Help me.

298
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
I will reward you if you get 600 cash off.

299
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Aim at a bigger discount for me.

300
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Come on. Hurry up.

301
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,710
300 cash off.

302
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,600
Aim at a bigger discount for me.

303
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Five times and I will get it for free.

304
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,999
Hurry up. The activity is interesting.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
100 cash off.

306
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,700
Aim at "600 off".

307
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,589
If you aim at it for five times, it will be free.

308
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,300
600 cash off.

309
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,600
The biggest discount.

310
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,100
Buy Together.

311
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I believe you've got your note.

312
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Please come to the shop

313
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,540
at your due day

314
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,000
for your favored Cloud Silk and Gauze.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,300
Ladies and gentlemen, the activity in "Buy Together",

316
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,390
as well as the opening of our cloth shop

317
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,000
is now finished.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Great.

319
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,100
What are you doing?

320
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Who asked you to come?

321
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,999
I don't know what you are talking about.

322
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
I came for the Cloud Silk and Gauze.

323
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
Well.

324
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's your last chance.

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Who asked you to come?

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,500
I told you.

327
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,400
Are you going to tell me or not?

328
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,000
No one.

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Wait, I will tell you.

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,400
Eldest Young Master Wen Xing asked me to come.

331
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
He took me here.

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Then go tell him.

333
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
If he does it again,

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
he will be the next.

335
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Find a doctor for him.

336
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,159
How is it? How much did we lose?

337
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
Don't worry, Father.

338
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,359
Because of the rain, it's normal we suffer loss.

339
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,599
After this, I will ask Wen Xing to help Tan'er.

340
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
We will make it up.

341
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Net profit is more than 15,000 taels.

342
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
No way!

343
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,000
It's the best performance in the history since we opened a new store.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Did you calculate it wrongly?

345
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,200
The opening today wasn't smooth but it was properly solved.

346
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,400
I have sent the Cloud Silk and Gauze Prefect Zhang and Magistrate Xu wanted.

347
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,900
Good.

348
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,700
Tan'er, I will say something harsh.

349
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,000
Although you made a profit today, it was not moral.

350
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Businessmen can chase profit.

351
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,400
But Su Family has always been honest about the price.

352
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,100
You set a higher price to recover the damage.

353
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,200
I know you have your own reasons.

354
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
But it is against our rules.

355
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
It was my idea.

356
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,300
Tan'er had nothing to do with it.

357
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,800
I haven't expected that the gauze she makes can be so good.

358
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
So exquisite.

359
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,079
So, I came up with the idea and set a higher price.

360
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Please forgive me.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
You are still proud of what you did?

362
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,000
You'd ruin the reputation of the Su Family one day.

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,600
We can do the math

364
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
to see if it is a reasonable price.

365
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
The average price is 1,500 cash per bolt.

366
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
It is the same as the original price.

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,700
How did you make it?

368
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,800
It is all about probability.

369
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Jiangning has a population of 210,000.

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If more than one third of them take part in the activity

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
and we divide the turntable into seven parts, then we can get

372
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,400
an average price of 1,500 cash.

373
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,700
It's like a gamble.

374
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,100
But I know people have a tendency

375
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,400
to buy cheap things and join in the fun.

376
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
It was unlikely that I'd lose.

377
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
It's quite interesting.

378
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,600
Some of my friends were asked to "Buy Together" today.

379
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
Since the price is still the same, that means

380
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
they didn't break our rule.

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Tan'er, Ning Yi just came here.

382
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
He doesn't understand many things.

383
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Help him.

384
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
Business can be complicated.

385
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,800
You have to learn from Second Uncle

386
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
and your eldest brother.

387
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,200
Don't be proud.

388
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
I understand.

389
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Okay. It's late.

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,300
Go back and take a rest.

391
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Good night, Grandfather.

392
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,300
Don't worry, Father.

393
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,400
Grandfather loves me.

394
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,100
I am the only son

395
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,200
who knows business in the family.

396
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Su Tan'er is still a woman no matter how capable she is.

397
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,100
Grandfather asked her to learn from me.

398
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
What's wrong, Father?

399
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Get me a bowl of water.

400
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,479
Why?

401
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's check if you are my son.

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,900
How can I have such a stupid son?

403
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
How am I stupid?

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,500
So it's all thanks to Young Master.

405
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,200
The shop would not have been opened successfully.

406
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
You also helped us fight back Second Uncle.

407
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Are you thinking about the roof?

408
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Before the opening, I checked it myself.

409
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,700
There was nothing wrong.

410
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
So, there is only one reason.

411
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
It was Second Uncle.

412
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,200
He did it for the seal.

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They broke the roof

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,400
and today they even gathered some rascals.

415
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a pity that we don't have any evidence.

416
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,300
Evidence?

417
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
That rascal is the evidence.

418
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Moreover, we've found other evidence.

419
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
This is the footprint of Sun Er Hu.

420
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
It's the same as the one in the warehouse.

421
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
He was in a hurry so that he had no time to clean it.

422
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Sure.

423
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,500
Now, he must have cleaned the footprint.

424
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,400
If we take him to grandfather,

425
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
the rascal may fight back and blame us.

426
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
We can just leave him alone for a while.

427
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,000
Sun Er Hu is still in our family.

428
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,500
We can catch him anytime.

429
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,800
Let's wait and see instead of alerting the enemy.

430
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,700
We can use him to pry into Second Uncle.

431
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,200
They won't know about us.

432

Isn't that more interesting?

What do you think?

673
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,200
Grandfather, Ning Yi did well on the shop opening.

00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Please don't kick him out.

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Tan'er, you are so kind. If people know it…

676
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,200
Or... just make him on reflect himself at home for a few days

and study in the School of Male Virtuousness.

678
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,800
All right.

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Then it's decided.

680
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,000

Keep wives away from the kitchen.

694
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
Husbands clean the hall.

695
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,400
Wives don't get up early.

696

Husbands make the soup.

697

This is Ning Yi from the Su Family.

698
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,370
His guilt is so intense that I can't even say it out.

699
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,000
It's indeed really hard tell.

Study now.

703
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,100
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

704
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,800
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

705
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,600
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind.
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

706
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,200
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

707
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,600
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

708
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,200
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

709
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,000
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

710
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

711
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

712
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

713
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

714
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,700
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

715
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫
