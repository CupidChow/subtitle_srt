Get out!

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,810
Holy Master,

6
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,630
I'm afraid we're losing the fortress of Xuanwei Camp.

7
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,690
Holy Master,

8
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,130
East Gate and West Gate have both been occupied by their armies.

9
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,169
Master,

10
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,530
North Gate was lost.

11
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,209
Dong Dao Fu and his vice generals have already entered the city.

12
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,150
Now that they want to die with us, why don't we allow them to?

13
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,090
Gather all our people at the powder magazine.

Dong Dao Fu's army has entered the city.

25

Holy Master has sent a signal to gather all the people at the powder magazine.

26

How could they attack at this time? All right.

Go gather our people!

Yes!

29
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:27,369
Xi Gua, the Holy Master ordered you to go to the powder magazine,

30
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,530
because he wants a cluster suicide.

31

We're about to lose Lin'an. Don't seek your doom.

I have to go, too!

Hurry! Hurry! Open the door!

Get all the gunpowder out!

Let's confront them!

Not bad.

Yes. There was heavy rain.

Fang Tian Lei has no gunpowder to use.

Yes.

After the wedding ceremony, Holy Master asked us to escort Madame

118
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,588
and leave the city in disguise through the South Gate.

119
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,209
I have arranged for her to live in a cottage in the far outskirts of Lin'an.

120
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,609
Some guards were left to serve her.

121
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,750
No one will find out her identity. Don't worry.

122
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,509
So it seems Master has long expected Dong Dao Fu will attack the city.

But since it was already expected,

124

why does it only take some rain,

125
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,629
just a night's rain, to defeat us?

126
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,549
And why did the guards at the South Gate

127
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,370
let us pass so easily?

128

No way.

Are you worried about the Holy Master?

You can remove your worries.

141

Holy Master...

143
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,450
He will come back safely, too.

Why?

147
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,650
So, you work for the Secret Investigation Department?

148
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,770
Am I right?

149
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,249
Yes.

150

Do you know how my father died?

151
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,190
After this battle is finished,

152
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,789
don't go to save the Holy Master,

153

no matter what.

154
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,470
These are all the people you have now.

155
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,309
Don't lose the whole Badao Camp.

156
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,690
From the moment you came to Badao Camp,

157
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,029
you've never said anything true.

158
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:20,110
You lied to me.

159
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,069
Go for ten miles to the east,

160
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,330
you'll see the camp of your enemy.

161
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,190
There's some food behind the camp.

162
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,169
If you steal some,

163
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,369
you won't starve.

164
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,090
Come back!

165
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,729
You address me as "Your Ladyship."

166
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,690
You said I could work for the people.

167
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,749
You said you recognized what I did.

168
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,609
You said you genuinely wanted to help me.

169
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,170
I believed you

170
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,129
because you did a lot of thinking and said so much to me.

171

But is all this fake?

172
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,369
Lin'an cannot go on like this anymore!

173
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,530
The situation in the North is tense.

174
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,789
If they lose this battle in Lin'an, the Wu Dynasty will be done for.

175
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,710
None of my business!

176
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,170
And it has nothing to do with Badao Camp.

177
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,570
It's none of my business, either!

178
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,550
I admit it.

179
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,690
Since I came to the Badao Camp,

180
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:56,330
all that I said was fake.

181
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,129
I did everything for you

182
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,590
to achieve my own purpose.

183
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,369
These things are true.

184
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,290
But my friendship with you

185
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,689
and your buddies

186
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,390
is also true.

187
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,969
In the long history,

188
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,130
there are too many people who rose in revolt like you.

189
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:40,490
I don't want to see you become

190
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,110
one of those cold figures in the history books.

191
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,650
But...

192
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,729
But why you?

193
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:00,150
Ning Yi,

194
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,090
why did you lie to me?

195
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,250
Why do you work for the Secret Investigation Department?

196
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,889
My father...

197
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:16,709
My father was killed by the people from the Secret Investigation Department.

198
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,989
I shall take revenge!

199
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,508
I will avenge his death!

200
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,689
Ning Yi,

201
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,530
I will not forgive you!

202
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,010
I will not forgive you!

203
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,769
Liu Xi Gua.

204
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:54,810
Liu Xi Gua.

205
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,989
Get out!

206
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,029
I will not forgive you.

207
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:26,429
From the moment you come to Badao Camp, you won't have any say.

208
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,090
I want you to be my Army Advisor, so you'll have to be.

209
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,009
I heard you wanted to flee.

210
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,389
What's wrong?

211
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,969
Do you feel wronged being my army advisor?

212
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,250
As long as you do what you promised, I'll give you the whole Badao Camp,

213
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,150
let alone a group of my people.

214
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,470
If you want to call me Xi Gua,

215
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,750
I don't mind it, either.

216
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,730
As long as you are not my enemy, I will be fine with anything.

217
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,769
A'Sha, you protect the army advisor.

218
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,570
He is not good at fighting. Keep him safe.

219
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,230
No matter what happens, you have to send him out of the city.

220
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,869
Ning Yi,

221
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,269
don't let her down!

222
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:18,709
Can you do it?

223
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,870
He can, Aunt.

[Tomb of Lou Shu Heng]

226
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,069
Lady Lou, the cart is overloaded.

227
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,550
We'd better leave this box of books here.

228
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,089
This is the map drawn by Leader Bao.

229
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:32,060
It shows where the outlaws in the Wu Dynasty are hiding.

230
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,888
Keep it.

231
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,300
Yes.

232
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,060
Come and load the cart.

233
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,430
[Lin'an]

234
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,129
Dong Dao Fu has eliminated all eight camps of bandits.

235
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:59,609
Holy Master Fang Tian Lei was taken alive.

236
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,510
Lin'an has become peaceful again.

237
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,280

239
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,168
Great, great!

240
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:19,690
Move! Move! Make way!

241
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,410
Serves you right!

242
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,970
This is what you deserve.

243
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,400
Finally! Relief!

244
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,809
Take your medicine.

245
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:39,710
You're welcome.

246
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,140
Heat this medicine with three bowls of water and condense it into one bowl.

247
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,260
Kneel down!

248
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,548
General,

249
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:18,369
the bandits around the city have all been eliminated or captured.

250
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,768
The leader of the bandits, Fang Tian Lei, has been captured.

251
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:21,389
He has been put in prison.

252
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:24,429
After I check all the gunpowder and weapons, we're ready to return to the capital.

253
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,990
Good.

254
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,189
What about the gunpowder?

255
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:31,049
Thanks to the rainproof lining, the black powder, and the gunfire

256
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,589
in the grain hopper have been preserved intact.

257
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,270
That's great!
[Badao Camp]

258

[Wude Camp]

259

[Badao Camp]

260
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,360
Fathe, we only became the richest people here for one day.

261
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,090
How about you borrow 30 cash from Tan'er?

262
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,768
Let's use it to pay for the buns first.

263
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,889
I don't want to. It's embarrassing.

264
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:10,849
At that time, we even told him we were the Su family from Jiangning.

265
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,909
How humiliating it would be if people knew it!

266
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,349
Well, we can go together.

267
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,928
I can't tell you what to do now, can I?

268
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:19,508
General Dong, Lord Commander.

269
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:22,069
Don't mind the courtesy. Go back to your work.

270
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,950
Soldiers!

271
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,068
These guys are the ones who saved Lin'an. They're our heroes.

272
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:37,429
Please don't. Don't call us like that!

273
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,590
We'll feel embarrassed.

274
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,068
Yes, you flattered us.

275
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,250
Just call us warriors.

276
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,008
Warriors have always been praised since ancient times.

277
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,388
Now we should praise the courage of scholars.

278
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:48,688
Yes, it's a pity that we even missed Brother Ning's wedding.

279
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,980
Yes, yes, yes.

280
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,329
Go back to work, please.

281
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:56,980
General, come on and take a look! The plaque has been hung up.

282
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,429
Wude Camp.

283
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,269
Great.

284
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,569
Since the Wu Dynasty's Army came to Lin'an,

285
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,750
the security and order of Lin'an have basically been restored now.

286
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,090
Brother Ning, that is to say, your whole family is

287
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,800
living under the nose of the bandits, yet they are still safe and sound.

288
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,128
And you even came up with the idea to cover yourselves up,

289
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:24,190
deceive everybody, and help me take back the city.

290
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,729
Yes.

291
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:28,850
Now that I think about it, it's quite incredible!

292
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,330
When your army broke into the gates, I did have some concern.

293
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,890
Before this, Lady Lu said

294
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,089
you failed in the siege of the powder magazine.

295
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:41,068
Your identity was almost exposed.

296
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:45,730
I was kind of uncertain about today's attack.

297
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,010
But in the end, I still chose to believe the person entrusted by Old Qin.

298
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,949
General, come on.

299
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:54,169
Allow me to introduce you.

300
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,429
This is my wife, Su Tan'er.

301
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,629
Tan'er, this is General Dong.

302
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,770
Greetings to General Dong.

303
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:09,810
Miss Xiao Chan also contributed greatly to this battle.

304
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,249
Yes, of course.

305
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,408
You've seen these four heroes.

306
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:17,500
Like me, they are also matrilocal husbands.

307
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,230
Nephew-in-law.

308
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,308
I see.

309
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:24,208
Lady Lu is not only the elite of the Secret Investigation Department,

310
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,909
but also my martial arts teacher。

311
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:26,709
I feel sorry.

312
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:31,250
Without Lady Lu, I would have died many times.

313
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,729
Yes, yes, I am...

314
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:33,809
These are the people that

315
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:34,710
I should introduce you to.

316
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,068
That's pretty much all about it.

317
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:39,328
General Dong, your time is valuable.

318
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,810
Okay.

319
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,989
I've met all the heroes.

320
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:47,669
What I can't understand is you only have ten people in total.

321
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,588
How did you do it?

322
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:51,348
That's a long story.

323
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:54,760
We shall start from the very beginning of this mission.

324
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,790
It's empty.

325
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,529
Oh, no.

326
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,909
This is a trap.

327
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,310
Let's go.

328
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,588
We had planned everything that time, yet the gunpowder was gone.

329
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:12,028
After that, we presumed that after the assassination, Fang Tian Lei

330
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:16,270
had transferred all gunpowder and weapons.

331
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,149
Under the name of the Holy Master, now I order you two get married.

332
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,889
The wedding ceremony will be held on the day after tomorrow.

333
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:24,569
I killed a leader of the bandits, Bao Wen Han.

334
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,610
Accidentally, I was ordered to marry Liu Xi Gua.

335
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,149
At that time, there were only three days remaining

336
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:33,068
before Master Qin would come to take the city.

337
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:36,028
I'm well aware that Fang Tian Lei wouldn't trust me.

338
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:38,208
The marriage must be for something else.

339
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:41,680
So I could only go with his plan.

340
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,068
I asked my teacher to follow Fang Tian Lei

341
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:49,029
and Zheng Biao, the man in charge of the powder magazine.

342
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:53,560
We found that they hid the gunpowder in the granary.

343
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,290
How about it?

344
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,588
There was too much gunpowder.

345
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:07,589
It would be impossible for just the few of us

346
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,049
to transfer the gunpowder.

347
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:12,780
I then came up with a plan with my wife.

348
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,089
My dear. This is the grain hopper that the bandits used to store the gunpowder.

349
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:22,249
I want you to help me make some waterproof linings.

350
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:25,149
Make sure that the linings fit perfectly

351
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,509
with the inner wall of the grain hopper and each peck of gunpowder

352
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:30,669
so they will not go bad even if soaked in water.

353
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,229
That's all?

354
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:37,128
Yes.

355
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:38,789
So simple?

356
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,429
It's not simple, my dear.

357
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:43,208
It's critical. You have to be very careful with it.

358
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,329
Black powder will spoil when it touches water.

359
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,430
If the gunpowder becomes useless, it could affect

360
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,789
the safety of the civilians of the Wu Dynasty.

361
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:50,989
I know.

362
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,009
But it's still simple.

363
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,268
Shall we make a bet?

364
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:56,308
If a box of gunpowder is soaked in water,

365
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:59,900
I'll do all the cooking from now on.

366
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,720
I believe in you, my dear.

367
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,220
For the next few days, we have to work around the clock.

368
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,520
Now, I'll teach you how to make waterproof cloth.

369
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,429
This is the formula.

370
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,490
Pass it around.

371
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,050
The paint should be mixed evenly.

372
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:32,150
Check it thoroughly.

373
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,450
Use more paint.

374
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,989
Fang Tian Lei had invited all eight camps to my wedding.

375
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:41,828
He was luring me to send information out to you.

376
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:42,989
Because there would be a weak defense,

377
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:45,268
we could use this opportunity to attack the city.

378
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:46,229
But in fact,

379
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:49,149
that night was a good opportunity to deal with the powder magazine.

380
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,868
I asked them to take advantage of this ceremony,

381
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:55,028
and go to the granary with the waterproof linings when they changed shifts,

382
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:58,788
and pad every grain hopper with the lining.

383
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,750
Then we made some holes in the roof.

384
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,429
Slow down, Father.

385
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,548
Slow down.

386
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,370
Be careful, Father.

387
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,868
These kids are so rude.

388
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:27,729
They don't have any respect for the old.

389
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,950
Nor do they know how to love children.

390
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,229
My son,

391
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,550
you should recognize the reality.

392
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,309
You are too old to be called young.

393
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,530
You're not young anymore.

394
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,469
Father,

395
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:41,690
in your heart, I'll always be a child.

396
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,508
Well. It's so dangerous here.

397
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,629
Let's do it quickly.

398
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,390
You're right.

399
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,649
Here, Father, take this.

400
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:48,980
Come on.

401
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,349
Father, hold them tight.

402
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,609
Father.

403
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:55,809
By the way, Gao.

404
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,109
Brother Ning specifically instructed us not to

405
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,008
lay water-proof cloth in those boxes by the door.

406
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,749
No worries. I got it.

407
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:03,469
Father, take my hands. Grab my hands, Father.

408
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,730
When the big rain came, it looked like there was a flood.

409
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,469
Why are there so many holes in this roof?

410
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:23,648
Holy Master.

411
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,348
The drains are all blocked.

412
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,749
Fang Tian Lei thought all the gunpowder was soaked in water

413
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,308
and couldn't be used anymore.

414
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:30,990
Before they had time to check it carefully,

415
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,850
General Dong then attacked the granary.

416
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,520
He could only finish the fight against General Dong.

417
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,069
General Dong. We were not introduced by him.

418
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:47,770
I am Su Zhong Kan, the second master of the Su family.

419
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,630
This is my son, Wen Xing.

420
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,360
We're the ones who came up with this excellent plan.

421
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,290
Apart from that, we used to test the feasibility of this plan.

422
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,750
It always works. It's absolutely feasible.

423
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,089
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:04,229
How dare you say that.

425
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:05,470
You finally admitted it now.

426
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,769
It was all because of you.

427
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,788
My lady lost all the Cloud Gauze in the storage.

428
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,208
And it almost delayed the opening of the cloth store.

429
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,370
All thanks to the Young Master.

430
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,948
Xiao Chan, that's not fair.

431
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:18,969
Yeah. That was ages ago.

432
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:23,469
- Chan'er, you need… you need to let go of it.
- That's right.

433
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:28,710
Uncle and cousin used this to fool the enemy.

434
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,510
They've made amends for their fault.

435
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,968
Tan'er is quite right!

436
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:34,480
Yes, yes.

437
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,660
General, sorry you have to see this.

438
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,150
After that, Lady Lu asked me to attack the city when the rain fell.

439
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,029
At that time I was extremely puzzled.

440
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:46,750
Why could we only attack the city after the rain fell?

441
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,769
Now I finally understand it.

442
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,768
You were protecting the gunpowder magazine under the guise of holding a wedding ceremony.

443
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:53,788
Yes.

444
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:57,809
Only in that way would Fang Tian Lei know that he had lost all of his advantages.

445
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:00,930
Only then would they fight to the death against you.

446
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,928
The Wu Dynasty is lucky to have you as the commander of the Secret Investigation Department.

447
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,090
General, you flatter me.

448
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,989
Lady Lu, the captivity name-list

449
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,689
didn't mention anything about the adopted daughter of Fang Tian Lei.

450
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,968
Yes, her people in Badao Camp have been quite chivalrous and righteous,

451
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,389
and they were good to the people.

452
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,090
The Secret Investigation Division has offered amnesty and enlistment to them.

453
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,230
If they're really like what you said,

454
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,809
we can try to persuade her into working for the Secret Intelligence Division. That's great!

455
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,550
It's just she is the adopted daughter of Fang.

456
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,910
I'm afraid she will cause more trouble.

457
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,588
Don't worry, General Dong. I will deal with it.

460
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:07,070
Dong Dao Fu, if you still want to get something out of my mouth,

461
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,150
I suggest you forget about it.

462
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,209
I am just doing my part as a comrade. I mean nothing else.

463
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:17,930
You'll be questioned by someone else.

464
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,968
Ning Yi, I will rip you apart!

465
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,168
You bastard! Answer my questions!

466
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:44,049
What did you do to Xi Gua? Where is she now?

467
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:48,789
Badao Camp is still safe.

468
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,889
They should be hiding somewhere in the mountains.

469
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,510
There is no need to worry.

470
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,789
I came here today to ask you a few questions.

471
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,170
What a coincidence! I also have a few for you.

472
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,230
Did someone tell you to attack Lin'an?

473
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,109
Yes.

474
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:20,309
Did you come here to prevent the army from heading north?

475
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,109
Yes.

476
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,469
How did you know that there would be a downpour this morning?

477
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:32,770
Well,

478
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,509
I didn't actually.

479
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:40,329
Lin'an has a lot of rainfall. I was just waiting.

480
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,408
Waiting?

481
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,289
I was waiting for the rain.

482
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:47,729
The rain was the signal to attack Lin'an.

483
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,670
So, I'm doomed.

484
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,750

Dong Dao Fu also asked me this.

My answer is still the same.

490
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:17,029
If I don't tell you, what can you do to me?

491

Just leave, Ning Yi.

00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,309
The Secret Investigation Department cooperated from the inside with the people outside.

500
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:18,469
Commander Ning Li Heng carried out an excellent plan

501
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:21,949
to make Fang Tian Lei, the head of the bandits, fail to use the gunpowder.

502
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:26,529
They've not only kept the people of Lin'an safe but also won the time to take back the city.

503
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,429
On Sept. 19th, the fifth year of Jinghan's reign, Lin'an was recovered.

504
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:34,610
Fang Tian Lei, the head of the bandits, was captured alive.

505
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,668
Minister, there is something that's been troubling me.

506
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:47,329
I think if Fang Tian Lei comes to the capital, he will cause you trouble.

507
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:51,750
Do you want me to send someone to kill him instead?

508
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,750
No need.

509
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,289
Once Lin'an is taken,

510
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:00,408
Fang Tian Lei will become useless.

511
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:03,389
How much trouble can he cause?

512
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:08,789
Let him be. I have more important things to do.

513
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,090
Minister He,

514
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,730
His Majesty wants to see you.

515
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,348
His Majesty ordered Dong Dao Fu to lead 100,000 troops due south.

516
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,549
Lin'an had been recovered. The bandits had been eliminated.

517
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:31,428
Fang Tian Lei, the head of the bandits and his followers were all arrested.

518
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:34,368
They would be executed in a few days. This was the moment for celebration.

519
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:36,309
This is a dynasty with all the people of one mind.

520
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:39,789
Great. Excellent.

521
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,469
God bless! Great!

522
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:55,830
Now Bo Yong is in good health.

523
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,010
And Tan'er and Ning Yi will be back soon, too.

524
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,389
I... I'm going to the temple to offer prayers.

525
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:05,749
You should stay home. Maybe they'll be back in a minute.

526
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,349
That's right.

527
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,648
Well. Then I'll prepare some food and drinks that they like.

528
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:12,930
We'll give them a warm welcome.

529
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,269
Yeah, that's right.

530
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:15,769
Let's go.

531
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,529
Father, look.

532
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,970
This is our family's cloth store.

533
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,669
Look at you!

534
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:59,089
Look. The eighth branch of Zhu Restaurant.

535
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:03,170
In the blink of an eye, so many stores have been opened.

536
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,529
I really didn't expect that we would come back alive.

537
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,909
Well, I am really starting to miss my wife.

538
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:18,389
The days that we can argue and fight were so great.

539
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:21,170
Yet I didn't cherish them.

540
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:25,509
I wonder if my wife is in good health now.

541
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:29,130
We left here so long ago, yet we didn't even bring any gifts.

542
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,409
The husband's safe return is enough to comfort his wife.

543
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:37,749
Now that you came back safely, this could be the greatest gift to your wives.

544
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:39,810
Good for you, Shen Miao.

545
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:45,209
After this trip to Lin'an, your insights into love have grown.

546
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,248
People who've experienced life and death will change their opinions about earthly life.

547
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,849
What are you doing?

548
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,810
I think we are still dreaming.

549
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,988
Shut up! Close your mouth!

550
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:03,689
Elder Master. Elder Master.

551
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:07,028
Elder Master. Lady and Young Master have come back!

552
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:10,928
Excellent! Excellent!

553
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,689
Let's go!

554
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,350
[Su Manor]

555
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,530
Mother.

556
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,689
I've missed you so much!

557
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:35,048
I've looked forward to your return all this time. You're finally back!

558
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:37,229
- Was it a tiring journey?
- No!

559
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:38,668
- Did you get hurt on the way?
- Grandfather!

560
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:41,369
I'm great! We're okay. Don't worry about us.

561
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:42,449
Father!

562
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:44,108
Grandfather! Grandfather!

563
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,929
Father! Father!

564
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,290
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

565
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:44,120
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

566
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,820
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

567
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,360
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

568
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:58,700
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

569
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,460
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

570
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,270
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

571
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:13,150
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

572
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,220
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

573
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,590
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

574
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,510
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

575
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,990
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

576
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,930
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

577
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,390
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

578
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:39,340
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

579
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,770
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

580
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:46,790
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

581
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,190
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

582
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,140
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

583
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,500
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon

584
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,550
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,890
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫
