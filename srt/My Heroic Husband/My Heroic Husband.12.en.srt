[Episode 12]

3
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,700
You want this silk because of the tributary cloth, right?

4
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,800
If you are willing to break the contract with the Wus,

5
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
I can not only pay the penalty to you,

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,200
but also increase the price to 15 times of the original one.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,600
But I already signed the contract with Young Master Wu.

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
As a businessman, I always keep my word,

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
which is as good as gold.

10
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Young Master Ning, don't worry.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
If I can cooperate with Young Master Ning,

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,700
my promise will be even better than gold.

13
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,000
Good.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
Please send my word to other silk merchants.

15
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,100
They can find me

16
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,400
if they have similar intentions.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Okay.

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
I can buy all the silk they have.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay.

Father, it's done.

25
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,600
I have gotten all the silk orders of Dachuan's Cloth Store.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Ning Yi will have no silk to sell.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
He'll sell those preserved eggs

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
for the rest time of his life.

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,100
Father, why don't you ask me

30
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,000
about the silk price I offered?

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
We're profitable

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
even its price is twenty times of the original one.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
You can be let loose

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
since we're sure that nothing is wrong about the silk.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
As your father, I trust you.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,400
Everyone, now, the silk price has increased greatly.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
We can't let the Wus enjoy the huge profits alone.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,100
- You're right.
- But will Boss Ning keep his words?

40
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,800
What if he doesn't admit it after we break the contract?

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,500
It's something we should worry about.

43
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,600
But are you happy to see

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
the Wus threatened us to sell the silk at its cost price

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
by making use of Commandant Song?

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,600
But we'd better have a good talk with Young Master Wu.

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
We can't break the contract unilaterally.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Right, right, right.

49

Master. Master!

50

Dachuan's Cloth Store signed the contract with the Wus!

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,200
Boss Xue sold his silk to the Wus

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,300
at the price of 3500 cash per bolt.

53

3500 cash?

54
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,900
Xue Jin is just a boss of a cloth store.

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Unlike us, he has never reeled any silk.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
He can make profit from the silk order.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Why should we live under the pressure of the Wus?

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
No way! I'll be the first one to quit. Let's go find him.

Even if you want to bleed us dry.

Now, the silk price has increased greatly.

You just paid a 50% deposit down on the silk

then we'll be convinced by you.

Right, you should explain to us.

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
Brother Wu, you're a clever man.

170
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,900
I'll just be honest with you.

171
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
They said you've made a good deal recently.

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I also want to join you.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't expect the news would spread so quickly.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Brother Wu, take it easy.

175
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Several young masters who are close to me told me.

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
They run money shops and casino business.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
So naturally, the news spread much more quickly.

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,800
Brother Su, what will you provide to have a deal with me?

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Brother Wu, I know you don't care about these,

180
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,600
but it's truly all the savings we have.

181
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
Brother Wu, rest assured.

182
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,000
You can take most of the profit.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
We only need 10% of the profit.

184
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,300
Brother Su, you're so generous.

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,400
How dare I be greedy when I cooperate with you?

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Think about it.

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,300
If it weren't for Ning Yi,

188
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,600
we wouldn't have gotten into such a plight.

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,800
We have the same enemy now.

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,600
If we join hands,

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,800
we can help you watch him, right?

192
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Thank you for your guidance and support.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I will do what you say in the future.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,400
Brother Su, you're making fun of me.

195
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,200
Please.

196
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay.

197
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Jing defeated Liang's defenders.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,500
The capital of Liang was overwhelmed

199
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
and annexed by Jing.

200
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,800
The result has been settled.

201
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,000
[Wu Dynasty]

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
[Nourish the Heart Pavillion]

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Your Majesty.

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
Why are you so flustered?

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
The troops of Jing defeated the capital of Liang yesterday.

206
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Liang has been occupied.

207
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Summon the Left Prime Minister, Li Gang.

208
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Minister of Defense, Tan Chen.

209
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
General Dong Dao Fu.

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,300
Tan Chen and General Dong are waiting outside the palace.

211
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,800
Well... as for Left Prime Minister Li…

212
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
What's wrong with Prime Minister Li?

213
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
When he received the battlefield report,

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,800
he went to Jiangning at top speed.

215
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,300
Jiangning?

216
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,400
How dare you break into the Right Chancellor Qin's Mansion?

217
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm the Left Prime Minister.

218
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll cut your heads down if you dare to stop me.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Get out of my face!

220
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,800
Right Prime Minister Qin, I, Li Gang,

221
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
respectfully invite you to return to the capital.

222
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Left Prime Minister Li?

223
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,300
You rode for the whole night?

224
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
When I got the report that Liang was occupied yesterday,

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,600
I came here as fast as I could.

226
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Right Prime Minister Qin, His Majesty has urged you to return to the post several times.

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Why don't you come back?

228
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
We've prepared for eight years.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's the best chance to recover the north regions.

230
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,900
No. You must come back with me today.

231
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Otherwise, I won't leave you.

232
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,000
We haven't seen each other for years.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,600
You're still so short-tempered.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,400
It's been a long and tiring trip.

235
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,600
Here.

236
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
Taste the minced port porridge with preserved eggs.

237
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,800
Have a seat.

238
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,500
What is preserved egg?

239
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,700
Look what we are facing!

240
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
I don't want to eat it at all.

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,300
Right Prime Minister Qin, how long are you going to wait?

242
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,800
If you keep waiting, I'm afraid that the tributaries will have been prepared for Jing.

243
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
No hurry. Calm down.

244
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,200
I also got the news yesterday.

245
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,500
Today, I'm going to set off.

246
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
But before that, I need to see someone.

247
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,000
I have asked someone to invite him over.

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Brother Li, eat the porridge first.

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
No rush.

250
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
Please.

251
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,300
You're really a slow coach.

252
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,600
In the whole Wu Dynasty,

253
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
only you can keep your equanimity.

254
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,400
The porridge is not hot!

255
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Right Prime Minister Qin,

256
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,600
did you know that I came here in person?

257
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,100
Brother Li, just taste it.

258
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,500
How does it taste?

259
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,000
This black stuff tastes good.

260
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
It's quite delicious.

261
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,700
Well, have more.

262
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,800
You'll know it.

263
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
- Have a taste.
- Try it.

264
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
- And this.
- Right.

265
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,500
It was just invented.

266
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
Brother Shen, taste it.

267
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Come on.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And this one.

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
It was invented by Brother Feng.

270
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,000
It doesn't look good.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
The soybean with preserved egg is good, too.

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,100
Taste it.

273
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
It was cooked just now.

274
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
- And this one.
- Where is my sister-in-law?

275
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Tan'er? I just bought some books.

276
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,900
She's helping me gather them up at home. She'll come here in a minute.

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,800
You two are really sweet.

278
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,600
It would be nice to be a matrilocal husband like you.

279
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,800
We wouldn't sell preserved eggs

280
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,400
if we could be a matrilocal husband like you.

281
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
We still need to do business.

282
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Come, let's drink.

283
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
- Come on.
- Here.

284
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Come on.

285
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,600
Boss Nie,

286
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,100
how's the restaurant going recently?

287
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,200
It's going well.

288
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400
I have asked them to advertise the Zhu Ji Club.

289
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
According to your requirements,

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
whoever joins the Zhu Ji Club,

291
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,400
should write a preference design.

292
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,000
Ning, it's such a good idea.

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
It called…

294
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,500
what it's called again…

295
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,800
big data analysis.

296
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,700
Exactly.

297
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
Thanks to this big data analysis,

298
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
we can recommend products to them

299
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
according to guests' preferences.

300
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,400
And we're going to provide home delivery service.

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
If delivery service can be popularized–

302
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Who is Ning Yi?

303
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
I am.

304
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
No, no.

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
No.

306
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Someone wants to see you.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
- Come with us.
- Hey!

308
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,329
- Who are you?
- Yes.

309
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,600
Don't worry.

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,700
I'll be back soon.

311
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Ask Tan'er to wait for me

312
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,400
if she comes later.

313
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
But… No, no, Brother Ning.

314
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,100
- Brother Ning.
- Brother Ning.

315
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
- What's wrong?
- Miss Nie.

316
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Brother Ning was taken away.

317
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Did he offend some officials?

318
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
Is it about the silk?

319
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,200
[Qin Manor]

320
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,400
Your Lordship, he has arrived.

321
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Sorry, everyone.

322
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,100
I'm late.

323
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,400
Brother Ning was taken away by two mysterious men with swords.

324
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Taken away?

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
When?

326
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Just now.

327
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Boss Su, don't worry.

328
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Young Master Ning. Maybe he–

329
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,800
- No.
- Sister-in-law.

330
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Sister-in-law.

331
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,000
You're going the wrong way!

332
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,800
I guess you didn't have any ill intentions,

333
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,000
but it's not proper to invite me

334
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,800
in this kind of way.

335
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
How dare you!

336
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,000
Our Lordship is the Prime Minister.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,700
Watch your language!

338
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
It doesn't matter.

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Ning Yi and I are close friends.

340
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Leave now.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Master Qin?

342
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Young friend, did they scare you?

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
These two guys are in some special outfit.

344
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,200
The pattern on the belt is not simple, either.

345
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
I think that the one who invited me over

346
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
is not ordinary.

347
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
But I didn't know it was you.

348
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,400
I have long known you're not ordinary.

349
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
But I didn't know that you're the Right Prime Minister.

350
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,300
No wonder Commissioner Han begged

351
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
me to pass on the visiting letter to you.

352
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
Husband!

353
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,300
Who are you? Stop.

354
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
How dare you break into the house without permission?

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,100
Do you know where this is?

356
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,400
I don't care.

357
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Let my husband go.

358
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Husband!

359
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Wife?

360
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,100
Husband!

361
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,400
Let me go.

362
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Master Qin, there must be some misunderstanding here.

363
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Let her go.

364
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, Wifey,

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
aren't you a little bit offensive?

366
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,300
You... aren't you in danger?

367
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,300
No.

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,600
Master Qin, let me introduce.

369
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,800
She is my wife, Su Tan'er.

370
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,400
I mentioned her to you before,

371
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,800
and this is Master Qin.

372
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
He is the Right Prime Minister

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,700
and also my friend.

374
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Boss Su, I've heard a lot about you.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,300
Ning Yi told me before that you're

376
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,700
not as normal as those women,

377
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,700
and you're an ambitious woman.

378
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,300
Prime Minister Qin, I'm flattered.

379
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,800
I…

380
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
Broke into your manor

381
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
because I worried about my husband too much.

382
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Yes, yes.

383
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,500
No offense.

384
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,800
It's okay. Calm down.

385
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Put them back. Put back.

386
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,200
Husband,

387
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
I just remembered that

388
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,600
I was cutting the fruit at home and I haven't finished it yet.

389
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
So, I have to leave now.

390
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Goodbye.

391
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,300
Goodbye.

392
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm going to cut the fruit.

393
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
Be careful not to cut your hands.

394
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,500
My body has been short of vitamins lately.

395
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,400
So I asked her to cut some fruit for me.

396
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Your wife is quite funny.

397
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,300
Come on, young friend,

398
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,000
please drink a cup of tea.

399
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Come on.

400
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,700
Sure.

401
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Enjoy the tea.

402
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Just act like what we did in playing Go.

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,900
Make yourself at home.

404
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,400
I never know how to restrain myself.

405
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Even you are the Right Prime Minister.

406
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Isn't the tea still the same as before?

407
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Few people at your age

408
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,100
would have such a temper.

409
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,800
But I'm still confused about one thing.

410
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,200
You, as the Right Prime Minister,

411
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,000
why do you stay in a small city like Jiangning?

412
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,800
It's a long story.

413
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,200
[Four years ago]

414
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
Report.

415
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,500
Right Prime Minister Qin, the court said that the army provisions have been cut off.

416
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,600
Please withdraw troops and go back to the court right now.

417
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,200
We have victory in hand.

418
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
But now army provisions are cut off.

419
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Is the Wu Dynasty destined to fall?

420
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,800
Everyone, I'm useless.

421
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm uncertain how many odds we have in the war.

422
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,600
I want to ask you

423
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,400
if you have the determination to fight to the end?

424
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
Crush the enemy!

425
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
I shall accept death!

426
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Crush the enemy!

427
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,100
I shall accept death!

428
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,500
Crush the enemy!

429
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,000
I shall accept death!

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Crush the enemy!

431
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,800
I shall accept death!

432
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Crush the enemy!

433
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,800
I shall accept death!

434
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Crush the enemy!

435
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Our troops had fought day and night

436
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,900
even when we didn't have the army provisions,

437
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,500
but we could not compete with the Liang's troops

438
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,000
and came to a total defeat.

439
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
The Minister negotiated with Liang.

440
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,600
As a loser, I couldn't change the result.

441
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,800
I had to agree with Liang

442
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,900
and sign the Heshui Alliance.

443
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,000
Every year, we need to offer tributary coins

444
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,300
and cloth to them

445
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,300
as well as countless salt and iron.

446
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,610
[Wu]

447
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's hard to imagine such a heavy past

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
was buried in your heart.

449
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,600
It's the bygones.

450
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,000
I should forget it.

451
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
I saw many horses and carriages

452
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
in front of the door just now.

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,700
And you asked me here so urgently.

454
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,600
Are you going to the capital?

455
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes.

456
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
His Majesty has summoned me for days.

457
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,200
And now is the best time.

458
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Are you waiting for the time when Jing defeated Liang

459
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,600
so that one threat was removed?

460
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,400
And then by the time Jing recovers his national strength,

461
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,000
you'll pour forward and recover the lost territory in the north

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,900
to make up for your loss?

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
Liang has a lot of troubles already.

464
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
It's just a matter of time before its collapse.

465
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,400
But Master Qin, are you sure you will

466
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
persuade the Emperor into dispatching troops?

467
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,200
I have to try it.

468
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,100
According to our military strength, will we be able to win?

469
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,400
I won't reply to the summon and go back to the court

470
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,800
if I'm not totally sure about it.

471
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Since you are so confident

472
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,100
and asked me here urgently before you leave Jiangning,

473
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,700
it is not just for a cup of tea

474
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,500
or playing Go with you, right?

475
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Do you plan to take me to do some business in the capital?

476
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,000
Like we can cooperate with each other?

477
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,500
Young friend Ning, I've been observing you for a long time.

478
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
It's a waste of your talent

479
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,600
to be a mere matrilocal husband in Jiangning

480
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,200
since you're a capable man.

481
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
I want to ask

482
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,300
do you have an ambition to be a courtier?

483
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,700
To be a courtier?

484
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,000
The threshold of entering the court is reduced to this now?

485
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,600
I've never been wrong.

486
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,100
I've said so.

487
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
You're underestimating yourself

488
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
if you refuse me.

489
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
I dare not.

490
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,400
But I have never been a courtier before.

491
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,300
I don't know how to be a courtier, either.

492
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,400
People won't think I'm reliable

493
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
if you promote me directly.

494
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Who else would listen to my words?

495
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,600
You don't have to have them listen to you.

496
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
The plans you provide me

497
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,200
are for our country and the world.

498
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
When you arrive in the capital,

499
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,900
what you need to do

500
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,300
is not as simple as

501
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,500
improving a cloth store or a business market.

502
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,000
If we join hands,

503
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,500
maybe we can change the Wu Dynasty eventually.

504
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,000
Thanks for your appreciation.

505
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,500
To be honest,

506
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,000
the first time I played Go with you,

507
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,800
I just went through my ups and downs.

508
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,300
But as for the future,

509
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,600
what I should do and what I should not do

510
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
are still uncertain.

511
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
During the time I lived in Jiangning,

512
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm gradually interested in this place.

513
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,100
I now have the thing I'm concerned about,

514
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,300
and the people I cared about.

515
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,200
Everyone has his own ambition.

516
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
Master Qin, you're concerned about all the people and the country.

517
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,600
But I…

518
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm just an ordinary merchant.

519
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
In my heart,

520
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,500
there is only trivial stuff like business.

521
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,600
I can only be a mere matrilocal husband

522
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
somewhere here in Jiangning.

523
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
I feel at ease here.

524
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
But...

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I've failed to live up to your expectation.

526
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,500
Young friend Ning,

527
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,500
you love someone.

528
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,000
So, you regard Su's Mansion as your world.

529
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,950
Forget it.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,600
I've known your answer.

531
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm leaving now.

532
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,000
Take this cup of tea

533
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,400
as a farewell.

534
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,000
Master Qin, take care.

535
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,400
I hope I can play Go

536
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
with you in the capital one day.

537
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,700
I hope it's just about the Go.

538
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,000
I have nothing to give you.

539
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,300
If you are in trouble some day,

540
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,700
you might use this to help you.

541
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
Thanks, Master Qin.

542
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,800
He is the matrilocal husband you said?

543
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,200
Don't look down upon him.

544
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,500
Someday, we may need him.

545
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,520
[Qin]

546
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
When did you make friends with the Prime Minister?

547
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,300
You didn't even tell me.

548
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
I didn't know he is the Right Prime Minister

549
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,700
when I knew him.

550
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
And without him,

551
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,800
Su Wen Xing wouldn't let go of the silk.

552
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,700
So, he is the friend you said.

553
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,600
I even rushed to his mansion with a knife.

554
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,900
I was so embarrassed.

555
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
Tan'er you just realized that?

556
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,900
Why did you act so weird today?

557
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,400
Why were you

558
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,800
so worried about me today?

559
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,300
I... I wasn't…

560
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
You weren't?

561
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,900
was afraid that you would disgrace the Sus.

562
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
Disgrace?

563
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
Why are you looking at me?

564
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm not.

565
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,800
You are looking right at me!

566
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
Stop laughing.

567
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't want to see your face now.

568
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,900
Go back to your room.

569
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,800
Okay.

570
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,900
I guess you're not afraid now.

571
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Then I'll move back.

572
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,900
It's up to you.

573
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,500
I'm really going back?

574
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600
Seriously.

575
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,100
Fine.

576
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,900
I was quite uncomfortable when I slept here anyway.

577
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,700
Wu Qi Hao borrowed enough money from the underground money shop.

578
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,200
I sent the money to him.

579
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
At that time, we can gain some profit from

580
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,300
the tributary cloth business with him.

581
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,600
Since we lost to Tan'er and Ning Yi,

582
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,200
I've been reflecting on myself.

583
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
I was too careless before,

584
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,500
so I always got myself into Ning Yi's traps.

585
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,600
Father, don't worry.

586
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,000
It will never happen again.

587
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,800
Heroine.

588
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,100
Heroine.

589
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,700
It's me, me.

590
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,500
I brought some dishes for you.

591
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
No need to watch.

592
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
I checked before I came.

593
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
No one is here.

594
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,100
How is your wound?

595
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,200
Fine.

596
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,800
I'll just put them here.

597
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Remember to eat.

598
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
You can leave here now.

599
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
You know how to speak?

600
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Amazing!

601
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
What… What's your name?

602
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,400
Right, yeah.

603
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,200
It's impolite to ask a heroine's name.

604
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,000
You need to hide your name in such a world.

605
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,100
But… where did you learn your marital arts?

606
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
None of your business.

607
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
It is none of my business,

608
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,900
but I saved your life.

609
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,600
Aren't the people who are chivalrous

610
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
all grateful?

611
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
No need.

612
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
Fine.

613
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Heroine,

614
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,600
I'm so curious about…

615
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,500
when you selected this road.

616
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,400
Did your family support you?

617
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,300
Did you practice martial arts very hard when you were little?

618
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,400
Did your teacher always beat you?

619
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,600
Did your father support you being an assassin?

620
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,100
Is it extremely risky to be an assassin?

621
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,000
Does your mother always cook some soups for you,

622
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
cook some soups for you,

623
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
like the medicinal liquor?

624
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,900
Do you want to marry someone

625
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,200
and stay with him for the rest of your life?

626
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,400
You…

627
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm sorry.

628
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,900
I'm being too talkative.

629
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,200
Fine, these… these questions are too private.

630
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
It's normal if you don't want to answer me.

631
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Well… but you should tell me

632
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,500
why you assassinated Song Xian.

633
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,800
He must die.

634
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,500
Song Xian is a wretch

635
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,600
who rapes girls and commit all manner of crimes.

636
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,800
I learned martial arts to bring justice to this world.

637
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Since I know the despicable things he did,

638
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,900
I can't just stand and watch it.

639
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,300
Although we insist that we can't tell it to someone else,

640
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,400
you saved my life.

641
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
Don't be so surprised.

642
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm not surprised by the reason why you assassinated Song Xian.

643
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm surprised how could you speak so much in one breath?

644
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,700
Heroine,

645
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,000
can you teach me martial arts?

646
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,100
I want to be a hero, too.

647
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
You wish.

648
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,300
Why?

649
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
A hero won't be that talkative.

650
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,200
Eat your meal.

651
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
Ministry of Revenue has calculated

652
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,200
the money we need in the north expedition.

653
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
If we are really going to fight,

654
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
in the next three years,

655
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,100
we need to increase at least 30% of the taxes.

656
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,200
Building an alliance with Jing is the same as asking a tiger for its skin.

657
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,800
Where can we provide the tributary cloth they asked for?

658
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,800
Your Majesty, please make a final decision.

659
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
It's better to decide as fast as possible.

660
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,500
Be quiet.

661
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,700
You are giving me a headache.

662
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,500
Eunuch Zhang,

663
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,800
did you ask Grand Master his advice?

664
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Your Majesty,

665
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
the Grand Master has been sick recently.

666
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,500
He is having a rest at his manor

667
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,900
and refuses to see anyone.

668
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,600
Have you asked the imperial physician to check on him?

669
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Even the physician…

670
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
Even the physician was not allowed to enter either.

671
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Why is the Grand Master He so stubborn?

672
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,100
I need to see him in person.

673
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,900
You don't have to.

674
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
Greetings to Your Majesty

675
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,900
from Qin Si Yuan

676
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,300
and Li Gang.

677
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,800
As you were.

678
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

679
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
Right Prime Minister Qin,

680
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,600
I've been looking forward to your return for several days.

681
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Now, you finally came back.

682
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,000
You must have had a long journey.

683
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,800
I appreciate for Your Majesty's concern,

684
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,400
but I'm not so sure why Your Majesty

685
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
summoned me back.

686
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Didn't the imperial decree state it clearly?

687
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,200
Recall the Right Prime Minister to take charge of the Chancery,

688
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
and manage the six ministries and the twenty-four departments.

689
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Such being the case,

690
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,700
you can discuss this with me.

691
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,100
The six ministries and I must come up with a sure card.

692
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,400
Grand Master He is old now.

693
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
He can live a peaceful life in old age.

694
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He doesn't need to worry about national affairs.

695
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,400
I just heard Grand Master He is sick.

696
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,100
I wanted to visit him.

697
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,300
Since Right Prime Minister Qin has come back,

698
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,100
then I will discuss the national affairs with Right Prime Minister Qin.

699
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,600
Now, the northern Jing defected Liang.

700
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,200
What should we do

701
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,600
according to your opinion?

702
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,800
Dispatch the troops as soon as possible.

703
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you have the confidence to win

704
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,800
if we send out the troops now?

705
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,200
The odds are 60 if we fight with Jing

706
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,000
by using swords and soldiers.

707
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
Except those,

708
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
what else do we have?

709
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I… have a confidential letter to Your Majesty.

710
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Where did you get it?

711
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,700
The late Emperor

712
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,600
gave me a posthumous decree.

713
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
It writes clearly that

714
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I should assist Your Majesty

715
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,000
to recover the lost territory in the north,

716
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,300
which it is a long-cherished wish to unite the country.

717
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,400
I've waited for four years in Jiangning

718
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
in order to accumulate the strength to win the war directly

719
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
for Your Majesty.

720
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,400
What kind of strength?

721
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,600
What have you done?

722
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,500
The firearm.

723
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I set up the biggest munitions depot of Wu in Lin'an.

724
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,600
Now, there are 500,000 catties of black powder,

725
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,000
and 300 cannons,

726
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,800
which can be used in the war right away.

727
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Your Majesty,

728
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,600
whether we can make a great achievement for Wu Dynasty

729
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
and create a peaceful world

730
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,700
will all depend on it.

731
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,600
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
 Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

732
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,400
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

733
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,000
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

734
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,600
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

735
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:53,000
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

736
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,800
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

737
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,400
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

738
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,400
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

739
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

740
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,800
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

741
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

742
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

743
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

744
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

745
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,600
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

746
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

747
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

748
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

749
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,300
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

750
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,800
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

751
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

752
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

753
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

754
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,300
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫
