If your wife is beautiful and were hanging out,

4
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,590
it's very likely Bao Wen Han's kidnapped her.

5
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,128
You know him, he is such a lecher.

6
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:01,368
When we just came here, he assigned tasks to his men every day

7
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,289
just to kidnap several women on the street.

I'm afraid your wife is…

No way!

I can't let you take the risk again. I'll go by myself.

Let me think about it.

I went out to borrow grain for people in Lin'an City

Guard Geng told me he saw bandits ravishing my wife.

131
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,809
I once checked the dungeon as well as Bao Wen Han's house.

132
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,290
But I didn't find her.

133
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,530
I don't mean to trouble people in the Secret Investigation Department.

But I have no choice now.

135
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,428
Maybe she is not in the camps of bandits.

136
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,890
I once saw rascals form factions to sell people in the city.

No.

148
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,909
The biggest human traders at the moment are those bandits.

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,931
All right. I-I'll set them free.

That's nothing to do with you.

157
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,209
So, the one who took away the Lady must be in the bandit camps.

158
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,049
Young Master, then how should we find her?

159
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,609
To find Tan'er in bandit camps

160
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:28,389
is like searching for a needle in the sea.

161
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,750
We have to find the one who ravished Tan'er first.

Why did you lock the door?

It's okay, Master. She won't hurt me.

167
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,589
But Master, you'd better change your outfits.

168
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,509
You look indeed like a killer now.

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,090
Change into a girl's outfit, so that I can tell them

170
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,150
you're my older sister even if they catch us.

171
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,650
Got it.

172
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:34,749
Xi Gua, did you come for Brother Ning to discuss about camp reinforcement?

173
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,989
I didn't find him. His door was shut.

174
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,190
I don't know what he's doing every day.

175
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,368
Right.

176
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,369
What's he doing recently?

177
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,650
I really have no idea.

178
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,828
Are you hiding something from me?

179
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:54,389
No. No.

180
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,090
No nonsense. Say it.

181
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,469
This is his private business. I can't tell you.

182
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:03,769
His business is mine, too. Why can't you tell me?

183
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,469
He is Master Ning, all trades and professions obey his orders.

184
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:09,629
He has much to deal with.

185
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,748
In my opinion, being your military counselor is a waste of his talents.

186
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,789
You're in the way of his serious business.

187
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:19,068
I just asked you for a plan for camp reinforcement. You had to trouble him.

188
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,849
Is the camp yours or his?

189
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,850
Stop talking nonsense.

190
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,650
Make it clear first what the thing you can't tell me is.

191
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,709
You don't have to know it. Anyway, he doesn't want to talk to you.

192
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,070
Why doesn't he?

193
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,270
No reason.

194
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,210
You murmur "counselor" all the time. How can't he be annoyed by you?

195
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,309
He is occupied with finding his wife, how can he have time–

196
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,110
to respond to you?

197
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,329
Finding his wife?

198
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,669
What wife?

199
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,470
Nothing.

200
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,090
Say it.

201
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,949
Anyway,

202
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,049
Brother Ning is already married. His wife was lost in Lin'an City.

203
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,609
He is now trying to get her back.

204
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:12,790
Why-Why you would rather not to say this.

205
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,370
If he had told me about it before, I'd have already helped him find her.

206
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,588
He treated me as an outsider.

207
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,849
Why did he tell you rather than me?

208
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:23,449
Because I'm his sworn buddy.

209
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,989
Well, I'm his Ladyship. Even his life was saved by me.

210
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,550
Where are you going?

211
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,628
I'm enough to help him find his wife.

212
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:34,169
I go on patrol outside every day.

213
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,109
I'm more familiar with the places, streets and people in this city than you are.

214
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,049
All right.

215
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,588
Then you'll be troubled to find her.

216
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:47,009
His wife is my wife. You have to find her for me.

217
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,848
Your wife? Can you have a wife?

218
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,988
Your Ladyship, good skill in using the machete.

219
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,689
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,308
I have an official document to ask your favor

221
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:49,809
to hand it to Holy Master.

222
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,760
[Counsellor Ning Yi asks to hold a feast for all the officers]

223
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,109
What's this for?

224
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:08,090
I want you to beg Holy Master for me to hold a feast

225
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,490
for him as well as all the soldiers in eight camps under him.

226
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,570
As for the wording, I dared to finish it for you.

227
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,369
Holy Master must say yes after he reads it.

228
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,368
Eight camps? Then Bao Wen Han's guys will be invited, too?

229
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,469
I won't do it.

230
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:30,289
Your Ladyship, since I've done much for you,

231
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,468
and I never begged you for anything,

232
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:38,469
please be sure to promise me to hold the feast.

233
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:46,129
All right. I'll promise you.

234
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:49,749
I'll go for my adoptive father later and hand it to him.

235
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,670
Thank you, your Ladyship.

236
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,390
Are you holding the feast to find your wife?

237
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,009
Yes.

238
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,820
[Badao Camp]

239
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,199
Commander Liu.

240
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,899
Commander Bao.

241
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:42,419
Eight camps have all promised to attend the feast.

242
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,780
If Commander Bao's Xuanwei Camp is absent,

243
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,020
how can it be called "the Feast for All Officers"?

244
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,658
Holy Master,

245
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:54,140
you agreed to Liu Xi Gua's idea. I had nothing to say about it.

246
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,259
But you left Xuanwei Camp to me, and that was an approval of me.

247
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,379
If all my men go out tonight for the feast,

248
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,739
then we will leave a chance for some bad guys.

249
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:11,359
I can't be held accountable for some potential accidents.

250
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,060
What do you mean, Commander Bao?

251
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,859
Now that our people are all over Lin'an City, who can get the chance?

252
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:25,500
Or the bad guy you mentioned before is me, Liu Da Biao?

253
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,519
Xi Gua.

254
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,900
He doesn't have to come if he doesn't want to.

255
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,939
Northwestern Camp will support your feast.

256
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,819
Holy Master, please perceive it.

257
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:41,620
I know Commander Bao has many complaints to me.

258
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,278
But we're all buddies working for Holy Master.

259
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,699
He should put down that conflict sooner or later.

260
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:52,380
I proposed the feast to bury the knife with Commander Bao.

261
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,519
Xi Gua, it's a hatchet.

262
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,940
It doesn't matter.

263
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,499
Anyway, to make peace and cease fire. Are you coming or not?

264
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:07,140
I've stepped back. If you're still unwilling, we can go out to have a fight.

265
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,979
If you lose then, be good and come to the feast.

266
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,339
Let's deal it this way.

267
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,719
It's unnecessary to use force.

268
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:21,860
Xi Gua said in the document that the purpose of the feast

269
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,340
is to build the whole team, enhance troop morale for the future.

270
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,739
I thought she was right.

271
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,498
That was a huge battle achievement for us to occupy Lin'an City,

272
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,820
yet we didn't gather together to celebrate.

273
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's have a good gathering through the feast.

274
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,299
Old Bao, please come.

275
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,260
Yes, Holy Master.

276
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,259
Thank you, Holy Master.

277
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,440
Drink tea, sir.

278
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,459
Commander.

279
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:21,658
I investigated it. It was Ning Yi who wrote it.

280
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,719
It was him.

281
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:30,019
I was saying, how come the illiterate Liu Da Biao gets to make it up?

282
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,060
Look at her, recruiting Ning Yi as her counselor

283
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,579
who made Holy Master agree to hold the feast with just a document.

284
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,680
Look at you then.

285
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,258
Commander, are we going or not?

286
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,419
Nonsense. No.

287
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Wait a second.

288
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,940
Sir, I don't know if I should say this.

289
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,939
You're not an outsider. Go ahead.

290
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,419
No one can change something. Holy Master

291
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,099
has decided to do just like you.

292
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,698
A document got Holy Master agreed.

293
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:19,019
It was not because Ning Yi was awesome but Holy Master

294
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,340
wanted to hold the feast.

295
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,240
You're the head of eight camps with a distinguished post.

296
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,138
If you won't go, and other camps follow your example,

297
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,759
it'll get awkward in the feast then,

298
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,858
which not only hurts Holy Master's reputation,

299
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,500
but makes Holy Master to suspect that you are cliquing.

300
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,740
Your loss outweighs the gain then.

301
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,580
You convinced me.

302
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,180
Go to the feast on time.

303
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,480
Got it. Please mind your business, Commander.

304
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,360
I'll go inform our guys of that.

305
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,340
You're wise, sir.

306
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,160
Your Ladyship, are you looking for me?

307
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,979
People of eight camps will come to the feast tonight.

308
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,100
So I specially prepared you a new outfit.

309
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,898
All officers will be there.

310
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:31,499
After my careful consideration,

311
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,658
how come my counselor is with the least title?

312
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,019
How can that work?

313
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,219
So I promoted you from level-nine to level-seven.

314
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,178
Your Ladyship, purple gown and golden belt

315
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,059
are prepared for those whose title is higher than level three.

316
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,860
If you promote me to level-seven, I should wear a green gown.

317
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,079
Well… For you, green is not so lucky.

318
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,960
You scholars all like purple gowns and golden belts on you, right?

319
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,400
All right, thank you, Your Ladyship.

320
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,400
Watch out.

321
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,799
Order the song Bad Boy for this beauty.

322
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,399
Ning Li Heng?

323
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,339
Wait a second.

324
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,620
Ning Li Heng.

325
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,040
I knew it.

326
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,359
Every time I wet my clothes and get changed,

327
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,898
my wife would appear right away.

328
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,579
It's obvious she doesn't want me to cheat on her.

329
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,459
You want other women?

330
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:19,679
Commander Liu, Empress wants to see you and asks you to go over there.

331
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,340
Okay, I see.

332
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,019
Dry it yourself.

333
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,480
Get changed with the clothes tonight.

334
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Don't humiliate me.

335
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,840
What's wrong with you today?

336
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,959
Every time I wet my clothes before,

337
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,699
Tan'er would appear in front of me.

338
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,759
But this time…

339
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:35,759
As you said, you wounded the man in his right hand,
[Fang]

340
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,740
then his wound can't be healed now.

341
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,659
So we can only go by this.

342
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:51,559
Old Geng, I know it's improper for me to do so.

343
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,880
But wait for me for a second.

344
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,299
Okay, okay. I'm done.

345
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,218
But I do want to ask you, why did you make yourself look like this?

346
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:09,079
I was afraid they'd find me.

347
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,459
So I disguised myself like this.

348
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:14,620
You're so disguised that I can barely recognize you.

349
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,399
They're coming. They're coming.

350
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,979
Heroes, please stand there for a moment.

351
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,119
Who are you?

352
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,739
I'm the counselor of Commander Liu from Badao Camp, Ning Yi.

353
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,979
Today, I specially prepared a red cloth,

354
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:37,710
hoping you can sign your names on it,

355
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,100
which is for the good that the future generations

356
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,458
can know your names when talking about your achievements.

357
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,259
You are really articulate.

358
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,599
Then, you first.

359
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,079
Come on, guys.

360
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,520
For a souvenir here.

361
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,920
Come on.

362
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,039
Young Master, we've checked so many people.

363
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,960
The man didn't show up.

364
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,218
Wait longer.

365
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,300
There is still someone.

366
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,739
Drink more. Drink more.

367
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,859
Heroes, please eat more.

368
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,020
Write your name on the silk banner.

369
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,419
Okay, okay.

370
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,759
You two, follow me.

371
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,799
Wait here, you two.

372
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Father,

373
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,260
I'm dying of hunger.

374
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,959
Can we steal for some ort when they're done with it?

375
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,539
Please spare my life. Please spare my life.

376
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,040
We didn't steal anything. We didn't.

377
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,480
Second Master, Old Young Master. It's me.

378
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,380
Guard Geng?

379
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,458
- Old Geng!
- Guard Geng?

380
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:44,618
Why are you here?

381
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,559
We-We… We were caught here.

382
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,019
Guard Geng, why are you dressed like a bandit?

383
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,618
It's a long story.

384
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,259
After the bandits ravished the lady away,

385
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,539
Young Master Ning Yi and I came here to find him.

386
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,700
To avoid being recognized by them, I dressed like this.

387
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,240
Tan'er was ravished away by a bandit?

388
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,219
It's too dangerous here. Let me get you out of here first.

389
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,119
Good, good.

390
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,079
Hurry up, hurry up.

391
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,979
- This is...
- Get in, get in.

392
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,480
Just wait here at the back door.

393
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,880
I'll come to pick you up after my business is done.

394
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,019
Okay, okay.

395
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,419
See you later.

396
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:31,679
- Just wait.
- Just wait.

397
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,658
Commander Bao, please sign your name on it.

398
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,000
Get away.

399
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,100
Commander Bao.

400
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,979
Commander Bao. Commander Bao.

401
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,400
If you won't sign your name on it, you can't attend the feast.

402
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,418
What the hell is the banner?

403
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:00,799
You asked us to sign our names, and we have to do it?

404
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,858
What do you think are we?

405
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,459
Take it away.

406
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,138
What?

407
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,979
Ning, you want to pick a fight with Xuanwei Camp?

408
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,240
I dare not to.

409
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,140
What's wrong again?

410
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,739
Holy Master.

411
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,739
Why are you standing here instead of being seated?

412
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,799
What's wrong again?

413
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,359
Holy Master.

414
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,599
Counsellor Ning proposed the feast.

415
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,779
But I don't think Xuanwei Camp is welcome by him.

416
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,299
Then why don't we retreat now?

417
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,579
Right? Guys.

418
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,079
Yes.

419
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,519
Holy Master invited eight camps today,

420
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,019
yet you're the only one who wants to be absent.

421
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,760
You don't seem willing to eat at the feast.

422
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,880
Holy Master, I don't mean that at all.

423
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,019
But Ning Yi has offended my camp at times.

424
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,680
If he asks me to stay, I'll obey.

425
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,200
How should my fellows in the camp be convinced by me?

426
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,779
Please forgive me, Holy Master.

427
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,918
- I'm leaving.
- Let's go.

428
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,079
Go.

429
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,839
Old Bao.

430
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:15,400
I set the feast today for you to make peace with Badao Camp

431
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,938
so we can accomplish a great achievement with concerted effort.

432
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:20,920
If you left, how can the feast complete?

433
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,658
Holy Master is right.

434
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:25,499
It's an occasion for reconciliation and celebration.

435
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,099
If you want to stay, stay.

436
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,259
If you don't want to, the door is over there.

437
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,099
Holy Master, you heard that?

438
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,819
I never said I didn't want to make peace.

439
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,178
But Commander Chen talked to me like that for a menial counselor.

440
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,759
As you saw, was that the attitude to make peace?

441
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,359
Commander Bao, I offended you.

442
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
It had nothing to do with Commander Chen.

443
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,880
You said you wanted to see a good attitude. Go ahead, as you please.

444
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,610
I will do what you want

445
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,370
for the sake that you'll forgive me

446
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:01,680
and let the fellows of Xuanwei Camp be seated in the feast.

447
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,898
See?

448
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,398
Old Bao, the attitude you want is here.

449
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,400
Is that enough? Be seated, be seated.

450
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
Be seated.

451
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,698
Commander?

452
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,599
Be seated.

453
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:32,159
Counselor Ning,

454
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,900
I don't want you to kneel down and apologize to me

455
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,630
but to drink with my guys in Xuanwei Camp.

456
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,879
Bottom up that jar of alcohol.

457
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:46,178
Our conflict will be gone.

458
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,819
Right. Right. Drink it. Drink it.

459
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,399
Drink it.

460
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,038
It's easy for you to say.

461
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:53,979
Drink up this whole big jar of alcohol.

462
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,000
Why don't you drink it and let me see?

463
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:01,178
Thank Commander Bao for inviting Badao Camp to drink.

464
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:02,779
Share the alcohol.

465
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,379
Thank you, Commander Bao.

466
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,638
Commander Liu, no need to share it.

467
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:15,198
This jar of alcohol is a treat for Counsellor Ning and my fellows.

468
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:19,638
What? You won't show your respect for me?

469
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:26,460
Xi Gua, just let Counselor Ning drink with the fellows.

470
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,578
It seems that Holy Master is determined to

471
00:34:30,578 --> 00:34:33,779
let Bao Wen Han run wild this time.

472
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,060
Counselor Ning, what do you think?

473
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,219
Commander Bao,

474
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:52,978
it's my honor.

475
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:57,058
Even if you didn't bring out the jar, I had been thinking

476
00:34:57,058 --> 00:35:02,459
to have toasts with you and the fellows of Xuanwei Camp.

477
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,678
Bring me the alcohol.

478
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:06,499
Counselor, please.

479
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,019
Commander Bao,

480
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,698
this bowl of alcohol shows my respect for you.

481
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,599
You don't have to drink along.

482
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,499
Come on, fellows. Let's have another bowl.

483
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:02,240
Thank you, Counselor.

484
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:09,018
Work hard. You know?

485
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,900
Brother, a toast from me.

486
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
Thank you, Counselor

487
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:22,059
Here, brother.

488
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Thank you, Counselor.

489
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,119
Brother.

490
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,619
Thank you, Counselor.

491
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:36,939
Let me see.

492
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,940
Drink it. Drink it.

493
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,978
Here, here. Come on, keep on drinking.

494
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:42,858
Bring it. I haven't come yet. Who are you drinking with?

495
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,940
Drink it. Drink it.

496
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:54,080
♫ The world is coldest and ruthless ♫

497
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,520
♫ Fallen the brightest blooms are hard to find ♫

498
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,080
♫ Everyone counts ♫

499
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,340
♫ I'm the only one crying ♫

500
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:13,400
♫ Provoking bitterness for a while ♫

501
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:19,930
♫ Who is sad to dream about this ♫

502
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:27,190
♫ Recognize the heaven and earth but not fate ♫

503
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:34,940
♫ Mourn for its misfortune ♫

504
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,470
♫ Let me wake up in this chaotic world ♫

505
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,780
♫ Who is sad to dream about this ♫

506
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:54,750
♫ For fear that no one will hate ♫

507
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,720
♫ It is not certain what the day is like ♫

508
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,600
Son,

509
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,819
it's almost dawn.

510
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:14,739
Why hasn't Guard Geng come yet?

511
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:19,819
Father, we know what kind of person Old Geng is.

512
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:22,259
He'll come.

513
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,460
Just wait.

514
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,299
Just wait.

515
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,419
- Counselor.
- Counselor.

516
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Fuck off.

517
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,158
Commander Bao,

518
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:50,218
my Counselor is drunk like this.

519
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:52,459
Have you worked off your anger?

520
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,019
If you haven't, I can drink for him.

521
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,120
All right.

522
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,558
Brother Ning, good capacity for liquor.

523
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:08,999
We will make it stop here today.

524
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:12,739
Your conflict with me is cleared up.

525
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,798
Wang Jin, Shi Bao, help the Counselor.

526
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,140
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

527
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,850
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

528
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,520
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

529
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,230
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

530
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:15,520
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

531
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,090
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

532
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,090
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

533
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:29,960
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

534
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,050
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

535
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,390
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

536
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:41,350
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

537
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,750
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

538
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,740
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

539
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,110
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

540
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,020
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

541
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,440
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

542
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,530
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

543
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,940
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

544
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,790
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

545
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

546
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,300
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

547
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,620
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

548
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,650
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

549
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:32,590
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
