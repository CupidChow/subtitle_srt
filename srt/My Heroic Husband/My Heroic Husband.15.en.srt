[Episode 15]

3
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,379
Shouldn't I come up with a name before we start learning from this rare book?

4
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,679
I've already come up with a name for myself.

5
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,359
I would be called "Human Butcher of Bloody Hands."

6
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,318
- Master, you're called...
- Lu Hongti.

7
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
You do have a name?

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,080
Lu Hongti?

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,299
That name does sound quite tasty. (Her name has the same characters that also mean red grapes.)

10
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,200
Stop with the nonsense!

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,219
Master is right in chiding me!

12
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,140
Then let's... Get started.

13
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,359
I've finished teaching.

14
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,539
Master.

15
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,639
You're really only teaching it once?

16
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,200
What kind of lousy teacher is she?

17

[Su Manor]

Three Bamboo Tile.

19
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,740
Green Tile.

20
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,970
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,799
I don't know what is with my daughter and son-in-law.

22
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,090
They insisted on buying these trivial things for me.

23
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,699
It even makes playing Mahjong inconvenient.

24
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,579
I told them that I didn't need these. But she insisted on it.

25
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,759
Sometimes having a daughter that is too filial can also be troublesome, right?

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,879
That's right. Your son-in-law has such a successful business.

27
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,058
He must be so busy that he doesn't have time to care for Tan'er anymore, right?

28
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:48,118
If so, then when will you ever have a grandchild?

29
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,678
It's also good that Madame doesn't have any grandchildren.

30
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,539
She's able to still have time to play Mahjong with you, right?

31
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,159
My eldest grandson is extremely clingy.

32
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,580
He is unable to be without someone even for a single day.

33
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,118
He has been making an uproar with me wanting a rattle these two days.

34
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,519
Oh, that's right, do you know which long-standing shop makes the best rattles?

35
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,518
I want to buy one to play with him later. That way I can avoid him making a fuss at home every day.

36
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,599
I know. I know.

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,199
There is a store that is good at making these gadgets.

38
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,919
My granddaughter really likes their gadgets.

39
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,100
- Really?
- Yes!

40
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,440
- Are there a lot of different patterns and styles?
- Yes!

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,499
Are we still playing Mahjong?

42
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,998
Yes, let's continue playing.

43
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:22,238
Yes. Come on.

44
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:24,039
I am not going to play any longer!

45
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,160
Why are you not playing anymore?

46
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,879
The waterproof paint invented by Young Master deserves to become renowned in Jiangning.

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,238
In Lin'an, even Shuwan responded without delay after hearing about it.

48
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:37,078
She came looking for me to ask for the paint formula.

49
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,640
Then is Young Lady planning to give it to Miss Lou?

50
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,758
If it was only Shuwan, I would've naturally granted her request.

51
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:46,638
However, those people in the Lou Family often bully her.

52
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:51,459
I'm afraid that by giving her the formula I would be helping someone else succeed.

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,659
My good daughter. Look at you!

54
00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:00,420
Can't you let me gain some respect in front of others?

55
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,338
Mother, you've already been wearing so many pieces of jewelry.

56
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,318
You still can't hold your head high in front of others?

57
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,118
Hold my head high?

58
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,839
I can hardly hold my head up. It's heavy.

59
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,470
What can I even use all these things for?

60
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,100
I want to have a grandchild.

61
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,830
A grandchild!

62
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,198
What have you and your husband done here every night?

63
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:23,379
Are you just lying on your stomach working through the account books? Can't you...

64
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,599
Young Lady.

65
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:33,138
Mother. Mother.

66
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,160
Mother. Mother.

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,499
This…

68
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,018
This… This…this…this… This hole! What is this?

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,799
So turns out you and your husband have been sleeping in separate rooms.

70
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,479
No wonder you have no signs of being pregnant.

71
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,619
You're driving me crazy. When can I have a grandchild?

72
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,319
You can't do this to me.

73
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,619
It's no use in just scolding me.

74
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,539
I can't decide myself on this kind of matter.

75
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,398
Okay. Today, I'll decide for you.

76
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:22,259
Xiao Chan, go and tear down Ning Yi's room!

77
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,638
I'll see where he sleeps in the future!

78
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:26,298
- Tear-Tear down...
- Go! Right now!

79
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,778
- Tear down whatever you see, the table, stools, chairs and the cabinet.
- Madam. I…

80
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,500
Tear them all down! Don't leave anything intact!

81
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,318
I just won't believe

82
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,780
that if it is all torn down that he wouldn't sleep here. Where else would he sleep?

83
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,338
Young Lady.

84
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:42,658
Xiao Chan, my mother is already this angry.

85
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,300
I can't do anything about it.

86
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,619
Tear them down.

87
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,420
Understood!

88
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
Was there an earthquake?

89
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,979
It can't be.

90
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,600
An earthquake only in this room?

91
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,279
Forget it. I'd better hurry and fix this.

92
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,019
This… Why is Young Master so persistant?

93
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,998
I tore it down once and he fixed it back up once.

94
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,959
He doesn't find it tiring, but I do.

95
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,159
I just won't believe it!

96
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,939
Young Master. Young Master.

97
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,578
Young Master. Young Master. Young Master.

98
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,539
It's like your room has been haunted these few days. The things in your room keep breaking.

99
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,198
There's too much for me to fix.

100
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,958
What you are doing is covering up your own misdeeds by shifting the blame onto other people.

101
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,879
I seriously suspect that you are the one doing it!

102
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,958
You're doing this to get me to hurry and write novels, right?

103
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,139
If I wanted to urge you to write more, I could just directly beat you. Why would I have to tear down your room?

104
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,239
You really might not be able to defeat me now.

105
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,679
I've done some practice. I also…

106
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,079
It hurts, it hurts!

107
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,380
Let's go.

108
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:49,558
Oh no! Not again! This time the roof is leaking.

109
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:52,780
Young Master, now do you see?

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,998
We've been staying together for this whole time. I couldn't have done this.

111
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,119
It wasn't you. It was the ghost.

112
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,519
Forget it.

113
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,838
Even if a ghost comes, it only goes to my room. Don't be afraid.

114
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:09,480
That's right.

115
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,899
Young Master, I'll go find a ladder and fix it for you.

116
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,318
- You smashed everything?
- I did.

117
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:38,438
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

118
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,100
Young Lady, there are already two holes in Young Master's room.

119
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
Why hasn't he come here yet?

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
How about you go back first?

121
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll wait for him here alone.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
- My Lady, are you planning to…
- Why are you still here?

123
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,600
How long does one have to practice to reach the point of destroying the roof?

124
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Young Lady, my legs are numb.

125
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Mine, too.

Don't startle Young Lady.

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,900
My Lady.

130
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Hurry up. Hurry.

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Hurry up. Follow up.

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,300
Hurry up.

133
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,100
Catch up.

134
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,800
Be defter!

135
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Everyone be deft! Defter!

136
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Don't procrastinate!

137
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
Everyone be very careful!

138
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,400
The weather is very dry.

139
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
We have to guard against things catching fire.

140
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,600
The Second Master's room was burned one time before.

141
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
The Elder Master had no choice but to take in Young Master Wenxing.

142
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
They were crammed living together.

143
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
It was tough for the Elder Master.

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
A thing like that cannot happen in our First Master's.

145
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Xiao Chan, where did Young Master go?

146
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,300
My Lady? My Lady?

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Master. Master.

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
It's me. It's me.

149
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Your strikes are ruthless enough.

150
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

151
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,300
In any case, I'm your only disciple.

152
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Originally when you gave me a rare book, I was happily learning from it.

153
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
I thought that I had mastered it.

154
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,500
I didn't expect that I would still be defeated by you in a few moves.

155
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,000
But… I saw what you were doing just now.

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Your heroes are always doing useless things and never anything proper.

157
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,800
Also you like to send letters with pigeons.

158
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,700
What kind of letter is that?

159
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
A love letter?

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
You can tell me.

161
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
I can even teach you...

162
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
All right.

163
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
This joke is not funny.

164
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
I know what you just sent.

165
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
A confidential letter. Right?

166
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Heroes like you must have undertaken some type of mission.

167
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Of course, I don't want to know what it is specifically.

168
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,700
The reason why you assassinated Song Xian has nothing to do with me.

169
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
In Jiangning, I currently

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,500
have a family, relatives, and friends.

171
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,800
As long as you don't hurt them, we'll live in peace with each other.

172
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,200
Let me count it for you.

173
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
As long as… you don't hurt my wife,

174
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,300
Lao Geng, Xiao Chan, my father-in-law,

175
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,400
my mother-in-law, Li Pin, Gao Qiu, Feng Yuan…

176
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,100
There are so many people you want to protect.

177
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,300
It's good that you know.

178
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,200
In short, we both keep out of each other's affairs, then we can continue being friends.

179
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
Do you understand?

180
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
You have misunderstood.

181
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,000
Everything I do is for the desire to rid evils from the people

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
and bring justice to this world.

183
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,800
You heroes always like saying these kinds of pretentious words.

184
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
It doesn't matter. You don't want to tell the truth

185
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
and I am too lazy to ask.

186
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
This is the truth.

187
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,900
Nowaday, the Wu Dynasty has to bow its head to Liang and Jing.

188
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,200
It's only because the Wu Dynasty has lowered its head

189
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
that all the people can raise their heads.

190
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
But it's not a permanent solution.

191
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,000
Have you ever thought

192
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
that someday the Jing State will grow stronger and unruly. They'll definitely go south then.

193
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
When they have forcefully killed right before the people you want to protect,

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
you likewise would have to protect this country,

195
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
because if the country is ruined, the land will still be here

196
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
but home will truly be gone.

197
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
That's pretty good.

198
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Your speech is rich with provocation.

199
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
I nearly fell for your words.

200
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,900
Anyway, I still hope for the world to be at peace.

201
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,400
It would be best that no country should ever start a fight with other countries.

202
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,000
But after listening to your words,

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,100
I think you're really a good person.

204
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,900
You're really an extraordinary person.

205
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm proud to have such a master like you.

206
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Master. Master.

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,100
Let go! Let go!

208
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,200
I was wrong!

209
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Rude!

210
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,800
What're you doing, Lao Geng?

211
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
What's Young Lady doing?

212
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
Preventing fire and cooling down.

213
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,200
Young Lady is moving away the splashing tube used for putting out a fire.

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
If there is a fire, what she did

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
would cause there not to be enough time to put out the fire.

216
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
The splashing tube has become old with age.

217
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Young Lady took it for maintaince.

218
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Why is she holding a gourd ladle now?

219
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,600
If there is a fire, Young Lady must know

220
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,800
how much water the gourd ladle can contain.

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,900
She threw out the gourd ladle now?

222
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
She knows now

223
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
that the gourd ladle can't hold too much water.

224
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
She needs to use a wooden basin.

225
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Now the wooden basin is gone, too.

226
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
I really can't explain this.

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
What does she want to do?

228
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Young Master, did you offend Young Lady somehow?

229
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Nonsense!

230
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,000
All of Young Lady's actions are obviously done to burn down your side room.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
She really is going to burn it?

232
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,600
No!

233
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Young Master, you won't have a place to sleep if the side room is burnt down.

234
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Where will you sleep?

235
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
She could have just told me

236
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
rather than going through all this trouble.

237
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,600
Someone come!

238
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
Fire!

239
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Hurry and put out the fire!

240
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Someone come!

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:18,200
There's a fire. Put out the fire.

242
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Someone come!

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,900
There's a fire! Come and put out the fire!

244
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I don't know what happened.

245
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
The weather has been dry. How come the room suddenly caught on fire?

246
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,900
We should put out the fire first.

247
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,798
No hurry.

248
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Let it burn for a bit more.

249
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,500
Young Master!

250
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Everyone be careful!

251
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,300
These goods are fine as it is.

252
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,500
Don't hurt yourselves!

253
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,100
Young Master,

254
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,800
did Young Lady do all of this to

255
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
consummate with you by burning the room?

256
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Are the two of you going to...

257
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,800
Lao Geng, do you think the fire can be put out now?

258
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
It's almost all burnt down.

259
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay.

260
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,600
Go help them.

261
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Now?

262
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Fine.

263
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Put out the fire!

264
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm coming to put out the fire.

265
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Lady, I'm here to put out the fire.

266
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Someone come! Put out the fire!

267
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,699
I'm coming to put out the fire.

268
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
The weather has been dry.

269
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,600
Be careful with fire and candles.

270
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,300
Madame, the fire in the side room had been put out.

271
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,200
Okay.

272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
No one was hurt, right?

273
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,900
No.

274
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,720
Good.

275
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,798
Money is just worldly possessions.

276
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
It doesn't matter.

277
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Then all of you should hurry and go rest.

278
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
- All right..
- Yes, Madam.

279
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,600
You all worked hard.

280
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
I just feel sorry for my novels.

281
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,700
Novels?

282
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,400
I just so happened to have free time yesterday,

283
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,700
so I put away all your novels and books.

284
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,300
Xiao Chan,

285
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
by chance, these were all put away yesterday.

286
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,400
You even took out the eggs?

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Did you take out Young Master's kite?

288
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
It's in the Lady's room.

289
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,800
Luckily, yesterday we… put it away, too.

290
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
This is too obvious.

291
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Xiao Chan, pour me a cup of tea.

292
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,100
Yes.

293
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,900
The… The weather has been scorching hot.

294
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,200
The… The weather has been dry.

295
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

296
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,600
There is a high possibility of a fire.

297
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Yes.

298
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,800
Did the fire frighten you?

299
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,000
I really was frightened.

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But… What I'm more worried about is where you will sleep in the evening

301
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,560
since your side room was burnt down?

302
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,199
They were really weren't careful enough.

303
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
But luckily, no one got injured.

304
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,800
The main problem is now that your side room is burnt down

305
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
what to do for tonight?

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,500
Madame, isn't the Lady's room empty?

307
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,600
Right.

308
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,500
What am I thinking?

309
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
So my son-in-law… Tonight… How about…

310
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,100
How about…

311
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How about…

312
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,900
Madam, my room is empty, too.

313
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
Shut up!

314
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
Understood.

315
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,160
What are you even saying?

316
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,598
Our Su Family just became the wealthiest family in Jiangning.

317
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Young Master has worked hard at call with undeniable contributions.

318
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,100
How can he live in a guard's courtyard?

319
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,400
If it is known by others,

320
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,900
people will say that we abandoned our benefactor as soon as his help is not required.

321
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,400
That is not the manners of our Su Family.

322
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
Tan'er's room… is just right.

323
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,500
Spacious.

324
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
It wasn't burnt at all. Completely intact.

325
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
Isn't it just right?

326
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Just right.

327
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
- Someone can live in it.
- Someone can live in it.

We're all on the same side. No need for unnecessary courtesies.

Hurry and come forward.

Today… we invited General Dong and General Wang over

for the north expedition.

376

Although His Majesty issued an official imperial edict on the north expedition,

00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,800
there is more and more ample confidence in the expedition.

The courtiers have had enough of

are the most honorable Generals in the Wu Dynasty.

The north expedition will be led by you two.

Right Prime Minister Qin, we're flattered.

We are with strengthened power.

I'll appoint Wang Bing and Yang Shike, the Two Generals,

391
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,600
to march along the Xizhou and Qizhou border to the north.

392

They'll go directly to Jing's hinterland.

You two will lead a group of cavalries respectively.

394

From the trading route between

our country, Wu and Liang,

396
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,900
you will attack from both sides striking the unprepared enemy.

397
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,400
This way we will fight and win the series of battles

The honeymoon is… After two people are together,

413
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
there will be one month during which they want to be with each other most.

414

So, we must go out to have fun.

One month that they want to be with each other the most?

416
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,200
So afterward, they don't want to be together anymore?

487
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,400
There we can admire the beauty of flowers along the river.

488
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,300
However, it's not flowering season now.

489
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,600
Along the road, we will only see faded flowers and withered willows.

490
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,700
It's not recommended.

491
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,600
If we go in the southwest direction, it'll be a public road.

492
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,800
We'll pass by the Anmo and Bi County.

493
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
Not only is the road bumpy and muddy,

494
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,700
but the destination is also the barren Gobi Desert.

495
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,500
It's uncertain whether we can come back alive.

496
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,400
I don't recommend it even more.

497
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,100
Only if we go in the straight south direction

498
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,600
will we see a trade route continuously stretching about 150 kilometers.

499
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,100
We will pass by the famous cities of the Wu Dynasty.

500
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,600
Not only is the scenery beautiful,

501
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
but we can also eat hawthorn juice,

502
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
the glutinous wine lees rice balls, Osmanthus cake and more of these delicacies.

503
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,800
There are too many to count.

504
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,100
Finally, we arrive at our destination after we climb over a small hill.

505
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,000
Lin'an City.

506
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Lin'an City?

507
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,500
Lin'an City is one of the richest cities in the Wu Dynasty.

508
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,900
Countless merchants come and go with clusters of poets and writers in the city.

509
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,800
Among the 100 old cities of the Wu Dynasty, it is the one city that is a must-visit for traveling.

510
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Lao Geng,

511
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,200
why do you know so much?

512
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,300
Young Master, I'm flattered.

513
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,000
When I was young, the world was my home

514
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,200
and with just myself and a horse, I traveled the world.

515
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
However, I had to take care of my old mother at home.

516
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,100
Otherwise, I would still be living with knives covered with blood and a satisfying, avenging

517
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,900
life of Jianghu.

518
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,600
Okay. It's decided.

519
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,400
We'll go to Lin'an City for our honeymoon trip.

520
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,500
So, I…

521
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,900
Guide Geng, this time I will have to ask for your help.

522
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,200
I believe this trip will be interesting and meaningful

523
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
under Guide Geng.

524
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
The trip will not have been made in vain.

525
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
Cheers.

526
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,200
Then, I'll go prepare.

527
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
You have worked hard.

528
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,300
No need to be polite.

529
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,400
His talent was wasted.

530
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
Be very careful when placing them!
[Su Manor]

531
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,700
That's right. Put them over there.

532
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,000
You, too. Over there.

533
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,900
That one.

534
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,300
Be careful. Don't run!

535
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,400
Put them in order.

536
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
That's right. That.

537
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Right. Place them all over there.

538
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,800
You got the wrong thing. Didn't I tell you that I wanted the silk quilt?

539
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Look at the weather right now. Are you trying to cover Young Master and Young Lady into getting a heat rash?

540
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
- Hurry and go change it!
- Got it, Madam.

541
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,400
- Hurry up!
- I'll go change it right now.

542
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,500
Tan'er, you're here.

543
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,600
Have a look. The preparations are almost ready.

544
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,200
Mother, didn't I tell you I will come back in half a month?

545
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Except for the daily necessities, I don't need anything else.

546
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,000
But these are all the daily necessities.

547
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,300
That carriage has clothing and bedding.

548
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,400
And in this carriage are belongings and the things sent by your aunt,

549
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,600
like edible bird's nest and preserved fruit.

550
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,800
You doing all of this will make people think that we're fleeing from calamity.

551
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,300
- Xiao Chan, unload the things we don't need and leave them for Madam to use.
- Okay.

552
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,400
You can't unload it!

553
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
But you need to bring some clothes, right?

554
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
Take the Tiger Wine with you.

555
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's up to Tan'er.

556
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,500
- Son-in-law.
- Brother-in-law.

557
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,000
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

558
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

559
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,800
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

560
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,400
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

561
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:00,600
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

562
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,400
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

563
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,200
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

564
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,100
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

565
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

566
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

567
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

568
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,800
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

569
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

570
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

571
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can!♫

572
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,600
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon

573
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,800
