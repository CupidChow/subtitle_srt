[Episode 31]

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,950
The Su family is honored to have had you as a guard.
[Tomb of Geng Zhi]

4
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,129
You said you wanted to travel all over the world with your sword.

5
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,389
From now on,

6
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,229
you don't need to worry about us.

7
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,589

[Tomb of Geng Zhi]

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,150
Old Geng,

10
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,210
I didn't read the novel you wanted to show me.

11
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,949
Today I will sit down and read it.

12
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,949
In the 100th year of Changing's reign,

13
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,850
there was a young man

14
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,130
named Geng Zhi in Bafeng Village.

15
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,190
He is twenty now.

16
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,250
Bored of the loneliness in the countryside,

17
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,169
he decided to go to Jiangning

18
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,230
and explore his own world.

19
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,150
That night,

20
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,010
he and his fellow countrymen were waiting outside the gate of Jiangning

21
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,730
in order to enter the city in the early morning.

22
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,390
In the crowd…

23
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,368
He met Lady Yang.

24
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,729
You were doing great in the sing-song house in the country.

25
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,889
Why did you have to come to Jiangning?

26
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,829
Madame Liang said my voice is great.

27
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,510
She told me to come to the city.

28
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,070
I will be the best singer in the biggest sing-song house in Jiangning.

29
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,310
Then we won't be able to afford to hear you sing.

30
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,629
How about you sing a song for us now?

31
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,329
All right, I will sing something for you.

32
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,050
Bathed in the moonlight,

33
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,449
Lady Yang seemed to be wearing gauze.

34
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:57,090
The scene depicted in the song/i>

35
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,310
made the night even sadder.

36
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,989
That was the first time he heard her sing.

37
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,510
She did not even take one look at him.

38
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,889
In her eyes,

39
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,369
he saw her expectation of a beautiful future life.

40
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,369
- Do you need escort guards here?
- Please come in.

41
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,249
Okay. Thank you.

42
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,129
Come in. Come in.

43
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,130
What are you doing?

44
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,589
Don't you need escort guards?

45
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,068
I have been studying martial arts since childhood. I am good at boxing and using the sword.

46
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,888
Here we only need the top masters in martial arts in the world.

47
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,589
This is not a place for some gangsters.

48
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:09,109
I am a top master.

49
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,888
Well, I will show you how I use a sword.

50
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:11,950
You will know.

51
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,430
Stop. Stop. No need.

52
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,130
Come on.

53
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,389
Well, you seem really sincere.

54
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,010
I can introduce you to our leader.

55
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,570
Thank you.

56
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,430
But you have to show your sincerity.

57
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,230
You know.

58
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,789
From then on,

59
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,050
he became a guard in Su Manor.

60
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,950
He protected the Su Family for decades.

61
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,950
In his spare time,

62
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,129
he never stopped searching for Lady Yang.

63
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,189
He knew…

64
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,249
-  she must be in a sing-song house in Jiangning.
- Come in, please.

65
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:10,949
- She had become the most popular singer.
- Please come inside.

66
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,389
She must be singing beautiful songs

67
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,290
and wearing a beautiful dress somewhere.

68
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,529
There were guests from all around the world

69
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,370
yet no one had entered her heart.

70
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,350
He had always wanted to find her

71
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,609
and express his feelings to her.

Several years later,

76
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,469
he began to doubt if she was still in Jiangning.

77
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,888
The new sing-song house seems great.

78
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,229
- Let's go have a look.
- Let's go.

79
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,070
Maybe she had gone back to her hometown.

80
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,469
Maybe she had married someone.

81
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,349
He even doubted if he had ever met Lady Yang.

82
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,910
His memory became blurred.

83

- Okay. All right.
- Good.

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,229
he'd meet her in such a way.

We still have seats here. Please come in now.

90

He knew that he and Yang Xiu Hong were just commoners in the world.

105
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:17,810
They were ordinary and vulnerable.

Yet for Lady Yang,

107

hoping he could save enough money

112

and tell her he would like to marry her one day.

Please do me a favor.

119

His one and only interest was to read novels.

The heroes in the stories

In thousands of nights,

and living happily with her ever after.

In order to meet her more often,

127

he often went to the sing-song house.

She had no time to even look at him.

145

quietly watched her get busy.

147

But for all those times,

she didn't even know him.

whether he could do business with him.

154

He was so excited.

164

Meeting such a good person,

165
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,990
he should work even harder

166

and make enough money.

167
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,150
Maybe one day he could go to Lady Yang and tell her his name.

168
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,610
Maybe what he dreamed about could come true one day.

169
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,170
He could marry her and live happily with her.

170
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,150
In the end…

171
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,190
In the end…

172
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,748
I didn't expect…You are a chivalrous hero doing a dangerous job

173
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:17,968
yet you love reading romance stories?

174
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,568
Excuse me, my clothes are wet. I was afraid of getting a stroke.

175
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,049
I-I will go get changed.

176
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,709
Remember, you can have a good life and whatever you like

177
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,229
if you follow me.

178
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:34,429
So I especially sent you to Lin'an to work as a manager.

179
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,689
I trust you. I'm waiting for your upcoming stories.

180
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,690
I've got to go.

181
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,190
When I finish what I'm doing,

182
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,709
I will come to you again.

183
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,710
Do you think Xi Gua really likes Ning Yi

184
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,330
or she just wants to protect him?

185
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,529
Don't you know her?

186
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,550
If she doesn't mean it,

187
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,208
how would she make up something like that

188
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,169
in front of that many people?

189
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,349
She's gone through a lot with us all these years.

190
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,349
But she never helped someone with such an excuse.

191
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,670
I set her up on several blind dates but she just refused all of them.

192
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,130
I think she really likes Ning Yi.

193
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,069
If they can get married,

194
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,590
we may help a couple find their happiness.

195
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,029
But at the moment, we haven't figured out what happened in the powder magazine.

196
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,670
If Ning Yi is a spy,

197
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,049
then we're opening the door to a dangerous person.

198
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,969
That's not right.

199
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:02,229
Since Xi Gua appointed him as the counselor, this city has become

200
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,608
way more peaceful than before.

201
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,950
How could he be a spy?

202
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,870
Xi Gua lost her mother when she was little.

203
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,290
She is like my daughter.

204
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,589
He is the first man Xi Gua likes.

205
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:20,650
As her aunt,

206
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,930
I will help her marry him.

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,210
It's pointless arguing about this.

208
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,770
Let's go with it.

209
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,809
You mean…

210
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,670
Let them marry.

211
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,250
At that time, let's send our invitations

212
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,729
to all the camps and have them come to the wedding.

213
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:47,329
If he was really a spy,

214
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,050
he would take the chance since we'd have a weak defense by then

215
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,630
and ask Dong Dao Fu to attack us.

216
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,390
In that way, we can also use our powder.

217
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,109
If we stay safe,

218
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:01,029
Ning Yi will prove his innocence.

219
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,829
And we also witness the big event for a happy couple.

220
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,770
Holy Master, I have brought him here.

221
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,230
Ning Yi,

222
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,970
do you know why I summoned you today?

223
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,270
I know. I will be punished.

224
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,950
You're right.

225
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,369
You hurt my people at the port.

226
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,670
You ruined my business by bringing food into the city.

227
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,228
You killed my camp leader out of Badao Camp.

228
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:58,809
Do you think you are guilty?

229
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,570
I don't.

230
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,389
A person should have a line in the sand.

231
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:07,530
This is my line.

232
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,650
I believe you have your own line, too.

233
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,309
Everyone here has his or her line as well.

234
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,769
And the meaning of that line

235
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,930
is to do things that we know we can't do.

236
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:24,948
Good.

237
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,430
I knew I could trust you.

238
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,810
When is your birthday?

239
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,309
I'm asking about your birthday.

240
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,269
February 11, 7 to 9 o'clock.

241
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,250
I can't remember

242
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:49,409
which year.

243
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:51,689
Do you have any family?

244
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,089
My parents died.

245
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,770
I married Su Tan'er and was a matrilocal husband

246
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,450
in Su Family in Jiangning.

247
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,950
I don't have any children.

248
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:05,749
Holy Master, if you want to kill me,

249
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,029
you don't need to be so specific.

250
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,469
You are bold.

251
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,030
Listen.

252
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,989
Divorce Su Tan'er right away.

253
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,849
Xi Gua has liked you for a long time.

254
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:38,729
As her family, we have all agreed to this marriage.

255
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,290
Right now, I, under the name of the Holy Master,

256
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,569
order you two to get married.

257
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,250
Your wedding will be held the day after tomorrow.

258
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,950
It's nonnegotiable.

259
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,668
Be careful. Move it higher.

260
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,969

Be careful.

264
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,668
- Move it higher. Higher.
- Move it there.

265
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:10,748
Okay. That's good.

266
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:12,349
Okay.

268
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,590
Move it higher. Higher.

269
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,149
Excuse me,

270
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,809
who is getting married today?

271
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,810
- Leader Liu.
- Oh! Leader Liu?

272
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,400
Leader Xi Gua is so young and capable.

273
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,329
She must be married to someone as young and capable.

274
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:46,969
Can you tell me who she is marrying?

275
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,790
Our counselor.

276
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,649
Good.

277
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,889
It's good to marry a counselor.

278
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,349
Isn't your counselor

279
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:57,708
Ning Yi?

280
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,809
Yes.

281
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,469
Liu Xi Gua is marrying Ning Yi?

282
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,709
But Ning Yi is my nephew-in-law!

283
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:04,630
My cousin-in-law!

284
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,830
How can they get married?

285
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,869
No. No. Let me tell you! I don't agree!

286
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,150
I don't agree, either!

287
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,789
So, you are the family of our counselor.

288
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:15,809
What a coincidence.

289
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,930
Holy Master ordered that anyone who hinders the marriage

290
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,210
shall be killed.

291
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,609
This is such a good event.

292
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,389
I will see who dares to disagree with it.

293
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,709
Yes. They are born to marry each other.

294
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,169
They will live happily forever. They will have their babies soon.

How can you ask him to marry me so easily?

304
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,229
I don't want to get married.

305
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,630
How can you control our lives?

306
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,269
You like him, don't you?

307
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,290
Of course, I should help you.

308
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,350
Why should I marry him if I like him?

309
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,349
I have never thought like that.

310
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,748
In the hall, you said you liked him in front of so many people.

311
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,249
So he has to marry you.

312
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,649
I promised your late father that I will make you happy.

Aunt,

314
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:20,370
Xi Gua said she's unwilling to do so.

315

Chen Fan, give me a break.

316
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,129
Xi Gua can marry someone she likes.

317
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:26,370
What's bad about it?

318
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,570
This is my own life. Don't force me.

319
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,210
Xi Gua, this is not your own business now.

320
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,649
If only you didn't say you liked him.

321
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:41,050
Yet you said it and it happened in front of so many people.

322
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,050
You are the leader of Badao Camp.

323
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,989
You can't even marry him?

324
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,890
You would lose your face.

325
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,369
You would embarrass the whole Badao Camp.

326

Everyone in the eight camps wants to take his life now.

334
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,770
If he marries you, nobody will dare to lay a finger on him.

335
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,850
If you don't marry him,

336
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,390
Xuanwei Camp won't let him get away with it and you know it well.

337
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,309
If he is caught by them,

338
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,309
I can't guarantee he will stay safe.

339
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,210
So, Xi Gua, I won't force you.

340
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,970
You decide whether you'll marry or not.

341
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,050
Master, Ning Yi has been married.

342
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,210
You both know it.

343
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,890
He is just a matrilocal husband.

344
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,290
We can force him to divorce.

345
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,990
But…

346
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,990
But… Ning Yi and his wife love each other.

347
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,029
I don't want to break up a family.

348
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,889
He can love his wife.

349
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,089
Then he can also fall in love with you, too.

350
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,050
You should be more confident.

351
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,050
And if he marries you, he has to divorce his wife.

352
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,110
You can't share a husband with another woman.

353
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,790
- Xi Gua!
- This kid has been spoiled by us.

354
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,550
Master,

355
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,730
how about the situation in the Secret Investigation Department?

356
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,529
After the sneak attack,

357
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,570
we lost half of our people.

358
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,789
We need some time to recover.

359
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,850
But we only have three days left.

360
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,089
The attack failed.

361
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,169
I guess the powder may have been transferred.

362
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:33,869
We don't have enough people in the city to cooperate with Dong.

363
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,250
It seems we have to make an opportunity

364
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,790
to attack them when they have a weak defense.

365
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,330
I understand.

366
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:53,749
And please report to Right Chancellor Qin.

367
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:57,370
Also tell him not to worry too much.

368
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,209
I will think of a solution

369
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,229
to get back Lin'an.

370
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,090
Ning Yi.

371
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,150
Ning Yi, you are here.

372
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,150
I have been looking for you. I have something important to tell you.

373
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,490
What's wrong?

374
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,390
I can't refuse our marriage.

375
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,830
We killed Bao Wen Han.

376
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,570
It would not be easy for them to forget it.

377
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,509
You knew it.

378
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,329
If they make it difficult for your family,

379
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,970
I will send them out of the city first.

380
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,290
When it's all over, we will get back to what we are. Your wife will still be your wife.

381
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,530
All things happening here won't be effective.

382
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,169
Let's find a way to help you survive.

383
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,490
Thank you.

384
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,889
It's nothing.

385
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,770
Explain it clearly to your wife.

386
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,609
The reason why I said I like….

387
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:03,309
I said that nonsense

388
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,950
in order to protect you.

389
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,270
It's a deal.

390
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,849
Talk to your wife about this.

391
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,930
Ask her not to take it seriously.

392
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,210
I'm leaving now.

393
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,810
Liu Xi Gua.

394
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,770
What's wrong?

395
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,490
You are being wordy.

396
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:31,630
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,789
Sorry for what?

398
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,950
You are my friend! You owe me this!

399
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,649
My dear.

400
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,509
Where have you been?

401
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,129
I had a meeting.

402
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:42,670
Tell me the truth.

403
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,509
I went to drink.

404
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,209
I heard Young Master Ning will marry Leader Liu in Badao Camp.

405
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,129
I should send my congratulations.

406
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:56,010
A big wedding is coming.

407
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,650
Do you want to divorce your wife

408
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,890
or make her your concubine?

409
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,670
Stand there!

410
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,389
Are you allowed to come?

411
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:10,548
- It was all fake. It was all fake!
- Say it louder!

412
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,069
It's just a show. It's fake!

413
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,310
Fake?

414
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,810
And you agreed! Didn't you?

415
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,649
No, no, my dear.

416
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:24,249
Kneel down!

417
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:28,689
Don't. It's quite dangerous...

418
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,490
We actually have a plan.

419
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,329
What plan?

420
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:39,089
I dare not say it since you're pointing scissors at me.

421
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:40,290
Well, I will stop teasing you.

422
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,050
Hubby, what is your plan?

423
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,089
Tell me.

424
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,390
You scared me to death!

425
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,149
We do have a plan.

426
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:54,830
But you have to cooperate with us.

427
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,789
Now I have to cooperate.

428
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,870
That is to say, I have to help you marry another lady. Right?

429
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,830
Young Master Ning, you look like an honest man

430
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,210
but you do know how to enjoy yourself by having two wives.

431
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,810
No.

432
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,710
Did I allow you to come?

433
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,970
Sit back.

434
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,490
Fine, I will.

435
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,249
Say it.

436
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,809
Nephew-in-law! Nephew-in-law!

437
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,809
I have been looking for you.

438
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,490
Come. Come.

439
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,708
I have something important to tell you.

440
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,609
Stop.

441
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,708
It can't be more important than mine.

442
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,409
I have…

443
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,169
You might no longer be my cousin-in-law.

444
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,210
Isn't that important?

445
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,390
Yes.

446
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,010
Tan'er, you know about his coming wedding.

447
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,250
What are you going to do?

448
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,230
How dare a matrilocal husband marry another lady?

449
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,609
This is really immoral.

450
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:55,849
Nobody can stand it.

451
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:57,569
If it is known by people in Jiangning,

452
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:00,010
- our grandfather will be pissed off.
- Yeah.

453
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,450
Uncle, we already have a plan to cope with the wedding.

454
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,908
Don't worry.

455
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,509
We still have something to do. We've got to go.

456
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:07,969
Let's go.

457
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,408
Hey, Tan'er. Tan'er!

458
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:10,250
Ning Yi.

459
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,850
Cousin-in-law.

460
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:14,290
Father.

461
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,990
Tan'er knew Ning Yi would marry another girl.

462
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,690
Has she gone crazy or just lost her soul?

463
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,809
She didn't cry or make a fuss about it but she smiled.

464
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:25,029
Since when did young people become this open now?

465
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,468
We can't let it happen.

466
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,468
I will have to ask her again.

467
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,209
Come back! Come back.

468
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,690
Wen Xing, think about it.

469
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,330
If Ning Yi marries Liu Xi Gua,

470
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,729
then he'll be dumped by the Su Family.

471
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:41,710
Tan'er has to divorce him anyway.

472
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,569
Without Ning Yi,

473
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:49,210
can Tan'er still manage the family business?

474
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,669
You mean… In this way,

475
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:57,609
the property of the Su Family will belong to us.

476
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:02,010
This couple has contributed a lot to our family.

477
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,549
But who would know we'll get their fruits?

478
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,789
Then we will be the richest people in Jiangning.

479
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,950
Lay low.

480
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,490
I'm so happy to even think about it.

481
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,870
What you said is right.

482
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:24,789
But how can we get back to Jiangning?

483
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,810
I know nothing good will happen to us.

484
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,690
It is so strange.

485
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,468
There used to be a house.

486
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,190
Now it is gone.

487
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,570
Forget it.

488
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,530
You four build a house here for me.

489
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,609
I don't need a fancy one or anything.

490
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,350
I just want a house that will accommodate

491
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:55,589
more than ten people and not collapse.

492
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,789
I want to see it by tomorrow.

493
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,869
Tomorrow?

494
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,610
That's too hasty.

495
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,249
What?

496
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,710
You all have become lazy in the city.

497
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,050
Back when we were in the mountains, you could build one in half a day.

498
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,990
Hurry up!

499
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,990
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.

500
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,290
Why are you building a house?

501
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:27,489
Master.

502
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,269
Master. Madame.

503
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:41,808
- I knew that Chen Fan is in love with Xi Ggua.
 - Master, let me out!

504
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:42,730
Yes.

505
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,951
We have watched him grow up.

506
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:45,370
- Madame! 
- I know him so well.

507
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,109
- Leader Fang. 
- But they don't match each other.

508
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,250
They both like to fight with their swords.

509
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,950
- If they get married—
- Xi Gua can't get married!

510
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,869
- How can they live peacefully? 
- She can't!

511
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,349
- Lock him here first. 
- Master!!

512
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,210
- In case he causes any trouble on her wedding.
- Master!

513
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,950
After the wedding, we will free him.

514
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,250
Put it over there.

515
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,410
What has Ning Yi been doing these days?

516
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,390
Nothing special.

517
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,410
- He sent his wife to Lou's Cloth Store.
- Slow down.

518
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,589
He should be back by now.

519
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:26,869
After his wedding with Xi Gua, don't let him meet his ex-wife.

520
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,930
- And don't invite his family here.
- I think it's good.

521
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,889
I will go to check on Xi Gua.

522
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,909
Send our invitations to all the camps. Don't miss any camps.

523
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,049
- Yes.
 - Put it over there. Hurry up!

524
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,790
Erhei, make sure the flag is in place. Set it well.

525
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,110
Okay.

526
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,129
Stop what you're doing for a while.

527
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,929
Come here.

528
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:02,828
Now, there is an urgent task for us.

529
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,890
- Okay.
- No problem!

530
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,249
Drink more.

531
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:09,230
Come on. Drink more.

532
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,490
Why are you so late?

533
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,010
Buddy. Buddy.

534
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,828
May I ask you… if...

535
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:20,268
This is the wedding invitation of

536
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:22,469
- Leader Liu and our Young Master?
- Yes.

537
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,450
Are we invited?

538
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,209
- No.
- No?

539
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,330
My nephew-in-law is marrying again but you don't even invite us?

540
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,490
We are the richest people in Jiangning.

541
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,788
But the truth is you are not invited.

542
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,130
Why?

543
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,809
Is there a problem?

544
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,629
Any problem?

545
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,329
No. No. No.

546
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:44,228
After all, we are relatives of Tan'er.

547
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,209
They are afraid that we may cause trouble.

548
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:47,950
- I can understand.
- I understand.

549
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,109
Father, don't worry, don't worry.

550
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,308
If they don't invite us, we will go eat something even better.

551
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,888
- Of course!
- I'll leave you alone.

552
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,129
We have sent the invitations to all eight camps

553
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,050
and not one is missed.

554
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,930
I know that.

555
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,030
You can go now.

556
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,469
Aunt, it's just a wedding.

557
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:16,909
We don't have to invite that many people.

558
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,429
You have no idea.

559
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,389
Since it is your wedding ceremony, we have to make it big.

560
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,289
It's troublesome.

561
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,350
You are going to get married.

562
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,689
Don't carry your sword all day.

563
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,969
I'm used to it.

564
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:34,910
I know you so well.

565
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:36,330
When you have something on your mind,

566
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,169
you like to play with your sword.

567
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:39,669
What?

568
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,569
Are you are getting nervous?

569
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,189
There is no need to be nervous.

570
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:48,610
Although we forced him to marry you,

571
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,970
we are all chivalrous people.

572
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,689
We never cared about these trivial manners.

573
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,450
After your wedding, if you get along well with him,

574
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,589
he will fall in love with you.

575
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,809
You are such a beautiful girl.

576
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,189
So many guys want to marry you.

577
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,650
Ning Yi is so lucky to have you.

578
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,710
Nonsense.

579
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,869
Between him and I…

580
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,748
Well, enough.

581
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:14,090
I will stop.

582
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,629
You have to get prepared now.

583
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,450
I know.

584
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,890
Aunt, please go back first.

585
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,110
Please leave me alone.

586
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,828
All right.

587
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,210
I will go. I will.

588
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:32,310
Have a rest early tonight.

589
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,390
I know that.

590
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,490
Father,

591
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:05,790
I'm getting married

592
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,590
tomorrow.

593
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,369
Father,

594
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:49,529
thank you for taking care of me all the way along.

595
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:51,989
You are my son.

596
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:55,089
Don't say things like that.

597
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,930
Although it was a tough journey,

598
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,449
we got good results in the end.

599
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,009
Yes.

600
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,429
We have worked hard for half of our lives

601
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,669
and finally, become rich merchants.

602
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:14,790
Yet we can't even

603
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,450
spend our money in the city during the lockdown.

604
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:22,189
Why?

605
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,810
My son.

606
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:32,250
This is the so-called destiny.

607
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:37,269
Father, look.

608
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,329
We finally have somewhere to spend our money.

609
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,249
Welcome. Steamed buns that just came out.

610
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:45,330
- Do you want one?
- I will buy two.

611
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,670
What? Two? That's not enough.

612
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,689
How many people do you have in your family?

613
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:50,689
Fifteen, please.

614
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,389
Okay.

615
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,450
Please. 30 cash in total.

616
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,290
Give me your address.

617
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,729
I will send the money to your house later.

618
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,609
Hold on.

619
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,748
You want me to give you credit even when buying some steamed buns?

620
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,669
Are you crazy because of poverty?

621
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:04,890
Poverty?

622
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,890
I am not afraid to tell you.

623
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,430
We are the householders of the Su Family,

624
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,748
the richest family in Jiangning.

625
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:13,169
Have you heard of us? You must be afraid now.

626
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,970
We are just stuck in Lin'an now.

627
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,890
When we go back to Jiangning, we can even buy your stand,

628
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,729
let alone your steamed buns.

629
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:21,269
It's no big deal to us.

630
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:26,149
If you want to have a store, we can open one for you.

631
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,909
You can choose the location.

632
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,069
At that time, you won't have to work so hard

633
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,550
through the wind and rain by then.

634
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,550
Wen Xing, let's go.

635
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,030
Goodbye.

636
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,230
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

637
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,890
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

638
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,500
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

639
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,010
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

640
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:04,520
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

641
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,180
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

642
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,910
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

643
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:18,930
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

644
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,910
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,350
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

646

♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫
