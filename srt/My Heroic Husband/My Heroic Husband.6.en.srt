[My Heroic Husband]

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,050
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,500
Ning Yi, do you recognize this now?

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,090
Stop!

5
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,079
Father!

6
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Why are you here?

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,390
How dare you cause such a big trouble for me!

8
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,969
Ning Yi has gone too far—

9
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,079
I've already told you

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,229
to never do stupid things for a woman!

11
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,930
Go home!

12
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,890
Let me see

13
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,760
how you're going to handle the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting in a few days.

14
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,520
Our business has been steady for now.

15
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,620
But I think

16
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,450
the couple should try harder

17
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,639
- on their private life.
- Private life?

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,119
Private life?

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,220
- Do you mean…
- What private life?

20
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,649
I mean starting a family

21
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,610
and carrying on the family line for the Su Family!

22
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,939
That's right!

23
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:05,469
You see, Master Ning and Tan'er have been married.

24
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,550
Having kids is automatically on their to-do list.

25
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,510
But Master Ning

26
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,100
is living in the second wing still. It's not appropriate.

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,620
- He's still living in the second wing?
- In the second wing?

28
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,259
I don't want to see that, either.

29
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,939
But even though I'm Tan'er's mother,

30
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,569
I can't keep urging her to be pregnant.

31
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,479
That's why I hope you can help figure something out for me.

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
Well... do you have any ideas?

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,460
Don't worry!

34
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,249
I have a kind of medicine.

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,850
You only need to put it in the wine.

36
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,390
Let me tell you.

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,980
When my husband drank it, he never felt more alive!

38
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,380
Did you bring any here?

39
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll send someone to get it for you!

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,569
Listen, once he drinks the wine, it'll definitely take effect.

41
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,300
- Great!
- Let's give it a try later!

42
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,269
That's right. I'll count on you!

43
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,219
- It's my family's—
- Young Master is here.

44
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,479
- Oh here he is.
- He's back!

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,150
Young Master, you are back!

46
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,669
You've been busy for the whole day.

47
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,280
I didn't know where to find you.

48
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,679
So I came here for you.

49
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,719
Come on. Let me introduce.

50
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,239
These are the madams from the noble families in Jiangning.

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,849
They are all my good friends.

52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,679
- This is Auntie Bai.
- Auntie Bai.

53
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,559
- This is Auntie Hu.
- Auntie Hu.

54
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:25,410
- This is Auntie Jin.
- Auntie Jin.

55
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,759
They've heard so much about you but never met you in person.

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,809
So they are here today to meet you specially.

57
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,929
Oh, I don't dare.

58
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,879
- Come here.
- Sit down.

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,809
- Don't just stand there.
- Have a seat.

60
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,879
- Sit here.
- Come on. Sit down.

61
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,169
What a good-looking man!

62
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,849
- He's really good-looking!
- Look at his ears!

63
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,679
- You can tell he is blessed!
- That's right!

64
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,460
Tell me about it!

65
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,570
Of course. He's my son-in-law.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,039
He's been busy recently.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,080
Your aunties specially brought something for you

68
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,569
to replenish your energy.

69
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,169
I've been quite good recently.

70
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,569
I don't need that.

71
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,959
But we are worried about you.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,319
- You have been exhausted.
- It's to replenish your energy!

73
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,239
We are doing it for your good.

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,209
All right! Fine!

75
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,649
Here. Drink it up.

76
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,679
Come on. Here.

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Let me try it.

78
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,369
- Good! Have more!
- There you go!

79
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:11,929
Good job!

80
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,770
- Nice!
- Have some more! Have another bowl.

81
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,959
Drink more!

82
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,349
What's that taste? What wine is this?

83
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,480
It'll make you more alive than ever. It's tiger wine!

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,610
No! I've had enough!

85
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,729
It's okay. Come on. Drink it!

86
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,879
It's good wine!

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,929
Come on. Drink it up! Finish it.

88
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,680
Good! Good!

89
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,999
- Young Master!
- I can't.

90
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,879
You can! You definitely can.

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,720
- No! No!
- I can't drink anymore!

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,929
- I will fall asleep if I drink any more.
- Sleep is good!

93
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,189
You are supposed to sleep after drinking it.

94
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,289
- I'm going back.
- Go back and sleep.

95
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,469
- Go back to where?
- Your room is right here!

96
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,510
This is Tan'er's room!

97
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,959
You are married. You are a couple.

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,319
- Hers is yours.
- That's right!

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,380
This is your room.

100
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,619
Go in! Go in! Go in!

101
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,799
You must be tired! Go sleep!

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,009
- I'll take care of it.
- Give your mother a grandson soon!

103
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,450
- Go in!
- Okay!

104
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,590
I already told them I don't drink.

105
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,250
But your mother forced me to.

106
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,629
So I... drank a little bit.

107
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,570
She forced you?

108
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,270
Are...

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,230
Are you okay?

110
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,340
Tan'er,

111
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,950
it's so hot!

112
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,850
I can't bear it anymore!

113
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,319
I apologize!

114
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,520
What are you doing?

115
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,289
Calm down!

116
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,520
What drink did they give you?

117
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,100
I don't care.

118
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,000
If it weren't for the wine,

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,719
I wouldn't be able to do this!

120
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,850
Get yourself together!

121
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,570
But, isn't the wine way too effective?

122
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,849
Now you can be relieved, huh?

123
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,980
It's very effective!

124
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,800
Don't worry!

125
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,240
Where did you find the hammer?

126
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,480
I should ask you this.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,680
This is your room!

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,489
It's so much noise!

129
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,729
That's right.

130
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,239
My daughter has been weak since childhood.

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,050
Right.

132
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,340
Young people are energetic.

133
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,889
So I should prepare some invigorant for my daughter, too?

134
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,389
Okay. I'll prepare some for her later.

135
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,290
Remember to do it!

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,390
What are you doing here?

137
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,320
You'll know in a minute.

138
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,170
Almost done.

139
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,570
It works.

140
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,380
From now on, if something like this happens again,

141
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,610
I'll go back through this hole.

142
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,140
Then, you can pull this down to cover the hole.

143
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,680
That's all?

144
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,420
Then why are you still doing this?

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,600
Your mother won't leave if I don't!

146
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,880
This is all?

147
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,290
Very well!

148
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,440
Go back. Let me do it.

149
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,140
Y-You... slow down!

150
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,349
I'm an honest man. I can't have your mother misunderstand me.

151
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,730
How about this?

152
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,050
This is good!

153
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,170
It's such a good idea!

154
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,410
Madam, let's go back.

155
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,459
Give them some privacy.

156
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,439
That's right! Let's go.

157
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,730
Be careful! Let's go.

158
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,380
Are...

159
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,880
you sober now?

160
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,790
I'm okay. I feel better after sweating.

161
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,330
The day you took me to Xinmen Brothel,

162
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,540
I was going to say a few words to you.

163
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:48,090
I want to thank you for what you did these days.

164
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,339
I thought you were just an ignorant scholar,

165
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,599
but it turns out you helped me several times

166
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:59,390
and got Su's Cloth Store back on track.

167
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,730
What you are saying? It's too polite.

168
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,510
I've been curious actually.

169
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,790
Since you are so capable,

170
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,409
why do you settle for a life in a small and backward village?

171
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,930
You don't want to do business or take the exam for official rank?

172
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,810
You got me.

173
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,680
How should I explain it to you?

174
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,160
You see this hole?

175
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,380
Actually I came from the other side of a magic hole,

176
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,570
through which I somehow ended up becoming Ning Yi.

177
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,140
Can you understand if I put it this way?

178
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,900
No.

179
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,020
Even though I don't understand,

180
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,570
I do find that you are so much better than before.

181
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,670
Of course.

182
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,429
I just didn't bring my muscles with me. It'd be better if I could.

183
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,370
Muscles?

184
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,570
I mean my body.

185
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,750
They are part of your appearance.

186
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,590
I don't think appearance is that important.

187
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,510
One's family background,

188
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,380
social status, or gender aren't, either.

189
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,750
What matters is one's moral character and capabilities.

190
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,930
That's why are you fighting for the seal of the Su Family?

191
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:39,170
You've seen what kind of people my uncle and my cousin are.

192
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,729
If the seal ends up in their hands,

193
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,570
the future of our cloth stores will be foreseeable.

194
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,390
And that's why I've been determined to take over the seal since childhood.

195
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,530
Unfortunately...

196
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,540
What?

197
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,380
[Su Tan'er]

198
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,111
Up until now, you still won't apologize?

199
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,689
You should be studying in the academy! Why did you sneak to the cloth store?

200
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,999
If the shopkeeper hadn't found you and sent you back, I would've still been kept in the dark!

201
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,129
I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologize?

202
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,520
I even sold all the fabrics my cousin didn't!

203
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,250
How dare you be defiant?

204
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,960
My father wanted me to do my own job and be a good housewife.

205
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,140
But I never wanted that for myself.

206
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,290
We've argued several times.

207
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,700
And gradually, we stopped talking to each other.

208
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,490
My father...

209
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,610
wasn't willing to see me, either.

210
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Tan'er.

211
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,030
Give it to me!

212
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,300
I've told you many times!

213
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,579
Don't get involved in the family business and don't think about making cloth.

214
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:45,559
You should focus on your studies! Your mother and I will offer you a good life.

215
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,869
But I like making cloth. I'm not lacking at all compared to my cousin.

216
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,630
He can be a businessman, so why can't I be a businesswoman?

217
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,729
I want to take over Su's Cloth Store in the future

218
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,049
and become the most successful businesswoman in Jiangning City!

219
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,030
Nonsense!

220
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,070
How can a girl run a cloth store?!

221
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,040
Do you know how difficult it'll be if you choose this?

222
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
It doesn't matter whether I'm a girl or boy.

223
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,690
What matters is I can choose my own path.

224
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,300
If you don't give up on this thought, don't acknowledge me as your father anymore!

225
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,079
And don't come home and cry if you encounter any difficulties outside later.

226
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,530
Why do I have such a rebellious daughter?

227
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,190
Haven't you ever thought

228
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,790
about finding a chance and talking to him?

229
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,200
Of course, I have.

230
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,750
But my father

231
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,030
doesn't want to understand me.

232
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,690
When I was in the wood house the other day,

233
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,880
I'd given my promise to your father.

234
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,820
I promised him that I'd help you get the seal.

235
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,780
After you get the seal, whether you want to divorce,

236
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,600
or remarry, or decide whom you love, you have the final say.

237
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,170
But your father told me that

238
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,340
your biggest dream is to get the seal.

239
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,960
He asked me to try my best to help you.

240
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,520
Actually, your father really cares about you.

241
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,860
You two are so much alike.

242
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,470
You are both stubborn.

243
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,720
You both want the other person to speak first. No one is willing to step forward.

244
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,020
It's the new business card of our cloth store. Here!
[School of Male Virtue]

245
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,720
Guys, please distribute the cards for us!

246
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,260
It's so exquisite!

247
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,870
Just a piece of paper. What's so good about it?

248
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,490
By the way, Brother Ning. I read from the government report

249
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,050
that your family will have a clan meeting today

250
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,550
and hand over the seal to your wife!

251
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,229
By then, Brother Ning's wife will be the first female head of the household in Jiangning City!

252
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:40,470
Brother Ning really married an extraordinary woman!

253
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,409
Gao Qiu has improved a lot! He's become smooth-tongued.

254
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,509
My dear! My dear!

255
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,340
My wife is here to pick me up.

256
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,270
It's late now. I should go home, too.

257
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,920
Me, too.

258
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,269
- Brother Ning, goodbye!
- See you.

259
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,639
- We are leaving.
- See you tomorrow.

260
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
Everybody,

261
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,830
today is

262
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,459
the Su Family's annual clan meeting.

263
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:33,610
I'd like to seize this chance and announce something important to you.

264
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,890
Everyone, take a look.

265
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,369
This is the seal of our Su Family.

266
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,080
Today, I'll hand it over to my granddaughter,

267
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,510
Su Tan'er!

268
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,730
Hold on!

269
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,450
Thank you for checking the accounts.

270
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,030
When our Lady becomes the seal holder,

271
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,560
she'll reward you all!

272
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,069
Manager Xi, our Lady will be the first female seal holder in Jiangning City ever,

273
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:50,409
and she values you a lot.

274
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,090
You'll be promoted sooner or later!

275
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,119
Hope I can have your support in the future!

276
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,100
Stop such nonsense.

277
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,029
I think Ning Yi has made you muddled with his move.

278
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,859
Just feel free to play.

279
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:26,640
He's got something.

280
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,859
The business of Su's Cloth Store is booming,

281
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,319
almost making it as the top one store in Jiangning.

282
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,060
And Ning Yi is the wire-puller who makes it happen.

283
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,629
Speak of the devil!

284
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:44,199
Master Kang! Master Qin!
[School of Male Virtue]

285
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:47,959
I haven't visited you so for long. I've been busy with the cloth store.

286
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,909
Finally, I got some spare time, and here I am.

287
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,629
I just knew you'd play Go here.

288
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:54,360
I brought a small gift for you two.

289
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,630
Here. Please accept it.

290
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,450
Master Kang.

291
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,679
- What is it?
- This is the new business card of our store.

292
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,060
The prices of the fabrics and our address are printed on it.

293
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,819
If you want to buy cloth, you can find us according to the address.

294
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,000
You just need to mention my name, and they'll give you a discount!

295
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
How interesting!

296
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,430
Only you can think of such an idea!

297
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,869
Manager Xi, something's wrong with the eldest Master's store accounts!

298
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,570
It's not ours!

299
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,880
Someone has switched the account book!

300
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,060
Father, the auditing isn't over yet.

301
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,029
How can you hand over the seal so rashly?

302
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,029
I've had a little review of her accounts.

303
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:58,690
There's no problem.

304
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,280
Then...

305
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,790
let's check it again.

306
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,999
You came at the right time. You can play with Master Qin for a few rounds.

307
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:29,159
I'll go get a chair. You forgot to bring a chair again.

308
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,549
- All right!
- Here, please.

309
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,229
- Here. Have a seat.
- All right, all right!

310
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,890
Master Qin, you still can't get over this move?

311
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,159
Last time you asked me to take the first move with my White stone.

312
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,510
I didn't want to take advantage of you,

313
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,790
so I intentionally placed it in the corner to give you an upper hand.

314
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,080
I say, you...

315
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,559
You just wouldn't tell me what that was!

316
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,719
I've been thinking about that for days, and I just couldn't figure it out.

317
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,850
Yet your reasoning is

318
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,129
you just didn't want to take advantage of your opponent!

319
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,930
You...

320
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,610
We matrilocal respect the old and care for the young.

321
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,080
Here. I got a chair.

322
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Little Friend, I heard that your wife

323
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,409
- will get the seal of the Su Family today.
- Yes.

324
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,230
So will you participate in the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting?

325
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,110
How come you also mention it?

326
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,500
Many people have mentioned it to me recently.

327
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,039
What on earth is it about?

328
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,249
It's an event that gathers all cloth stores.

329
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,099
They'll invite performers to play music

330
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,279
while reading poems and invite some artist friends to appreciate it.

331
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,439
Master Qin and I will be there, too.

332
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,270
We are looking forward to your performance!

333
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,319
Don't, please!

334
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,749
I don't know how to sing. I only know how to play Go.

335
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:59,550
Go ahead, Master Qin.

336
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,650
[Accounts]

337
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,729
The accounts involve 138,300 taels.

338
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,940
Half of the numbers are mismatched.

339
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,610
Tan'er,

340
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,550
how will you explain this?

341
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,090
Grandfather, please believe in me!

342
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,970
Your grandfather trusts you too much,

343
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,859
so he didn't even check your accounts carefully.

344
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:32,679
No wonder your several months of revenue

345
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,730
would exceed our years' revenue.

346
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,630
Turns out you fabricated the accounts!

347
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,260
[Accounts]

348
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,800
Tan'er, you just started in this business,

349
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,790
yet you already played dirty.

350
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,240
How are you supposed to go far and convince others?

351
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,580
How are you supposed to lead our Su Family to prosperity?

352
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,510
You claim that there's something wrong with the accounts.

353
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,310
But you keep the account books in your warehouse.

354
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,760
How could they be switched?

355
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,260
Even though you desperately want the seal,

356
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,180
you can't take such dishonorable actions.

357
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,829
Grandfather, these are the accounts of the cloth store. Please have a look.

358
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,410
Okay.

359
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,779
Grandfather, these accounts are fabricated.

360
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,359
Of course. You are the one who did that.

361
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,879
Tan'er is a girl. It's reasonable if she makes mistakes.

362
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:44,090
Elder Master, why don't you let Zhong Kan take over the seal today?

363
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,979
That's right. It's more important to make clear the accounts.

364
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:50,949
I know my daughter best! She'll never forge the accounts!

365
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:53,169
Tan'er has been smart since childhood. Even if she did that,

366
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:56,639
she would do a flawless job and no one would even find out.

367
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,610
Tan'er can't wait to get the seal.

368
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,870
It's possible that she didn't make it perfect.

369
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,280
Father, today, the seal…

370
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,620
Grandfather, please give me two hours.

371
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,830
I promise I'll sort out the accounts.

372
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,799
Young Master! Something's wrong! Something came up at home!

373
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,280
Elder Master, the accounts match now!

374
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,249
No way!

375
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,030
How can Su Tan'er remember so many entries?

376
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,130
Just because you can't, doesn't mean that I can't, either.

377
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,179
Since Tan'er took over the store, she's been holding the account books into sleep every night.

378
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,560
The first thing she did in the morning is to check the accounts.

379
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,309
She personally deals with every single matter of the store.

380
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,380
Of course she remembers all the deals and entries.

381
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,060
That's right. However,

382
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,390
sister-in-law, you just said even if Tan'er fabricated the accounts,

383
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,630
she'd do a perfect job.

384
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,610
And now the accounts all match,

385
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,989
I'm afraid it's because she's good at fabricating.

386
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:09,690
I... just now, I wasn't thinking straight. I was just saying it.

387
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,999
I was out of my mind! Tan'er will never ever forge the accounts!

388
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,159
Eldest Auntie, how can you prove it?

389
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,570
My father said I'd get married this year, yet I'm still single.

390
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,459
Su Tan'er, you have no evidence to prove the authenticity of the accounts.

391
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,159
So it means they are fake!

392
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,060
She's innocent until proven guilty!

393
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,250
Cousin-in-law, you really are ignorant about the Law.

394
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,309
You are matrilocal! You are not qualified to attend our clan meeting!

395
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:40,980
Get out!

396
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,280
Cousin-in-law, I have to say you are quite lucky.

397
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,910
You always get what you want.

398
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,850
You'd win a lot of money if you play mahjong.

399
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,560
You want proof, right? Here's the proof.

400
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,679
Since my wife opened the store,

401
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,900
I've kept all the receipts for purchases and sales.

402
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,400
If you don't believe me, you can go through all the receipts

403
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,100
and ask all the customers one by one.

404
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,400
I promise you they will all match.

405
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
All right. I won't disturb your private meeting anymore.

406
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm leaving.

407
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,200
Grandfather, bye.

408
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
[Su Manor]

409
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Tan'er, you've had a high aim since you were little.

410
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,200
But as a woman,

411
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,000
you don't have any advantage in business.

412
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,600
You have to work three times harder than other males.

413
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,300
It may even destroy your marital life.

414
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,600
I've been worried that you couldn't enjoy the warmth of family

415
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,100
and have someone who cares for you.

416
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,000
But now it's good,

417
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,800
because you have Yi'er by your side.

418
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,600
You two can help each other and make decisions together.

419
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,500
It's a great relief to me.

420
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,700
Father,

421
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,300
Tan'er is outstanding, but she's a woman after all.

422
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,400
It's inappropriate to have a woman become the seal holder.

423
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,400
If people know about this, they'll definitely gossip about us!

424
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,300
The gender doesn't matter at all!

425
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,800
Our father is selecting a person who's best at running business.

426
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
The decision can't be influenced by gender.

427
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,600
Tan'er has been interested in making cloth since she was little.

428
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,200
She used to skip the academy

429
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,800
and go to the cloth store to watch people weave and dye cloth.

430
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,900
She has a gift in making cloth and running business.

431
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,000
Everybody in Jiangning City knows it.

432
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,800
There's no denying that since Tan'er took over the cloth store,

433
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,500
our business has been thriving!

434
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,200
Tan'er,

435
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,900
the seal holder

436
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,400
needs not only take care of the whole family,

437
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,200
but also should be responsible for the future of the family business.

438
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
You are a woman,

439
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,400
yet you chose a tough way,

440
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,900
which means you have to workten times harder than men.

441
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Can you do that?

442
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
I can!

443
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
Our family motto,

444
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
"Respect the elders, assist the peers and protect the young."

445
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,400
Can you do that?

446
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
I can!

447
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
Businessmen have to travel around.

448
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Not only do you have to set your family as priority,

449
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,500
you also need to help the world become better.

450
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,400
Can you do that?

451
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
I can!

452
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,800
But our Su Family has never had a female as the seal holder.

453
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Then we'll make history today!

454
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,439
Well said!

455
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
I've made up my mind!

456
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,900
Tan'er,

457
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,600
come here.

458
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
Today,

459
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,000
I'll officially hand over the seal

460
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,600
of Su Family to you.

461
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,000
From now on, you'll be in charge of the family affairs.

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Do you understand your responsibilities now?

463
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
Grandfather,

464
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
I understand!

465
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Good!

466
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,200
Father, thank you for what you did today.

467
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,800
Father-in-law.

468
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Father-in-law.

469
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
He...

470
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,700
He's a proud man.

471
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,200
It's already good enough.

472
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,900
Wifey.

473
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,200
As the first female seal holder of the Su Family ever,

474
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,400
how are you feeling right now?

475
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,700
I feel... great!

476
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,200
Happy?

477
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
I can see you are happy!

478
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,900
You've even prepared wine for celebration.

479
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,800
You said so because you wanted to give me a surprise.

480
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,000
You prepared it, right?

481
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,700
All right.

482
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,400
Who cares who prepared it?

483
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,700
Let's drink!

484
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,100
Let's!

485
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Come on!

486
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,200
Little Tan Tan!

487
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Drink it!

488
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,200
You can't drink anymore?

489
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
You are drunk, aren't you?

490
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I can drink.

491
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,600
Su Tan'er,

492
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,500
let me tell you.

493
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,000
As for the seal you got this time, you take half credit for it,

494
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,600
and I'll take the other half.

495
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Without me, you wouldn't have been able to obtain it so quickly.

496
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,300
Congratulations!

497
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
You helped me get the seal.

498
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,400
Congratulations!

499
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,000
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

500
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,400
Tan'er,

501
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
wait a minute.

502
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I have a surprise for you.

503
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,500
Wait here.

504
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,800
Congratulations!

505
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Here come the dishes!

506
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,600
You are so self-absorbed!

507
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm carrying the plate yet you don't even bother to clean the table!

508
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,800
Look!

509
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
These are my treasures!

510
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
What's this?

511
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,200
It's called millenium egg, and you can also call it Songhua egg.

512
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,600
It's made of duck eggs.

513
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
Dip it into the chili sauce.

514
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
I promise you'll like it.

515
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Here, here. Open your mouth.

516
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,800
I don't want it!

517
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
Eat it. Don't spit it out!

518
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
It's delicious.

519
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
Now, do this.

520
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,900
You've swallowed it?

521
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Isn't it nice?

522
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,700
The first bite

523
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,800
was a little disgusting.

524
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,200
But the aftertaste

525
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,900
is very good!

526
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,600
There you go!

527
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,800
That's the magic of millenium eggs!

528
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,200
Don't eat too much.

529
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,000
You'll be addicted if you eat too much.

530
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You are feeling dizzy?

531
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Yes!

532
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,800
That's because you drank wine!

533
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
I feel dizzy!

534
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,200
Don't hit me!

535
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
The millenium egg goes with everything.

536
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
Besides the sauces here, you can also dip it into sugar.

537
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,500
Tasty!

538
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
You can also dip it in honey!

539
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
Honey is delicious.

540
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,400
You can also dip it in honey locust powder!

541
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,000
Honey locust powder is delicious!

542
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And cement!

543
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Cement is also delicious!

544
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
And asphalt!

545
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,400
Asphalt is also delicious!

546
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,600
- And mercury!
- Mercury...

547
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,300
And sulfuric acid!

548
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,900
- And…
- Ning Yi!

549
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
You are making fun of me!

550
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
- I'm not!
- You are!

551
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
- I'm not.
- You are!

552
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm going to punish you!

553
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How will you punish me?

554
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,400
I want you to go attend

555
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting with me!

556
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are!

557
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't know how to write a poem. Why should I go there?

558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,200
It's a punishment for you!

559
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,500
No! I'm not going!

560
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,300
You have to!

561
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,800
You can go there alone.

562
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
People all know that we are a couple.

563
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
How can I go by myself?

564
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Fine. I'll go.

565
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
But you have to give me more money.

566
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,100
Five hundred taels!

567
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,400
Twenty taels!

568
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,800
Four hundred taels!

569
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Twenty-five taels!

570
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Three hundred taels!

571
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,800
Thirty taels!

572
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
Two hundred taels.

573
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,900
F-Fifty taels.

574
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,800
How about one hundred taels?

575
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Fifty-five taels.

576
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Twenty taels.

577
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Fine then.

578
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
It's so hot!

579
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Why does...

580
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Why does the wine taste so familiar?

581
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,900
So hot! So hot!

582
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,999
It's right that you are hot.

583
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,300
This is the tiger wine from your mother.

584
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
What is tiger wine?

585
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
Tiger wine…

586
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,200
I can't take it anymore.

587
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
I apologize!

588
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,400
Tiger wine!

589
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
How dare you let me drink this?

590
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
You are so despicable!

591
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
I-It wasn't me who brought it!

592
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
You pervert!

593
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
How can you let me drink this?

594
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Water! Where's the water?

595
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,300
Ning Yi!

596
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,600
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

597
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,400
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

598
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,200
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

599
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,800
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

600
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:08,200
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

601
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,800
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

602
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,600
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

603
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:22,800
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

604
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

605
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

606
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

607
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

608
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,400
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

609
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,800
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

610
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

611

616
