00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,500
Wen Xing, are you sure there's sour prune drink in it?

4
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Go to the east about 10,000 meters and then head south about 7,500 meters.

5
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,900
After walking through a forest,

6
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,200
you will see a fairy village drifting in the clouds and mist.

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
That's right, Father.

8
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,700
The sour prune drink is in there.

9
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,000
I know, Father.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Although it's the outhouse, no one says sour prune drink.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,900
can't be made in an outhouse.

12
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,800
Make sour prune drink in an outhouse?

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you crazy?

14
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
Perhaps there really is.

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,100
Xi Gua, the more I think about it, the more inappropriate it seems.

16
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Then, how about you be the Counselor?

17
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You can't just appoint a guy so randomly to be the Counselor.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
How about you be the Counselor?

19
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,600
You don't even know him.

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
How can you let him be the Counselor?

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
How about you be the Counselor?

22
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,088
That's enough.

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,000
Who says that I don't know him?

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
What are you doing, girl?

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
They're fighting, you know?

26
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,300
It's dangerous.

27
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,100
Don't forget to come to Jiangning and take revenge.

28
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,400
This is Wu Qi Hao from Wu family.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
His name is Wu Qi Hao.

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I met him once before I went into the city.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Alright, you just met him once.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,300
How could you know his background?

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,400
There's something special about him.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Xi Gua, the position of the Counselor can be critical.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,100
You-You can't just do anything stupid.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,300
Then... how about you be the Counselor?

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
Leader.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,700
How's it going?

39
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,600
I've got something.

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Go ahead.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,700
Wu Qi Hao lives in Jiangning City.

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,300
He's the Young Master of the well-known Wu's Cloth Store.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,200
They say that he always acts quickly

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,100
and he can be versatile.

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700
He has a corrupted morality.

46
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,600
He lives a voluptuous life,

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
and except for that, he's also a lecher.

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,700
He's bold and reckless and does whatever he wants.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,800
He once wanted to rape a rich girl.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,700
He's quite notorious in the whole Jiangning.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,400
Is that true?

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
A lecher?

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you hear that, Xi Gua?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
You want that kind of man to be the Counselor?

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,000
What we should do now is to kick him out.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Never mind. Forget it!

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,100
It doesn't matter.

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't care if he's a lecher or not.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
As long as he's capable.

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,700
Anyway, we have more lechers in the camp.

61
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Here's one.

62
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,000
- Yeah, yeah.
- Shut up!

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Shame on you.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Xi Gua, you must...

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,330
What now?

66
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,250
How about you be the Counselor then?

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
Fine.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
A'Sha, send these to that lecher.

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Okay.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
A lecher?

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Buddies, do me a favor.

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,200
I've got things to do.

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,000
The Leader ordered that no one shall leave the camp at will.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,400
Goodbye.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,700
I'm the Counselor. How dare you stop the Counselor.

76
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,200
That's what we were told to do.

77
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
The Leader said that we must fix our eyes on the Counselor,

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
and that the Counselor isn't allowed to leave the camp.

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Good girl.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Your Ladyship ordered me to handle some business outside the camp.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,700
You must make way now.

82
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,000
Your Ladyship has ordered that no one can go out without the token.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Unless you have her token...

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier about the token?

85
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Son, are you sure this is the hot spring?

86
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,509
Sure, Father.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
The water is warm.

88
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,400
Father, do you think

89
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
the hot spring-the hot spring is right underground

90
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,500
and we need to dig it ourselves?

91
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,800
Then we can take a bath in it.

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
That's possible.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Then, go try it.

95
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Okay.

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Father, where are you going?

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll wait for you on the carriage.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,100
Tell me when we can have a bath.

99
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,400
Father, digging it alone is a bit… inefficient.

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
We've got enough time.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
It's okay.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
Stop there!

103
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,800
What do you want?

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,100
The writs.

105
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Back off, back off.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Just put them here.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
- I'll put them on your desk.
- I said put them there.

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
All right.

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
There is a large gathering of the refugees.

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,800
I...
- Back off! Back off!

111
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Why-Why? What's wrong?

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
I'd like to keep a little distance now.

113
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
Fine.

114
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Counselor,

115
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
I didn't expect that you'd have this kind of fetish.

116
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
You don't look like that kind of person to me.

117
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,400
After all, you may know a person's face but not his mind.

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't expect that you'd admit it.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
But it's okay.

120
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
You don't need to feel ashamed.

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Actually, I don't.

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I feel honored.

124
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Ba Dao Camp is a big united family.

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,600
We will accept you no matter what you did.

126
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
What I see in you are your abilities.

127
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Yes.

128
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,800
I wouldn't have that kind of fetish if I didn't have the abilities.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,700
Just go back.

130
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,400
Got flattened, huh?

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Well, why should you be ashamed of

132
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,100
being keen on making money in here?

133
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,200
Come on. What are you going to do with that money?

134
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,600
No matter where you go,

135
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll stay with you forever.

136
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,300
- Good for him.
- Lecher.

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You didn't know he's like that, huh?

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,100
Lecher.

139
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,000
I didn't.

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
He's got something.

141
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,289
Can you say that when he's not around next time?

142
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,200
Our Ba Dao Camp is a big united family.

143
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
We need to accept him, be inclusive. Okay?

144
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,400
It's not easy that he joined us.

145
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
We need to let him feel he's one of us gradually.

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,700
Look at yourselves!

147
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,300
You know best what you are.

148
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
Yet you are judging him?

149
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Go and do what you should do.

150
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

151
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,800
Counselor, don't be too upset.

152
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,600
I've already scolded them.

153
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
As an educated man, don't take their words seriously.

154
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,700
We're a big family. A big family.

155
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Lecher!

156
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
My arm!

157
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
Is it broken?

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Liu Da Biao!

159
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,200
Liu Da Biao!

160
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
How strong are you?

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
You are so fierce, Wu Qi Hao!

162
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
How dare you come on to me!

163
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm your Ladyship!

164
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
What a lecher!

165
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
I have been putting up with you for a long time.

166
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not Wu Qi Hao!

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you mean by lecher?

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,300
I didn't come on to you!

169
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
Get off! Fix my arm right away! It really hurts.

170
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Why were you being so cruel?

171
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'm not getting down!

172
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
I'd hack you apart if I did.

173
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,700
This is what a lecher like you deserves.

174
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
Lecher! Lecher!

175
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
You are still denying that you're a lecher!

176
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You're dead today.

177
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
You dare come on to me.

178
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,400
I'll kill you! Lecher!

179
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,800
Harm set, harm get.

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Help me turn over.

181
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
How is he?

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,500
He's still alive.

183
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,800
You hit him harder than me.

184
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,000
I did my research.

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
He's not Wu Qi Hao.

186
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
His name is Ning Yi and he is from Jiangning City.

187
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,600
That's all we know.

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Cut it out.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
Just go and fix his arm.

190
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You're truly bandits.

191
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
You hit me even without asking me in advance.

192
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700
Look what you have done to me.

193
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,300
At least I'm still a Counselor, right?

194
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm useful to you after all, huh?

195
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,700
Yet you treated me like this.

196
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,600
I guess you'd tear me apart and make me into a meal

197
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,000
if I became useless one day.

198
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,100
But it's you who told me Ba Dao Camp is a big family.

199
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,200
Even if you're not Wu Qi Hao, nor a lecher,

200
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,300
why did you steal my token without any reason?

201
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,700
Steal? Why did I do it?

202
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,200
I want to escape! All right?

203
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,400
We saved your life and appointed you as the Counselor.

204
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
We treated you so well.

205
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Why do you want to escape?

206
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
If you were me and were put in Wude Camp...

207
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,900
If you were threatened with broadswords on your neck

208
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,200
when you woke up...

209
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,000
If you were tortured when you didn't do your job well...

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,100
Would you not also try to escape?

211
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,400
The Counselor is right.

212
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
What we did today was truly reckless.

213
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
That's reckless.

214
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,800
We're not on the mountains now.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
We can't start a fight without any reason.

216
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,200
We can't be so violent.

217
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,500
We need to win people by virtue.

218
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,400
Leader, we didn't do it.

219
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
You did it, didn't you?

220
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
That's right.

221
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Enough about this.

222
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,800
You should learn a lesson from my mistake.

223
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,300
You want the token, right?

224
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
Here, take it.

225
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,900
In Lin'an City, everyone will regard this token as me.

226
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
It keeps you safe.

Thank you, Leader.

Have a good rest.

229

We'll leave now.

Xi Gua, aren't you afraid that he might run away with the token?

231

- Go on with your patrol.
- Yes.

236
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,500
Counselor, the Leader said that no one can go out randomly.

237
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
Nice.

238
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,600
You're quite responsible.

239
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
You see this?

240
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,300
This is the token of Leader Liu.

241
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
Now let me go, quickly.

242
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,800
The Leader said that we can give you as much convenience as you want,

243
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,000

Thank you, Heroine. Thank you for saving our lives!

Thank you for saving our lives!

-All right, enough.

336
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
This is not the right place for a quarrel.

337
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Now put me down. We will talk about this down there.

338
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Right! Brother Ning, it's urgent.

339
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
I'll go with you.

340
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
No, no, no. It can't hold two people.

341
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,500
- It can. Come on, come on.
- No, no, no.

342
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,100
It's fine. It's all right.

343
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,100
Slow down, slow down!

344
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,700
We're going down. It's going.

345
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,048
Keep going! Keep going!

346
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,200
Bring them up.

347
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,600
You're doing it wrong! The direction is wrong.

348
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,500
Why are we going up? Why aren't they going up?

349
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,700
It's wrong!

350
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,600
What's wrong with you?

351
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Why are you bringing us up?

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,900
- Yeah.
- He…

353
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Counselor, what are you busy for?

354
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,800
Fixing the wall.

355
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,500
And I found some prisoners by the way.

356
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
[Lin'an Prision]

357
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Put those in jail.

358
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
Yes.

359
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Move, hurry up!

360
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Hurry up!

361
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,500
Move.

362
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,000
Hurry! What are you looking at?

363
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Move.

364
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
Hurry up.

365
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,800
I want to know how you will make up another story for Liu Da Biao this time.

366
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,700
Hurry up.

367
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,400
Why did Ning Yi throw himself into the lap of the bandits？

368
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,200
We did that, too.

369
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
That's different.

370
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,000
Haven't you heard how that bandit leader addressed Ning Yi? The Counselor.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Right.

372
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,000
Cats hide their claws.

373
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,800
A surrender letter is worth thousands of dollars.

374
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,000
But what are we supposed to do now?

375
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,200
Don't worry.

376
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,500
We've got a protective umbrella.

377
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,800
You can't keep us here.

378
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
We work for the Leader Fang, Fang Qiong.

379
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
We serve Leader Fang and Mrs. Shao.

380
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Yes, that's right.

381
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm the cleaner.

382
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm the herbalist.

383
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,400
I'm the clerical officer.

384
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,700
I'm the cook.

385
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,000
It's almost midday.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,100
You'll be responsible for delaying

387
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,600
Leader Fang's lunch and massage.

388
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Buddies, I'm thinking for your own good.

389
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If you don't trust me, let me massage your shoulders and neck.

390
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well.

391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll make you feel very comfortable.

392
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Just have a try, buddy.

393
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Buddy, I'm one of you.

394
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
Buddy, let us out!

395
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
- Buddy!
- Buddy!

396
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
We're one of you!

397
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,400
- We really are!
- Buddy!

398
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Let go of me. Easy.

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Liu Xi Gua, what did I say?

400
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,800
He just wants to escape.

401
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,700
I caught him right under the wall.

402
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,800
It can't be wrong this time.

403
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Is that true?

404
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Get your hands off me!

405
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,600
Say it.

406
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll see what stories you will make up.

407
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,100
Your Ladyship, of course, that's not true.

408
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,800
You are just like what people said about you.

409
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
So annoying.

410
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,600
Why do you always get involved with Ba Dao Camp's business?

411
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Your Ladyship, I was supervising the repair work on the wall.

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,300
I even caught four prisoners who wanted to escape.

413
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,200
It was at that time, Leader Chen came up.

414
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,700
He insisted that I was with those four,

415
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,000
and that I also wanted to escape.

416
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Why do you think I'd escape?

417
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
We're still behind schedule today.

418
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,900
The work we did today all ends in vain.

419
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,000
When you ask me to hand over a completed project,

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,800
and then if I didn't finish it, who would be responsible? Me or him?

421
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Well, Your Ladyship, it seems that I, as the Counselor,

422
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,000
don't have much power.

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
I want to quit.

424
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Please ask someone else to do it.

425
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,300
I think you trust Chen Fan a lot.

426
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,000
Why not let him take my place?

427
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,700
I'm done.

428
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,400
You really have impressed me with your shamelessness.

429
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Liu Xi Gua, if you were there, you'd believe that this guy just wanted to escape.

430
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,900
Do you really think so?

431
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,400
Sha, Ren, Chang, Ming. Here.

432
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Did the Counselor escape today?

433
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
He didn't.

434
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,400
He worked so hard to supervise our work,

435
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
and he even let us have lunch before him

436
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
while he hasn't filled his stomach with anything till now.

437
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Yes.

438
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
He didn't even have time to eat

439
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
the black rice buns he asked me to bring for him.

440
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,100
I guess he must be very hungry now.

441
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
It's okay.

442
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,000
Everything is...

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
- Counselor.
- Counselor.

444
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,600
What's wrong? Take him there.

445
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
Don't be tricked by him. He's putting on a show.

446
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Hurry, sit here.

447
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
I may be too tired.

448
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
Hurry, give him the bun.

449
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,700
Counselor, you should eat.

450
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Here's your bun.

451
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Have some water.

452
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,900
Let's go. Take me to the wall.

453
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,600
The later we finish it, the more dangerous it will be.

454
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,100
You can't, Counselor.

455
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,800
He's so engaged!

456
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Chen Fan, you should know what's important now.

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,900
I don't care if he's putting on a show or not.

458
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
What I saw in him is that he can review the writs for me.

459
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,600
You can't just see this, Xi Gua.

460
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,100
Then what should I see?

461
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
You can't review them for me anyway.

462
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
We need a brain at this moment.

463
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,000
We need to use their strong points.

464
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,800
Your Ladyship...

465
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
The food distribution team has stopped.

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
It's just like what you said.

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The farmers in the east got enough food so that

468
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,900
there won't be a problem for them now.

469
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,600
As for the rats in our Camp, I've sent people to investigate.

470
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,500
We'll know the result in a few days.

471
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,400
Good.

472
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
One more thing.

473
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Holy Master kept a close eye on Qian Xi Wen.

474
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,100
He didn't agree to send him here.

475
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
When I sent people to negotiate with him,

476
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,500
every time we mentioned settling people's minds,

477
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,400
he refused without giving it a thought.

478
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,600
So, I think we must think about some other ways.

479
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,500
I didn't expect that Your Ladyship works so effectively.

480
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,600
I feel delighted for the people of Lin'an City.

481
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
It's their blessing.

482
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
On behalf of the citizens…

483
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,400
Counselor, Counselor, take it easy.

484
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,000
- Counselor.
-That's enough.

485
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You don't need to say flattering things in Ba Dao Camp.

486
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't fall for that.

487
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,600
As for Chen Fan, he's actually not a bad guy.

488
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,700
He is just a bit stubborn.

489
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't blame him.

490
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,300
Brother Fan is a sensitive man

491
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,500
and I'm green here.

492
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,300
It's normal to have some misunderstandings.

493
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,200
Forget it.

494
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I can't stay here any longer.

495
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
I need to see our soldiers.

496
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
- I can't stop, not even one second.
- Counselor.

497
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Tell them.

498
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,600
I'll only come back for a rest when they finish building the wall.

499
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,000
- Counselor, take it easy.
- Counselor, be careful.

500
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
Follow me.

501
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,600
Father, I was still wishing just now...

502
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,800
But when I saw the cliff,

503
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I was sure of the thought in my mind.

504
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,000
This map was made by a dumb bastard.

505
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Guard Geng!

506
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,400
We can't use this map anymore.

507
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Father, let's go back to Jiangning.

508
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,500
It's definitely better than here.

509
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,800
No.

510
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
We have only just left for a few days.

511
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,500
People will doubt us if we go back now.

512
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,200
In my opinion,

513
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
we've got the money anyway.

514
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,400
We can enjoy ourselves wherever we are.

515
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,300
Bastard.

516
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,800
Father.

517
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,100
Then where should we go next?

518
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,460
There are three counties in Jiuxiang, next to Lin'an City.

519
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,400
Let's go around them one by one.

520
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
That's good.

521
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,400
- Get in.
- Go.

522
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,700
Stop! Stop!

523
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,300
Stop! Stop!

524
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,600
Stop there! Stop there!

525
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,300
Enough, enough. Leave it.

526
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,600
Leave it.

527
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
We have the money anyway.

528
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,800
We could buy a new one.

529
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm exhausted.

530
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I put the money in the carriage.

531
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,900
Stop!

532
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,800
The money!

533
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,400
Stop!

534
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
The money!

535
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,700
Come back!

536
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,300
My money!

537
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,900
Leader, the quality of people in our Camp is getting increasingly higher.

538
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,600
- You did a good job educating them.
- Hey, Xi Gua!

539
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,900
Auntie.

540
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,800
No, no, no!

541
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
I just can't find you every time I want to see you.

542
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Please, Auntie, not today.

543
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,200
I need to deal with something.

544
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,100
I-I need to discuss business with the Counselor.

545
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,000
Yes, business.

546
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What business?

547
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,100
A blind date is what matters most.

548
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,600
Come on.

549
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,700
- Come on.
- Wait for me!

550
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,100
Hurry, you should look great.

551
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
New Year's hasn't come yet.

552
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
What's so important about it?

553
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Brother Fan,

554
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,200
why are you so mad under the burning sun?

555
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
What are you doing?

556
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Do you want to get beaten up?

557
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Don't get me wrong.

558
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
I was just thinking

559
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,600
that the most charming guy in Ba Dao Camp

560
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,200
must have something annoying on his mind.

561
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,200
Xi Gua, sit well.

562
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,100
It's okay, it's fine.

563
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,000
This is Young Master Dou.

564
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,400
His father Dou Min Zhong is a famous scholar in Lin'an.

565
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,000
Young Master Dou, Xi Gua isn't good at talking.

566
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
You can speak first.

567
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
Okay.

568
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Xi Gua.

569
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Who allowed you to come here?

570
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Go back.

571
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,600
Okay.

572
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,600
Young Lady Xi Gua,

573
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,200
my name is Dou Jing Zhi.

574
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm Liu Da Biao.

575
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
Hero, are you feeling better?

576
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Say it.

577
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,100
You're a bit impatient.

578
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I guess you wonder why

579
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,600
someone like you who can master pen and sword

580
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,500
and who's also handsome

581
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,600
just can't walk into a girl's inner world.

582
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,400
Do you know what it is that you lack?

583
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,600
Tenderness is what you lack.

584
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Tenderness?

585
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Tenderness is useless.

586
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,400
Yes, it is of no use.

587
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
But just think about it.

588
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you think the Holy Master will allow his daughter to marry

589
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,400
someone who doesn't know how to take care of her?

590
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
Miss Da Biao...

591
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,800
I heard from Auntie that you look very pretty and you're very smart.

592
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,500
I came here to meet you because of your Auntie's kind invitation.

593
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
No need.

594
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
There's no need to meet.

595
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
We just entered the city.

596
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,500
There're so many things to deal with.

597
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,800
I am so busy.

598
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Young Master Dou should leave

599
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,200
or it'll disturb our business.

600
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,800
Xi Gua, don't be so mean.

601
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,300
Young Master Dou is a gentleman

602
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,600
and his feelings for you are genuine.

603
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,000
How can you be so cold to him?

604
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,500
Auntie, I appreciate what you did

605
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,400
but I just want to put all my energy into my career.

606
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I don't have time for this.

607
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,900
You are not young anymore.

608
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,300
Marriage is the most important thing now.

609
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,600
I-I-I'll go to the toilet.

610
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,700
Didn't you just go there?

611
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,000
Counselor. Counselor.

612
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What are you doing here?

613
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Come on.

614
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,800
What's the matter now?

615
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,700
Come on and help me out.

616
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,300
How can anyone help you avoid your blind date?

617
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't care.

618
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,500
You are the Counselor.

619
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,200
You should deal with the difficulties for your Leader.

620
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,400
Guys, please allow me to introduce myself.

621
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
My first name is Yi, last name Ning.

622
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm the Counselor of Leader Liu in Ba Dao Camp.

623
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm mainly in charge of Leader Liu's everyday business,

624
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,100
including blind dates.

625
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,600
You can't deal with this.

626
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
Auntie, let me tell you.

627
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,000
I know I'm not so important, but I have been doing fortune-telling

628
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,800
in Jiangning City before I became the Counselor in Badao.

629
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm really good at analyzing whether it's a good match.

630
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,400
If that's the case, please analyze it for them.

631
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,500
Well then, I'll do as you say.

632
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Can anyone give me pen and ink?

633
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,200
Guys, take a look.

634
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,100
This is Leader Xi Gua's birth date.

635
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,300
The third day of the seventh lunar month.

636
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,000
A Fire-type girl.

637
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,800
This kind of women's personality is like fire.

638
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
They move like a wild rabbit.

639
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Although they aren't like normal girls,

640
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,600
they are brave and courageous,

641
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,200
much better than those delicate girls.

642
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,900
The best match of this kind of women is men of the Wind-type,

643
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,800
because the way they see a relationship is the same.

644
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,500
They are loyal.

645
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,800
That's right. Right.

646
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,400
I like guys who are loyal.

647
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,800
It's the best that he only likes me.

648
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Even if the number of girls who like him are countless,

649
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,000
he won't take a glance at them.

650
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I am exactly that kind of person.

651
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,700
A play boy.

652
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,400
Young Master Dou, please look.

653
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,600
This is Young Master Dou's birthday.

654
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
He was born on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month.

655
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,300
He's a Water-type guy.

656
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,700
Water.

657
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,500
The sea refuses no river.

658
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,200
Although he can be loyal,

659
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,400
he can be loyal to every girl in the world.

660
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,200
It's not the "loyal" Xi Gua wants.

661
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Auntie, he, and Xi Gua are incompatible like water and fire.

662
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,700
I see.

663
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,400
Young Master Dou, this way.

664
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Auntie, I'm definitely not a playboy.

665
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,500
You and Xi Gua just don't match.

666
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,800
But how did you know it?

667
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,200
I'm not a playboy at all.

668
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
You and Xi Gua really don't match.

669
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Xi Gua should be with a man who's serious and loyal.

670
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,600
- This way please, Young Master Dou.
- Don't, don't.

671
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
That's nonsense.

672
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:05,969
You're good, Counselor.

673
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,200
I'll leave it to you if I encounter something similar.

674
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Come on. You're not young anymore.

675
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Next time, I'll teach you those reckless inventions

676
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
so that you will be able to handle them on your own.

677
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,300
So you were just making up stories?

678
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,700
Not all of them are stories.

679
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,200
There are some theories about astrology in it.

680
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,800
Then teach me this astrology next time.

681
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,100
Okay, we will talk about it next time.

682
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,000
What kind of guy did you say is perfect for me?

683
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,400
Did you really believe it?

684
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Wind-type.

685
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,800
You need to analyze it more seriously when you have the time.

686
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,000
Tell me who's a Wind-type in Ba Dao. I'll keep my distance.

687
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,400
I'm not going to let those things disturb my ambition and grand plan.

688
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,900
All right.

689
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,900
- What's your type?
- Wind.

690
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,200
The wind is strong.

691
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,300
I need to check my clothes.

692
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,400
Tenderness?

693
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,000
Is he Wind-type?

694
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,900
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

695
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,500
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

696
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,200
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

697
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,800
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

698
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,200
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

699
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,700
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

700
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,700
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

701
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,600
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

702
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

703
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

704
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

705
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,400
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

706
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

707
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,700
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

708
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

709
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

710
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

711
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

712
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,500
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

713
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

714
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,900
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

715
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,300
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

716
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,400
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

717
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,400
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
