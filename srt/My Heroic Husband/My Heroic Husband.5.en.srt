[Episode 5]

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Young Master! Young Master!

4
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,600
Are you angry with me, Young Master?

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm not.

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,700
- Please let me explain, Young Master.
- No need to do that.

7
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,200
I didn't betray you.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Young Master, please say something.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,100
I didn't–

10
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,000
Here, let me help you.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Put it down!

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Old Geng, what are you doing?

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you mad at me?

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
It's none of your business.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Listen, there is an urgent situation now. I don't have time to explain to you.

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't tell anyone that I'm going out.

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,600
For the sake of all the novels I wrote for you.

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
You are mad at me.

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,400
Buddy, how much is the watermelon?

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,300
Five cash for each.

21
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,000
Pick yourself.

22
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,900
Good.

23
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,600
Stop running.

24
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Where is he?

25
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,840
[Nie Yun Zhu]

26
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,100
Young Lady, are you feeling better?

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
You are so bold.

28
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,500
How can you live here alone?

29
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,200
It's dangerous!

30
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
But luckily, you met me.

31
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,100
I'm a gentleman.

32
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Other guys would have done something evil to you.

33
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Mr. Savior, you are a real gentleman.

34
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
No.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Don't call me Mr. Savior.

36
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,100
I have a name.

37
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,200
My surname is Ning, given name Yi, and courtesy name Li Heng.

38
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
You can just call me Young Master Ning.

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,100
Mr. Savior sounds so awkward to me.

40
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm Nie Yun Zhu.

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Young Lady Nie.

43
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,200
Well, it's rare to see a girl like you

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,700
who lives by the Qinhuai River but cannot swim.

45
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,000
It's truly uncommon.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
- Because...
- I didn't live here before.

47
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a long story.

48
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Well... That's reasonable then.

49
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,800
Young Master Ning, let me dry your clothes.

50
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
You can have a rest in my room now.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,200
Don't catch a cold.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,600
Well, it's a bit improper for me to rest in a girl's room.

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,500
Don't worry.

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,100
I am very fit and in a good health.

55
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
It's just that I haven't exercised much recently.

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,400
When I was younger,

57
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,800
I could swim back and forth over ten times

58
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,900
in rivers as wide as Qinhuai River.

59
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,400
But I have to say that you know how to enjoy life.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Well, this corn looks very sweet and fragrant.

61
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
To eat it on a regular basis is beneficial to your health.

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,200
And the corn can be ground into cornmeal,

63
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
which can be made into delicious porridge.

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
My Lady.

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,200
Where's your Young Master?

66
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Young Master?

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,900
He...

68
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Isn't he in the room?

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
He's not.

70
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,100
Then I don't...

71
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,900
What's in your hands?

72
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
Give it to me.

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,200
My Young Master Falls in Love with Me Ⅱ.

74
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
- Where's the part one?
- Part one...

75
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
I've finished it and returned to him.

76
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,579
You two are quite intimate.

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,300
You went to Xinmen Brothel together,

78
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,800
and now you even dare to cover for him in front of me.

79
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,700
That's not true.

80
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, I've always been loyal to you, my Lady.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Loyal to me?

82
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,700
Show me your loyalty. Burn it.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll take you to find the Young Master.

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
This way, please.

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Young Lady Nie, are the geese also yours?

86
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes.

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Could I pet them?

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,900
Sure, suit yourself.

89
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,300
I'm coming.

90
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm coming. Coming!

91
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
My Lady, it should be here.

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,100
But we've walked for a long time,

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,000
and there's still no trace of Young Master!

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,900
Are you sure?

95
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,500
My Lady,

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,300
that's Young Master's stuff.

98
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Let's go.

99
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Excuse me, do you know where the owner of these things is?

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
He jumped into the river.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,800
- Jumped into the river?
- Yes.
- Jumped into the river?

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
My Young Master!

103
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,200
I didn't know you'd jump into the river.

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,000
I wonder why you were so emotional!

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Young Master.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
My Lady,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,600
it wouldn't have ended like this if I had stopped him from going out.

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Young Master. Young Master.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,500
I'll get you. Stop.

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,200
My Lady, it seems like I've heard Young Master's voice.

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,400
Is he coming back for me, Lady?

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
My Lady, you...

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,700
My Lady, where are you going?

114
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Young Master.

115
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,400
My Lady.

116
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,500
You can't escape from me.

117
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,400
This goose is really big.

118
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
Big and white.

119
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,300
Don't move. Hold still.

120
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,900
I'm coming. Coming.

121
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,500
Young Master Ning, the clothes are dry.

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,000
You can get changed in my room.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Okay.

124
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,800
My Lady.

125
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Young Master Ning, are you dressed up?

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Young Master Ning, you saved my life today.

128
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,000
Please take these duck eggs as a small gift.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,300
It's not appropriate.

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,200
These are a lot of duck eggs.

131
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,600
Young Master Ning, have some water.

132
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Let me.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
It's all right. Let me do it.

134
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,400
You are my Mr. Savior.

135
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm supposed to serve you.

136
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
Thanks then.

137
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
Sorry, Young Master Ning.

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,500
It's okay. I'm fine.

139
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
How about you take off your clothes?

140
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll dry it off for you again.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
I guess there's no other choice.

142
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Wait a minute.

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Three.

144
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,400
Two.

145
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
One.

146
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
Ning Li Heng!

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
I knew it.

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,900
That is my wife.

149
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,200
I didn't know you are such a person.

150
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
You learned nothing from the School of Male Virtue.

151
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,700
I thought you died in the river...

152
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Shame on you!

153
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,100
Let me explain. It's a complete misunderstanding.

154
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,400
Tan'er, there is nothing going on between Young Lady Nie and me.

155
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Nothing happened.

156
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
I'll explain to you.

157
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,500
Now, come back with me and explain it clearly.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Old Geng, you have to believe me.

160
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
- I don't want to hear it.
- I–

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
You– Don't–

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
I–

163
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a misunderstanding.

164
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Sorry.

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Tan'er.

166
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
My dear. My dear.

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Please let me explain.

168
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
It's not like what you just saw.

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,500
Listen to me, at that time I was on the bridge eating watermelon.

170
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Then a girl plunged into the water,

171
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
and those passersby were so cold!

172
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,400
No one else was trying to save her except for me.

173
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
I jumped into the river and saved her.

174
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,500
To return the favor–

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,400
The girl offered to marry you?

176
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Right.

177
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
No. It's not like that.

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,800
She didn't offer to marry me, but some duck eggs.

179
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Think about it.

180
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Only I, your husband, could save her.

181
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Old Geng would have drowned.

182
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,700
I was helping her and I managed to save her.

183
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,000
I swear to you, Tan'er.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,200
If I were disloyal to you, I would be hit by lightning.

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,900
Why do you get your clothes wet every time you go out alone?

186
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, this is not my fault, Tan'er.

187
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,700
The screenplay was designed this way.

188
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,000
The director also filmed it like this.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Listen to me, now people are joking about us on Danmu.

190
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Which family is Danmu from?

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
You can explain to this girl later.

192
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,400
"Danmu" means timed comments. It's not a girl.

193
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,700
I– Now we are here.

194
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,800
I was here back then.

195
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,500
The box was put here. I put my bag on it.

196
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,000
Reflect on your mistakes.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
I didn't make any mistakes. Why would I?

198
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm wronged.

199
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm so wronged, Tan'er.

200
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,500
What are you doing?

201
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,800
Am I being grounded?

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
It's your fault.

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,300
Why did I bring you back?

204
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,800
Tan'er, you finally came back.

205
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,100
I heard that incorrigible Ning Yi caused trouble outside again.

206
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,200
Is that true?

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Mother, don't worry.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
I've checked by myself. It was just a misunderstanding.

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,900
I've locked him up in the kitchen so that he can learn a lesson.

210
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,200
That's good.

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,500
What can I do with the duck eggs?

212
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
My dear, I know you wouldn't be so cruel to me.

213
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
I-I'm reflecting on my mistakes.

214
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,000
A'Da, do it.

215
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
Young Master,

216
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
I will be gentle.

217
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Wait... Hold on.

218
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
Today, you hung out with other girls.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
His Lordship will teach you a lesson for our lady.

220
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Give me a chance.

221
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,100
Oh my, your father knew what Ning Yi did and got furious.

222
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,600
He already went to Ning Yi with A'Da.

223
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
It seemed that he would beat Ning Yi.

224
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
My Lady.

225
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,500
Why are you here?

226
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Where's my father?

227
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Well, we just finished chatting. He left.

228
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
What's the matter?

229
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Nothing.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
It's fine.

231
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,700
Sometimes Tan'er is just like her father, stubborn.

232
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,300
Seriously. She had a bad temper when she was little.

233
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
You know her father's temperament well.

235
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
He always wears a long face.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,200
I feel uncomfortable when I see his face.

237
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,700
Come on, have a seat.

238
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,600
It hurts a lot to be beaten by this cane.

239
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
It's a nice cane, isn't it?

240
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes, it is.

241
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
I guess that I can't take even take one lash.

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Luckily, I didn't beat you with it.

243
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
Of course you wouldn't since we are all a family.

244
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,300
If you want to hit someone with it, you should go to Wu Qi Hao.

245
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,500
- You think so?
- I get angry when I see him.

246
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,200
- If I have any chance, I–
- Right, hit him.

247
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Give the cane to me. I'll beat him.

248
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,300
- Good.
- Seriously.

249
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,610
I'll make a better cane for you.

250
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,820
[30 minutes ago]

251
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,900
Why did you try to kill me several times?

252
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,000
When did he try to kill you?

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Then what is he doing right now?

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
You dare to let Tan'er down.

255
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,000
I won't let you have a good time.

256
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,800
When did I let Tan'er down?

257
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
It was you who treated me badly first.

258
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
In the forest outside town,

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
you ordered a man in black to kill me.

260
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Then you let him poison me with a sachet.

261
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,500
No, it was a scented ball.

262
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,600
After-After that, Guard Geng took me to Xinmen Brothel

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,100
and then you wanted to beat me 100 times.

264
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,400
100? I could have died.

265
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,800
Young Master, what-what nonsense are you talking?

266
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
His Lordship went to the forest to save you that day.

267
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,000
- I gave you the western scented ball to keep away mosquitoes.
- What?

268
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,300
Give the thing on the desk to him.

269
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,800
I remember you spent a lot to buy it from the west region.

270
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,100
Now you just give it to Young Master?

271
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
Just do it.

272
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Anyway, it's also going to expire.

273
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Your bark is worse than your bite.

274
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
You gave Young Master such precious stuff

275
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,400
so that he would treat the Miss well.

276
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
Enough.

277
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,600
Go give it to him.

278
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Just behave yourself.

279
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,000
Deliver a message to Guard Geng so that he will know what to do.

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,300
Your Lordship, you still doubt Young Master's conduct.

281
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,200
You want Guard Geng to take him to Xinmen Brothel

282
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
in order to give him a trial.

283
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
But what if he really goes there with Guard Geng?

284
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,300
Your Lordship, what should we do then?

285
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,200
It's okay to enjoy the performance.

286
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,700
But if he flirts with any girl,

287
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,400
beat him with a stick 100 times and drive him out.

288
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Your Lordship, they caught him.

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Who are those people?

290
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
How dare they hurt my son-in-law?

291
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
- Go and save him now.
- Yes.

292
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,100
Stop it.

293
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
- Be quick.
- Yes.

294
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Young Master, are you all right?

295
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Young Master.

296
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,300
Your Lordship, why did you save him

297
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
since you don't like him?

298
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,800
Though he's not in Tan'er's league, he's still my son-in-law.

299
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,000
How could we allow him to be killed by others?

300
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,800
It's a misunderstanding... a misunderstanding.

301
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,500
The thing is he wears a long face all day like a bad guy.

302
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,600
Young Master, today you hung out with another girl secretly.

303
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
His Lordship would teach you a lesson for the Miss.

304
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
No, please! I can explain it.

305
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Everything I did was to help your daughter get the seal.

306
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
If I lied, I'd have no complaints even if you sink me into the pond.

307
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,900
A'Da!

308
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,100
Wait a moment.

309
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,830
I was really helping Tan'er get the seal.

310
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,700
[Present]

311
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,600
Listen to me. Your lord, well, my father-in-law,

312
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,900
he has this one weak point.

313
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,400
Most of the time, it would be all right if he had made everything clear.

314
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
But he always keeps silent and keeps it to himself.

315
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
- I can't help with that.
- It's all right.

316
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
I really want to have deeper conversations.

317
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,600
I know it's been tough for you.

318
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,300
When he orders you to do things, you can't refuse him, either.

319
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
I've served him for a long time.

320
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
- Actually, I can manage.
- Right.

321
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,500
You've got used to it.

322
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll also be careful.

323
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
Anyway, he's my father-in-law.

324
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,700
You're new here.

325
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,000
- Just take your time.
- Okay!

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
I'll have your back here in the future.

327
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,600
- Okay, I'll have no worries.
- About my lord, I'll stick up for you in front of him.

328
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Good, you can rest assured.

329
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,900
I'll behave myself, okay?

330
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,180
♫ Buy paintings, words and books ♫

331
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,000

What do you mean?

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,581
Actually, the first time I came to Su's Cloth Store,

412
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,489
I noticed the open space in the front of the door.

413
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,550
Looking around the whole Jiangning City, only your cloth store

414
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,539
has such a huge space before the door.

415
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,030
This is a advantaged condition.

416
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,200
I visited the east and west markets

417
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,580
in my spare time.

418
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,409
The cloth stores in the east market are mostly under the Wu's signboard.

419
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,540
It means their influence is great.

420
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,689
But in the west market, Dachuan Cloth Store is

421
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,540
competing with Su's Cloth Store.

422
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,729
I've studied the location of Dachuan.

423
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,249
I found it's not as good as yours,

424
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,160
but it has far more customers than you.

425
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,139
I've also done some research on the Dachuan's cloth quality

426
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,070
and Su's Cloth Store,

427
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,169
but I found yours is of better quality and more novel style.

428
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,490
But why can't your sales go up?

429
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,489
Because we sell expensive fabrics at a relatively low price.

430
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,489
On the contrary, it removes the customers' trust in our quality.

431
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:49,960
Well, you know the reason. Why do you still do that?

432
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,000
Su Family has a motto from the ancestors,

433
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,939
"Protect and hand over the family business while helping the world become better."

434
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:59,510
We must consider the poor.

435
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,379
I know the current practice is inappropriate,

436
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,690
but I don't want to go against the motto.

437
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,899
Then why can't we launch a fabric for the people with lower income

438
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,440
to wear during work?

439
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,299
Rich people like it but they despise its cheap price.

440
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,139
Poor people can afford it but find it impractical.

441
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,689
Any product needs target customers.

442
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,200
Each piece of fabric should be sold to customers who truly need it.

443
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,539
So what you mean is that we should raise the price

444
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,160
of fine fabrics to gain profit.

445
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,539
And on the premise of ensuring the quality, we can develop more

446
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,350
ordinary fabrics suitable for normal people.

447

493
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,820
so there's no place to park the carriage.

494
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,500
Do you still buy fabrics from Wu's?

495
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,340
That's right. You, too?

496
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,169
We are going to another store in the west market.

497
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,819
The Sus have prepared a parking lot.

498
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,539
You can park in front of the door.

499
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,539
- Is that true?
- Yes.

500
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:47,860
Yes.

501
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:48,819
All right, let's go.

502
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,300
Let's go there, too.

503
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,060
Sit tight, Young Master.

504
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,100
Here, Madam. Take care.

505
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Thank you.

506
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,439
Come on. Park that carriage in the parking lot.

507
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,249
We are salesclerks in the store, not carters.

508
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,649
That's right. Why should we listen to you?

509
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,250
I'll do it myself.

510
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,619
From now on, his words are my words.

511
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,300
No one shall disobey Young Master's orders.

512
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,700
Yes.

513
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,779
Classmate Li! Long time no see!

514
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,920
The great Young Master Ning!

515
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,790
We are both matrilocal husbands,

516
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,510
yet you've visited the brothel

517
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,489
and are still well treated.

518
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,060
I really admire you.

519
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,760
Stop it. Why are you here today?

520
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,300
I came to buy some fabrics.

521
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,579
Great.

522
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,649
This is my wife's cloth store.

523
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,790
Let me help you. Come.

524
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,030
The silly grandson of the Su told me that

525
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,450
his family usually uses Young Lady Yuan on Jade Garden Poetry Meeting.

526
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,520
That's right.

527
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,409
- A'Cai.
- Yes.

528
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,299
Show our contract to Madame Yang.

529
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,440
No performers of Xinmen Brothel shall be used by other stores.

530
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,150
But...

531
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,690
Well, thank you, Young Master Wu.

532
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,170
Come on, Young Master Wu.

533
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,970
Have some wine.

534
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,899
Distinguished guest, please.

535
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,300
Take care.

536
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,720
Brother Ning, your design is so terrific.

537
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,000
There are both fabrics and ready-made clothes.

538
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,110
And it's divided into high-price and low-price zones.

539
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,400
So no matter what goods I need, I could buy it from your store.

540
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,960
Brother Li, I'm flattered.

541
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,890
How about this?

542
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,299
My four dear brothers, you can all choose a piece of clothing

543
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,649
in the high-price zone as a gift to your wife.

544
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,510
Just take it as a gift from me to my friends' wives.

545
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,139
Thank You, Brother Ning.

546
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,000
Brother Ning, I haven't married yet.

547
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,819
Just pick one more for my wife.

548
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,189
- Let's go.
- Oh, Brother Li.

549
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:46,969
Guys, come on.

550
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,579
Take care of the four Young Masters.

551
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,250
They are our VIP.

552
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,000
In the past few days, our revenue has increased a lot.

553
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,880
If it goes this way, I believe that we will

554
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,060
come close to Wus in a few days.

555
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,209
Young Master is quite impressive.

556
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,420
He can even invite some guests from the School of Male Virtue.

557
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,930
Boss, I don't mean to throw in a wet blanket but

558
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,859
recent huge flow of customers and sales have outnumbered our supply.

559
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,859
So we let them place their orders first.

560
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,850
But I'm still worried that we may suffer delay in delivery.

561
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,790
Manager Xi, stop worrying about things beyond your duty.

562
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,299
After you told me about it last time,

563
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,379
I came up with an idea to handle it.

564
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,340
Young Master, you have another new idea?

565
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,539
But don't be anxious.

566
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,450
You'll know when our distinguished guest comes.

567
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,410
Boss! Boss!

568
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,299
The Elder Master came here in person.

569
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,409
See?

570
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,550
Our distinguished guest has arrived.

571
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,200
Good! Great!

572
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,610
This is...

573
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,779
Grandfather, this device is driven by steam

574
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,779
and the force is transmitted by the gears.

575
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,960
In this way our weaving efficiency can be greatly improved,

576
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,820
and the cost is not high.

577
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,249
So we can put it into mass production.

578
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,779
In this way will we be able to deliver goods on time.

579
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,440
Great.

580
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,489
Tan'er, you and my grandson-in-law did something great again.

581
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,010
I'm happy for you.

582
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,140
Boss.

583
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,320
Grandfather, this is the account book of the cloth store.

584
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,840
- Please have a look.
- Okay.

585
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Good.

586
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,859
Great.

587
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,030
You've gained so many profits in such a short period.

588
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,890
It seems I picked the right person.

589
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,480
Tan'er's new store has just opened for less than half a year.

590
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,670
Although the business is booming,

591
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:48,400
there is still a long way to go and a lot to learn.

592
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,360
The revenue of her store in one month

593
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,590
is equivalent to yours in one year.

594
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,930
You!

595
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,600
You have a lot to learn.

596
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,050
Good.

597
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,809
Well, congratulations, my dear.

598
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:19,060
Now we are one step closer to obtaining the seal.

599
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,010
Thank you very much.

600
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,000
Did I say anything wrong again?

601
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,780
Bamboo Seven.

602
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,490
I met that Young Master Wu again a few days ago.

603
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,450
It's lucky that Tan'er hasn't married him!

604
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,300
What you said is totally right.

605
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,259
Our son-in-law is such a capable man.

606
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,601
To be honest with you, the first time I saw him,

607
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,779
I knew that he could achieve something big.

608
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,960
You know what?

609
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,190
With his help, our cloth business has been thriving day by day.

610
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,240
Maybe we'll be the richest family In Jiangning City in the future.

611
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,780
Then congratulations!

612
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,160
Our Young Master

613
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,659
has such a good-luck face that he's bound to help his wife succeed.

614
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,759
Right. You're right.

615
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,089
A good-luck face.

616
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,221
I like the appearance of my nephew-in-law.

617
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,560
Look at him. A small nose and small eyes. How jubilant!

618
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,460
I have to say, the whole idea of leaving Tan'er's happiness

619
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,779
for the rest of life to him,

620
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,929
is so reassuring to me.

621
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,630
Right.

622
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,970
Actually, I didn't know my nephew-in-law was such a good man

623
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,049
and was so good at business.

624
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,390
Now as I see it, you will definitely get to hold

625
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,080
the clan meeting

626
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,610
three days later.

627
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,659
The clan meeting hasn't started yet.

628
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,190
You can't say for sure.

629
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,120
The walls have ears.

630
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,779
It's no big deal.

631
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,779
In the future, the Su family may rely on Tan'er and her husband.

632
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,960
- Right.
- Yes.

633
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,490
By the way, don't treat me as an outsider.

634
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,560
You are welcome to ask me for help.

635
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,690
Since you said that, I do need your help on something.

636
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,700
What's that?

637
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,870
Give me that bag. I'm going home.
[Su's Cloth Store]

638
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,219
Have a rest early.

639
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,900
Goodbye, Young Master.

640
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
Go after him.

641
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,220
Hey, guys.

642
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,699
Stop looking around. I am here.

643
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,820
Why don't you sleep but instead follow me in the middle of the night?

644
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,860
That's not right.

645
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,269
I'm outnumbered by you. Six versus one.

646
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:11,530
Even if you win,

647
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,740
it's also a shame for you.

648
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,190
Wu Qi Hao.

649
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,630
Ning Yi.

650
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,219
Since you married into the Su Family,

651
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,179
you seem to have forgotten who you are.

652
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,650
It's okay for you to sell fabrics as usual.

653
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,800
But I didn't expect you'd expand business to the east market.

654
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,480
Why did you plan the parking lot to take all our guests away?

655
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,969
I just built a parking lot.

656
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,400
How did I disturb the market?

657
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,829
You can also build one. I won't stop you.

658
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,530
You chose the hard way.

659
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,130
I didn't beat you to death last time.

660
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,340
So you got to marry Tan'er.

661
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,410
This time,

662
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,179
I won't let you go that easily.

663
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,680
Last time it's you who tried to kill me.

664
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,219
Madame Yang, Jade Garden Poetry Meeting is coming.

665
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,609
We want to get fully-prepared.

666
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,969
Is it possible that all your performers go perform for our family?

667
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,699
Boss Wu, of course it is.

668
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,779
Young Master Wu has already told me that.

669
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,340
Don't worry about it.

670
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,970
[Wu Cheng Hou]

671
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,449
That's my brilliant son to have thought of this in advance.

672
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,449
Sure.

673
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,339
Young Master Wu is handsome and clever.

674
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,390
He's really a...

675
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,550
[Huo Mumen]

676
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,300
Bastard!

677
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,260
Young Master Wu is handsome and clever.

678
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,489
He's really a bastard?

679
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,479
Your Lordship, Young Master hired people from Huomumen again to kill Ning Yi.

680
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:50,300
I couldn't stop him, and I dared not.

681
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,370
Don't be mad, Your Lordship.

682
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Go.

683
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Ning Yi, does this look familiar to you?

684
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,500
Stop.

685
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Father, why are you here?

686
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
How bold you are!

687
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
How dare you make trouble like this!

688
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,400
Father, Ning Yi has pushed me too far.

689
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
I've told you long before not to act against the law for a woman.

690
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,800
Go home!

691
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,600
The Jade Garden Poetry Meeting is coming.

692
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,800
I'll wait and see you cry.

693
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,700
At that time, we'll know who's the powerhouse.

694
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

695
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,600
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

696
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,200
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

697
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,800
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

698
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,400
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

699
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,000
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

700
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,800
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

701
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,600
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

702
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

703
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

704
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

705
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,400
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

706
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

707
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,800
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

708
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

709
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

710
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

711
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,700
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

712
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,700
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

713
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

714
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

715
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

716
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

717
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
