I'm old.

11
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,108

He secured a leading position right away

by bringing up Lin'an's Munitions Depot and the late Emperor's posthumous decree.

If you knew it, why did you still send Commandant Song to Jiangning?

31

People want to watch a show,

32

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:16,029
Madam Hu, are you willing to take the risk that

168
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,309
you won't be as fashionable as Jiang, Tao and Su

169
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,909
just because of your personal preference?

170
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,949
No way!

171
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,789
They want to win over me?

172
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,189
It'll take them another 100 years!

173
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,029
I want this dress!

174

Brother Ning, I have a small question.

00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:57,388
Since our business is booming, can we deliver the products on schedule?

190

At this point, our cloth store will count on all of you!

They are blocking the entrance and asking to see you!

No way!

Young Master, it's the people from the money shop.

00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,589
They said they'll tear our house down

if you don't see them!

208

Please give me more time.

224
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,029
I've already pawned Wu's Cloth Store to you.

225
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,210
Are you still afraid that I'll run away?

226
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,290
That makes sense after all.

227
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,468
Why don't we set a time limit then?

228
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:24,209
Three days! How about you pay us back in three days?

229
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,050
I can't make it in three days!

Lad, I have an idea for you.

231
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,330
If you really don't have any money,

232
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,129
you can borrow from your friends.

233
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,748
I think Su Family is quite wealthy.

234

They've made much money!

236
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,350
Why don't you borrow from them?

237
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,889
Boss, are you really going to lead me off a cliff?

238
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,290
Lead you off a cliff?

239

I'm trying to find a solution for you!

240

Then I have no other choice!

246
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,270

Boss Ning, what you did is so unethical!

252
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:25,050
You violated business rules! How are we supposed to survive in this industry?

253
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,309
- That's right!
- How are we supposed to live?

254

That's right!

I admit that it's indeed my fault!

That's why I prepared a small gift for all of you!

Hope you'll kindly accept it!

it's proper that you went to Yamen in person

become a tributary cloth supplier.

We even promised to give you half of the profit!

How can you leave us alone like this?

it's obvious that he wants to pocket all the money and run away!

We pay 10,000 taels of silvers to him every year!

324
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,508
It can't even turn us into a tributary cloth supplier?

You idiot!

326

in order to solve our pressing problem!

331
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,670
How…

332
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,630
How come I have such a son?

333
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,308
He's just a profit-driven person who'll avoid disadvantages for himself!

334
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,109
Once His Majesty decides to pay tribute to Jing again,

335
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,028
Song Xian will become our friend again.

336
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,629
Except him, we don't have any other

337
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,349
connection in the court.

338
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,709
He's our only chance to erase the debt!

339
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,809
Your Lordship,

340
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:17,010
Young Master, someone wants to see you.

341
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,409
Creditor again?

342
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,708
Stop him!

343
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,509
It's Manager Xi.

344
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,788
Younger Master!

345
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,609
Younger Master, you finally…

346
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,909
Just tell me why you are here.

347
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,310
Younger Master,

348
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,369
I have to prove it to you that I didn't betray you!

349
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,290
I drew these 58 portraits by myself.

350
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,830
They are the 58 students at the Academy of Male Virtuousness.

351
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,109
They are the ones who colluded with Ning Yi

352
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,649
and formed an alliance of matrilocal husbands to spread rumors

353
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,788
and bid up the silk price in Jiangning!

354
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,909
His name is Li Pin,

355
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,669
who's the closest to Ning Yi!

356
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,149
His name is Shen Miao,

357
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,548
and he voluntarily went to study at the School of Male Virtue

358
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:02,949
several months after he failed the imperial exam,

359
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,130
and then, he became close with Ning Yi…

360
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,109
- Cai.
- Yes.

361
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,609
- Get him out!
- Manager Xi, please go back!

362
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,229
Younger Master! I've always been loyal to you!

363
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,788
You have to trust me, Younger Master!

364
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,969
Shen Miao is the one who smeared, cheated and framed me!

365
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:18,209
He asked me go to Zhu Ji to meet Ning Yi!

366
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,849
Get lost!

367

You ungrateful ingrate!

370

You snobby, black widow!

Let me tell you!

373
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
Commandant Song is upstairs right now

374
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,800
and I still have your indenture!

375
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
You'll have to marry him, anyway!

376
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,700
My mother signed the indenture!

377
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,000
It has nothing to me with me!

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Give it back to me! I want to redeem myself!

379
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,800
Do you really think you can have a better life

380
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,900
if you escape from this place?

381
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,400
You have no idea how tough life is outside!

382

Do you know that?

383
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Do you know that? You should feel lucky that you can

384

be Commandant Song's concubine!

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
Stop lecturing me!

386
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
You came to Jiangning by yourself and wanted to be a top performer.

387
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,700
But because of your poor singing skills, you became an unscrupulous procuress!

388
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
Listen to me very carefully! Don't try to blame it on me!

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,700
I don't even want to be his wife,

390
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,100
let alone his concubine!

391
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
Unless I can be his grandma!

392
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,300
You…You…You… Are you insane?

393
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,800
You don't want to be a good girl! Instead, you followed that Nie Yunzhu!

394
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
You want to show your face in public every day with her

395
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,000
and sell that disgusting preserved eggs?

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Aren't you ashamed?

397
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,200
You don't even feel ashamed of procuring.

398
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Why should I be ashamed of myself selling preserved eggs? It's upfront and honest!

399
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,500
I won't give in today unless I'm dead!

400
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,300
Fine! If you want to die, then go ahead!

401

But don't drag all of us Xinmen down with you!

Stop! Don't come over!

I won't let you do it for nothing.

410
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,200
You can have

411

all the money I earned over the past 15 years.

I only want to use the money

Go get her up!

Come! Go get help!

Madam Yang, it's my wedding day.

428
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,500
Why are you crying so badly?

429
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,100
Jin'er didn't want to marry you.

430
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,400
She got desperate and jumped into the river!

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
When did she do that?

432
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,000
Just… Just now!

433
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,200
She jumped from that bridge.

434
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
The water is quite deep.

435
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm afraid… she's already dead!

436
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Commandant Song, look.

437
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
She even killed herself because of this.

438
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
I think we should cancel…

439
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
You shut up!

440
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,100
She's mine no matter she's dead or not!

441
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
Guards!

442
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,000
You guys go find her!

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Even if she's dead, get me her body,

444
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
and hang her head up in public!

445
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Go now!

446
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,100
Yes, Commandant!

447
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,500
Why hasn't she come yet?

448
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,300
She should be here now.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
Of course, I'd come back!

455
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,300
Those evil people are still alive,

456
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,700
how could I die?

457
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,000
I can't leave this world to those people!

458
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
Now, go inside and get changed.

459
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,400
So? I'm really good at swimming, aren't I?

460
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
- I'm so wet!
- Slow down!

461
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
Put this on!

462
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,600
Song Xian's people are so dumb.

463
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,700
They only searched downstream,

464
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,800
but they didn't expect Lady Yuan could swim.

465
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
She even swam to Miss Nie's home!

466
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,400
How could they know Yuan Jin'er could swim?

467
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,400
You don't say.

468
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,000
All people of Xinmen know that

469
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,500
Miss Yuan is good at swimming

470
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,700
and that she often swims here,

471
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,800
but no one gave her away.

472
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
They are really good friends.

473
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,800
It's a fact that everybody knows,

474
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,200
yet Madam Yang doesn't.

475
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,800
She's not that clever after all.

476
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,400
No wonder Miss Yuan wants to leave there.

477
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,100
You really think Madam Yang doesn't know Yuan Jin'er can swim?

478
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,400
It's just because she wants to let Jin'er go.

479
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,200
Commandant Song, look.

480
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
She even killed herself because of this.

481
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
I think we should cancel…

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
It's also Madam Yang's way

483
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,600
of expressing her love for Jin'er.

484
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,600
Don't say that.

485
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
I know you can't understand.

486
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's okay.

487
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's wait.

488
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
After a while, I still don't think… you will understand.

489
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Enjoy your tea.

490
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,000

00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,200
You're so dead today!

665
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
Father! Father!

666
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,200
- Please! Father!
- Stop!

667
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Father! Father! Don't beat me!

668
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,000
Stop!

669
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Father! Please calm down!

670
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,688
Brother Wu, how are you doing?

671
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Brother Su, save the small talk.

672
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,000
I think we both know why you came here today.

673
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,700
Our situation is pretty obvious.

674
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,000
I'll just tell you the truth.

675
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,400
I'm afraid you can't get your money back.

676
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
But…

677
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,200
Brother Wu, my son and I gave all our money to you!

678
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,600
Now that Commandant Song is dead,

679
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
the tributary cloth business must be screwed up!

680
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,400
You can't just leave us alone!

681
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,300
We invested in Wu's because we believed in you,

682
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,000
and now you want to pocket the money and run away?

683
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Don't you dare talk to my father like that!

684
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Shut up!

685
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,500
Yes.

686
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,800
Brother Su, I'll just be honest with you.

687
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
My stupid son pawned all our stores without telling me.

688
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,600
We don't have any money now.

689
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Then, what are we supposed to do?

690
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
We don't have any money,

691
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,800
but I know someone who does.

692
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,400
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
 Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

693
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

694
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,800
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

695
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,400
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

696
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,700
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

697
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,400
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

698
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,200
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

699
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,200
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

700
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

701
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

702
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

703
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

704
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

705
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

706
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,400
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

707
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,800
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

708
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

709
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,200
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

710
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

711
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,400
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫

712
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,400
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

713
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,800
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

714
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

715
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,900
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon 
from thousands of miles away ♫
