We will do it according to our tradition.

170
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Go prepare it!

171
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah, sure.

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,000
The ceremony begins!

173
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
First, bow to Master Guan.

174
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,300
We brothers from eight camps stick to loyalty and righteousness.

175
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,600
Only with death does our course end.

176
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,000
If you become a traitor, you will be cut through by swords and torn apart by carts.

177
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
Today, Ning Yi married into Badao Camp, and from now on,

178
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,400
we should share happiness and difficulties together.

179
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Second, bow to the broadsword.

180
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,800
This sword was left by Xi Gua's father.

181
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,700
It's like you are bowing to your father-in-law.

182
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,800
Hope you can be of the same mind

183
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,600
and can overcome any difficulties in the future.

184
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,800
Bow to each other.

185
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
The ceremony is done!

186
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Great! Great!

187
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,700
Great! Great!

188
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,400
You will be a family from now on.

189
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Ning Yi, now I will leave Xi Gua to you.

190
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,600
You have to treat her well from now on.

191
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,200
She had never fallen in love with someone for all these years.

192
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,000
Ning Yi, you must not let her down.

193
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Can you do it?

194
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
He can, Aunt.

195
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,400
My Lady.

196
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Drink!

197
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Come on. Bottoms up!

198
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,700
You two. May I propose a toast?

199
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
You don't deserve that.

200
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Since you married Commander Liu, we can't do anything to you.

201
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
But in the future,

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,800
if you fall into our hands again…

203
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,300
What's wrong with you?

204
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,600
What?

205
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
What's wrong?

206
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
What are you doing?

207
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you rising in rebellion?

208
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
It's Xi Gua's wedding day.

209
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,600
You guys should act well today.

210
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
Let's go, Counselor.

211
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Let's go and have a drink over there.

212
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
What are you looking at? I will poke your eyes out.

213
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,200
-Clean it up. Hurry!
- No problem.

214
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
- Let's drink ourselves.
- Let's drink ourselves.

215
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,100
Come on, Counselor. Come on, Counselor.

216
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,400
Let's drink now.

217
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,900
Good wine.

218
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,900
Congratulations, Counselor.

219
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,400
Come on, everybody. Bottoms up!

220
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

221
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
- Come, cheers!
- Come on.

222
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,300
Come on.

223
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
- Come on!
- Fill it up.

224
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Counselor, it's not good if you drink like that!

225
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I still have something to do later.

226
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
He has to go to the bridal chamber!

227
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
He's got something serious to do tonight.

228
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I think he's having ulterior motives.

229
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,600
The reason why he stays awake is that

230
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,800
he will work from inside with Dong Dao Fu tonight.

231
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,300
Keep your voice down.

232
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,100
- If he dares to do so…
- Cheers!

233
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,700
I will kill him tonight.

234
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Holy Master. A toast from we three.

235
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Enough. Go find someone else.

236
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,700
He won't drink tonight.

237
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes. Go.

238
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,600
Ning Yi is a generous man.

239
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
Hope he won't let Xi Gua down.

240
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
He dare not.

241
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,000
Leave me alone.

242
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,700
Go there. Drink with them.

243
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,600
I won't drink too much tonight.

244
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay. Let's go.

245
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Take care.

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Let's go.

247
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Bottoms up!

248
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's drink.

249
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
Come on. Give me more.

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,300
Come on, let's drink.

251
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
Come on, cheers.

252
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,600
- Let's drink.
- Okay.

253
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Bottoms up!
[Happiness]

254
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Counselor, we will escort you to the bridal chamber.

255
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,500
Let's go, Counselor.

256
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,200
- Let's go.
- It's time.

257
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Xuanwei Camp also sucks!

258
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah. They all suck!

259
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
Look at him! And him!

260
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,100
Let's go, too.

261
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah. Okay.

262
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Let's go.

263
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Get up.

264
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,700
Xian Ying, go take some rest.

265
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Act on our plan.

266
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Hurry.

267
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Come on.

268
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
Come on.

269
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Counselor, you have to treat Commander Liu well in the future.

270
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Although this is your second marriage,

271
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,200
Commander Liu has never liked anyone.

272
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

273
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
You're so lucky, Counselor.

274
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
But she just likes you.

275
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
What can we do about it?

276
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Everyone has his own taste.

277
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You must treat her well in the future.

278
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,800
If you dare to treat her badly,

279
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,300
we'll be the first ones to kill you.

280
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

281
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
All right.

282
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,600
You can go back now. I've arrived.

283
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,200
Yeah.

284
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,600
The wedding night!

285
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Let's go! Go!

286
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,500
Every minute of the wedding night counts!

287
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,800
Let's go back and drink!

288
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Let's drink!

289
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
Let's drink until dawn.

[Granary Storehouse of Lin'an]

291
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,200
This knockout powder given by Ning is so effective!

292
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
Cut it out!

293
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,000
Hurry up. Get changed!

294
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,100
This-This outfit looks weird.

295
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,000
Are you serious? You still pay attention to your image now?

296
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,600
Of course. We will be killed if we're recognized.

297
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
We won't.

298
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,400
I've observed their movements between their shifts.

299
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
You just need to follow me and don't say anything.

300
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,100
Heroes, what about us?

301
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I only drugged four bandits. There are no clothes for you.

302
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
But… We will be recognized if we push the cart there.

303
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,400
Yeah, we didn't put on any disguise.

304
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,900
It's like we're going to suicide.

305
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,600
I've never seen those who're afraid of death like you.

306
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
But… I'm kidding.

307
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,400
After we finish the task, you will come with the goods.

308
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700

We still don't know what's going on between Young Master and that woman.

If he dares to fail you, I will kill him!

You're late.

323
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,400

"Please take care and not suffer from hunger and cold."

328

The password is, "Please take care and not suffer from hunger and cold."

Okay, sure.

336
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,798
Thank you for your hard work!

337
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,700
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

338
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
What happened?

339
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,800
How did you know the password?

340
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,000
They are the last two lines in the ancient poetry of Traveling over and over again.

341
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,300
"There are many things I want to say.

342
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,400
Please take care and not suffer from hunger and cold."

343
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,100
It sounds weird. But that's what they wrote.

344
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,800
Brother Shen, the time you've spent studying has not been wasted at all!

345
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,600
Really.

346
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,900
Not until one is up against a practical problem to be solved does one realize how little they have read.

347
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,000
I wonder if he was hungry when he wrote this.

348
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,200
- Get out.
- Come on.

349
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,300
Hurry up! Hurry up!

350
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,500
[Lin'an]

351
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
It's so stuffy.

352
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
I can't even see the stars.

353
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,600
I've arranged it properly. Once they enter the city,

354
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,200
they will explode into pieces.

355
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,800
If Ning Yi is a spy and colludes with Dong Dao Fu,

356
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
I will show no mercy to him.

357
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,700
Xi Gua, where did you buy the sunflower seeds?

358
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,200
It's so raw.

359
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
So what?

360
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,600
I can't taste it anyway.

361
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
I've been used to being hungry.

362
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,200
It's already good enough to have food.

363
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,200
You were also born of poor parentage.

364
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,400
No wonder you asked me to take back the grains and save the poor.

365
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,200
You were always hungry when you were little.

366
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,800
My father was down and out in other places.

367
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
My mother was alone and conceived me.

368
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,600
At that time, she couldn't afford a watermelon.

369
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,500
Later, when I was born, she named me Xi Gua. (Xi Gua means watermelon)

370
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,800
Although she still couldn't afford it, by naming me Xi Gua,

371
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
she'd feel like she has a watermelon every day.

372
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Later my father came back, but we still suffered from hunger.

373
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,400
So, we could only become bandits.

374
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,700
Have you ever thought about doing something else?

375
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,000
Like, you can do embroidery at our Su's.

376
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,600
Are you kidding me?

377
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,200
Now, I take charge of a whole camp!

378
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
How could I leave them alone and do something else?

379
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,700
You can bring them along.

380
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Enough. Thank you for your kindness.

381
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You just think it is not a permanent solution to live such a life.

382
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
My Aunt thought the same.

383
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,600
So she always wanted me to get married.

384
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,000
But my father wanted to retire and live a peaceful life.

385
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,800
But he didn't expect that he'd be framed by corrupt officials

386
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,600
accusing him of treason.

387
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
He ended up losing his life.

388
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,800
My mother died from sickness when I was little.

389
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
I hardly remember anything about her.

390
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,300
I was brought up by my father.

391
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,200
So I was very sad when he died.

392
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,600
His name was Liu Da Biao.

393
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,500
So I call myself that, too.

394
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,800
He followed my uncle and was so kind to him.

395
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,500
He'd listen to everything my uncle said.

396
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,200
So I chose to follow my uncle, too.

397
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Later, the people who heard the name Liu Da Biao

398
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,000
thought he was still alive and came to Lin'an with the Holy Master.

399
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
You know what?

400
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
My father was quite awesome when he was young.

401
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Although you are also very good,

402
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,600
you still can't compare to him.

403
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,300
I dare not.

404
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,400
My father taught me to be faithful and reasonable when I was little.

405
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I only get to use strength if I can't win against them.

406
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,900
He was right.

407
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,600
He just wanted to earn a living

408
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
and never thought about hurting anyone.

409
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,200
He was so loyal to my uncle.

410
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
When those corrupt officials sent people to hunt him down,

411
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
he said he'd take it all by himself

412
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,400
and asked my uncle to leave with me.

413
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
You know it.

414
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
They just wanted to kill him.

415
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,900
Being reasonable wouldn't have worked anyway.

416
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,000
There's no other choice but to fight them.

417
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Thinking about my father's kindness to him,

418
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,900
my uncle has always spoiled me.

419
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,100
Actually, about Bao Wen Han's issue, he didn't believe you.

420
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,800
But I said I liked you.

421
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
So he couldn't punish you.

422
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,000
As for my aunt, it's because

423
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
she was afraid she'd fail my father's trust.

424
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,800
So she had to see us get married.

425
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,200
That's how it is.

426
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Can you two understand it?

427
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,600
We… Of course, we can.

428
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
But… we have put you in such big trouble.

429
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,100
What are you going to do then?

430
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,300
It's nothing.

431
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,500
My father told me that friends should be loyal to each other.

432
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,200
I thought about it before.

433
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,800
If this doesn't work, I will threaten my uncle with my own life.

434
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,600
I didn't expect that you can be saved by a fake marriage.

435
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,300
What a good deal!

436
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
Xi Gua,

437
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,100
did you ever think that

438
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:29,600
the Holy Master was determined to go on this path from the very beginning?

439
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,600
No.

440
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,600
He just hates those corrupt officials doing evil

441
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
because they killed my father.

442
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,900
You denied it so fast.

443
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,100
Even you don't believe it either, right?

444
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,100
Uncle is kind to me.

445
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,000
I will help him win this battle in Lin'an no matter what.

446
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,700
What if you can't?

447
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
It doesn't matter.

448
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,000
If you lose,

449
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Chen Fan and you can just surrender for amnesty.

450
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Can't you say something good on the wedding night?

451
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,800
My bad. My bad.

452
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
I'll sleep now.

453
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,450
[Dong]

454
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,400
Brother, it's already morning

455
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
and it's not a good opportunity for them to strike an attack.

456
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,800
Dong Dao Fu is good at night raids.

457
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,100
Yesterday, we had a weak defense because all the people were celebrating the wedding. They all knew that.

458
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,600
If Ning Yi was a spy, he wouldn't have given up this opportunity.

459
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Were we wrong?

460
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,000
They guarded for the whole night after leaving the wedding feast. They must be tired.

461
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Should I ask them to shift guards?

462
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay.

463
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,100
Let them have a good rest in case Dong Dao Fu swoops in.

464
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,200
Ask them to get off.

465
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,200
It seems like there is nothing's wrong with Ning Yi.

466
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
Go and let Chen Fan out. He's been locked up for a day.

467
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

468
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
Why are you back?

469
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,300
We guarded all night, but nothing has been seen.

470
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,400
It's raining.

471
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,000
You guys, put the weapons away.

472
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
Let's go back to the camp for a rest.

473
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,800
Move quickly!

474
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,400
Okay!

475
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,400
Have they finished the ceremony?

476
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,900
It's almost daybreak. I guess they've already finished consummation.

477
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,500
Commander Chen! Commander Chen!

478
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,600
Xi Gua.

479
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,700
There are so many rainfalls in Lin'an.

480
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,400
It's raining again.

481
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,100
Yeah.

482
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
The rain comes so fast.

483
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,200
[Badao Camp]

484
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
Commander!

485
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Commander!

486
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,300
Commander! The ceremony is finished!

487
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,900
If you really kill the Counselor,

488
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,600
Commander Liu will become a widow!

489
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
To think about that day,

490
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,000
it was a rainy day like today.

491
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,200
Da Biao was decapitated on the street.

492
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,400
We tried so hard to save him,

493
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
but we still couldn't make it.

494
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,000
If he knew of Xi Gua's wedding,

495
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,500
he would be happy for her.

496
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,800
It's just that Xi Gua has such a strong personality.

497
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,300
Ning Yi may have a hard time.

498
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,900
What's wrong, Brother?

499
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,200
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

500
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,800
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

501
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,600
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

502
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,200
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

503
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,500
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

504
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,200
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

505
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,000
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

506
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

507
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

508
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,400
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

509
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

510
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,700
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

511
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,800
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

512
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,200
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

513
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

514
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,600
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

515
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

516
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

517
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

518
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,160
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

519
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,340
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

520
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,620
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

521
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,590
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

522
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:14,500
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
