00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,470
Your Lordship, now is the blessed moment.

169
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,079
Now is the blessed moment.

170
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,050
Let's start the ceremony.

171
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,330
The first bow is for the heaven, the earth, the sun, the moon, and stars.

172
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,930
Second bow is for the nurturing of your parents.

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,659
I have no experience from my first marriage.

174
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,620
I will do better next time.

175
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,850
The bride and the bridegroom bow to each other.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,160
Wait.

177
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,869
- What's he doing here?
- Young Master Wu.

178
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,800
Excuse me for not coming out to meet you.

179
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,730
Your Lordship.

180
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Young Master Wu.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,350
Today is Tan'er's wedding ceremony.

182
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,850
Please have a seat

183
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,999
since you've come.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,810
I came here today

185
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,360
for Tan'er's final settlement in life.

186
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,260
Tan'er, I know your feelings.

187
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,550
You don't want to marry me, not because you don't like me,

188
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,440
but because you don't want to leave the Su Family.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,299
Young Master Wu, please stop your nonsense.

190
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,249
All between us is just business.

191
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,609
There is no personal stuff.

192
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,200
If you want to attend our wedding,

193
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,489
you're surely welcome.

194
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,290
Otherwise, don't bother.

195
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,400
Xiao Chan, see him out.

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,410
Today, I won't allow Tan'er to marry a rat

197
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,690
like Ning Yi, on all accounts.

198
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,990
How dare you!

199
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,619
- My dear.
 - My dear?

200
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,390
He has a wife.

201
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,399
Father, father!

202
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,959
Are you leaving me?

203
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,049
I've been looking for you for a long time.

204
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,950
Our child is still so young.

205
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,450
Why are you so cruel?

206
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,520
Father.

207
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,809
Father.

208
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,289
Have you seen it?

209
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,079
This is Ning Yi's wife.

210
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,490
He abandoned his wife and child,

211
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,729
only to marry into the Su Family.

212
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,320
Do you think he's qualified to marry into the Su Family?

213
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,759
Father-in-law, before Ning Yi came here,

214
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,199
I already asked Guard Geng to investigate him.

215
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,689
He has no wife or child.

216
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm afraid someone wants to frame him today on purpose

217
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,510
and ruin Tan'er's wedding.

218
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,850
Young Master Wu,

219
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,250
I don't think you have bad heart.

220
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,640
Was it because

221
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,879
you listen to and believe rumors?

222
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,930
You should be more than deliberate.

223
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,020
Don't break up this good relationship.

224
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,420
Sure, Your Lordship,

225
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,560
but you'll know the truth

226
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,860
after we have a test.

227
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,560
What test?

228
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,040
Blood test.

229
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
It's okay. It'll be fine.

230
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Young Master Ning,

231
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,850
it's your turn. Come on.

232
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,000
Grandfather, it's my wedding day.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,550
If we tolerate him to mess up like this,

234
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,469
my husband and I will be humiliated.

235
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,419
Tan'er, I did this all for the Su Family.

236
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,199
If we don't test it today, when the truth is exposed in the future,

237
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,909
the whole Su Family will be humiliated.

238
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,509
- Everyone, do you agree with me?
- Yes, totally.

239
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:32,679
Yes.

240
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,640
Test it now.

241
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,810
It's about the Su Family's reputation.

242
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,829
- Grandfather.
- Guard Geng.

243
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,239
Elder Master has agreed.

244
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,470
What are you doing there?

245
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,969
- They're merged.
- They're really merged!

246
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,910
The blood has merged.

247
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,800
- I didn't expect he is a such person.
- Take a look, everyone.

248
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,799
Look. Their bloods are merged.

249
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You are the father to the boy.

250
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,949
Father, I didn't expect Ning Yi is such a person.

251
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,079
Fortunately, Tan'er hasn't married him,

252
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,250
or he would have disgraced the whole Su Family.

253
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Ning Y, how do you explain this?

254
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,950
Is he really Ning Yi's secret son?

255
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,050
But these two big eyes surely weren't inherited from me.

256
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,210
Boy,

257
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,290
am I really your father?

258
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,700
You playboy, what else do you want to say?

259
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,330
Fine.

260
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,410
I admit it.

261
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,160
This boy is my son.

262
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
But what is done is done.

263
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,430
I don't want to hide it anymore.

264
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,200
Actually, he's not the only son I have.

265
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,639
I also have another one.

266
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,469
Another one?

267
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,030
He's not the only one?

268
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,079
How many bad things have you done?

269
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,119
Yeah.

270
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,340
Where is the other one?

271
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
Son, give me a hug.

272
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
I haven't seen you for a long time.

273
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,830
I've missed you so much.

274
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,150
Nonsense.

275
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,620
You don't believe me?

276
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,950
If you don't,

277
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,080
we'll know after we have a test.

278
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
What test?

279
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,260
Blood test.

280
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,840
Okay, excuse me, excuse.

281
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,629
Merged. They're merged.

282
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,559
Yes, they're mixed!

283
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,830
Their bloods are merged!

284
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,350
The bloods have been merged.

285
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,060
The bloods have been merged.

286
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,270
The bloods have been merged.

287
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,340
They are truly merged.

288
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,740
I am the father of Wu Qi Hao.

289
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,980
Is Wu Qi Hao really Ning Yi's secret son?

290
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm older than him. How could I be his son?

291
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,650
Wu Qi Hao, how dare you!

292
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,800
You tampered with the water.

293
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,270
Yeah, I did.

294
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,580
Didn't you?

295
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,700
If this child is really my son,

296
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,410
then I'm your father.

297
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,810
Since our bloods have merged,

298
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,380
now I'm asking you.

299
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,740
Am I your father?

300
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,980
Of course not.

301
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,580
Then, is this boy my son?

302
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,730
Stop there.

303
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Wu Qi Hao, today is my wedding day.

304
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,390
You didn't say anything to congratulate

305
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,990
but came here to mess up and smash things.

306
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,240
If your mother didn't show you how to behave when you are home,

307
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,460
then here today,

308
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,120
I, your father, must teach you how.

309
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,910
Apologize!

310
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,319
Yeah, apologize to them.

311
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,151
Apologize! Hurry up and apologize!

312
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:51,460
Ning Yi is kind of interesting.

313
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,550
- You have to apologize!
- Yes, apologize!

314
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,400
You just messed up!

315
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,760
Apologize!

316
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

317
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,040
Ning Yi

318
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,850
is not the father to this boy,

319
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,130
nor to me.

320
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,030
Your Lordship, I've believed a slanderer.

321
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,559
Sorry to have startled you.

322
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,840
Sorry to have startled everyone here.

323
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,109
Leave! Leave!

324
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,080
Hurry! Just leave!

325
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,479
Young Master Ning, are you okay?

326
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,319
I'm good.

327
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,719
What was going on here?

328
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,229
Why were the bloods merged in both bowls of water?

329
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,869
Because he added alum to the water.

330
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,990
Alum can speed up the merging of bloods in water.

331
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,799
But you didn't add any alum in your water.

332
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,130
How can Young Master Wu's blood and yours merge?

333
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,650
Okay, excuse me.

334
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,029
Because I had a bowl of warm water.

335
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,550
Warmth can also speed up the merging of blood in the water.

336
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,440
A friendly reminder.

337
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:31,029
The way of identifying relationships by dripping blood into water is not reliable.

338
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,080
I see.

339
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,629
Young Master Ning, you know a lot.

340
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,679
I'm flattered.

341
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,349
- I learned that in TV series.
- TV series?

342
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,250
Mr. TV is my first teacher.

343
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,359
- Mr. TV is a great teacher!
- Mr. TV.

344
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,479
All right, it's my wedding day.

345
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,869
Let's forget about TV series.

346
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,260
Come on, let's continue.

347
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,229
Peace in pieces.

348
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,799
The obstacle has been overcome. The best is yet to come.

349
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,679
The newlyweds are bound to be blessed.

350
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,290
Next, let's continue the ceremony.

351
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,390
Bow to each other.

352
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,080
♫ I only wish for the rest of my life smiling
with you watching these four seasons ♫

353
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,319
Come on.

354
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,540
Here, thank you very much.

355
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,779
Come on. I'd like to propose a toast to all of you.

356
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,030
Hi, everyone.

357
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,530
Thank you!

358
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,430
- Come on.
- Suit yourself.

359
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,360
Hi, everyone.

360
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,740
I'd like to propose a toast to all of you.

361
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

362
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,749
thank you for taking time from your tight schedule to attend our wedding.

363
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,679
Please forgive me if I have some oversight today.

364
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,719
Enjoy yourself.

365
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,740
I'll empty it.

366
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,180
He's really good at getting himself busy.

367
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,359
All right, all right.

368
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,250
It's already the inner yard.

369
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,110
You can stop here.

370
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,740
Your Sister is waiting for me inside.

371
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,030
Come on.

372
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,970
Thank you all for coming to congratulate us today.

373
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,319
It's late now.

374
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,010
Friends, it's time to say goodbye now.

375
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,989
Why?

376
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,269
You want us to leave even before we are done teasing you?

377
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,630
Yeah, don't let us down. Please allow us to.

378
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,140
Yeah, allow us.

379
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,049
You're all kids. You are not allowed to.

380
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,500
All right. Stop all the mischief.

381
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,170
Oh, it turns out that Young Master is eager to consummate now.

382
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,629
Don't tell tales.

383
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,339
All right! Enough. I won't see you out.

384
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:41,140
Alright! Thank you for your wishes.

385
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,110
Why are you still up?

386
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,359
The Cloth Store will be open tomorrow.

387
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,700
I still have something to deal with.

388
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,160
You did pretty good in the ceremony today.

389
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,700
I did what I should do.

390
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,599
I'll leave you to it.

391
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,560
I'm going back to the guest room.

392
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,060
Wait.

393
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't sleep in the guest room anymore.

394
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,320
Sleep in the wing room from today on.

395
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,630
Okay.

396
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,870
There still is room for improvement.

397
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,150
Fine.

398
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,310
Anyway, I can sleep anywhere.

399
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,180
Your Lordship.

400
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,150
Are they sleep?

401
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,510
Yes.

402
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,080
He's sleeping alone in the wing room.

403
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,030
Bring the thing on the table to him.

404
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,730
Isn't this…

405
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,650
Are you here for me?

406
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,199
The weather is hot. His lordship cares about you,

407
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
so he asked me to bring you the bug repellent sachet.

408
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,660
His Lordship?

409
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,110
My father-in-law

410
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,100
cares about me instead of his daughter.

411
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,560
He's so weird.

412
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,580
Grandfather, please enjoy the tea.

413
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,600
Since you have married into the Su Family,

414
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,840
some rules you still have to obey.

415
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,959
Serve tea and wait upon the elders every day.

416
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,800
I don't expect you to have any achievements.

417
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,890
You only need to do your job.

418
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,390
Yes.

419
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,199
Su's Cloth Store will officially open tomorrow.

420
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
Let's come here tomorrow.

421
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
Boss,

422
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,509
a total of 800 pieces of Cloud Silk and Gauze

423
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,250
have been counted and already put in storage.

424
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,780
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

425
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,199
Everyone, the store will open as planned tomorrow.

426
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,680
Thank you for your hard work today.

427
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Go back and have a rest now.

428
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,510
- Thank you, Boss.
- Thank you, Boss.

429
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,149
Xiao Chan, please accompany me to the temple

430
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,269
and pray for the opening tomorrow.

431
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,870
Yes, Miss.

432
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,230
Let's go.

433
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,630
This is Ning Yi.

434
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,830
I'm here to serve tea.

435
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,750
Your Lordship?

436
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,200
You didn't see him? Never mind.

437
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,749
You didn't even attend their wedding. Thanks.

438
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,250
It doesn't matter if you ignore the one who serves tea.

439
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,200
Anyway, he's now Tan'er's husband.

440
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,760
Your daughter will be the only one that bears suffering.

441
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,560
He won't see me?

442
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,130
Anyway, you came.

443
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,180
He probably won't see you.

444
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,630
Is he against me?

445
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,260
No.

446
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,280
You don't deserve that.

447
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,870
The Cloth Store is opening tomorrow.

448
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,150
I'm here to pray for blessing.

449
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,200
May everything go well.

450
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,270
Miss, won't you pray for your marriage?

451
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,440
I can't be that greedy.

452
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,070
I will be totally satisfied as long as the cloth store does well.

453
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,370
Can it be that the opening of the cloth store won't go smoothly tomorrow?

454
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,520
Don't worry too much, Miss.

455
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,220
Go back to the cloth store with me.

456
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,989
Young Master, the Second Master is the most unsatisfied with us.

457
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,680
They may put you in an awkward situation later.

458
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,960
Just put up with it.

459
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,600
Don't make any trouble since you just married.

460
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,150
[Su's Account Book]

461
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,010
I gave you a whole night to check the account.

462
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,389
There are 22 account books in total.

463
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,749
But you only finished four or five.

464
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,629
Are you ashamed to take a doze here?

465
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,330
Tell me.

466
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,500
Tell me.

467
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,700
Tell me! Are you a loser?

468
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,150
You loser! Loser!

469
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,909
Come. Eat the rest of them.

470
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,670
Eat it.

471
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,869
Come on. Eat the rest of the account books.

472
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,030
Eat it!

473
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,210
Eat!

474
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,810
He's gone too far.

475
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,940
Stop!

476
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,350
There are 22 account books in total.

477
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,029
Each book has 192 pages.

478
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,839
Each page includes 40 entries.

479
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,600
So there are 168,960 entries in total.

480
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,559
You asked him to audit them all in a night.

481
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,959
If we say he had eight hours in the night, which is 480 minutes,

482
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,760
he should audit at least 352 entries per minute

483
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,870
without any rest.

484
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,200
Show me if you have

485
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,830
the capability to do so.

486
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,210
Who the heck are you?

487
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,199
So you're not shamed to be the matrilocal husband,

488
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,770
but want to step into our business?

489
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,960
You're here to serve tea?

490
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,029
What a coincidence! My father is not here.

491
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Serve it to me.

492
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,770
Young Master.

493
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,930
Serve tea.

494
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,000
Cousin-in-law, enjoy your tea.

495
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,490
Cousin-in-law, please enjoy the tea.

496
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,359
This is too cold.

497
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,340
How can I drink it?

498
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
Serve again.

499
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,120
Yes.

500
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,330
Cousin-in-law, please have the tea.

501
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,440
Do you want to scald me?

502
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
You're so careless.

503
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,630
How can you serve Tan'er in the future?

504
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,330
Serve again.

505
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,960
Cousin-in-law, this cup of tea is neither cold nor hot.

506
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,940
It's just right. Have a taste.

507
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,950
It's too full.

508
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,310
I'd spill it when I hold it.

509
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah, it really spilled.

510
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,330
You b*stard!

511
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,880
How dare you!

512
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,230
You give me...

513
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,990
Stop!

514
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,809
Come on. Why are you hopping about?

515
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,480
Why has my arm become five cm shorter?

516
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,370
Second Young Master! Second Young Master!

517
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,540
Young Master, please stop.

518
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,230
Let go of me.

519
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,600
Stop fighting. Stop fighting!

520
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,079
Second Young Master! Second Young Master!

521
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,319
Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

522
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,269
Calm down! Stop fighting!

523
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,669
Calm down.

524
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,509
Let go of him!

525
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,709
I will beat the pants off of you.

526
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,469
Who was kneeling and begging for mercy?

527
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,359
You used a sneak attack

528
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,709
or I could have beaten the pants off of you.

529
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,370
Everything was above board. You…

530
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,269
Get away!

531
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,879
Lord Zhang, Wen Xing has always been well-behaved and gentle.

532
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Your daughter and my son are a perfect match.

533
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,320
I'm going to kill you!

534
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,800
Su Wen Xing, stop!

535
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,690
I didn't expect that you, just a matrilocal husband,

536
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,499
were bold enough to fight with the Second Master.

537
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,640
You're good, too.

538
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,800
Don't think that I didn't see you also kicked him.

539
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,910
Well, the chief steward

540
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,669
introduced me to be the guard here.

541
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,710
I owed him a favor.

542
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,400
Young Master, despite what I am now,

543
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,190
when I was young, I was also a bold swordsman.

544
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,140
Okay.

545
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,839
Warrior Geng, is the tea serving almost done?

546
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,989
Can I go back to sleep now?

547
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,319
It's still early.

548
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,500
All the aunties in the Su Family...

549
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,319
My lady's aunts and uncles have all come from the other cities.

550
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,740
My lady said you had to serve them one by one.

551
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,200
I didn't expect that even a bold warrior like you

552
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,810
would like to read romantic novels.

553
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,469
- The Biography of Ying Ying!
- Young Master! Young Master!

554
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,999
- A Story in a Pi–
- No! Don't!

555
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:32,989
I'll look at this side.

556
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,949
The Biography of Huo Xiao Yu? Who's Huo Xiao Yu?

557
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,079
Then I'll see those.

558
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,549
- A Story in a Pillow.
- Please. Come on.

559
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,259
Let me see them. Tell me about the story!

560
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,920
Tell me!

561
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,360
Miss, I've done checking.

562
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,079
All the aired cloth has been put in storage.

563
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,840
Nothing has been missed.

564
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,920
The tiles on the warehouse roof, the courtyard's drainage

565
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,039
and other constructions were all supervised by you.

566
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,319
You just checked them again.

567
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,920
Everything is fine.

568
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,920
Let's go.

569
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,180
Sentimental novels in Wu Dynasty are so bad.

570
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,320
My novels are much better than them.

571
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,740
Boss!

572
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,930
Boss!

573
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,689
Something bad is happening! Boss!

574
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,650
Emergency! Boss!

575
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,410
Miss! Please open the door.

576
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,580
Miss! Miss!

577
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,180
- Boss!
- Miss! Miss!

578
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,790
- Open the door! Hurry up!
- Miss!

579
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,610
Miss! Something is wrong with the warehouse.

580
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,980
What?

581
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,970
Give me the umbrella.

582
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,670
- Go.
- Hurry.

583
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,900
Hurry up, everyone.

584
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,319
The silk of Cloud Silk and Gauze is special.

585
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,600
It must be kept from water.

586
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,039
Manager, only a few dry gauze were saved.

587
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,080
The rest have been drowned.

588
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,650
Boss. Boss.

589
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,360
I don't know why there is a roof leak.

590
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,900
♫ There's a sudden windstorm tonight ♫

591
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,470
♫ It's you that is reflected in the rain ♫

592
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:15,080
♫ The misty rain azure color is disappointing ♫

593
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,560
♫  Whose eyes are filled with ripples ♫

594
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,460
Hurry up!

595
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,750
Move faster! Hurry!

596
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,969
Boss. Boss.

597
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,759
Miss! Miss!

598
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,849
- Hurry!
- Miss.

599
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,969
Hurry.

600
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,470
Hurry up!

601
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:43,040
♫  Just now how much I knew you ♫

602
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,480
♫ Under the moonlight, the shadow is tenuous ♫

603
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,180
♫ The colorful clouds paint a landscape scenery ♫

604
00:42:52,180 --> 00:43:00,720
♫ Just a glimpse of you will wake me up from my dream ♫

605
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,240
♫  Your love is strong and does not change ♫

606
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,670
♫ Leaning against the sunset ♫

607
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,150
♫ Leaning against the sunset as I ponder about poetry ♫

608
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,970
♫ I only know you ♫

609
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,400
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

610
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,030
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

611
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,770
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

612
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,370
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

613
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:27,540
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

614
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,360
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

615
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,390
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

616
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:43,100
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

617
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,250
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

618
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,470
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

619
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,570
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

620
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,900
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

621
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,010
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

622
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,380
