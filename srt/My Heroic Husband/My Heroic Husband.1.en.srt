00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,580
Please pay extra attention.

169
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,319
Don't worry. I won't have you work hard for nothing!

170
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,499
- Yes!
- Yes!

171
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,578
Let's go. Get back to work.

172
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,658
Manager Xi, please get some silver ingots from the accountant and reward them.

173
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:53,339
Yes.

174
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,260
Clean up carefully.

175
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,098
Miss, Young Master is awake!

176
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,520
Is he?

177
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,859
Great!

178
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,059
How's his condition?

179
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,178
He's fine,

180
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,740
but Xiao Chan said he doesn't remember anything.
[Guard Geng]

181
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,779
It seems he suffers from memory loss.

182
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,580
Memory loss?

183
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,599
Never mind, as long as he's fine.

184
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,038
Guard Geng, I'm still busy and cannot leave here.

185
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,220
Please take care of Young Master for me.

186
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,539
I'll be there after I check the Cloud Silk and Gauze.

187
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,340
Miss!

188
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,299
The Cloud Silk and Gauze is important, but tomorrow you'll get married.

189
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,859
You haven't even tried on your wedding dress.

190
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,180
Aunt Niu sent me here to remind you that.

191
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,020
Abdominal muscles are gone.

192
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,259
Pectoral muscles are gone.

193
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,380
So are my biceps!

194
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,579
The dress is so pretty!

195
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,539
Tell me about it!

196
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,418
I've never seen such a beautiful wedding dress!

197
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,179
It's so nice! So pretty!

198
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,819
Where's our Young Lady's veil and hairpin?

199
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,658
I forgot them!

200
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,939
Look at you! Go get them, now!

201
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,490
♫ Looking at your beautiful face,
upends the thoughts in my mind ♫

202
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,940
♫ At this moment, I am dazzled ♫

203
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,500
♫ Like petals on the tip of fingertips ♫

204
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,050
♫ In that bay with trembling in the blue waves ♫

205
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,780
♫ Like a cool breeze painting looking forward to a shadow ♫

206
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,420
♫ I'll always want to be with you ♫

207
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,200
♫ Even if everything is slow and ordinary  ♫

208
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,150
♫  I've traveled all over the sky and seen all the rivers ♫

209
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,020
♫ You're the only one that is unforgettable ♫

210
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,200
♫ All the beauty of the eye will fade several times ♫

211
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,050
My fiancée.

212
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,850
♫ In the frosty winter and the snowy mountains  ♫

213
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,360
♫ Look forward to the blooming flowers and willows' secrets ♫

214
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,760
♫ I want to give you endless warmth ♫

215
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,290
♫ I've traveled all over the sky and seen all the rivers ♫

216
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,200
♫ You're the only one that is unforgettable ♫

217
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,040
No wonder she needs a matrilocal husband!

218
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,519
But she's too old for me!

219
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,719
Aunt Niu, why are you trying on the wedding dress? Where's our Lady?

220
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,299
She's checking the Cloud Silk and Gauze.

221
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,699
So, she asked Aunt Niu to try it on for her.

222
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,379
Aunt Niu and I have similar figures.

223
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,699
And she brought me up. She knows what fits me best.

224
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,079
Aunt Niu can try it on for me.

225
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,339
What is Young Master doing?

226
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,000
He's carrying a bag… Is he running away?

227
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,599
I think he is!

228
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,299
Let's get him!

229
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,398
Young Master! Young Master!

230
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,779
Young Master!

231
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,459
Young Master! Young Master!

232
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,498
Don't come over!

233
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,459
I-I-I'll kick you!

234
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,299
Xiao Chan! Go get more people!

235
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,000
More people?

236
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,999
Young Master! Young Master!

237
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:34,899
Young Master!

238
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,960
Young Master! Young Master!

239
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,119
Such a rich family!

240
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,999
They have so many servants!

241
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,918
Young Master! Young Master!

242
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,320
Young Master! Young Master!

243
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,820
Young Master!

244
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,520
Search!

245
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,799
- Is he here?
- No!

246
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,959
Let's go! Go search the next room!

247
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,700
Young Master!

248
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,479
Father!
 [Su Zhong Kan]

249
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,339
He really ran away?

250
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,000
It's true, Father!
[Su Wen Xing]

251
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,459
The servants said

252
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:24,258
after Ning Yi woke up, he kept asking Chan'er questions.

253
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,938
He doesn't even remember his own name!

254
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,498
And his actions were strange as well.

255
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,059
He was trying on the wedding robe,

256
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,658
but then, he suddenly started running away like a maniac.

257
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,799
I bet the attack has damaged his brain!

258
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,699
Your grandfather suddenly wants to pass the seal to a grandchild.

259
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:40,139
Su Tan'er is just a girl.

260
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,039
How can she win against you?

261
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,218
That's why she desperately found a poor scholar to be her matrilocal husband.

262
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,759
But grandfather values her a lot.

263
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,079
He even asked her to take charge of the new store.

264
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,799
So what?

265
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,880
Ning Yi was already stupid,

266
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,259
and now the attack makes him a fool.

267
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,359
If the wedding is canceled, Su Tan'er will have to marry herself off.

268
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,960
In that case, she'll take a different last name.

269
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,559
A girl with a different family name

270
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,619
will have nothing to do with the seal.

271
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:16,939
By then, your grandfather won't even let her take charge of the store,

272
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:20,019
let alone the seal!

273
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,759
Miss! Miss!

274
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,819
Young Master ran away!

275
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,059
What? When did he ran away?

276
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,579
I don't know!

277
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,318
Has he been found? Go find him now!

278
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,519
What on earth is going on?

279
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,178
Miss, we'll go find Young Master!

280
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,258
It's raining heavily right now.

281
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,880
He shouldn't get too far.

282
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,099
You guys, get out through the front and back gates of the Manor.

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,418
Look for him carefully!

284
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,060
And you guys, go look for him in the courtyard.

285
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,300
Yes!

286
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,100
Miss, if we can't find Young Master, your second Uncle—

287
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,978
That's right, Miss.

288
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,779
If your second Uncle finds out that Young Master is gone,

289
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,339
he definitely will trouble you!

290
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
Let's find him first.

291
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,658
Young Master Ning Yi has just gotten better, and he's still out of his senses.

292
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:00,978
What should we do if he has another accident?

293
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:02,519
Don't just wait here! Let's all go find him!

294
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,498
- Yes.
- Miss!

295
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:04,779
Please get changed first.

296
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,018
We've sent out many people to…

297
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,379
She's a nice person,

298
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,340
but just not suitable for me!

299
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,800
What happened?

300
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,218
Why did he suddenly run away?

301
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:36,159
Father, I heard that after Ning Yi woke up, he lost all his memory,
[Su Yu]

302
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,539
and he acted and behaved in a weird manner.

303
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,559
I'm afraid he's gone crazy.

304
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
Crazy my ass!

305
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,220
Grandfather.

306
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:49,960
Grandfather, Ning Yi is missing.

307
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,259
Sorry to have worried you and my uncles.

308
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,738
It's my fault.

309
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:56,710
I'd like to apologize and ask for punishment!

310
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,319
Grandfather,

311
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,280
now Ning Yi has gone crazy.

312
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,498
I think the wedding should be put off.

313
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,579
No, it can't be!

314
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,619
The wedding date has been long determined,

315
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,579
and we've sent out invitations.
 [Madam Yao]

316
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,299
It's not proper to call it off.

317
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,899
Just because the invitations have been sent out,

318
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,759
we have to cancel it in time.

319
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,259
All the guests we invited are well-known people in Jiangning.

320
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:18,920
If any trouble comes up,

321
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,300
our Su Family will be disgraced!

322
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,260
That's right.

323
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,639
In my opinion, Tan'er should have been betrothed with the eldest son of the Wu Family.

324
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:30,738
Since always, parents have been in charge of their children's marriage arrangement.

325
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,738
But Tan'er has been a rebellious since she was little.

326
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,099
Not only does she run her cloth business in public,

327
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,340
she even chose her own husband.

328
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,920
Now that such an accident has happened,

329
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,459
how will you deal with it, Sister-in-law?

330
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,979
Such being the case,

331
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,459
it's not a bad idea to put off the wedding.

332
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,039
But our new store is about to open,

333
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,739
and Tan'er is waiting to get married.

334
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,179
How can she take charge of the new store?

335
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,820
It's not appropriate!

336
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,819
- Why don't we—
- Second Uncle, so all you want

337
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,319
is to take away my management over the new store!

338
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,419
Tan'er, we are just worried about you.

339
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:19,139
Since Ning Yi is missing, and your wedding can't be held as scheduled,

340
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,440
we all have to be humiliated with you.

341
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,878
- Even if Ning Yi is found, he's gone crazy.
- Where's the silkworm?

342
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:28,979
As your uncle, how can I stand by and let you marry him?

343
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:32,480
I think the wedding should be called off.

344
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,819
As an unmarried girl, how can you run the new store by yourself?

345
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,620
Just let your cousin and I share your burden.

346
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,018
It's urgent.

347
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:43,520
Father, please make a decision!

348
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:46,340
Grandfather,

349
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,100
I can swear right now that I will never get married.

350
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,339
I'll adopt children in the future and carry on our family line.

351
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,938
I promise I won't ruin the Su's reputation!

352
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,439
Nonsense!

353
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,140
Younger Sister, I know you feel upset, but there's no other choice.

354
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,319
Your fiancé has run away!

355
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,359
Ning Yi Heng was kind of silly before,

356
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,119
and now he's become crazy!

357
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,119
Since you have bad taste in men,

358
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,499
your taste in fabrics must also…

359
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:24,139
Two men bully a woman!

360
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,159
What's that about?!

361
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,760
Why did they stop arguing?

362
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,460
Young Master!

363
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,359
Come here! Young Master! Come here!

364
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,619
Come here, Young Master!

365
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,480
Come out!

366
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:54,900
Ning Yi Heng!

367
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,658
We… We've been looking for him the whole afternoon.

368
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,379
It turns out he's having fun under the table!

369
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,680
But, why are you shaking?

370
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,579
Is it fun?

371
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,140
Was that your playmate under the table?

372
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,498
Were you chatting?

373
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:06,938
Were you having fun?

374
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,759
Were you having a great time chatting?

375
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,580
Grandfather, look at him!

376
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,379
Look at his unusual behavior!

377
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,280
I say, you've really become a lunatic!

378
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,539
You're the lunatic!

379
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,580
You're not only crazy, but also evil!

380
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,859
You're an adult, yet you're still bullying your younger sister!

381
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,599
Shame on you!

382
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,698
But it makes sense. Like father, like son.

383
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,540
Your father is shameless, too!

384
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,059
It's all because he wants to take over the cloth store.

385
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,219
He speaks like a moral person, yet he's full of evil thoughts!

386
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,178
How dare you!

387
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,018
Grandfather is right here! How dare you speak so rudely?!

388
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,859
Grandfather, he's gone crazy.

389
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,619
He's not qualified to marry into the Su Family!

390
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,440
That's right!

391
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
Even if Tan'er has been engaged,

392
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,079
since ancient times, the right way for a woman to assist her husband is to raise her children at home.

393
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,739
Shut up!

394
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:52,978
Be a housewife?

395
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,860
Did you make these rules?

396
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,738
Do all women have to listen to you?

397
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:59,978
Why can't they make their own ways and have their own career?

398
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:03,220
In the history of textiles, all successful leading practitioners

399
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,018
were not men but women.

400
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,299
Like the weaver girl who imparted textile knowledge,

401
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,978
and Lei Zu who invented the silk loom.

402
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,779
Even the founder was a woman!

403
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,900
You two even forgot where you came from!

404
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,978
Moreover, it's a cloth store, and all your customers are women.

405
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,018
You two are both men.

406
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,819
Do you know what women like?

407
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,379
The store hasn't even opened, yet you keep saying she can't make it!

408
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,738
Are you a fortune teller?

409
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:25,658
You know what will happen in the future?

410
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,698
Are you Zhuge Liang and you Sima Yi?

411
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,139
If you can tell a fortune, why don't you tell mine?

412
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,599
The result will speak for itself,

413
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,339
and the result hasn't come out yet!

414
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,720
Last but not least,

415
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,579
Grandfather, the decision-maker, is not confused yet.

416
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,859
Who allowed you two to talk nonsense like that?

417
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,879
Enough!

418
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,520
Tan'er will be in charge of the store.

419
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,440
The most important thing for now is the wedding tomorrow!

420
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,139
Mr. Old Man, we still need to talk about the wedding.

421
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,840
Why?

422
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Let me speak to Miss Su in person.

423
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,980
Miss Su,

424
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,740
I admit

425
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,539
that I do admire you.

426
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,879
I admire your talent,

427
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:31,940
your courage, and what you've done.

428
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,939
You are very outstanding.

429
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:39,730
But, even though I admire you,

430
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,010
we don't have to get married

431
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,059
to be close to each other.

432
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,440
We can be sworn brothers!

433
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,680
From today on, you'll be my older brother and I'll be your good buddy.

434
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,159
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

435
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,459
What do you think?

436
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,400
What are you talking about? I can't understand.

437
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,779
If you have any thoughts about our marriage,

438
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,200
you can tell me directly.

439
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,459
You're Miss Su?

440
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:14,899
Yes.

441
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:23,490
♫ Leave behind all the past ♫

442
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,350
♫ Your answer falls short of making sense ♫

443
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,978
I'm sorry!

444
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:33,290
I lay on my stomach for too long.

445
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,980
My legs were getting numb!

446
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,398
Young Master Ning, hurry and get up.

447
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,130
Xiao Chan, help Young Master get up.

448
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:44,479
Young Master!

449
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,799
Grandfather, Young Master Ning has just recovered.

450
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,158
He hasn't fully regained his consciousness.

451
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,460
I'll take him back to his room for rest.

452
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,339
But since he's not suffering any major problems,

453
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:57,599
the wedding can be held tomorrow as scheduled.

454
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,240
Go ahead.

455
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:05,299
Grandfather!

456
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,100
Bye-bye!

457
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:13,059
Just now, you helped me in the meeting hall.

458
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,779
I should thank you.

459
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,499
But after you woke up, you acted like a completely different person.

460
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:22,219
I believe it's because of your memory loss.

461
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:26,039
I hope you won't make any trouble in the future.

462
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,759
Sorry to interrupt,

463
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,720
but were we…

464
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,959
Your family and mine have been close.

465
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,539
Yet your family later was caught in a predicament,

466
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,320
and lived on borrowed money.

467
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,900
Xiao Chan,

468
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,699
this is the evidence of the debt of your family.

469
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,680
You and I are engaged.

470
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,800
You agreed to marry into our family.
[Debt Note]

471
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,599
When I get the seal, I'll write off all your debts.

472
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,199
Until then, I'll support you and give you a monthly allowance,

473
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,639
and I will take care of you till death.

474
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,800
Got it!

475
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,840
You're my sugar mommy!

476
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,459
Sugar mommy?

477
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,219
I mean… I mean…

478
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,879
it's a deal.

479
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,179
As I thought…

480
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:22,499
How can such a rich and beautiful girl fall for a loser like Ning Yi?

481
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,360
Go on. Please.

482
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,000
Tomorrow we'll get married,

483
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,440
but you've been acting weird since you woke up,

484
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,199
which makes me worried.

485
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,859
Why don't we make a pledge?

486
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:39,699
During the marriage, if you make any trouble,

487
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:43,339
I'll send you to the government and sue you for default.

488
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:47,260
Such a crime will put you in jail for at least three years.

489
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,938
There are no emotional ties between us at all? That's too harsh!

490
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:53,320
You need not worry

491
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,340
if you don't make any trouble.

492
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,840
Fine.

493
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,960

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,960
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind.
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

656
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,630
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

657
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:21,900
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

658
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,630
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

659
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,400
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

660
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,400
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

661
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,400
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

662
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,800
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

663
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,800
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

664
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,200
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

665
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,200
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

666
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

667
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,500
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

668
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

669
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

670
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,600
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

671
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,200
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

672
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,600
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

673
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,600
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

674
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,000
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

675
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

676
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
