[Taiping Alley]

4
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,339
Bringing so many people here

5
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,500
just for Chen Da Mu?

6
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,339
Seriously?

7
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:01,798
What do you think? Should we go down?

8
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,460
Chen Da Mu worked for Wenhan's.

9
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,999
Why should we go down?

10
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,339
So why are we here?

11
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,598
Lad,

12
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,599
is my vice general, Chen Da Mu, in your hands?

13
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,799
Deliver him over to me.

14
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,299
Dead or alive, bring him to me.

15
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,858
Wang Jin, kill him.

16
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:33,959
- Yes.
- Hold on.

17
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,139
Do you people have manners?

18
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,039
I'm eating noodles.

19
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,860
I'm afraid I can't bring you the Chen something

20
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,279
you're looking for.

21
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,419
It's not because I don't want to, but he's been exploded into pieces.

22
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,459
If you still want to see him,

23
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,158
I can get a bowl to collect some remains of him.

24
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,859
Shut up!

25
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,859
Who are you?

26
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,099
A great man never changes his name wherever he goes.

27
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,419
I'm known as Bloody Hands Slayer.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,480
Bloody Hands Slayer?

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,260
You called yourself Bloody Hands Slayer?

30
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,720
Look at your thin arms and legs.

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,980
Don't laugh at me.

32
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,380
You will cry soon.

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,959
Since you've come to this street,

34
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,840
I will tell you directly.

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
Have you seen this box?

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,419
It's filled with gunpowder.

37
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,280
Have you seen the fuse?

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,599
If I ignite the thin one, you will all be exploded into pieces.

39
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,180
If I ignite the thick one,

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,660
then we will perish together.

41
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,380
What?

42
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,659
You want to deceive me with some cords?

43
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,638
Do you really think that I'm stupid?

44
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:04,198
Guys, whoever kills him for me will be rewarded a gold bar.

45
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:06,659
I'd like to see who dares come.

46
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,059
Guys, kill him!

47
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,179
Yes, hurry up! Hurry!

48
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Come on.

49
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,260
You didn't believe me, did you?

50
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,580
I want to see who isn't afraid of death will come.

51
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,599
- Thick, thick, thick…
- Thick what?

52
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,979
The thick one has been ignited!

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,800
- Back off!
- Hide yourselves.

54
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,820
Boss.

55
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,279
- He ran!
- Stop

56
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,038
- Guys, go after him!
- Kill him.

57
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,259
Go!

58
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,960
Go! You all!

59
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,920
Interesting.

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,498
Let's go and follow them.

61
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,299
Go.

62
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:30,158
- Over there! There!
- Chase him!

63
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:31,720
Over there!

64
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,318
Commander Da Biao, did you see where that bastard headed?

65
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:39,819
Bastard?

66
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,638
No. Did you see him?

67
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:46,140
Weird. I saw him running towards there.

68
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,079
He was the person who killed Chen Da Mu.

69
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,539
He led the soldiers from Wude Camp to have some of our men killed.

70
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,298
Then, you should look for him carefully.

71
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:57,459
Hurry, go.

72
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,859
Yes. Let's go.

73
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,859
Commander Da Biao?

74
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Can't be.

- Have you seen Li Pin?
- No.

77
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,459
Lady Lou is not here, either.

78
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,978
Did something happen?

79
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,058
Cut it out.

80
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,638
My Lady, it's dangerous here.

81
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:47,838
You go on the boat with Chan first.

82
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:49,458
- I will wait for Young Master here.
- No.

83
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,919
Hubby hasn't come. I will wait for him here.

84

My Lady, it's dangerous here!

85

Don't push!

How dare you make fun of me!

91

Run!

Tell you what.

That Liu Da Biao is a girl.

No way.

98
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,799
He's known for being fierce, strong and vulgar.

99
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,459
He even has chest hair!

100
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,499
You saw him?

101
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,260
No.

102
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,919
Forget it.

103
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,499
I will kill him if he comes.

104

By the way, if we can escape this time,

deliver some words to my mother.

Stop. You can't say that.

107
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,618
According to my experience,

108
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:45,579
anyone who says something like that will die soon.

109
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,719
Over there! Go check there!

110
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,159
- Find them!
- Let's go!

- This road leads directly to the wharf.
- Place it here.

Take care, kid. Leave the rest to us.

124

Thanks, General!

125
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,878
General, if it is conquered, you should preserve your life.

126
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,559
Take care!

On the wharf behind us are the people we swore to protect.

This sand field is the last line of defense.

130

Although we're outnumbered by the bandits, we are the elite soldiers

131

from Wude Camp!

132
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,179
We have to stay until the last moment

133
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,819
and fight till the last man's standing,

134
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,359
even if we can't live till tomorrow and never see our parents again.

135
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,279
He just left like this?

136
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,460
So, you also misjudge sometimes.

137
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,399
This lad is just a coward deserter.

138
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,299
So boring.

139
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,738

Time for a meal.

141
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,359
Aren't you leaving?

142
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,939
You can leave yourself.

143
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,499
We're not from the same camp anyway.

144
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,480
Our death today shall be weightier than Mount Tai.

145
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,018
Those lucky enough to survive

146
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,320
will remember this and tell of the battle tonight to future generations.

147
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,240
We Wude soldiers are brave!

148

Fight till the last man's standing!

149
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,419
I would rather die than give in!

150
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,699
Fight till the last man's standing!

151
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,138
I would rather die than give in!

152
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,459
Fight till the last man's standing!

153

I would rather die than give in!

154

155
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,220
Get ready!

156
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,059
Kill them!

157
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,960
Brothers! Charge!

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,340
Kill them!

159
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,618
We will leave immediately! Please wait for us!

160
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,778
Why hasn't he come? Please wait for us.

00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,520
We have to stay until the last moment

173
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,419
and fight till the last man's standing

174
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,739
even if we can't live till tomorrow

175
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,980
and never see our parents again.

176
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,219
Come on. Get on the boat!

177
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:46,479
Get on the boat now!

178
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:49,259
Hurry up! Get on the boat!

179
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,979
He dares to come back!

180
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,060
Interesting.

181
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Lad, how dare you come back?

182
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,359
You've had some guts!

183
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:07,200
Looks like I've underestimated you.

184
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,759
Set them free!

185
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,999
I will spare your life.

186
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,419
What?

187
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,259
You're bold.

188
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,538
With one of your arrows?

189
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,538
Don't mind me! Leave now!

190
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:29,160
No one can leave here.

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,119
None of you can leave today.

192
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,359
You come back! Stop!
[Yangxin Hall]

193
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,259
You are so bad!

194
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,800
I got you! Where are you going?

195
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,358
Run! Let's run!

196
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,140
- Your Majesty!
- I-I got you!

197
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,219
Don't go, Your Majesty.

198
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,460
Don't go.

199
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,118
Minister, when did you come?

200
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,820
Why didn't you announce your arrival?

201
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,459
Your Majesty, taking the circumstance into consideration,

202
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,120
Minister told me not to disturb you.

203
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,079
Minister,

204
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,859
please forgive me if I made you feel unwelcome.

205
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,519
Your Majesty.

206
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,620
The cake was so exquisitely made.

207
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,778
It looks like candy from outside and contains almond inside.

208
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,079
Chew it after it melts in the mouth.

209
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,060
The taste is really great.

210
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,879
But... you came here today

211
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,119
not only to send me the cake, right?

212
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,759
I...

213
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,620
I entered the Minister Institute when your Majesty was young

214
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,499
and have accompanied you to grow up.

215
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,359
You didn't like reading when you were young.

216
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,539
So, I'd bring some desserts

217
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,099
to the class for you.

218
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:47,059
Then you'd be willing to read.

219
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,580
I really thought

220
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,599
that was a great time.

221
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,259
Because at least

222
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,599
you wouldn't be thinking about the reason

223
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,520
why I brought some cake for you.

224
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:09,019
Minister, you are criticizing me.

225
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,778
Fine, fine. I've thought too much.

226
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,080
But even if you hadn't come here,

227
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,419
I would visit you.

228
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:21,110
Majesty, what is it?

229
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,979
Recently, some bandits have broken into Lin'an.

230
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,159
You must have heard that, too.

231
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,600
Right Chancellor Qin suggest that

232
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,259
the north expedition plan should remain unchanged

233
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,159
and send General Dong to suppress Jing.

234
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,420
At the same time, another army should be sent

235
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,579
to Lin'an so as to eradicate the bandits.

236
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,100
Then they will go north and gather with the main force.

237
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:54,500
Minister, what do you think?

238
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,619
Your Majesty,

239
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,960
the nation is your Majesty's home.

240
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,659
We are just like the cake in the box.

241
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,619
If you like it, you can take it out and taste it.

242
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,059
You can just cover the lid

243
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,618
or even throw it away.

244
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:22,799
Whether it's gone or not,

245
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,299
it's all up to you.

246
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:27,318
The decree of the north expedition has been released

247
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:28,779
and it can't be withdrawn.

248
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,379
You're worried about the military stronghold.

249
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,639
However, there's only one General Dong in Wu.

250
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,220
It's up to you

251
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,939
where to send him.

252

256
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,838
Get up.

257
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,260
Thanks, Holy Master.

258
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:23,979
Where's Xi Gua?

259
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,780
She's dealing with the wharf issue.

260
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,780
Xi Gua has contributed a lot in taking down this city.

261
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,559
Should I ask her to meet you?

262
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,020
No need. Let's check the goods first.

263

Holy Master. Holy Master.

264

We have captured all the guards in the city.

Holy Master. What…

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,959
- Holy Master.
- Do you know what this place is?

269
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,358
How dare you use fire!

270
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,458
Holy Master, please don't mad at us. I'm green and inexperienced.

271
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,159
I've never come to the military stronghold before, so I was being careless.

272
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,599
Please forgive me!

273
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,539
You all listen!

274
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,038
This is the military stronghold.

275
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:26,980
No fire shall be here!

276
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,758
If I see anyone use fire again, he will be killed instantly.

277
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,459
Yes!

278
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,040
We have lived in the city.

279
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,618
We can't do whatever we want like when we are in the mountains.

280
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:39,039
There should be rules!

281
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,938
Brace yourself! Do you understand?

282
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,439
Yes!

283
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,378
Get up!

284
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,339
You ignorant bastard.

285
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,740
Yes.

286
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,400
The scale of this powder warehouse

287
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,620
is beyond our imagination.

288
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,780
We have got hundreds of powder warehouses like this.

289
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,558
With all the gunpowder, you will lead us to march forward

290
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:19,979
and be ever successful.

291
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:20,979
Enough.

292
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,900
You have said a lot of flattery words.

293
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,580
Now that we have got the gunpowder,

294
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,859
but we also hold a hot potato.

295
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,640
Sooner or later, the court will come to us.

296
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,680
What are you going to do?

297
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,150
My dear. Look.

298
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,720
If there's only one box of gunpowder then it's just gunpowder.

299
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,899
But if we have 10,000 boxes of it,

300
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:50,560
it will no longer just be the gunpower.

301
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,819
What will it be?

302
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,119
It's our prospect.

303
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,580
Prospect.

304
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,600
Whoever dares to play with us now, just let him come at us.

305
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,000
I will let him have a good time as long as he wants.

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
Let's go.

307
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,700
Brother, these are the craftsmen who make weapons.

308
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,300
Untie them.

309
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Master, here's the thing.

310
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,500
I don't think the gunpowder is easy to use.

311
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,000
It's too heavy.

312
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,800
I need you to change it into blunderbusses.

313
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,300
How long will it take to make 1,000?

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
Kill me instead.

315
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,400
You bastards.

316
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,000
I will not make it.

317
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
We will do it. We will do it now.

318
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm asking about the duration.

319
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,500
The duration is up to you.

320
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,300
You will decide the duration.

321
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,700
Okay.

322
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,000
Seven days.

323
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
I will come back and get them in seven days.

324
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,700
1,000 blunderbusses.

325
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,400
Not one less or one more or you die!

326
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,600
- Zheng Biao.
- Yes.

327
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,100
Kill those people.

328
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
Yes.

329
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,200
- You take them to work.
- Go! Go!

330
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,700
Get up! Go!

331
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,100
Your Majesty, Fang Tian Lei and his main force have occupied Lin'an.

332
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,300
Fang Tian Lei has entered the city and locked the city gates to fortify the city and collect supplies.

333
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,400
It's said no one of Wude Camp survived

334
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,300
and have lost contact.

335
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,800
What?

336
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
What about the gunpowder?

337
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm afraid the enemy has got it.

338
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
Ask…

339
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,400
Ask Wang Zhong Shu to come here.

340
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
I will draft an imperial edict.

341
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700
Yes.

342
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
I, favored by Haotian Emperor, order General Dong Dao Fu to

343
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,500
lead 100,000 soldiers to go south

344
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,400
and eradicate the bandits in Lin'an.

345

His Majesty hereby announces.

346
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,200
His Majesty's order has been accepted.

347
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,500
General Dong, His Majesty is very anxious right now.

348
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Please don't wait any longer. Get ready and go south.

349
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,300
Eunuch Zhang, please deliver my words to His Majesty.

350

I will get ready and set off soon.

351
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Okay. Then, go ahead.

352
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,500
I'm going back and tell His Majesty.

353
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,200
General, shouldn't we go north?

354
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,600
But… But why are we heading south?

355
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,700
What about the north?

356
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,900
Again?

Get on the boat.

I'm going to kill you.

359
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,400
Why are you people caring so much about your look?

360
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,510
Have you finished?

361

and had a high ambition since childhood.

can even catch a dragon in the sky or dive in the sea…

But I don't know how to manage it.

402
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Are you willing to be my military counselor and help me manage it?

403

No, I'm not.

the moment you stepped into Ba Dao Camp.

You will be my military counselor as I said.

How dare you laugh at me?

I dare not.

418
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,600
What I'm laughing about is

419
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
the soldiers in Wude Camp.

420
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600

And I've done all the dirty and rough work.

How could a father do this to his son?

Why did I give birth to such a loser like you?

458

I told you to do your job, but I didn't mean you should really do it.

What are you talking about, Father?

461
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,500
Think.

462
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,200
We've been working from dawn to night.

- Why?
- Why?

464
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
To show them we have changed ourselves

465
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
and willingly bear the burden of hard works.

466
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,300
Then, when Su Tan'er gets back, she can give us some store to manage.

467
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,400
So our hard work should be seen by Zhu's people.

468
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
It's the best that we are seen

working hard all the time.

473
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,500

- You are so slow!
- No.

476

If you keep working like this,

477
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,800
you will finish all the work in half an hour.

478

How are we supposed to work harder

479
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,000
and keep being assiduous?

480
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,500
Oh! What you mean is…

481
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
What you mean is we should work hard under their eyes

482
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,800
but slack off when we're alone.

483
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,600
That is the most effective way of working.

484
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Do you understand?

485
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,700
Yes, sure.

Why did she ignore me?

Let's take a little rest.

Something bad happened.

Something came up at Lin'an City.

501
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,200
What? Something came up at Lin'an City?

502
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Several Zhu's stalls have reported to me that

503
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,800
there have been more and more refugees on business streets recently.

504
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,400
I heard that they all fled from Lin'an City.

505
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Bandits have broken into the city, plundering and looting there.

506
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
Those who could escape have all escaped.

507
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,000
But those who couldn't…

508
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,300
Sister!

509
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,700
Sister, are you okay?

510
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Let's go to Su's Manor.

511
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,800
Come on. Hurry up!

512
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,300
Wen Xing, no matter what happens today and how tiring it is,

513
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,800
you have to draw the lines well! You got it?

514
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
Yes, Father!

515
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
Father, what is going on?

516
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
What is going on?

517
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,100
Why are they acting blind?

518
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
It shouldn't be like this.

519
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,800
- Second Master, Yunzhu asked you to come along.
- Yeah, coming!

520
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Hurry up!

521
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,200
Young Lady Yunzhu, you finally saw us. We two…

522
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,400
Master Su, please go back to Su's Manor with us.

523
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Su's Manor?

524
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Okay.

525
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,500
Lin'an has been occupied?

526
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,400
Father-in-law, be careful. Calm down.

527
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
Be careful with your health.

528
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
Let them finish.

529
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,200
I'm fine.

530
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,100
Young Lady Yunzhu, where did you get the information?

531
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,200
Why didn't we have any clues about it?

532
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
It's Zhu.

533
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,900
Zhu's stalls have expanded to Ju'an town and Wutuo Mountain nearby,

534
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,600
which are close to the business street.

535
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Some refugees have managed to escape from Lin'an City.

536
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They said Lin'an was occupied by the bandits a few days ago.

537
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Now, they are…

538
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
What?

539
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,100
They are hunting down merchants,

540
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,000
stealing money,

541
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,600
or… just killing them on the spot.

542
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,700
Killing them on the spot?

543
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,900
Does it mean my Tan'er…

544
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,499
I will go find her.

545
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,400
Bo Yong!

546
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
Master Su, I…
- Bo Yong!

547
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,100
Uncle!

548
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,300
Go find the doctor!

549
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Go get us a doctor!

550
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,800
Hurry!

551
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,400
Father, what should we do now?

552
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,200
Now my uncle fell ill

553
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,600
and we still don't know whether Tan'er is alive.

554
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,600
- Do you think Ning Yi…
- What?

555
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,000
Can't come back?

556
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah.

557
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,300
We've been suffering at Zhu for a long time.

558
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,200
If he died,

559
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,300
wouldn't it be wasted?

560
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Not necessarily.

561
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,200
How's Bo Yong's condition?

562
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,100
Don't worry, Father.

563
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,800
The doctor has checked on him and prescribed some soothing medicine

564
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,600
and said he will become better after days of rest.

565
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,000
Good.

566
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,900
Master Su, I was being too abrupt.

567
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,000
I was being too abrupt.

568
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's fine.

569
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
What we should do now is

570
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,600
to send people around to inquire about their whereabouts.

571
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Whether they are dead or alive depends on their own fates.

572
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
Father,

573
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,100
as I see it,

574
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,600
there is still an opportunity.

575
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,200
Second Master, you have a solution?

576
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,500
I wouldn't say it's a solution.

577
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,800
But we can try.

578
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,600
What is it? Say it!

579
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,100
Before Young Master left, he said

580
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,700
this trip was going to be special.

581
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,600
It was their honeymoon trip.

582
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
What is a honeymoon?

583
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
I can't explain it.

584
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,610
But literally,

585
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,200
it means they will be inseparable during this trip.

586
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,000
So, I guess Young Master would go from place to place.

587
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Again with a female company, he couldn't have traveled too fast.

588
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Maybe, they haven't arrived in Lin'an now.

589
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,600
Go on.

590
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes.

591
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,100
In my opinion,

592
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,800
if we can send some people to go south along the business street,

593
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,380
chasing them nonstop,

594
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,800
we may find them on the way.

595
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,000
At that time, they will be brought back to Jiangning safely.

596
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,700
What if, unlike what you guessed,

597
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,300
they have already entered Lin'an?

598
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,700
Then, we can only have the worst plan to go.

599
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Worst?

600
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,600
What is that?

601
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,100
Wen Xing, kneel down.

602
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,400
- On your knees!
- Okay.

603
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,100
The worst plan is that Wen Xing and I will risk our lives

604
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,600
and sneak into Lin'an, negotiating with those bandits,

605
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,400
and we can seize the chance to save Tan'er and Ning Yi.

606
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,400
No, but Father, are we going to Lin'an?

607
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
Yes.

608
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,500
Now, my brother has been sick.

609
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,400
Only we can finish this mission.

610
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
Wen Xing, don't get cold feet now.

611
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,600
You will ruin our reputation.

612
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,800
Yes, yes.

613
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,600
- But, Father… have you made up your mind?
- Get up now.

614
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,300
Have you made up your mind?

615
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,700
Father, I've prejudiced Tan'er and Young Master for all the time.

616
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,800
But they not only returned good for evil,

617
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,900
but also lent helping hands to us,

618
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,800
giving us a job in Zhu.

619
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,000
This is the time when they need help the most.

620
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,600
Yes, if we just stand by and do nothing, we will be no different from–

621
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,400
we will be no different from those cold-blooded beasts!

622
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,200
Today, Here, I, Su Zhong Kan, swear.

623
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,500
As long as Tan'er and Ning Yi are alive,

624
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,600
I will try to save them from the den of monsters

625
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
and take them back safely

626
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,600
even if I have to sacrifice myself.

627
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,100
Good.

628
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,000
[Safely - Return]
