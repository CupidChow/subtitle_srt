Anyway, this is what I thought.

00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:54,149
I lost the Letter of Divorce anyway,

5

and don't need to write a new one.

6
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,310
It'll be too much hassle.

7
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,029
Also, I'm still of use to you anyway.

8

You seem not surprised.

17
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,350
You always love making events.

18
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,390
Young friend Ning showed himself tonight.

19
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,750
You must be behind this.

20
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,990
I just gave him the blueprint of the Jade Garden

21
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,910
and taught him about distribution.

22

What's more,

23
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,889
when I play chess with you, he always helps me to win over you.

24
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,530
I should help him this one time.

You…

26
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,790
Now the best thing

27
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,849
for me is to see young people arising

28
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,489
and surpassing the old.

29
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,250
He is different from others.

30
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,729
When others see me,

31
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,070
they call me "the emperor's son-in-law."

32
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,750
But privately,

33
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,530
they call me a "matrilocal husband."

34
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,650
He treats me like normal people

35
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,489
without any flattery.

36
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,789
I like him.

In the fifth year of Jinghan, Jing arose

41
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,768
and its Emperor envied the yearly tribute Wu gave to Liang.
[Jingliang Border]

42

Jing challenged Liang,

43

wishing to colonize Wu after conquering Liang.

44
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,929
During the war, many people died in the north.

Jing Empire has arisen.

48
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,650
It fought with Liang Empire

49
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,730
many times within one year.

50
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,329
It occupied tens of cities.

51

No one could stop it.

52
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,170
With such a serious situation,

53
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,010
Liang made no efforts to mind us.
[Emperor Zhou Zhe of the Wu Dynasty]

54
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,810
In my opinion, the tributes we promised
[Emperor Zhou Zhe of the Wu Dynasty]

55
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,489
in the agreement with the Liang Empire can be canceled.

00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:12,020
We can decide after the war.

59
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,550
We should also send troops to the north border for defense.
[Left Prime Minister of Wu Dynasty: Li Gang]

60
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,968
It would stop soldiers from the Liang Empire

61
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,669
and avoid being involved in the war.

62
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,970
Short sighted.

Jing Empire is bound to win.

66
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,809
In my opinion, the tribute or

67
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,889
defense isn't the most important.

68
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,190
We should attack the north.

69
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,810
When the two are at war,

70
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,270
we can take advantage of them

71
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,889
and get back the six cities

72

73
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,649

what kind of a man the King of Jing is?

79
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,470
I never saw him.

80
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,769
But seeing his actions,

81
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,309
I think he is ambitious.

82

Prime Minister was forced to make that with the Liang Empire.

90
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,449
We had more tribute. People are miserable.

91

If we do as before,

92

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,829
One day, without any hint,

172
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,769
his wife kissed him.

173
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,549
Your wife kissed you?

174
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,329
My friend! Friend.

175
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,649
Actually, it's quite easy to guess the reason.

176
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,909
You... Oh no, your "friend,"

177
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:36,709
must have hid his private money.

178
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,148
Let me tell you guys.

179
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:41,208
Every time my wife treats me well,

180
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,969
I must have done something wrong.

181
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:47,829
She is asking me in this implied way.

182
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,049
If I don't tell the truth,

183
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:54,689
she will beat me to death.

184
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,830
But this is common at my home.

185
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,968
If she kisses you from time to time, there's no need to worry.

186
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,190
No.

187
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,670
- She must be guilty if she cares about you.
- What?

188
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,388
Only when she marries a concubine will she kiss me.

189
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:14,509
Your friend's wife wants a concubine.

190
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:15,829
She is your wife.

191
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,888
If she has a concubine, then you can be brothers. Right?

192
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:21,869
Feng Yuan, nonsense!

193
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:24,869
Ning Yi is so good. How can his wife want a concubine?

194
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:28,308
Nonsense? A matrilocal husband always listens to his wife.

195
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:29,550
What's wrong with a concubine?

196
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,410
Always listens to his wife? You are so rigid.

197
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,929
- You stick to the old rules.
- You aren't flexible!

198
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,448
That's not for sure.

199
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:36,629
I have a friend.

200
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,709
He was sent to the school and his wife had a concubine at home.

201
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:41,850
You see?

202
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,888
You are illogical. You just see part of it.

203

You are...

204

Where is Ning Yi?

205
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,188
- Is this the dress that was at the Jade Garden Poetry Meeting?
- Yes.

206
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,730
Do you know how to match it?

207
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,650
- It…
- Excuse me, dear customer.

208
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,449
The one of Moon Silk is perfect with Cloud Gauze,

209
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,589
but it's better to be made of Cloud Silk.

Yes. Great. I am really hungry.

337
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,288
You are the most famous poet in Jiangning.

338
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,509
Do you still have time to watch us playing?

339
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,689
Don't tease me.

340
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:02,368
I am not a poet. I can't write poems.

341
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:06,908
It's the work of Mr. Su. I just borrow it.

342
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,849
Mr. Su?

343
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,928
I really can't write poetry.

344
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,350
If you want me to write, it would be like this.

345
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,668
There is a beauty in the north. She hanged herself on the tree.

346
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:21,148
If you love each other, just hang yourselves on the tree.

347
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:24,988
Great people are always lonely. They should all hang themselves on the tree.

348
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:27,609
Why did you make it to where everyone hung themselves?

349
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,328
I can't write poems. I might as well hang myself on the tree.

350
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,770
[Wu Manor]

351
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,269
- You arrived, Commandant Song.
- Boss Wu.

352
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,609
- You must be tired.
- Be careful. Let me help you.

353
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,609
You don't have to. It's okay for me to walk.

354
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,569
My pleasure. This way please.

355
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,330
- Let's discuss inside.
- Okay, okay. How was your journey?

356
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,909
It was quite fine.

357
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:09,668
In your letter, you mentioned something important.

358
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:14,049
I think I may not understand you.

359
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,029
Please.

360
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,128
During the war between Liang and Jing, Liang is going to lose.

361
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:29,148
In Grand Master's opinion, we may prepare more tribute for the Jing Empire.

362
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:35,630
So I have to mind the business of the tribute.

363
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:41,930
So you mean…

364
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,068
I understand your capability.

365
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:47,728
You may start to buy silk,

366
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:51,888
and I will buy your cloth after it is determined.

367
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:57,108
Everyone wants the order. Only the one with capability can.

368
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,690
What do you think?

369
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,989
Of course.

370
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,790
I will appreciate your help.

371
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:12,168
If I can get the order, I will pay you.

372
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:17,870
I will give you secret commission only known between us.

373
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:26,229
Commissioner Han came with you. Where is he?

374
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,209
He has somewhere to go.

375
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,748
- Serve Commandant. Hurry up.
- Come on, Commandant Song.

376
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:35,070
Cheers.

377
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,650
Please.

378
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:44,069
Is this the carriage?

379
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,169
- Brother-in-law.
- Lao Su.

380
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,648
Uncle, I miss you so much.

381
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:03,109
You must be Wenxing. You have grown up.

382
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:06,869
I wouldn't recognize you on the street.

383
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,709
You must be tired. Please come in.

384
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:11,869
- Please.
- Right, come.

385
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,368
Uncle, why didn't tell us that you would come?

386
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:22,249
We can have a party for you.

387
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:25,829
Your uncle just came to us and meet outside of the manor.

388
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,630
He must have his reasons.

389
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,968
Your father is right.

390
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:35,309
This time I came with good news.

391
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,390
What is it?

392
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,688
Silk sold in the south bank of the river must have belonged to the Wu Family.

393
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:45,309
You must now buy silk in the north bank.

394
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,569
The more, the better.

395
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,950
Why?

396
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,189
Lao Su, do you know about the war?

397
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,530
The war?

398
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,989
Everyone knows that the Liang Empire is going to lose.

399
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,109
Yes.

400
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,649
Then our agreement with Liang is to be canceled.

401
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:13,209
We will make a new agreement with Jing. What will happen next?

402
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,449
We need more tribute.

403
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:19,030
- Then the tributary cloth...
- Exactly.

404
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,768
Song Xian, our Commandant Song also came to Jiangning.

405
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,729
He discussed this with the Wu Family,

406
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:29,328
while I will help my families.

407
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:32,089
I am now the transport commissioner.

408
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:34,269
- I still have quite some skills.
- Yes.

409
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:37,329
Then we would need more cloth for tribute.

410
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:40,010
You just buy silk and make cloth.

411
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,430
Let's take the order of the government.

412
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,970
Really? That's great.

413
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,989
However, Su Tan'er, your cousin is not easy to deal with.

414
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,969
You should be careful.

415
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:57,188
We are family.

416
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:58,549
Yes.

417
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,029
Yes. Brother-in-law,

418
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,928
As for the price...

419
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,800
Don't worry about the price.

420
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
Jing is different from Liang.

421
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,200
Just treat it casually.

422
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
I said we need more cloth.

423
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,400
The government is going to pay more.

424
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Come on. Uncle, cheers!

425
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,300
- Brother-in-law.
- Uncle.

426
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,800
Do as I said this afternoon.

427
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
It's important.

428
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,400
I will.

429
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Thank you.

430
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,800
Don't worry.

431
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
You don't have to see me off.

432
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Let's go.

433
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Miss, there's a letter from Lin'an.

434
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
- Is it from Shuwan?
- Yes.

435
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,800
By the way, Miss, Commissioner Han will arrive tonight.

436
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
We will have a party for him.

437
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,500
We will have dinner together.

438
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,200
Uncle? Why did he come at this time?

439
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
Yes.

440
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
It is the season of tribute.

441
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
He should be in the capital and mind it.

442
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
He shouldn't be in Jiangning.

443
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh right, I heard Song Xian or Commandant Song also came.

444
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,500
They came together.

445
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,900
[Letter]

446
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
What's wrong, Miss?

447
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,000
What did Miss Lou write?

448
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,000
She wrote to let me ask about the tribute.

449
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
There may not be tribute for Liang.

450
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,400
Jing may ask for more tribute.

451
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,400
It is our business.

452
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,600
The Lou Family is designated by the royals.

453
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,000
It's their business.

454
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
We are not like them.

455
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,400
Oh right, Miss. Does Miss Lou have any way to help you?

456
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,800
If she has, and we can take part in it,

457
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
we would be better.

458
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
You said uncle came.

459
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Come on. Cheers.
[Su Manor]

460
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,800
Commissioner, it's rare for you to come back.

461
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,800
If you have time, you can stay longer.

462
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
Thank you.

463
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
I ask for a leave

464
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,600
because I miss you.

465
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,200
I would like to stay longer.

466
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
That's good.

467
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,000
It's been years since I left.

468
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Something may have changed.

469
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
For example,

470
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,000
a matrilocal husband can eat with us.

471
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,500
If others know that,

472
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,600
they would laugh at us.

473
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Commissioner Han,

474
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,200
Young Master is not an ordinary man.

475
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
He is good at business.

476
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,800
If it weren't for him,

477
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,800
the Su Family wouldn't be as successful.

478
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

479
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,700
I heard that,

480
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,500
but he is still a matrilocal husband.

481
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,800
Of course he should do that.

482
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
The achievement is not worth mentioning.

483
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
You hold a party for me

484
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,400
but I have to eat with him.

485
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
If others know that, my name

486
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,100
would be ruined.

487
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,000
Uncle.

488
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,000
If a single meal with me could ruin your name,

489
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,300
then it seems to me that you don't have a strong name in the first place.

490
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,700
You—

491
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Nephew-in-law, he is your uncle.

492
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
How can you say that?

493
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
That's right.

494
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,800
He is your elder.

495
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
How dare you not respect him?

496
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,900
Brother-in-law, if you respect him,

497
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,800
you can regard him as your father.

498
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,200
I don't have such an uncle.

499
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,400
See? Am I right?

500
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Uncle.

501
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,600
Come, have more food.

502
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
It's good for your health.

503
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,300
I heard we may need more tribute

504
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,200
during the war.

505
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,400
Did you know about it?

506
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Elder Master,

507
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
it's the same as before.

508
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,800
We don't need more.

509
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,700
Come on, uncle.

510
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Miss, what's wrong?

511
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,700
You looked upset after dinner.

512
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,000
Shuwan wrote that we would need more tribute.

513
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Uncle said differently.

514
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,600
Do you think Miss Lou cheats you?

515
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,100
I'm afraid uncle has ulterior motives.

516
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,600
He wants to cooperate with the Second Master's.

517
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,900
You are right.

518
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,100
That's what he thinks.

519
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,100
Wenxing, are you ready?

520
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Uncle, don't worry.

521
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,200
I have got the order of silk in the north.

522
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Good.

523
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you, Uncle.

524
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's a gift for you.

525
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
When we succeed, I will pay you.

526
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
Then from the beginning,

527
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,600
Commissioner Han didn't want to help us.

528
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,100
Yes.

529
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,200
Will your Miss give commission to him?

530
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,400
She just thinks her cloth is good.

531
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Then she will get orders.

532
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,600
She doesn't understand things in business.

533
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,000
They always think dirty,

534
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
think about their own profit.

535
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
Don't you think I should think so?

536
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,600
If my cloth is better than Wenxing's,

537
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,800
I should compete with him decently.

538
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
But he already started to buy silk.

539
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Where else can you get silk?

540
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,700
I can.

541
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,100
Business of silk

542
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,800
can be divided into South and North.

543
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
It is divided by Qinhuai River.

544
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,600
Su Wenxing got the silk in the north bank.

545
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,700
I still have that in the south.

546
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,000
If I can get that,

547
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,600
I can take the order of tribute.

548
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
You don't know how good it is.

549
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,800
If I get the order, I can pay less taxes

550
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
and the government would treat us well.

551
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
In a few years, everyone in the country

552
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,700
will know Su's Cloth Store.

553
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,100
You want it that much?

554
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,200
Of course.

555
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,900
Uncle was biased to only cooperate with Second Master's.

556
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,200
I will not admit defeat.

557
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,900
Fine then.

558
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
I don't know how to do it,

559
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,400
but based on my subconscious,

560
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,200
I think we should wait.

561
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
No.

562
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Su Wenxing has gotten the silk in the north.

563
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
If I don't act now, it'll be too late.

564
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
If I didn't know about it, I would've given up.

565
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
But now that I know about it,

566
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
I can't.
