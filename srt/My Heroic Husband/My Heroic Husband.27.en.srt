Where did you send this captured woman?

Who is this woman?

I know her. I know her.

27
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,109
The problem is that orginally when I captured her,

28
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,430
I was going to offer her to my Commander.

29

However, there were two men

who wanted to buy her. They offered a rather high price.

31

So I sold her.

172
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,770
Young Master, it's all my fault.

173
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,329
I lost my Lady.

174
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,130
Blame it all on me.

175
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,669
I'll never do that again.

176
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,369
In the future, I will give my life to protect my Lady and Young Master.

177

I will always keep close by.

Lao Geng,

179
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,829
don't blame yourself too much.

180
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,630
I'm also responsible for this matter.

181
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,470
Fortunately, we were able to find Young Lady.

182
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,950

It's all my fault.

185
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,169
I didn't protect you well.

186
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:37,889
I don't blame you.

187
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:41,130
Your life in the bandit camp was also not easy.

188
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,640
I just didn't expect that

189
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,689
we would come across so much trouble taking a trip to Lin'an.

190
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,109
It's like a nightmare.

191
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:05,149
Lao Geng,

192
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,589
I'll take care of the Lady.

193
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,550
You can go back and rest.

194
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,490
No. I will keep close and protect Young Lady and Young Master.

195
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,250
Lao Geng,

196
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,990
it's getting dark.

197
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,090
You should go sleep.

198
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,609
It's okay.

199
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:24,109
I'm not sleepy.

200
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:27,090
We are sleepy.

201
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,929
We need to sleep.

202
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,329
Get out!

203
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,489
Are you all right?

204
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,009
I'm all right, husband.

205
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,710
It's not painful.

206
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:45,008
Shuwan, save me!

207
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,189
Shuwan, please save me!

208
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:13,670
Father, as soon as the news reached the camp,

209
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,429
I came here right away.

210

Raising children while the old pass away.

211
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:23,610
It turns out that the only person you can count on right now is me.

212
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,269
Shuwan,

213
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:31,250
I have let you down.

214
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:39,149
Father,

215
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:46,670
do you know why there were no guards that came in to rescue you?

216
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,570
Father...

217
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:57,589
You...

218
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,689
Dear,

219
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,949
there seems to be someone outside.

220
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,830
It must be Lao Geng.

221
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,230
Lao Geng,

222
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,690
didn't I tell you to go back?

223
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:17,509
Commander.

224
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:20,450
- This...
- I came here to give you some stuff.

225
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,810
You are too polite.

226
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,330
Come on.

227
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,409
Tan'er,

228
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,849
Commander Liu has come to see you.

229
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,788
Commander, let me introduce you.

230
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,809
This is my wife, Su Tan'er.

231
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:34,969
Nice to meet you, Sister-in-law.

232
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:37,169
My name is Liu Dabiao, Commander of Badao Camp.

233
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,909
In this Lin'an City, if anyone bullies you, just tell them my name.

234
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,810
Liu…

235
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,689
Nice to meet you, Miss Liu.

236
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:46,589
She is really named Liu Dabiao. It's okay.

237
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,010
If you can't call her by that name, you can also call her Xigua.

238
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,369
Xigua?

239
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,090
You can call me either way.

240
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,449
Miss Xigua really is interesting.

241
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:56,570
Commander,

242
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,409
I still really have to admit a mistake to you.

243
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:08,429
Actually, when I came to this camp it really was to find my wife.

244
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:09,810
That's human nature.

245
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,468
A man should be like that.

246
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,969
There is no reason not to look for your wife when she is lost.

247
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:17,169
Actually, if I didn't let Sha, Ren, Chang, and Ming watch over you,

248
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:18,969
perhaps you would have been reunited earlier.

249
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:20,909
It's all right, Commander.

250
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:28,290
But today I killed Lou's father and son on impulse.

251
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,129
I'm afraid once the cloth store is closed,

252
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,189
Bao Wenhan won't leave the matter at that.

253
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,760
At that time, if he asks us for an explanation…

254
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,100
Don't worry about it.

255
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,090
If he wants an explanation, I will deal with him first.

256
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,649
But in the Lou family, besides this father and son,

257
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,429
there is also a daughter in Lou's family, whose name is Lou Shuwan.

258
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,149
What should you do if she risks everything to take revenge?

259
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,589
Is my sister-in-law here?

260
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,189
Xigua is also here.

261
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,670
Brother Ning,

262
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,929
nice to meet Sister-in-law. I am Chen Fan.

263
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,508
I'm in charge of Lin'an City.

264
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,990
If anyone bullies you in this Lin'an City, just tell him my name.

265
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,370
Nice to meet you, Brother Chen Fan.

266
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,490
Sister-in-law really is a beautiful woman.

267
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,050
Enough. What are you talking about?

268
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,290
Hurry and let them rest.

269
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,708
Let's host a banquet tomorrow to welcome Sister-in-law's arrival.

270
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:29,829
I just got here.

271
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,730
I told you to leave. Hurry and get out!

272
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,070
Why keep talking nonsense?

273
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,029
We are leaving first.

274
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,490
Are these the bandits you mentioned?

275
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,750
They are not quite the same as what I thought they would be.

276
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,170
Aren't they cute?

277
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,869
Liu Dabiao,

278
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,010
I haven't had a proper chat with Sister-in-law.

279
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,030
Why are you in such a hurry?

280
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,789
Liu Dabiao, I'm asking you.

281
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:05,529
I say that the couple finally reunited with great difficulty.

282
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,788
What kind of confusion are you trying to create there?

283
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,209
You're telling me? You were also there for a long time just now.

284
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,709
What's wrong? Do you have a stomachache?

285
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,489
Do you want to go to the toilet?

286
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,028
Who has a stomachache?

287
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,950
Come! Let's go to the drill ground to practice.

288
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:24,670
Then let's go practice!

289
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:26,691
Let me get you good.

You've squandered all the money in this family.

292
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:48,129
You should be responsible for this.

293
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,609
Get out!

294
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:52,409
Even if you have to beg for food today, you have to get the money back for me.

If you can't get the money, then never step foot into our family's door.

296
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,730
Well, I think

297
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,110
we can just drug her

298
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,830
and directly send her to the Officer's House

299
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,508
for the matter to be handled on the spot.

300
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:13,588
Then when she wakes up, what's done can't be undone.

301
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,929
She has to accept it.

What is your plan?

319
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,810
Lin'an's powder magazine is the key to the northern expedition.

320
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,010
We must take it back.

321

Once it falls into bandits' hands,

322

the consequences will be unimaginable.

00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,789
We can't attack by force, but by wisdom.

324

Master, Fang Tianlei extremely values the powder magazine

and sent heavy troops to guard it day and night.

326
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:07,569
It's not that easy for the Secret Investigation Department to take it back.

The Chancellor Qin has made his own arrangements to take the powder magazine back.

328

But the biggest problem is that most of the members of the Secret Investigation Department

in Lin'an City are separated and have lost contact.

It may help you.

332
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,709
Right Prime Minister Qin thinks very highly of you

333
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,489
because he wants you to lend him a hand.

334
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,668
It's an honor for me to be valued by Prime Minister Qin.

335
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:37,909
But last time

336
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:42,250
I left Tan'er here and she almost died.

337
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,150
This time I just want to take her back to Jiangning peacefully.

338
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:51,789
Since Prime Minister Qin gave it to you, you can keep it.

339
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,369
If you have decided to go,

340
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,449
it is meaningless for me to force you to stay.

341
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,149
Take care.

342
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,190
Your Ladyship.

343
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,110
Do you have any suggestions for the camp patrol?

344
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,210
Every day, we still patrol the existing guard posts as usual.

345
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,690
Besides, 200 extra men are needed.

346
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,130
One hundred of them will patrol the villages along the official road.

347
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,329
Another one hundred of them will patrol the roads within 5 miles of our camp.

348
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,910
Let's do it that way then.

349
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:39,049
Your Ladyship,

350
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:43,389
I want to ask for a favor.

351
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:44,969
Say it.

352
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,409
It's like this.

353
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:51,729
Now I have found my wife.

354
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,950
However, Lin'an City is really quite dangerous.

355
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,468
I'm a little worried about their safety.

356
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:04,330
So, your Ladyship, can you find a chance to send them out?

357
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,149
How about you?

358
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,590
Are you leaving, too?

359
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,929
I–

360
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,330
I'm just playing with you.

361
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,788
Since we are all brothers, I will certainly protect your wife and your family's safety.

362
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:24,550
Wait for my good news.

363
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:27,389
Okay.

364
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,409
Well, then thank you, your Ladyship.

367
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,730
Holy Master,

368
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,148
you asked me to hurry and come here.

369
00:40:47,149 --> 00:40:49,910
Do you have something that I need to do?

370
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,870
Lao Bao,

371
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:59,170
how long has it been since the two of us started the rebellion?

372
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,210
More than four years.

373
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,390
Four years.

374
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,510
Time has gone by quickly.

375
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,270
You and I have known each other for more than ten years, right?

376
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,210
Have I ever treated you badly?

377
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,210
You haven't.

378
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,130
Holy Master,

379
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,889
if you have something to say, then be frank about it.

380
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,829
Lao Bao, I treat you as my brother.

381
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,589
I've entrusted you with the military's financial affairs for so many years.

382
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:43,969
But I never thought that when the war was in such a critical situation

383
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:48,429
you would still dare to be corrupt and greedy.

384
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,550
My trust in you has been wasted.

385
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:57,129
Holy Master, why did you say this?

386
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:59,650
Do you have any proof?

387
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,430
It was your man who disliked the way you behaved and told me directly.

388
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,650
The proof was taken from your manor.

389
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,910
It'll be here in a moment.

390
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,349
Reporting.

391
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:16,569
Holy Master,

392
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,668
this is the account book found from Commander Bao's house.

393
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,810
Please take a look.

- Old Sir.
- Holy Master.

395
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:38,290
Would you please check the account book from Commander Bao

396
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:44,830
with my account book to see if the accounts are matched?

397
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,889
Yes, yes, yes.

398
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,430
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

400
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,820
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace  ♫

401
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,200
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

402
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,670
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

403
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,410
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

404
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:08,200
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

405
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:15,170
The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫
