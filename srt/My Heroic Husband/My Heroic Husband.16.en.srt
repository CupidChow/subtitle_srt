Be careful when putting them down.

4
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,479
That's right. Put them over there.

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,939
You, too. Over there.

6
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,999
That's right. Okay, good.

7
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,879
Okay.

8
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,840
You took the wrong one. I've told you to take the silk quilt.

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,759
The weather is hot now.

10
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,839
Are you going to heat your Young Master and your Lady and bring them prickly heat?

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,258
Go change it. Hurry! Hurry up!

12
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,299
I got it, Madam. I'm going to change it right now.

13
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,379
Tan'er, you're here.

14
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,658
Have a look. It's almost ready.

15
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:14,158
Mother, I've told you that we would come back within half a month?

16
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,818
I don't need anything except daily necessities.

17
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,099
But you have to bring some clothes, right?

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,260
Bring the Tiger Wine with you.

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,338
I'll follow Tan'er's idea.

20
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,978
- Young Master.
- Cousin-in-law.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,519
Uncle called me.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,379
Mother, we don't need those…

23
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,179
What's up, Uncle?

24
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,520
- Eldest Brother.
- Can I borrow you for a while?

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,459
What are you doing?

26
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,239
Uncle.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Please act your age, what are you doing?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,879
Ning Yi, cousin-in-law,

29
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,360
are you going on a long journey?

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,038
I just loaded some stuff on the carriage

31
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,279
and sent them from the front gate to the back door.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,658
Stop teasing us.

33
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,759
You are making fun of us.

34
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,158
I heard you are going on a long journey,

35
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,799
but there are so many poisonous bugs and mosquitoes in the south.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,839
So we have specially prepared the insect repellent cream for you.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,338
As long as you carry it with you, no bugs can bite you,

38
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,299
nor can mosquitoes get close to you.

39
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:18,919
Yes, that's right.

40
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,198
I don't need it.

41
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,158
I feel bad when looking at it.

42
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,460
Please, Brother-in-law. Take it with you.

43
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,819
No worries. It really works.

44
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:25,879
- Yes, he is right.
- Okay, fine.

45
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,858
Uncle, cousin-in-law.,

46
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,318
let's do away with all ceremonies.

47
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,899
Aren't we a family?

48
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,438
Yes, we're a family!

49
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,758
Since we are family, we shouldn't keep anything from each other.

50
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,478
Don't keep me in suspense.

51
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,200
Just give it to me straight.

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,658
Well, nephew-in-law, then I'm gonna ask you straight.

53
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,598
Here's the thing.

54
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,979
You know, since you closed all the cloth stores,

55
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,959
we two have been sitting around.

56
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,839
That's right.

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
So…

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,038
So?

59
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,479
So… So… So…

60
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,959
Could you please help us find something to do

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,059
so we can get some exercise?

62
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,398
Cousin-in-law, well…

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,580
I haven't used my brain for a while.

64
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,360
- It's getting slow.
- Yes, that's right.

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,338
Seems right.

66
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:27,459
Cousin-in-law, did you ever use your brain?

67
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,199
No.

68
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,518
If no, don't use it then.

69
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,578
No, I can't. New stuff is more valuable.

70
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:39,159
Cousin-in-law, well, you're kidding me, right?

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,599
Enough.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,259
Uncle, cousin-in-law,

73
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,559
I've got the idea what you want to say.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,159
You've got nothing to do now.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,879
Yes! You want to do something...

76
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,719
Yes, yes.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,638
to keep you busy!

78
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:53,579
- To use your brains!
- That's right!

79
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,140
That's right!

80
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,019
No way.

81
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,379
We have enough stuff. I'll talk to you when we lack the manpower.

82
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,379
Please!

83
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,639
Nephew-in-law!

84
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,638
As long as we can be a tiny help to you, we can do anything

85
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,878
regardless of the position.

86
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,919
Yes, anything!

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Anything!

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
- Anything.
- Anything.

89
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
- Not afraid of hardship?

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,019
- Not afraid!
- Not afraid!
- Not afraid of tiredness?

91
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,900
- Not afraid!
- Not afraid!

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,679
All right.

93
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,958
Then... please find Miss Yun Zhu.

94
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,599
Zhu Ji Restaurant is just opened.

95
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,778
They need more staff there.

96
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:28,919
Go find her.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,820
Do you mean it?

98
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,218
That's great!

99
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,018
- Thank you so much!
- Thanks a lot!

100
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,299
- We are a family
- We're a family.

101
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,198
See you.

102
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,239
Okay.

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,840
Goodbye!

104
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,660
Father, it hasn't been sent out.

105
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,699
No big deal. Whatever.

106
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,878
As long as we got what we wanted.

107
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,679
Yes, that's right.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,318
Take good care of yourself!

109
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:00,560
I got it, Mother.

110
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,799
- You, too.
- Young Master.

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,958
Everything is ready. We can set off at any minute.

112
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,459
Okay.

113
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,379
Mother-in-law, don't worry.

114
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,579
Leave Tan'er to me.

115
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,039
I'll take care of her.

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,399
Then, remember to write to me on the way!

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,438
Take care, Mother.

118
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,339
You, too.

119
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,519
Be careful on the way.

120
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,479
My Lady!

121
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,299
My Lady! Wait a minute.

122
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,198
My Lady!

123
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,360
Eldest Master asked me to give this to you

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,758
and he also asked me to tell you be careful on the way

125
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
and come back early.

126
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,559
Tell my father-in-law to rest assured.

127
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll take care of Tan'er.

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,239
Take care, Mother.

129
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,940
Take care.

130
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,919
Go!

131
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,659
[Map]

132
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,679
The map that Old Geng gave us is quite something!

133
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,978
There are not only scenic spots.

134
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:05,479
He's careless in most matters, but careful in some.

135
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,459
Even foods from the scenic spots are also written on it.

136
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,398
Learn from him!

137
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,799
Don't think he looks like an uncouth fellow.

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,180
He can be even more careful than you.

139
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,159
Do you have any idea how hard it will be if you choose this way?

140
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,319
The lamb shoulder you ate tonight was selected by him in the kitchen.

141
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,459
But we haven't had any female seal holder in the family!

142
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,199
Then she will make history!

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,458
Tan'er,

144
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,178
isn't this what your father gave you just now?

145
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,360
It's a little scissors?

146
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,398
When I was little, and I saw the staff

147
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,360
cut colorful cloths with scissors, I become interested in it

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,659
and asked Father for this scissors

149
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:06,518
to make clothes for my dolls.

150
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,260
When I grew up, I wanted to own a cloth store,

151
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,120
but he was strongly against it.

152
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,379
Then the scissor disappeared suddenly.

153
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,439
Turned out he had it with him.

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,539
Tan'er. Your father giving you the scissor proves

155
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,519
he has acknowledged you from the bottom of his heart.

156
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,458
Here, look at the map.

157
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,598
Syrup of plum, boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice,

158
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:44,719
and osmanthus cake.

159
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,520
Where should we go first?

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,199
Syrup of plum.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,479
Old Geng, did you hear her?

162
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,319
Your Lady wants syrup of plum.

163
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,359
Syrup of plum, right?

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,938
All right, be there soon.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Grand Master.

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,700
Only you're here today?

167
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,700
Grand Master,

General Yuan, who are they?

496
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,800
They are brigands.

497
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Their head is called Xu Fang.

498
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,700
He is good at using swords with both hands.

499
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,000
Their big boss is Liu Da Biao, also known as Lord of Sword.

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
He has some power.

501
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,000
This man is rough and has a face full of beard.

502
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,300
He is proud of his chest hair.

503
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,400
Did you see him?

504
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,500
Chest hair?

505
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
I didn't.

506
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Thanks for your help today, Young Master Ning.

507
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm unable to repay such a kindness.

508
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,800
Come to find me at Wude Camp if you have any difficulties in Lin'an.

509
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,200
I will try my best to help you.

510
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,000
See you.

511
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,300
Don't worry, General Yuan.

512
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll cover for you.

513
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm really full of positive energy.

514
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,300
[Wu Dinasty]

515
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,500
Your Majesty, the north expedition is looming ahead.

516
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
I've ordered General Dong to ready the troops.

517
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
As long as Your Majesty sends a decree to our troops,

518
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,600
we will take down Jing right away.

519
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,100
Your Majesty,

520
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,200
[Tan Chen, Minister of Works in Wu Dynasty]
Minister second.

521
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,000
please issue a decree and send the troops to the north.

522
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
[Liu Ju Yuan, Minister of Defense in Wu Dynasty]

523
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
Minister second, too.

524
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,700
Minister He is here!

525
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,930
[A Country in Peace]

526
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,200
Greetings from He Yuanchang, Your Majesty.

527
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,800
Forego formalities, please.

528
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,500
Have a seat.

529
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,200
Thanks, Your Majesty.

530
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,500
Grand Master He has been retired for years.

531
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Why did you come to the court all of a sudden?

532
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Your Majesty,

533
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
if you allow me,

534
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,200
I want to impeach someone.

535
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Who do you want to impeach?

536
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
The Right Prime Minister,

537
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,000
Qin Si Yuan.

538
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,200
He Yuan Chang, Right Prime Minister Qin is the pillar of our nation,

539
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,300
and he was assigned by the late Emperor to assist his Majesty.

540
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,300
You can't just impeach him without any reason.

541
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,800
Lord Li, Lord He was the Prince's teacher

542
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
and has assisted Your Majesty all along.

543
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
How dare you disrespect him?

544
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,700
You are definitely disparaging His Majesty.

545
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Liang Ping Zhong,

546
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes.

547
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,600
we're in a court right now.

548
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,400
How dare you be so noisy?

549
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
I-I-I-I'm guilty.

550
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
Grand Master He.

551
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,400
What crime has Right Prime Minister Qin committed?

552
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,500
Why do you want to impeach him?

553
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Your Majesty, he has deceived you.

554
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Right Chancellor Qin has always been loyal, and worked hard for Wu.

555
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,800
He even Personally supervises the military supplies and reserve.

556
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,000
How has he deceived me?

557
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,200
The powder magazine is the evidence.

558
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,900
Your Majesty, did you know we have gun powder in Lin'an

559
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,800
before Qin Si Yuan's resuming?

560
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,900
Well…

561
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,700
I did not.

562
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,100
He built such a big powder magazine without getting your permission.

563
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,400
Isn't it deceitful?

564
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,900
Deceit.

565
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,000
What do you think, my fellows?

566
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,500
Your Majesty, I think Grand Master He is very right.

567
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,600
Although Qin is the Right Prime Minister, he couldn't keep you from it

568
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,400
and built the powder magazine.

569
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,200
That is arrogation.

570
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,600
Please punish him according to Wu's Law.

571
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,100
Minister second.

572
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Your Majesty, please issue a decree

573
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,300
to punish him for being deceitful to the Emperor.

574
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,000
Are you all crazy?

575
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
Punish the Right Prime Minister Qin?

576
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,600
Have you forgotten how Right Prime Minister Qin treated you?

577
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,300
Your Majesty, I think the deceit is…

578
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
I admit it.

579
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
I, Qin Si Yuan, have retired for four years.

580
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,500
I've deceived Your Majesty and made gun powders in secret.

581
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
I've committed arrogation and deceived your Majesty.

582
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,900
I should be killed due to the sin.

583
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,000
Moreover, I'm the Right Prime Minister, and that makes me more guilty.

584
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,800
So my whole family will be implicated as well.

Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

586
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,100
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫
