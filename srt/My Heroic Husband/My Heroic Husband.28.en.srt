00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,990
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,019
Holy Master, these are the account books that were confiscated from Commander Bao's place.

4
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,080
Holy Master, please advise.

5
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,579
- Old Sir.
- Holy Master,

6
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:13,619
would you please compare the items of accounts in Commander Bao's

7
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:20,160
account books with those in mine to see if they match.

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,460
Yes, sure.

9
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,819
Report to Holy Master, the items in these account books

10
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,020
are in accord with those in your account books.

11
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,878
Are you sure?

12
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,180
I've checked them twice.

13
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,500
So, absolutely yes.

14
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,200
Bring the bastard in here.

15
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,740
The items of accounts match.

16
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,760
But you were confident and promised me that

17
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,020
the items of accounts contained accounting errors.

18
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,559
How would you explain this?

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,260
It's impossible.

20
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,598
Well, this is not right.

21
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,260
I clearly saw that there were 50,000 taels on these pages on that day.

22
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,158
They weren't handed in but used for other purposes.

23
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,059
How is it possible?

24
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,059
Holy Master, I was wrong.

25
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,718
Holy Master, please forgive me!

26
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,479
You're a mother-raping thief.

27
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,339
You've ruined our brotherhood.

28
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:49,619
Do you think I will still keep you alive?

29
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,180
Old Bao, it was a misunderstanding.

30
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,580
As your big brother, I was wrong. Please forgive me.

31
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,300
Holy Master, it doesn't matter.

32
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,779
I have always handled affairs justly.

33
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:05,920
I don't dare to be careless in money and provisions.

34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,700
That's great.

35
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,420
I have two things I want you to settle.

36
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,438
Please go ahead.

37
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,539
First of all, seal off all those secret tunnels as soon as possible.

38
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,339
And the second one?

39
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,500
Yes.

40
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
You can leave now.

41
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,719
Commander.

42
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,259
Commander.

43
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,139
Let me ask you,

44
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,700
before checking accounts who has ever entered the hall?

45
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,779
Report to Leader.

46
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,179
Only Miss Lou had entered the hall

47
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:55,020
before they confiscated the account books today.

48
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,340
- Miss Lou?
- Yes.

49
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,140
Your Excellency, the weather has been hot and muggy these two days.

50
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,339
I've specially made some white fungus and mung bean broth

51
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,539
to drive away summer heat for Your Excellency.

52
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,020
Have another bowl.

53
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,520
No need.

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,339
Let me ask you whether you have been to my study lately.

55
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,500
No, I haven't.

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,060
Don't you admit it?

57
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,779
My subordinate saw you go there.

58
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,740
Moreover, someone has changed my account books.

59
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,479
Please forgive me, your Excellency.

60
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Come on, come on. Get up, sweetie.

61
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Get up. Get up and tell me.

62
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,219
I…

63
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,020
I saw Deputy General Hu

64
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,739
sneak into the study and check the items of accounts a few days ago.

65
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,700
After he left, I went into the study to examine them.

66
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,940
I found that there were some careless mistakes in the account books.

67
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,979
I was afraid that they had been commandeered.

68
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,620
I was afraid that Your Excellency would be implicated with ithem.

69
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,179
So, I revised the items of accounts that very night.

70
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,539
There may still be some errors and omissions,

71
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,539
which cause you trouble.

72
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,398
Please forgive me, Your Excellency.

73
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,600
My beauty,

74
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,020
you even didn't cause me any trouble,

75
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,739
but helped me escape a disaster from Holy Master.

76
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:36,859
I don't even know how to thank you.

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,540
Thanks to you, my beauty.

78
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,460
You flatter me.

79
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,859
I didn't expect that you're so familiar with accounting as a woman.

80
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,859
I come from a merchant family.

81
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,580
I have been impacted by my father since I was little.

82
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,459
I was in charge of all accounting for my family.

83
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,260
No wonder.

84
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,799
Nice. Very good.

85
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,900
From now on, I will hand over all of my camp accounting to you.

86
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
Are you willing to do that?

87
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,119
Your Excellency has entrusted me.

88
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,580
I will do my best.

89
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,280
Great.

90
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,999
I'm reassured now.

91
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:38,290
[Anji]

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,799
Report to Holy Master, Dong Dao Fu's army has arrived in Anji.

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,638
They're more than 70 kilometers from Lin'an.

94
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
I estimate that they'll arrive the day after tomorrow.

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,620
We've already set our 300 cannons up on the walls in all directions.

96
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,859
We're embattled.

97
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:52,059
I know it. You may leave.

98
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,520
Yes.

99
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,339
Holy Master.

100
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,100
Xi Gua, come sit here.

101
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,179
I came to ask you for an order to leave the city.

102
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,380
Please grant it to me.

103
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,359
Why do you want to leave the city?

104
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,299
My Counsellor, Ning Yi, has some relatives trapped in Lin'an.

105
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,638
So I would like to ask you if you will allow them out.

106
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,979
Ning Yi?

107
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:13,979
That's right.

108
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,580
All of them are non-native.

109
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,500
After being trapped in Lin'an for so long,

110
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,940
all of them would like to go back.

111
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,859
Moreover, aren't we going to have a war soon?

112
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:23,219
Once we are in the war, I'm afraid they'll get hurt.

113
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,859
So I'm here to ask for your permission.

114
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,958
Xi Gua, if you asked me in normal days, it would be fine.

115
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,999
Nowadays, civilians have heard that Dong Dao Fu's army is coming.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,779
All of them are ready to exit the city.

117
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,100
I've just placed an order to enforce martial law and impose a curfew.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,140
If you want to send people out of the city now,

119
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,600
I will be in a dilemma.

120
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,278
I know the current laws,

121
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,740
but he is in a special situation.

122
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,579
Holy Master, I beg you to give him a way out.

123
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,900
Xi Gua, who is this Ning Yi

124
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,400
that you are so concerned about?

125
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,059
He-He is only a counselor in my Badao Camp.

126
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,179
However, I think the most highly of him in my heart.

127
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,820
I hope you can fulfill their wish for my sake.

128
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,339
Xi Gua, your father has gone early.

129
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,959
He entrusted you to me.

130
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,459
I've always doted on you very much and saw you as my own child.

131
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:32,199
But if you are haughty because of my love and indulgence,

132
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,740
and want to ignore the unshakable order, that won't be good.

133
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,860
I can promise you anything else.

134
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,699
This matter is not negotiable.

135
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:41,980
Uncle!

136
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,479
Be good.

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,980
You may leave.

138
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,980
Even if you don't agree, I will definitely send them out of the city.

139
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,359
Xi Gua!

140
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,419
Such an obstinate girl.

141
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:02,219
You guys check more carefully. Do you get it?

142
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,699
- Understood.
- Understood.

143
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:05,960
- Hello,
- Xi Gua?

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,199
- Have you seen Ning Yi?
- Brother Ning?

145
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,038
He seemed to take a walk with his wife.

146
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,100
Take a walk?

147
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
What's wrong? You want him?

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,340
Nothing.

149
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,940
Xi Gua!

150
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,760
What's wrong again?

151
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,919
Who are you?

152
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,540
- Catch them.
- Stop there!

153
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,199
Old Geng! Why would you always follow us?

154
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,100
Go back. Go back.

155
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,360
I want to protect you and my lady.

156
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,220
I don't need your protection, and I'll protect your Lady.

157
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,720
Go back.

158
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,140
Let's go. Let's go. Let him follow us if he likes.

159
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,179
What's next?

160
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,839
Xi Gua and Chen Fan, neither of them are bad people.

161
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,719
They should be willing to help us.

162
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,479
Lin'an has been closed up for several days.

163
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,340
How can we leave?

164
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,200
We can only judge the circumstances at each step.

165
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,239
I can't bear it.

166
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,940

Don't choke over the food.

Weren't you in Jiangning?

Why would you come here?

We've heard that Lin'an has fallen into the enemy's hands.

The whole family was very anxious,

He's just worried about you.

He was supposed to come looking for you.

But he had to stay at home to take care of your mother and your grandfather.

So, only the two of us came.

Originally, we didn't know your whereabouts.

To tell you the truth, this trip was very hard and dangerous indeed.

We followed the roads on this map.

However, the roads were all wrong.

The carriage was even stolen.

247
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,819
We had no food or water.

248
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,060
We even didn't have any money on us.

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,700

it was all the fault of the female thief.

She stole our carriage.

254
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,319
She was conscienceless.

255
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,479
She made us suffer so much along the way.

256
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,819
It was so hard for us to arrive at Lin'an.

257
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,739
We were regarded as assassins and were caught by officials.

Excuse us. Excuse us.

332
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
It's okay. It's okay.

333
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,860
This is Xiao Chan. She's our younger sister from Tan'er and me.

334
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Hello, Xiao Chan.

335
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,680
- This is Old Geng.
- I've met you.

336
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
I've met you. I've met you.

337
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,799
- I have seen them all.
- Have you seen them all?

338
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,239
I've seen all of them. I've seen all of them.

339
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,838
Don't underestimate the four of them.

340
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,518
- They're good at cooking.
- Are they?

341
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:50,480
They're good at cooking.

342
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,820
Well, thank you for your hard work.

343
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,060
- We'll have the luck to get something nice to eat.
- It's our honor. It's our honor. It's our honor.

344
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,459
This is my sister, Lu Hong Ti.

345
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:01,679
The Lu family and the Ning family have been friends for generations.

346
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,659
Unfortunately, our family declined,

347
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:07,100
but my sister has never abandoned me.

348
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,459
So although she's not my biological sister,

349
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,419
she's more like my biological sister.

350
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,759
Nice to meet you, Young Master Chen.

351
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,499
Are you sure she is a girl from a noble family?

352
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:20,540
Tell me more details, Counselor.

353
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,340
It's true.

354
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,540
This woman, not only does she come from a noble family,

355
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,838
but also, she is perfect in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

356
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,659
She is quite exceedingly beautiful.

357
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,518
Congratulations to Commander Chen in advance.

358
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,739
Does she know Kungfu?

359
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:39,419
A girl from a noble family is naturally gentle, cultured, and elegant.

360
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,739
How can she practice something as vulgar as Kungfu?

361
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,200
Could she be the one I'm destined to marry?

362
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,819
Sister?

363
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,039
Oh my.

364
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,979
May I ask you, Miss Lu,

365
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:01,019
are you good at lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting?

366
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,619
None of your bu—

367
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,420
What's up, Brother Ning?

368
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,340
My throat is a bit uncomfortable.

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,380
I remember with gratitude that my parents and brother

370
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,200
devoted all their attention to cultivate me.

371
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,519
Well... Well... Brother Fan,

372
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,399
come on. Come on.

373
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:25,040
It's impolite for you to talk to her like that.

374
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,600
I just wanted to ask whether she's from a noble family.

375
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,499
Yes, she is.

376
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,419
My sister comes from a scholar-gentry family.

377
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,900
She has been perfect in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting since she was little.

378
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,639
She's gentle, cultured, and elegant. She's virtuous and thoughtful.

379
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,720
She's from a noble family.

380
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,138
Come on. Don't ask her any questions. Don't ask.

381
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:45,219
Well, here is the thing,

382
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,559
may I ask you whether you're married, Miss Lu?

383
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,939
Brother Chen Fan, I should stop you from acting like this.

384
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,519
She's a girl. How can you ask her this question?

385
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,459
How can you ask her this question?

386
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,140
Yes, Brother Chen. Do you…?

387
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,680
It's not like that.

388
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just curious, curious.

389
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,499
It doesn't matter.

390
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,439
I have never been married.

391
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,299
I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

392
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,858
- Brother Ning!
- What's wrong?

393
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,580
Why did you bring your sister here?

394
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,718
I've been avoiding an unrightful marriage for a long time. It turns out I can't avoid it anyway.

395
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,459
Don't worry. It's not her.

396
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,518
How do you know?

397
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,259
I have predicted it. It's not her.

398
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,499
It's really not her?

399
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,798
Come on. Don't worry about it.

400
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,440
Ask those people what they can cook and what we'll eat tonight.

401
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,639
- It's really not her?
- It's not, it's not. Go. Go.

402
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,240
When did you have a sister?

403
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,199
Don't get involved.

404
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,260
Father,

405
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,259
is that woman the female assassin?

406
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,800
How come the more I look at her, the more she looks like the female assassin?

407
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,319
Perhaps we're wrong since she has never left Lin'an.

408
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,860
My Lady, the Second Master, and the Young Master,

409
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,019
are they really that kind?

410
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,659
They created difficulties for you before.

411
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:19,919
Now they seem to have changed their temper.

412
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,399
I'm also confused.

413
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,499
Maybe they aren't naturally despicable people.

414
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:27,319
Nowadays, the world is so chaotic.

415
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,599
They may be stung by conscience,

416
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,659
and will start to treat the family as a priority.

417
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,170
Put it inside.

418
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,140
- Put it here.
- Here.

419
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,839
My dear, have a sip, too.

420
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,039
I won't drink it.

421
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,479
This Master Lu…

422
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:13,580
Anyhow, Brother Ning is the Counselor of Badao Camp.

423
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,480
Why does he look like a

424
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,339
matrilocal husband?

425
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,019
I'll go check the kitchen.

426
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:29,939
In that case, Miss Lu is your Master

427
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,639
and she teaches you Kungfu?

428
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:34,340
Have you forgotten it? We were in Jiangning last time.

429
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,420
And that Manager Xi took revenge on us. It was her that saved our lives.

430
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:43,459
After I came to Lin'an, I found that she works for Qin.

431
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,979
She's from the Secret Investigation Department.

432
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,699
So that is what it is.

433
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:50,780
Moreover, if you have time lately,

434
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,510
please teach her how to walk, sit and lie down,

435
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,620
and teach her some etiquette.

436
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,979
Anyway, teach her

437
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,699
lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting as much as you can.

438
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:02,720
Look at her. She doesn't look like a girl from a noble family at all.

439
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,879
This Miss Lu treats us really well.

440
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,659
That's true. She's my Master.

441
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,599
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

442
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,078
Let me help you.

443
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,359
- Commander.
- Thank you, Miss.
- Xi Gua.

444
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,838
Guard Geng, this is delicious.

445
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,319
Let me tell you something. This dish is especially good.

446
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,359
Why are you looking at me?

447
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:35,219
I'd like to ask whether the red one is sweet or salty.

448
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,819
Try it.

449
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,838
Father, I ate too many steamed buns and too much porridge before coming here.

450
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,979
I can't even eat a bite of these dishes.

451
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,079
Me, too.

452
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,278
But these are good things.

453
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,540
How about we have some tea.

454
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,560
We'll eat when we're hungry.

455
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,779
I'm too full.

456
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,340
Let's go out for a walk.

457
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,259
Let's eat after we've freed up our stomachs.

458
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,159
Good idea.

459
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:22,019
Guys, have some, sister.

460
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,300
Excuse us.

461
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,399
We'll go to the toilet.

462
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,159
- Let's go for a walk.
- Excuse us. Excuse us.

463
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,259
Uncle, Cousin-in-law, why are you leaving?

464
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,919
We'll go to the toilet. We'll go to the toilet.

465
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,820
The good dishes aren't yet served.

466
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,419
We'll be right back. We'll be right back.

467
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,239
Don't wait for us.

468
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,080
They don't have luck in having delicious food.

469
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,299
Take a drink.

470
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,900
Come on, come on.

471
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,600
Look at it, my dear.

472
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,419
My Lady, Young Master has specially prepared this for you,

473
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,780
a small hotpot of spicy beef.

474
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,440
How could you know the specialty of Lin'an?

475
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,900
You'll know it after you try.

476
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,259
Why does the bottom of this pot give out steam?

477
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:09,739
Because I put some quicklime there.

478
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:12,140
It heats up when in contact with water.

479
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,860
Young Master, what is this word?

480
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,580
This word pronounces "Hi".

481
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,380
It's happy.

482
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,260
Anyway, it means happiness.

483
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,580
With this pot, my Lady can eat the specialties of Lin'an wherever she goes.

484
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,320
She is naturally grinning all the time.

485
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,959
Try it.

486
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,399
It smells good.

487
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,720
Come on, come on.

488
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,320
Have a piece of meat.

489
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,780
It tastes good.

490
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,860
If it's good, eat more!

491
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,979
Honey, try some, too.

492
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,879
Yes, yes.

493
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,019
Come on, try it.

494
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,520
I'd better have some food to calm down first.

495
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,259
My soup is a little bit undercooked.

496
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,639
When I go back to make it for my wife,

497
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:07,799
I'll have to pay attention to it.

498
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,740
I wish my wife could treat me so gently.

499
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,300
You should be satisfied.

500
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Doesn't your wife treat you gently?

501
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,020
Think about my wife.

502
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,219
That's right.

503
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,219
If I think about it this way, my wife is quite nice.

504
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,780
Being separated from summer to early autumn,

505
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,179
how many yearnings and sorrows are between them?

506
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,300
They seem to be newly married after being apart for a long time.

507
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,820
They have a mutual affinity.

508
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,090
It's not bad to be married.

509
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,020
Come on.

510
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,850
Cheers. To our wives.

511
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,690
To our wives.

512
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,979
Well, everyone, there are my friends from Jiangning.

513
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:48,999
There are also some friends from Lin'an.

514
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,239
I'm honored to have all of you gathered here today.

515
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,380
Then I will propose a toast to everyone.

516
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,599
I'd like to propose a toast to everyone as well. Cheers.

517
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,100
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

518
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,499
Everyone, I think only drinking some alcohol is too boring.

519
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,900
Why don't we have finger-guessing game? How about it?

520
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,140
It's too old-fashioned.

521
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,900
I have a new game to play.

522
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,179
It's called Truth or Dare.

523
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,499
Brother Fan, I can only help you with this.

524
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,060
What do you mean?

525
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,019
Truth and Dare, which one do you want to choose?

526
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:37,980
I, I…

527
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,699
Okay, you choose the Truth.

528
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:40,758
Let me ask you.

529
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,739
Is your beloved one here?

530
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,900
My beloved one.

531
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,839
I-I don't have any beloved one. Are you kidding?

532
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,159
Others always chase after me.

533
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,040
How can I have my beloved one?

534
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,039
Okay, fine. If you don't want to say it, just drink.

535
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,039
I'll drink.

536
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,819
- It's my turn.
- It's your turn. Come on.

537
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,520
Liu Xi Gua, is your beloved one here?

538
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:35,240
I choose Dare.

539
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,140
- Ask the question.
- Ask the question?

540
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
I-

541
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I-

542
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,660
I-

543
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:11,270
want to ask you tonight…

544
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,950
What will we do tonight?

545
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,620
I ask you to

546
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,979
fight tonight.

547
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,340
Let's fight then.

548
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,520
Do we need to wait until tonight?

549
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,100
Chen Fan, let's fight now.

550
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,101
Fight now.

551
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,259
Come on, the two of you.

552
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,259
Commander. Commander.

553
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,918
You two are commanders. Why are you acting like children?

554
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,179
You're fighting after losing a game?

555
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,719
- Next.
- Fight! No more fighting?

556
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,078
Brother Geng, it's your turn.

557
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,499
My beloved one isn't here.

558
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:01,379
She's at the Xinmen Brothel in Jiangning.

559
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,179
It seems that I haven't asked you yet.

560
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:10,959
Doesn't the Truth mean we should tell our beloved one's name?

561
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,558
Guard Geng, people won't ask the same question every time.

562
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,399
The same question.

563
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:19,739
Well... well... I don't know.

564
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:21,399
Come on, come on, keep spinning.

565
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,999
Okay, okay.

566
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,919
Well, why is it me again?

567
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,940
Do you have anything to ask?

568
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,179
I have a question for you.

569
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:41,318
When did you and your beloved one meet each other?

570
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,100
I have known her for ten years.

571
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,659
She has always liked me.

572
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,320
She's waiting for me to save up enough money to marry her.

573
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,100
You don't know…

574
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,299
Continue. Spin.

575
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,340
Good, good.

576
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,740
Well- Well-

577
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Well, I-

578
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Otherwise, I'll continue what I was saying.

579
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,780
I met my beloved one in Jiangning.

580
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,300
At that time, on that day, it was a beautiful day.

581
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,600
There were no clouds in the sky.

582
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,100
The birds sang and the flowers were fragrant.

583
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:23,399
The two of us like this slowly…

584
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:26,919
Later, my beloved one

585
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,399
became the most famous unsurpassed beauty in Jiangning.

586
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,820
People from all over the countryside came to see her performance.

587
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,160
But her famous song, "Farewell to Dong Da", was sung only for me.

588
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
She-

589
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,640
I-

590
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,180
Well, I will continue to spin it.

591
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,900
Stop.

592
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,479
We are all tired now.

593
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,380
Go home early and get some rest.

594
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,399
Okay?

595
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,881
Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Come on.

596
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:56,619
- Let's go, sweetheart.
- I'm not done talking yet!

597
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,521
Let's go.

598
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,939
Report to Commander. Bao Wen Han's person is outside the door.

599
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:01,539
Bao Wen Han?

600
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,099
Don't panic.

601
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,799
She's one of us.

602
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,160
I'll have a couple of words with her.

603
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,040
Miss Lou,

604
00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:43,159
I'm sorry about

605
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,579
your father and brother.

606
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,619
Although they bullied Tan'er before, I shouldn't have…

607
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,319
Young Master Ning,

608
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,739
they deserved that.

609
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,080
Take care of Tan'er.

610
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:07,699
I'll get out of your hair.

611
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:17,280
Sister Shu Wan! Sister Shu Wan!

612
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,659
Sister Shu Wan! Sister!

613
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,640
Sister, please stop.

614
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,979
Tan'er, I feel relieved to see that you're fine.

615
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:35,340
Just say goodbye to me here.

616
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,820
Sister, we're going back to Jiangning tomorrow.

617
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,860
Please leave with us.

618
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,360
I won't.

619
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:49,200
Sister, my husband has told me about your matters.

620
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,139
You've really suffered a lot.

621
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:54,118
I just hope we can leave here safely.

622
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,760
When we return to Jiangning, we'll start a new life and

623
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,140
forget everything that has happened here.

624
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,959
Tan'er, if you leave Lin'an, you will go back home.

625
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,260
If I leave here, I will go into exile.

626
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,979
I won't leave.

627
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,260
A person can't always run away.

628
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,700
I must learn how to face reality.

629
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,300
I should know how to continue my life.

630
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,820
Don't worry about me.

631
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,039
I'm doing well now.

632
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,360
I've never lived so well as now.

633
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,099
I'm leaving now.

634
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,699
Goodbye.

635
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,499
What are you looking at so seriously?

636
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,039
Young Master, is my story really bad?

637
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,879
Yes, it is. No, it's not.

638
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,999
Your story is very good,

639
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,220
but they don't like to listen to it.

640
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,340
That's because they don't understand the art.

641
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,099
I love your story.

642
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,479
Really?

643
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,238
Then I'll finish it for you.

644
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:27,019
And then, I went to see my girl, the unsurpassed beauty, and

645
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:28,340
listened to her singing every day.

646
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,459
A lot of people wanted to marry her.

647
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:34,140
- Old Geng.
- But she—
- I-I love your story.

648
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,400
But I don't like to hear it now.

649
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,240
Your story is very touching.

650
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,900
You should tell it late at night, after midnight.

651
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,780
And I think, if you just talk about it, it's too pale.

652
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,979
Well, you- you- you are writing a novel, right?

653
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:53,820
You can write your story into the novel.

654
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,119
Write it into my novel?

655
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,040
Is that really feasible?

656
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,459
Yes.

657
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,579
Sure.

658
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:04,900
I'll write it when I get back.

659
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,260
Okay.

660
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,119
Who is this?

661
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,900
Counsellor Ning, Holy Master wants to see Counsellor Ning.

662
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Please follow me there immediately.

663
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,259
Holy Master wants to see me?

664
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:19,640
Yes.

665
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,399
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

666
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,080
[Fang]

667
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,959
Holy Master, I bring him here.

668
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:56,959
Ning Yi, if I'm right,

669
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,720
you will send your family out of the city at dawn tomorrow.

670
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,839
This tea is too strong.

671
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,900
I don't know you.

672
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,640
But I know Xi Gua.

673
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,079
If she says she'll send you out, she'll do it.

674
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,419
But you should know whether you can get out of city or not,

675
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:23,360
it won't depend on her. It will depend on me.

676
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,900
I've heard that you have great magical power.

677
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,539
You've contributed a lot to our board recently.

678
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,059
I should express my appreciation to you.

679
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,059
So, it's okay for your family to leave here.

680
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:37,199
But, you have to do one thing for me first.

681
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,200
Once it's done,

682
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,180
you will be my Counselor.

683
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,660
Or I'll kill all your family members.

684
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,840
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

685
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,540
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

686
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,240
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

687
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,410
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

688
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:58,150
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

689
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,790
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

690
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,660
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

691
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:12,640
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

692
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,690
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

693
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,940
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

694
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,880
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

695
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,420
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

696
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,510
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

697
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,850
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

698
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,820
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

699
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,230
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

700
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,220
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

701

♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

702
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,450
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

703
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,960
