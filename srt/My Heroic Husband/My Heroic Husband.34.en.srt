00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,559
Mother!

5
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,739
I missed you so much!

6
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,979
You're finally back!

7
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,158
I've been looking forward to your return!

8
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,399
Was it a tiring journey?

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,358
No.

10
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,420
Did you get hurt on the way?

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,740
- Grandfather!
- I'm fine!

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,460
We're fine! Don't worry!

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,519
Father!

14
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,079
Grandfather! Grandfather!

15
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,599
Father!

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,480
It's so good that you are back!

[Su Manor]

18
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,060
Grandfather!

19
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,580
Tan'er, I've missed you so much!

20
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,880
Finally, you are back!

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Yi'er, this time you finally brought Tan'er back safely!

22
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,559
Luckily, I didn't let you down!

23
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,740
All right, all right!

24
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,040
I've prepared some food and drinks for you.

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,460
They are all your favorites.

26
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,860
Come on, let's enjoy a nice meal!

27
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,380
- Let's go!
- Grandfather, I got you!

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,059
Grandfather, I missed you so much!

29
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,479
It must have been a tiring journey.
[Su Manor]

30
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,079
We've been looking forward to your return!

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,280
My dear, I'm back!

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,339
Why did you come back?

33
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:16,438
You may as well have just die outside!

34
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,878
What are you thinking about?

35
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,379
If I'd died outside, you'd have become a widow, you know?

36
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,219
Widow?

37
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,080
You know what?

38
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,619
Don't think I don't know what you did!

39
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:25,860
I've asked the people at home.

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,619
The maid told me that you didn't even live at home,

41
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,659
but stayed in this house that I bought instead!

42
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,819
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,919
It means that you are waiting for me and that you've missed me!

44
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,700
Who's missed you?

45
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,779
I'd rather think of some other man than think of you!

46
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,359
You just didn't want to come back!

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,939
You've just gotten tired of me!

48
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,981
You want to take this chance to divorce me!

49
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,379
Listen! Don't think you've seen through me!

50
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,939
Never will I divorce you!

51
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,660
And you can tell the other man to give up on that!

52
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,038
I came back now!

53
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,539
Besides, my family name, Li, should be written on

54
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,379
the memorial tablet in your ancestral hall!

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,900
What? Afraid, now?

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,999
Listen to me!

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,878
I will die after you!

58
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
I won't give you any chance to be with another man!

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,139
You bastard! You should die outside instead!

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,599
Of course, I won't do that.

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,799
You are stuck with me!

62
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,500
My dear!

63
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,640
My dear, don't run anymore.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,839
I'll run to you!

65
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,559
Before I left, I concocted medicine for you,

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,099
and you were getting better.

67
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,519
You shouldn't make it worse.

68
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm back!

69
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,779
My dear!

70
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,639
My dear!

71
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,119
This is not a dream, right?

72
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,040
Pinch my face!

73
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,560
Of course it isn't!

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,740
You are finally back!

75
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,090
You are finally back!

76
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,260
[Su Manor]

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,150
In order to find Tan'er and Ning Yi,

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,190
my father and I tramped over hill and dale

79
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,360
and went through so many hardships

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,878
before we finally made it to Lin'an!

81
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,539
But we didn't expect that-that we'd lose all of our money

82
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,060
and be caught by bandits and enslaved!

83
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,199
What a brutal torture!

84
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,440
It was such a hard time for us!

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,360
But my son and I had a sharp sense of integrity and refused to surrender.

86
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
We fought with them every day, and finally

87
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,518
we cooperated with General Dong from the inside

88
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,959
and helped them take back Lin'an!

89
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,700
You may say that justice always prevails over evil

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,420
and call it an outright victory!

91
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,920
Tan'er's Uncle, Wen Xing, you did great!

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,920
You two had such a difficult time!

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,759
Yet you contributed greatly to our Su Family!

94
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,500
It doesn't matter if it was difficult!

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,739
We are a family!

96
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,699
We should always support each other!

97
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,559
That's right!

98
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,219
It's just…

99
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:12,919
- It's just…
- Uncle.

100
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,960
Say no more.

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Just ask, if you want anything.

102
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,599
Nephew-in-law.

103
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,860
I, Su Zhong Kan, am willing to help people anytime

104
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,260
and I don't want anything in return.

105
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,200
If you'd like to put it this way, you can kind of overlook us.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,438
That's right!

107
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,118
- Then just forget about it.
- One store.

108
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,159
Just one store, what about that?

109
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,139
Or even half of it!

110
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,720
A half would be so improper.

111
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,700
From now, I'll have to ask you two to take care of

112
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,759
the Su's Dyehouse and those stores in the East Market.

113
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,120
Su's Dyehouse?

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,419
Aren't-Aren't the stores in the East Market the largest ones?

115
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,319
Yes!

116
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,360
You two

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,638
helped my wife and me a lot.

118
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,099
We should do something to return your favor!

119
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,900
So, second uncle, Wen Xing, please take care of

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,040
Su's business from now on!

121
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,739
Sure. It's our pleasure!

122
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,940
Nephew-in-law! Nephew-in-law!

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,659
This is exactly what we are planning to do!

124
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,499
I'm sure our business will thrive under our control!

125
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,539
Mother,

126
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,739
why hasn't my father come here?

127
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,260
He–

128
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,900
Your father worried a lot about you, which made him sick.

129
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,180
Though he is much better now,

130
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,980
he's still very weak

131
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,700
and needs some rest.

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,179
Go inside and meet him.

133
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,660
Father, I'm sorry that I've worried you!

134
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,240
Are you getting better now?

135
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
I'm fine.

136
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,579
You had a hard time in Lin'an.

137
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,159
I'm fine.

138
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,700
Ning Yi took very good care of me.

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,500
We haven't enjoyed tea together like this for a long time.

140
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,420
You've become much more skilled than when you were little.

141
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,120
Before I knew it, you've become a big girl.

142
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,400
I didn't want you to do business

143
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,099
because I wanted to free you from any difficulties.

144
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,900
And now seeing that you are living happily,

145
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,819
I'm satisfied now.

146
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,080
You silly girl!

147
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,679
You're a big girl. Why are you crying?

148
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,899
I'm not.

149
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,980
I just...

150
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,539
feel so happy

151
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,299
to have a father!

152
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,199
Nonsense!

153
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,080
I will always be there for you!

154
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:48,419
Come on.

155
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,699
Today, I'll make it up to you for what I owed you before!

156
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,830
♫ I often think of the moments with you ♫

157
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,340
♫ Following closely behind as you walk ♫

158
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,470
♫ Devotion to you and protecting you silently ♫

159
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,810
♫ Love is the warmest giving in the world ♫

160
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,620
♫ A gift for a lifetime ♫

161
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,380
I was thinking about marrying you again

162
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,620
after we divorced in Lin'an.

163
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,419
And I didn't expect that I'd get to do it till today.

164
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,979
Shall we perform the formal ceremony again?

165
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,470
In my own way.

166
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,710
♫ I don’t want to be famous in this life ♫

167
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,510

The Academy of Virtue and Wealth, just as the name suggests,

220
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,278
means to make money through moral integrity.

It's an academy exclusively for talented merchants.

Confucius said, "We can gain new insights

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,820
through reviewing old material."

Not only will you learn the ways of making money,

229
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,038
you'll also be provided with a place where you can share your experiences.

230
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,358
As is said, "Cultivate people by virtue,

231
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,118
and make money through amiability."

Try out the dishes.

334
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,920
Don't just eat the rice.

335
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,639
You must know the reason why I came to Jiangning.

336
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,819
Sure.

337
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,940
You are here to visit your old friend,

338
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,820
and by the way,

339
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,239
to take a trip in Jiangning.

340
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,880
Brother Ning, you are so capable. Why don't you help us think of a solution

341
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,459
and help us rescue a prisoner from the court?

342
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,419
It'll be simple for you.

343
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,259
But if the prisoner is named Fang Tian Lei,

344
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,080
I think it'll be impossible.

345
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,900
I mean it!

346
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,680
So do I!

347
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,979
Ning Yi, I'll just be honest with you.

348
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:56,579
On my way to Jiangning, I've thought about it.

349
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,700
I'll do whatever it takes to save him.

350
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,780
So what?

351
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,759
So I can beg you,

352
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,518
or force you to do so!

353
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,319
Brother Fan,

354
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,359
this is a threat!

355
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,359
If it's necessary,

356
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,839
I will see it as a threat, too!

357
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,720
It's not the first day you've known me.

358
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,278
I've known about the specific location of Su's Manor.

If you don't say yes,

I'll kill your whole family!

361
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,080
I don't believe you would do such a thing!

362
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,740
Just like you believe that I wouldn't eliminate your whole camp.

363
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,579
I know a threat won't work on you.

364
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,520
So let me beg you!

365
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,419
I just want you to help me think of an idea to save my Master!

366
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,659
I only need an idea!

367
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:06,919
You don't need to show up or participate in it!

368
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,100
There will be no trouble at all!

369
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,359
Even if we fail, we won't sell you out!

370
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Brother Fan, Fang Tian Lei killed Qian Xi Wen,

371
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,100
connived in Bao Wen Han's evil doings,

372
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,820
and killed so many innocent citizens in Lin'an.

373
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,160
According to the law of the Wu Dynasty,

374
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,758
he should be beaten on his back

375
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,060
and suffer a thousand cuts until death.

376
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,140
But I did ask the Secret Investigation Department

377
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,479
to write a letter to ask for mercy to the Emperor.

378
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,959
Given that Bao Wen Han is dead

379
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,839
and Badao Camp contributed to the relief distribution.

380
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,640
The Emperor won't torture him.

381
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,179
He will only be decapitated in public.

382
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,060
There are some things that must not be done.

383
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,560
I can't help you with this.

384
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,820
I know it's difficult for you!

385
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,760
But nothing changes even if you sacrifice all you have!

386
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,800
Your Master has violated the national law

387
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,819
and hurt so many citizens!

388
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,380
He will surely be executed for it!

389
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,939
I had a glimmer of hope

390
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,099
that you would help me.

391
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:30,400
I understand that you want to rescue your Master.

392
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,140
But if you do that,

393
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,560
not only will Dong Dao Fu and I stop you,

394
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,398
but also the tens of thousands of citizens who became homeless because of him!

395
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,999
I know and understand what you said!

396
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,699
But he's my Master after all,

397
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,019
and also Liu Xi Gua's uncle who brought her up.

398
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,480
He's like our father!

399
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,559
How can we just leave him alone?

400
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,140
I owe you two my life.

401
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,579
Without the two of you,

402
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,720
I would've long been dead under the sword of Bao Wen Han.

403
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,540
So,

404
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,739
I'll do everything to protect you

405
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,940
and Xi Gua.

406
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:25,259
Actually, Xi Gua understands what you just said.

407
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,620
She just can't hate you,

408
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,600
but she doesn't want to see you, either.

409

That's how she is.

410
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,520
Saving Master is now her priority.

411
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,079
She'd even do it alone.

412
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,799
Ning Yi, she can't be hurt.

413
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,538
Actually, she shouldn't have gotten herself involved in this matter in the first place.

414
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,700
Could you please write a letter and help me to persuade her?

415

I know it might not work out, but…

You are concerned about our nation. I can't question it.

You can't rescue my Master. I can't force you or persuade you to do that.

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,439
I can't do a thing about that, either.

But you have to keep in mind

what you owe Liu Xi Gua and us

425

is something more than one life!

I bet they'll transport my uncle to the capital through this route.
[Hanlin Mountain]

This is the best spot for us to do it.

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,019
We can hide in the trees,

429

and spring an ambush when they pass by.

430

The odds are very much in our favor. As long as we do it quickly,

431
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,320
it's very likely that we can get him out!

Xi Gua, I don't want you to get involved in this.

The day when Lin'an was taken down, he said to me

that his biggest wish was to see you stop being an outlaw.

Faced with justice,

we are bound to have a different choice.

♫ I have to look at you from a distance,
dare not expect to depend on each other ♫

493
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,680
♫ Carefully hide your inner affection ♫

494
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,310
♫ Even if the tears fall into rain, even if words are like ice ♫

♫ If lovers cannot depend on each other ♫

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,080
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

500
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,710
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

501
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,380
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

502
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,030
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

503
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:39,400
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

504
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,010
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

505
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,780
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

506
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:53,830
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

507
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,960
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

508
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,120
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

509
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,170
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

510
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,530
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
