166
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Yes.

167
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Put the four of them in jail.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,100
Don't give them any food and water, and no one is allowed to visit them. Got it?

169
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,400
- No, please don't.
- Leader, we… no, please!

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
We really don't know! Leader!

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,100
Wait.

172
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,300
Gao Qiu, what are you doing?

173
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,500
What is done is done. I can't keep it a secret anymore.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,600
Gao Qiu, you will be struck by lightning if you betray your friend.

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Say it.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
I can't tell you the complete story of

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,400
why Ning Yi doesn't want to leave Lin'an city.

178
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,200
-Because… Because…
- Because what?

179
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,100
Because the timing is just not right.

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,700
What is not right?

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,100
What do you mean?

182
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,000
Normally, Expert Ning will practice divination by the geomantic omen

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
whenever there's a big event.

184
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,400
But they were in a hurry yesterday, so he forgot about it.

185
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
When they got to the city gate, they found the army was there.

186
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Their carriage was shot by countless arrows and was pushed back by it.

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Expert Ning racked his brains, and he thought it was not right.

188
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,000
So he practiced divination.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
- You know what?
- What?

190
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,500
The Fire forces the Wind to run, the South will be favored.

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,800
You are the Fire, and he is the Wind, it should have been something good.

192
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,600
But, the direction was wrong.

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,200
The South will be favored?

194
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
That makes sense!

195
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
The South will be favored.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
That's why only the South Gate was safe

197
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
when Dong Dao Fu surrounded the other three gates yesterday.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Nothing would have happened

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
if we had gone to the South Gate yesterday.

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,000
That's right.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But now we've missed the right timing.

202
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
We'll have to wait for another one and a half months

203
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,800
if we want to get out of the city again.

204
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Gao Qiu, I told you not to reveal anything you're not supposed to.

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
What you just said will shorten your life.

206
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Seriously?

207
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Please don't ask Expert Ning again.

208
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Counselor Ning knows what should be said and what shouldn't.

209
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
- I won't, of course.
- The secret that can't be revealed isn't what normal people should know.

210
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,500
Enough! I got it.

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Say no more. Leave.

212
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
Thanks, Leader.

213
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Let's go, let's go.

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Beauty, you're still doing the accounts?

215
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
My lord, you asked me to do it. I must do it well.

216
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
But I need to ask you about one thing.

217
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Go ahead.

218
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Some time ago, when I was doing the accounts that Hu Zheng saw,

219
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,800
I found that fifty thousand taels of silver were used for something else.

220
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,500
But after that I looked through the accounts for these years.

221
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,000
I discovered that more than 150 thousand taels of silver are missing!

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Beauty,

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
only you and I know this.

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,500
Don't tell this to anyone.

225
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
Because part of it

226
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,300
belongs to you.

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
No worries.

228
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,800
After the trouble in Lin'an is removed,

229
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,600
I'll take you out of here.

230
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,200
We can live without worries for many years with that money.

231
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,600
Master,

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm afraid that you'll need to go to Dong Daofu.

233
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Don't worry. I'll go tonight.

234
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Actually, you don't need to

235
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,900
participate in tonight's move.

236
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,400
We both know Fang Tian Lei

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
attaches great importance to the powder magazine.

238
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,700
Although we've gathered these people here, we're still short of hands.

239
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,800
It can be tough to get the powder magazine back

240
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
under the eyes of so many guards.

241
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,800
What's more, we only have one hour.

242
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,200
Every step is full of uncertainties.

243
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,500
This battle can be very dangerous.

244
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,400
To be frank, there is no chance for us to win.

245
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Everyone in the Secret Investigation Department

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
has prepared themselves to sacrifice their lives for Wu dynasty.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
But you still have your family and friends here.

248
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Maybe you'll lose your lives too

249
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
if you want to join us in the battle.

250
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,300
This is the first time I've heard you say this much.

251
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,000
I've got a friend

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
who said the same words to me.

253
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,100
"An extraordinary man does extraordinary deeds."

254
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
"Even if no one survives in the end,"

255
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
"at least it would show that"

256
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,600
"somebody fought back."

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
In that way, when others sacrifice themselves,

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,300
they can reference some names.

259
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Counselor, come on, Counselor.

260
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,400
Let's go get some drinks.

261
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,900
You quit the patrol?

262
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,400
Let's go.

263
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Let me tell you, Counselor, the restaurant we went to last time…

264
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Young Master, you finally came back!

265
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,200
What are you doing here?

266
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm waiting for you.

267
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Why are you waiting for me?

268
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,300
Where's Lady?

269
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,600
She has been busy all day in the Cloth Store.

270
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,500
She fell asleep.

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,800
Old Geng, did you promise me that

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
you'll protect Your Lady no matter what happens?

273
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,300
What's wrong, Young Master? You're being so serious today.

274
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,000
Answer me.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
Even if I were gone, you'd keep her safe, right?

276
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,000
I've lost her once.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It'll never happen again.

278
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
That's my good buddy.

279
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,100
Young Master,

280
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,200
well, I've been staying up several nights.

281
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I finally finished the story between her and me.

282
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,600
But I don't know how to finish the story.

283
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,500
Can you help me if you have time?

284
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,600
Old Geng, I've been exhausted these days.

285
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,400
I'll help you when I'm back.

286
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Wait until I'm back.

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
When you're back?

288
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,000
But you just got back.

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,300
You're back, my dear.

290
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm back.

291
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
I thought you were asleep.

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why did you came back so late?

293
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,700
I have to deal with some things.

294
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,800
Are they done?

295
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,000
I guess so.

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Go to sleep now. Get some rest.

297
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

298
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,500
Didn't you promise me that you'll protect Your Lady no matter what happens?

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
What's wrong, Young Master?

300
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,800
You're being so serious today.

301
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
Answer me.

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Even if I were gone, you'd keep her safe, right?

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
I've lost her once.

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,300
It'll never happen again.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,300
You got up, my dear.

306
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,100
The meal is ready. Come and eat.

307
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,600
What day is it today?

308
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,500
Why did you make a table of dishes so early?

309
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,800
I thought that you haven't tried the food I cook.

310
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,200
So I want to cook for you and let you have a try.

311
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,500
Here. Have this.

312
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,400
Thanks, my dear.

313
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Swallow it.

314
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
Swallow it now.

315
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,600
Is it good?

316
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,800
My dear, do you know that you should add some salt to the dish.

317
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
It doesn't matter if there's salt or not.

318
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Just tell me if it tastes good.

319
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
It's good.

320
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,600
It's great.

321
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Have you ever learned to cook somewhere?

322
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Your skill is even better than the waitress'.

323
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
No, the chefs of the best Tori restaurant in Lin'an.

324
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
As long as you like it.

325
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Have more if it tastes good.

326
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,300
Try this meat, and this bamboo shoots, and this maize.

327
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Have them all. Finish them.

328
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,200
I'll look at you while you eat.

329
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,500
Okay.

330
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,500
Eat.

331
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,700
I'm leaving now then.

332
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,498
Come back early.

333
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,499
Don't make me worry.

334
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,199
My dear!

335
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,259
It's not that I forgot to put salt in the dishes today.

336
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:11,580
It's because there's no salt left in our house.

337
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:17,819
I know.

338
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,920
I'll bring back some salt for you tonight.

339
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,839
Keep your words.

340
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,900
Or I won't forgive you.

341
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,910
[Lou's Cloth Store]

342
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,159
Guys, General Dong has agreed to attack.

343
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,859
Today's midnight, we must take the powder magazine.

344
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,040
At that time, General Dong will collaborate with us from the outside

345
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,840
and take Lin'an back.

346
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,639
To take Lin'an back!

347
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,639
Three teams have come in one hour.

348
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:50,359
I guess there are more than fifty guards around.

349
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,200
We need to think of a way.

350
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,539
No need. Just wait.

351
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
Did you see the Counselor?

352
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,979
I didn't.

353
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:09,640
I didn't see him the whole day. Where did he go?

354
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,720
What do you want him for?

355
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,579
I wrote a book.

356
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,839
You can't understand.

357
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,819
All right, I'll wait for him.

358
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,218
Fire! What's going on?

359
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:23,300
It's on fire! It's on fire!

360
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,259
Go get the water!

361
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,498
Hurry up!

362
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:26,738
Hurry up, stop the fire!

363
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:27,779
We'll be screwed if the fire comes here.

364
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,280
Hurry up!

365
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,320
Fire!

366
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,719
It's on fire!

367
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,319
It's on fire!

368
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,339
It's on fire! Hurry up.

369
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,579
Water!

370
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,280
Hurry up!

371
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,740
Go!

372
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,460
Here.

373
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
It's empty.

374
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:08,979
- It's empty.
- Nothing's in here, either.

375
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,240
- It's empty.
- It's empty.

376
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,940
Nothing's in here.

377
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
Damn it!

378
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,159
It's a trap!

379
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,659
Let's go.

380
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,639
The bastards from Wude Camp.

381
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:41,119
I knew you'd come for the powder magazine.

382
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,119
Kill them all!

383
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,919
Kill them!

384
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,800
Blunderbuss?

385
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,180
Ning Yi!

386
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
Take him away.

387
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,180
- You can't be exposed!
- Go.

388
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,159
If I go, what about you?

389
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,180
Don't mind us, go!

390
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,819
Stop! Stop there!

391
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,539
Go.

392
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,760
- Young Master...
- So, it's you.

393
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Protect the Counselor!

394
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,720
Counselor!

395
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
Hurry up and go!

396
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,479
Go!

397
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,819
Go!

398
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:42,079
Young Master, hurry up and go!

399
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:54,180
Something's wrong!

400
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,099
Bao Wen Han wants to kill the Counselor at the gate.

401
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,959
Let go! Let go!

402
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,238
Old Geng! Old Geng!

403
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,120
Geng.

404
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,999
Old Geng.

405
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:26,399
Where are they?

406
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,999
Over there.

407
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,540
Hurry up!

408
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,460
Ning Yi.

409
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,360
Are you all right?

410
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,420
Brother Geng.

411
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,199
What happened?

412
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,680
Bao Wen Han came to get revenge on me.

413
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,480
Old Geng died with him

414
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,860
because he wanted to save me.

415
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,319
Bao Wen Han died.

416
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,039
He was shot by a blunderbuss.

417
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,579
Did you kill him?

418
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,879
You and I together may change the fate of Wu dynasty in the end.

419
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:52,079
If this dagger is really given by the Right Chancellor Qin,

420
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,579
then you will be the hope of the Secret Investigation Department.

421
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,340
If we go home like this, who'd take care of them?

422
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,659
An extraordinary man does extraordinary deeds.

423
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,539
Even if we didn't survive in the end,

424
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,199
it could show that somebody fought back.

425
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,879
In that way, when others sacrifice themselves,

426
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,760
they can reference some names.

427
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,639
Did you kill him?

428
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,339
I didn't.

429
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:38,259
I took some men to the gate of Badao Camp.

430
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:43,159
Then I saw Leader Bao's body lying in the blood.

431
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,280
Holy Master.

432
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,119
Leader Bao went through ups and downs with you.

433
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,000
You must take revenge for him.

434
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,419
Holy Master, Bao Wen Han had always resented Badao Camp and Counselor Ning.

435
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,258
He had long wanted to get the chance to take revenge on us.

436
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:03,339
I didn't expect he'd come to us and kill six of our men.

437
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,940
Counselor Ning was severely injured, too.

438
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,720
And Brother Geng was killed on the spot.

439
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,839
Nonsense!

440
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,879
Leader Bao was fighting against the enemies

441
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,080
from Wude Camp who secretly sneaked into the powder magazine.

442
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,160
How come he appeared at the gate of Badao Camp?

443
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,240
The man sending the report said

444
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,680
that one of them was holding a blunderbuss.

445
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,259
That's why Leader Bao chased after them.

446
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,519
If it hadn't been Ning Yi, who else would it have been?

447
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,240
This man must be an ally of Wude Camp.

448
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,058
Please investigate it thoroughly, Holy Master.

449
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,560
Nonsense!

450
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,601
Bao Wen Han died in Badao Camp.

451
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,039
Why is the powder magazine involved?

452
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,578
You said Ning Yi sneaked into the powder magazine.

453
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,020
Where's the evidence?

454
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,160
I'm asking if you have any evidence?

455
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,739
Many soldiers in Wude Camp have blunderbusses, too.

456
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,859
Why did it have to be Ning Yi?

457
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:50,560
Everyone here can use a blunderbuss. Why do you blame it on him?

458
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,399
What are you talking about?

459
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,800
Oh, that is infuriating!

460
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,479
Xuanwu Camp.

461
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,899
Badao Camp.

462
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,280
The two Camps I trust the most.

463
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,120
But look at you!

464
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,120
You plot against and speak poorly of each other all the time.

465
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,299
Do you still regard me as your Holy Master?

466
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
Please calm down, Holy Master.

467
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,618
In my opinion, we don't have any evidence or witnesses.

468
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,839
It's no use to keep fighting.

469
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,919
Why don't we hold an elaborate funeral for our brothers

470
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,780
and settle the minds of the family of Leader Bao and our brothers.

471
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,280
Both Xuanwu Camp and Badao Camp should receive severe penalties.

472
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:39,180
Let's call it an end.

473
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,459
You two, do you agree?

474
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,740
Xuanwu Camp agrees to take the penalties.

475
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,039
But I have one condition.

476
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,159
I know what you are going to say.

477
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,940
No way!

478
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,999
Today, I won't allow anyone to lay a hand on Ning Yi.

479
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,120
No way!

480
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,299
He must come with me.

481
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,240
Otherwise, no one can call it a day!

482
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,899
Bao Wen Han wanted to kill him first!

483
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:15,619
Why should Ning Yi take the blame?

484
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,080
Good for you!

485
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,720
Good for Badao Camp!

486
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,639
I just don't understand

487
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,139
why an insignificant Counselor can make Leader Liu

488
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:37,019
turn the whole Badao Camp against us?

489
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,178
- Is Ning Yi your lover?
- You!

490
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:44,200
I'll kill you!

491
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,319
Liu Da Biao!

492
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,879
Holy…

493
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,199
Ning Yi, I don't care if you killed Old Bao.

494
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,320
You must die today.

495
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,080
Uncle, Uncle.

496
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,059
We still don't know what happened. We can't blame it on Ning Yi.

497
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,200
Why do you protect him like this?

498
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,899
I like him.

499
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,580
All right, you all leave now.

500
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,520
Let's discuss about this later.

501
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,359
Lady Lou.

502
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,719
Lady Lou, something's wrong.

503
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,160
Leader Bao was killed at the gate of Badao Camp.

504
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:41,399
Open the door.

505
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,560
I dare not.

506
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,280
- Leader Bao has said—
- Leader Bao is dead!

507
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,960
Who will take charge in this yard?

508
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,999
I will!

509
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,680
Leader Bao is gone.

510
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,679
Everything in here will belong to me.

511
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,600
Those wives behind you and you

512
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,640
are all mine.

513
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,839
Although Leader Bao is gone, you're not qualified to be the leader.

514
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,630
These women behind me and me…

515
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,030
Try laying a single hand on us.

516
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,159
Take them!

517
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,399
Take these two to the pioneer army and garrison.

518
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,800
Although they may not need this,

519
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,560
they could exchange it for some money.

520
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,779
They'll be happy.

521
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,979
In the future, give all my rewards to those soldiers.

522
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,379
You be careful.

523
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:00,899
Let's go.

524
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,999
Go, open the door.

525
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,640
Don't go anywhere now.

526
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,959
Lin'an will be safe sooner or later.

527
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,580
I promise I'll take you out then.

528
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,939
- Thank you, Lady Lou.
- Thank you, Lady Lou.

529
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,799
My dear.

530
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:07,440
♫ The world is coldest and ruthless ♫

531
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,910
♫ Fallen the brightest blooms are hard to find ♫

532
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,360
♫ Everyone counts ♫

533
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,750
♫ I'm the only one crying ♫

534
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:26,540
♫ Consume the sadness overnight ♫

535
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,340
My dear,

536
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,139
what happened?

537
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:34,839
Old Geng.

538
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,510
♫ No one cares ♫

539
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,410
won't be able to go home with us.

540
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,640
♫ Sentient beings with a loving pitiful fragrance fading away ♫

541
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,310
♫ Where can I find the sunny evening again ♫

542
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,970
♫ Provoking bitterness for a while ♫

543
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,680
♫ Who is sad to dream about this ♫

544
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,480
Geng Zhi, the guard of Su's family, was born in Bafeng village.
[Tomb of Geng Zhi]

545
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,280
He's a brave and righteous hero.

546
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,539
He kept Su's family safe for over ten years.

547
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:11,540
He was always loyal.

548
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,020
He kept faith to the bitter end.

549
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,880
He died in Lin'an

550
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,080
in June in the fifth year of Jinghan's reign when he was 30.

551
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,859
He was buried in a place near the Qingyue hill,

552
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,559
to the southeast of Hui lake in Lin'an.

553
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:35,779
♫ For fear that no one will hate ♫

554
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:40,419
The Su family is honored to have had you as a guard.

555
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:46,560
You said you wanted to travel all over the world with your sword.

556
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,840
From now on,

557
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,699
you don't need to worry about us.

558
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:55,019
Now just rest in peace.

559
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,380
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

560
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,980
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

561
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,720
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

562
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,930
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

563
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:22,550
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

564
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,360
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

565
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,130
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

566
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:37,120
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

567
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,120
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

568
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,430
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

569
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,500
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

570
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,850
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

571
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,930
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

572
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,290
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

573

♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

574
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,590
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

575
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:10,690
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫
