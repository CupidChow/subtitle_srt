[Episode 29]

3
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,878
But you should know whether you can get out of the city or not.

4
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:56,580
It won't depend on her. It will depend on me.

5
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,119
I've heard that you have great magical power.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,740
You've contributed a lot to our board recently.

7
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,260
I should express my appreciation to you.

8
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,339
So, it's okay for your family to leave here.

9
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:10,599
But, you have to do one thing for me first.

10
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,179
Once it's done,

11
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,480
you will be my Counselor.

12
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,059
Or, I'll kill all your family members.

13
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,359
You don't have to try to persuade me time and again.

14
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,119
I will never be persuaded.

15
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,800
Master Qian.

16
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,739
What?

17
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,499
You changed the person inducing me to capitulate.

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,359
Come on. Don't say such dreadful things.

19
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm not here to induce you to capitulate.

20
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,779
I'm here to give you psychological instruction.

21
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,318
You have been in a blue mood for a long time.

22
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,039
It's not healthy, both physically and mentally.

23
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,290
[Walls have ears]

24
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,020
Walls have ears.

25
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,718
Master Qian, why don't you meditate with me.

26
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:07,079
Find your inner peace.

27
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,438
Let's imagine that we are surrounded

28
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,319
by a peaceful rain and dew, and flowers in the mist.

29
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,979
Let's breathe the fresh morning scent.

30
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,960
Breathe out,

31
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,779
breathe in, breathe out,

32
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,219
breathe in,

33
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,500
breathe out,

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,580
breathe in.

35
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,459
A man of complete virtue won't induce someone to give up.

36
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:48,840
I already assembled grain into the city, saving people from hunger.

37
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,559
The dissatisfaction towards Fang Tian Lei is growing day by day.

38
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:03,660
Lin'an City will be back sooner or later.

39
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:16,820
I should feel at ease that Lin'an has someone like you.

40
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,459
Are you serious?
[Fang Manor]

41
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,779
I am.

42
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:33,338
Master Qian told me that he will surrender himself to you in front of the whole city.

43
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,360
How did you make him come around?

44
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:44,899
I just did one meditation with him.

45
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,899
Meditation?

46
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,020
In other words, going into the deepest place of his mind,

47
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,058
helping him think through the things that he couldn't have thought through.

48
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,820
Xi Gua indeed has a good judge of character.

49
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,719
All right, from now on, you should be my Counselor.

50
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,579
Thank you, Holy Master.

51
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,679
But Commander Liu has helped me.

52
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,480
I'd better stay at Badao Camp and help her with her business.

53
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,540
I hope Holy Master could understand me.

54
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,599
You are full of gratitude.

55
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,839
Fine, enough with that, now send your family out of the city.

56
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,380
Thank you, Holy Master.

57
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,719
Wait. There's another thing I want to ask you.

58
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:43,338
How did you collect 500 dans of food from the three counties near us in one night?

59
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,140
- I bought it.
- You bought it?

60
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,539
To tell you the truth,

61
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,500
I am a matrilocal husband of the Su family in Jiangning.

62
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,999
My monthly salary could buy over three times that amount of food.

63
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,480
Xi Gua didn't tell me that you're rich.

64
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:11,359
Actually, I've got my own difficulties.

65
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,619
Commander Bao came into the city, plundering the money of the rich merchants.

66
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,060
I hid this for my own protection.

67
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,238
I'm honest with you today because I know Holy Master is generous,

68
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:25,579
and you won't care about my little money.

69
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,959
This is what extorts the world.

70
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,998
I can't really do something when you describe it in this way.

71
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:35,300
I have to ask the Holy Master to keep it a secret for me.

72
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,078
After all, people like us who have some pennies are afraid to be exposed the most.

73
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,879
I'll see you later then.

74
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,379
Go then.

75
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,860
There were misunderstandings between us.

76
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,618
You thought we are bandits and rascals, and that we commit all manners of crimes.
[Fang]

77
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:18,140
But today, we've got the most respected people you know

78
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,078
to clear our names.

79
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:23,279
Master Qian, please.

80
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,020
Guys, you've been

81
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,319
through a hard time these days.

82
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,759
During this time, I've been thinking about one question.

83
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,640
What should heroes do exactly?

84
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,139
We repeat the saint words every day,

85
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,479
but no one was willing to stand out when the city was captured.

86
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:58,880
Then who would believe those words?

87
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,659
What's the meaning of "love the country, defend the country"?

88
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,779
It means when we live in a peaceful age, we need to do our duty well.

89
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,719
When we live in a truceless year, we need to defend our country's dignity.

90
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:16,800
Nowaday, every piece of land you're standing on is of your home country.

91
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,918
It is in the hands of others, but it is still under your feet as well.

92
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:25,438
You were born and raised by your country. It's not to see you fawn over others.

93
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:30,820
We should never cower when the enemy attacks us.

94
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,360
I beg you to remember

95
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,890
that we were born to stand for the word of China.

96
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,280
We should never be compelled by others, even if it will take our lives.

97
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,838
Never give in!

98
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:54,499
Never give in! Never give in! Never give in!

99
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,278
Old bastard, I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,020
Never give in! Never give in! Never give in!

101
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,190
Master Qian! Master Qian! Master Qian!

[The North Gate of Lin'an]

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,739
Uncommon man does uncommon deeds.

104
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:49,159
We have the knowledge.

105
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,079
We should resist the injustice.

106
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,778
Even death will not make one yield.

107
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,999
I will not only sacrifice my life calmly,

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,039
but also die in front of thousands of people.

109
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,899
That way that I can remind people

110
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,158
that the morality we uphold is real,

111
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,760
so that we can carry on the lost learning of the sages of yesterday.

112
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Master Qian, everything would be meaningless if you die.

113
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,560
You could stay alive and influence more people.

114
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,530
Some people's

115
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,679
deaths means nothing.

116
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,579
But some people's deaths mean everything.

117
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:42,879
So what we called a worthy death

118
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,970
meant it can warn people,

119
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,970
as somebody really has resisted.

120
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,060
When people want to sacrifice themselves,

121
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,879
they can't find a name to recall.

122

123
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,699
you said we're going home,

124
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,559
but what about them?

125
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,480
Let's go.

126
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,879
Open the gate.

127

There's only one carriage now. The other two are on the way.

Okay.

Although we don't want you to leave,

138

we can't separate you and your family.

139

Brother Fan, thank you and Xi Gua for taking care of me during this time.

There will be difficulties in the future. Take care.

Hope we can meet again someday.

Take care.

144
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,719
Father, we can finally go home.

145
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,619
I feel sad thinking about the difficulties

146
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:05,520
we've encountered on the way.

147
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,899
There's nothing to feel sad about. We'll be home soon. Don't be sad.

148
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm not sad.

149
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,419
Father, why do I feel like there's something wrong?

150
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,779
Indeed, it's too quiet.

151

154
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,959
Don't close the gate.

155

There, there. Move.

Hurry.

165
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,199
You won't be able to leave today.

166
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,999
Dong Dao Fu's army is bearing down upon the border. They're garrisoning outside of the city.

167
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,178
There will be a war.

168
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:09,218
God damn. It looks like we'll be stuck here to die in Lin'an.

169
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,939
Stop your nonsense. Be quiet.

170
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,699
My nephew-in-law, God damn.

171
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,419
It looks like we'll be stuck here to die in Lin'an.

172
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,838
You should go back to Badao Camp.

173
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:35,039
It's an unusual time now. Don't go out unless there's an emergency.

174
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,640
A'Sha, come with me.

175
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,978
Dong Dao Fu's army is at the gate. You need to strengthen your defenses. Don't relax.

176
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,599
- Understood?
- Understood!

177
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,619
- Welcome, Holy Master.
- Welcome, Holy Master.

178
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,359
What's going on outside?

179
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,598
Dong Dao Fu's army has surrounded three gates.

180
00:17:56,598 --> 00:18:00,099
Only the south gate has space. We haven't seen their soldiers there.

181
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,679
Holy Master, Dong Dao Fu came with full force.

182
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,019
What about I go and call out, taking them down a peg?

183
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,800
No need to do heroics.

184
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,318
Now take some men and examine the city.

185
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:15,159
Remember, at this moment, don't give them a chance.

186
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,298
Got it.

187
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,899
Open the gate.

188
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,239
- Holy Master...
- Open the gate!

189
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,919
General, according to the confidential letter that the Prime Minister Qin has given us,

190
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,759
there are three secret pathways around Lin'an city that go straight inside.

191
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,279
I already sent a message to Left General Lin Yun to sneak in secretly from the east,

192
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,180
Wang Bin will lead the Right General to go towards West...

193
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,900
There're many rice fields in the West they can as cover.

194
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,498
I think we can get into the city soon.

195
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,658
As for the northwestern part, the Middle General Zhang Hai Tian volunteered himself.

196
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:59,218
We will lead the army from outside to collaborate with them inside. Then we can take Lin'an.

197
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,759
Not bad.

198
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,558
Tell the brothers at the three gates to keep their spirits up.

199
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,800
Do call out every now and then to get the enemy's attention.

200
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,358
Also, we need to send another troop to the gap in the south.

201
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,979
There are some men under Fang Tianlei who are very brave and good at fighting.

202
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,000
They are really formidable.

203
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,440
We should never let down our guard.

204
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,678
Okay. I got it.

205
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,218
Report!

206
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,959
The thief chief Fang Tian Lei wants to see you.

207
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,199
Brother, it's been so many years since I last saw you. How have you been?

208
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,660
Fang Tian Lei, you're extraordinarily brave.

209
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,090
You dare come into my camp alone?

210
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,870
You aren't afraid that you may never go back?

211
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:01,599
I wouldn't come if I were.

212
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,580
Don't forget that I have the biggest powder magazine in the Wu dynasty.

213
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:12,879
Fang Tian Lei, long time no see, please come in.

214
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,750
[City map of Lin'an]

215
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,980
You surrounded three gates, left the fourth gate unmanned.

216
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,379
Brother, your confidence doesn't make any sense.

217
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:32,220
It's me who taught you the tactics that leave a way of escape to a surrounded enemy,

218
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,039
No more nonsense.

219
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,718
You only have one choice now.

220
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:43,499
Abandon the city and yield. Then maybe I can keep you alive.

221
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,960
Keep me alive.

222
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,630
You're in such a hurry to want me to give in.

223
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,790
Is it because the war in the north is critical so that you can't waste a minute in here?

224
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,350
So you can't waste a minute in here?

225
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,800
There's no relation between the north

226
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,920
and you attacking and occupying Lin'an.

227
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Report!

228
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,079
General, this is what they sent from outside.

229
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,620
I've prepared a liberal present for you.

230
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,359
I can't come empty-handed as we haven't seen each other for so long, can I?

231
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,800
Take a look.

232
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,500
Open it.

233
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,139
What?

234
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,300
What are you doing?

235
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,598
- What are you doing?
- Don't move!

236
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,559
Did you hear what your General said?

237
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,659
Did you?

238
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:42,639
Ask him if he dares touch a hair of mine?

239
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,319
They pissed me off!

240
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,140
Enough with that, let's talk about our business.

241
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,079
Lin Yun, Wang Bin, Liu Hai Tian,

242
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,919
- the heads of your three most favored Deputy Generals.
- What do you think?

243
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,599
Wei Wu, are they liberal?

244
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,440
Fang Tian Lei!

245
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,499
Look at you.

246
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,219
Come on, just kill me.

247
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:17,059
Do it. Kill me.

248
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,000
You don't dare.

249
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,490
Dong Dao Fu, listen to this.

250
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,430
If you dare touch a hair of mine,

251
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,639
I'll burn Lin'an city and the powder magazine into ashes.

252
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,819
Stop there!

253
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,559
Who's the man behind you?

254
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,440
What can you do to me if I don't tell you?

255
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,520
[Qin Manor]

256
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,210
[The enemy knows about the secret pathway.
They found out about the plan]

257
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,179
How is it possible?

258
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,038
The secret pathway is a secret.

259
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,520
Only you and I know it.

260
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
There's fish on the line! Come on, see.

261
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,580
Minister, the yellow carp is the hardest to get in the pond.

262
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,739
But they still can't get out from your hands.

263
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,839
Jin Han, you've been working hard these days.

264
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,340
This fish is yours.

265
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,140
Thank you, Minister.

266
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,419
Did you send your family out of town?

267
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,140
Minister, I did.

268
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,940
That's good.

269
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,118
Report to Chancellor Qin. There's no one in Hao Jinhan's Manor.

270
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,900
I'm afraid that he and his family escaped at night.

271
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,860
Go find them when they're not far.

272
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,741
No need.

273
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:54,699
No. I must imprison him

274
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,820
and ask him why he betrayed the Secret Investigation Department and the court.

275
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,140
He's not the only one who betrayed the court.

276
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,199
- Leave!
- Yes.

277
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,499
Maybe He Yuan Chang was involved as well?

278
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:23,960
It's possible that he bribed my guard, Hao Jin Han, to get information.

279
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,459
As for colluding with the bandits,

280
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:31,040
I don't think he'd dare.

281
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,399
If He Yuan Chang really bribed Hao Jin Han,

282
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,440
then he'd know that Dong Dao Fu,

283
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,330
who was supposed to march to the North,

284
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,730
was sent to the south by His Majesty temporarily.

285
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,580
In that case, I'm afraid that

286
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,480
the two Generals who went to the North might…

287
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,979
The army of the Wu dynasty did not get the advantage in the long battle.

288
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:54,580
They encountered a trap.

289
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,860
Except the Chief Commanders Wang Bing and Yang Shi Ke

290
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,019
that let the middle route army break through the attacks.

291
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:02,880
All other soldiers and horses have sacrificed themselves.

He Yuan Chang!

298

You bastard! You're a collaborationist. I'll kill you.

299

Why is Lord Li so mad?

300
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,620
Are there some misunderstandings?

301
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,799
Misunderstandings? Screw misunderstandings.

302
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,518
You told your trusted fellows not to use their best efforts, to chicken out.

303
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:31,879
Shao Qian just got married, and he died on the battlefield.

I can't face the soldiers who died in the North

Counsellor Li,

307
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,580
you are the Left Chancellor of the Court.

308
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,739
You need evidence before giving a statement.

309
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,159
Screw you.

310
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,100
You think no one can do anything to you

311
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,741
because you fawn over His Majesty?

312
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:59,419
Today, I will do the right thing for him!

313
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,280
Who wants to do the right thing for me?

314
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,719
Your Majesty.

315
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:13,459
I didn't know Your Majesty is here today. I deserve to die.

316
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:16,140
You still know I'm Your Majesty.

317
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,060
But do you really take me as your Majesty in your heart?

318
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,319
Guards! Take him out. Put him in jail.

319
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,840
Got it.

320
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,939
Chancellor Qin, why are you here?

321
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:44,599
You're so reckless. Why didn't you tell me?

322
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:48,200
I hope Your Majesty didn't blame you.

323
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:54,519
I guess He Yuan Chang knew that you'd come to him.

324
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,420
I should have warned you that day.

325
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,280
So, should we just give in?

326
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,341
I already suggested Your Majesty replace

327
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,440
General Wang and General Yang who slacked at war,

328
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,299
and sent the last troop and all the elites in the Secret Investigation Department to the north.

329
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:27,459
Despite that, if we can't take Lin'an in seven days.

330
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:32,580
I'm afraid… Maybe we can give this mission to Ningyi.

331
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,019
Mo Ying said in the letter that when the bandits came into the city,

332
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,820
he helped Wude Camp beat the bandits severely.

333
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,219
Then he lurked in the bandits as a spy.

334
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:44,620
He lowered the food prices, settled people's mind, and won trusts,

335
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,060
even became the Counselor.

336
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,419
He could use this title to do something…

337
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:57,699
It's a bit risky,

338
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,599
but we have to try.

339
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,278
You're here again, right?

340
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,239
Fine. Let me see.

341
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,800
Let me see what mission he give me this time.

342
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,340
Okay.

343
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,019
I received the letter.

344
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:33,739
I see.

345
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,340
I don't want to write a reply letter.

346
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,119
Listen, pass on this message to him.

347
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,518
I just want to go back to Jiangning with my wife.

348
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,599
Is there anything wrong with that?

349
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,340
I got the order to leave the city. I opened the gate.

350
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,900
Why is Dong Dao Fu attacking the city now?

351
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,600
If you say that it wasn't your order but his, I won't believe it.

352
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,499
I only live on small business.

353
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,278
I'm just a businessman.

354
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,860
You always want to persuade me with the righteousness of family and country.

355
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,919
You said Secret Investigation Department, Wu dynasty,

356
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,340
whatever this and that, that's your business, Qin Si Yuan.

357
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,820
It's none of my business.

358
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,999
Did you hear me?

359
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,358
Don't ever come to me in the future.

360
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,759
Get lost!

361
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,500
All right, good, and this.

362
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,100
This. See?

363
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,699
He called it the token.

364
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,199
Watch this.

365
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,979
All right. It's gone.

366
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,499
There's nothing between us from now on.

367
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:35,820
Do you understand?

368
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,420
Leave.

369
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,159
Fine, good for you.

370
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,140
You're worse than that old guy, you know?

371
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,620
You don't leave?

372
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,419
Okay.

373
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:53,280
Let me deal with you.

374
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,499
I couldn't find you anywhere.

375
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,319
I didn't expect that you're eating alone here.

376
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,619
I didn't.

377
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,819
Come and sit.

378
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,860
I know you have complaints.

379
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,499
But why did you turn to the pigeon.

380
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:00,730
My dear, have you thought about it?

381
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,599
Maybe it's God's will that

382
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,759
we couldn't leave the city.

383
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,820
I grew up in Lin'an. Looking at what it's becoming,

384
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,219
I can't stand by.

385
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:18,340
Turbulent days spare no one.

386
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,259
When the war spreads to Jiangning, we'll be the second Lou family.

387
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:28,620
My dear, you always say that everything will be okay.

388
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,459
Now that we've stayed, we should do something.

389
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,419
Lady Lu let me give it to you.

390
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,699
She said that there're many pigeons in the Secret Investigation Department.

391
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:48,219
You can eat as many as you want.

392
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:52,179
But Master Qin's dagger is unique.

393
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,840
You can't lose it again.

394
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,219
My lady is right.

395
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,999
Lin'an is having a hard time. Maybe I can help.

396
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,358
Moreover, I can protect you.

397
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,440
That's right, Young Master. I can stay here to serve you and my lady.

398
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,699
Come on. You don't need to persuade me.

399
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,299
I see what you mean.

400
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:21,399
Come and sit.

401
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,440
My dear, in the Secret Investigation Department

402
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,939
is the pigeon tasty?

403
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,620
You really thought I stewed his pigeon?

404
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,179
This is chicken soup.

405
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:43,079
Let me break off a leg for you.

406
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,200
It's good.

407
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,100
Come on, Old Geng. Here you are.

408
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,860
Want one, my dear?

409
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,979
I'll eat it if you don't.

410
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:52,340
My lady, have a taste.

411
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,860
I suddenly remember one thing.

412
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,880
If the four of us stay, what should our uncle and his son do?

413
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,900
Uncle, cousin-in-law.

414
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,479
Why do you put on these tattered clothes again?

415
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,380
If we hadn't gone to the city wearing bandit clothes,

416
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,540
we wouldn't have been attacked by the soldiers outside.

417
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,820
Indeed.

418
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,259
I didn't force you to wear it.

419
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,780
Why didn't you stop us when we were leaving?

420
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,979
I wish I could.

421
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,839
The point is that you didn't.

422
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,939
Indeed.

423
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:39,520
Think about this, we're family. We shouldn't hurt each other.

424
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,340
Thank god we ran fast.

425
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,080
Otherwise...

426
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,559
Otherwise, we'd meet in the Hall of Su's Ancestors.

427
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,380
Uncle, Uncle, don't be upset.

428
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,639
If anything happened to you,

429
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,320
I'd definitely settle your soul in your homeland.

430
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,220
What are you saying?

431
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,120
Put it here.

432
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,019
What's this?

433
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:11,039
A drink for the road or the last meal?

434
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,819
Father, don't scare me.

435
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:18,620
Wen Xing, eat some when you still can.

436
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,619
Father, I'm not hungry at all.

437
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,859
Not hungry? Give it to me.

438
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,600
All right, enjoy your meal.

439
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,579
I've asked them to prepare another carriage.

440
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:32,118
You can leave when you've had enough.

441
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,979
You don't need to worry about our leaving.

442
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:37,099
We will never leave again.

443
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,280
[Fang Manor]

444
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,300
Lin'an is now surrounded by the court's army.

445
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,280
But as long as we've got the powder magazine,

446
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,979
they don't dare to attack.

447
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:51,139
However, we need to be careful that they don't attack us at night.

448
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,339
Yes.

449
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,180
There're many people from Wude Camp in Lin'an.

450
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,720
We need to get prepared in case that they collaborate from within with forces from outside.

451
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,680
It's the best if you could find them all and kill them to spare all later trouble.

452
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,820
Yes, Commander.

453
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,980
You must take the city and go back to court in seven days,

454
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,919
otherwise, the war in the north would be in vain.

455
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:13,539
Listen to Ning Yi's command.

456
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,820
That old guy really trusts me.

457
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,598
You've got Master Qin's dagger.

458
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,320
Who else should he appoint?

459
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,720
I've sneaked into the powder magazine.

460
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,540
This is the topographic map.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,540
That's so detailed.

462
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,519
All right, I'll try my best then.

463
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,740
You know what, Fang Tian Lei attacked Lin'an city

464
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,158
for this powder magazine.

465
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,399
If Dong Dao Fu's army wants to take it by force,

466
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,799
the bandits must resist intensely.

467
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,718
There would be countless deaths.

468
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,560
Even if he made it, Fang Tian Lei would burn the powder magazine

469
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,640
and let all the people of the city die with him.

470
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,580
Then the North marching would be screwed.

471
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,479
We can't just wait here and do nothing.

472
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:00,999
The more days the army stays outside,

473
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,799
the less chance of winning the north marching has.

474
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,979
I know.

475
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:07,640
I meant to say that you and I aren't enough to do it at all.

476
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,439
Have you ever thought about this? We not only need to take the powder magazine,

477
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:13,399
but also have to collaborate with Dong Dao Fu from inside when he attacks the city.

478
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,340
We need people to help us.

479
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,158
So, we need to gather the people from the Secret Investigation Departments and the Wude Camp as soon as possible.

480
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,879
You've got spies here?

481
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,139
Do you have a secret knock?

482
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,699
Is it like Sky King cover ground tiger, price tower shock river monster?

483
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:28,919
There's a special pattern on your dagger.

484
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:32,959
I see, it means we should spread this pattern.

Guys, it's the reopening of Lou's Cloth Store.

491
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,739
Please come in.

492

Come in. Come in.

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,019
Brother Ning, I still don't understand.

494
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:04,720
Why do you still have the mood to open the cloth store

495
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,319
while their army is surrounding the city?

496
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,180
Well, the civilians care about the following four things most:

497
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,139
clothing, food, shelter, and transportation.

498
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:15,200
I helped you gather food before, which solved the need for food.

499
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,839
Now I open this cloth store that is to solve the need for clothing.

500
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,760
As long as people have clothing and food, they won't make trouble.

501
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,600
No wonder you're Master Ning!

502

You always think about the people. You're a living Buddha.

You make my policing job easier.

But, what's this pattern?

505
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,560
Do you mean this?

506
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,420
That's a business emblem.

507
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,499
When the people see this emblem,

508
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,900
they'll know that they should come to Lou's Cloth Store.

someone could save you every day.
