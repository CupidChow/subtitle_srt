00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,010
[My Heroic Husband]

2
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,910
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,159
Are you really Master Ning?

4
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,139
That day under the city wall, I felt you were very familiar, but I didn't dare to acknowledge if it was you.

5
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,798
I, Li Pin, am honored to meet Master.

6
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,140
No need for formalities.

7
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,718
What Master Ning? What kind of trick are you playing?

8
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,038
Master Ning has made quite an impressive name for himself. Unless you have never heard his name before, Hero?

9
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:10,599
Master Ning is an extraordinary talented hermit who lives on the summit of Mount Dianzu!

10
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,999
He‘s not only quite intelligent and well-read,

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,758
but also understands people's future prospects through geomancy.

12
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,118
In our Wu Dynasty, he even enjoys the reputation of "Unhindered knowledge of all trades"

13
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:23,179
Who doesn't know of Master Ning's reputation?

14
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,780
You flatter me.

15
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,979
Our meeting is due to fate.

16
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,700
It's also heaven's will for us to meet here at this broken temple in the mountains.

17
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,260
Sit there and ask the questions you have.

18
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,380
Thank you so much, Master Ning.

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,279
Master Ning, I have been married for years.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm supposed to have many children that would carry on the family name now.

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,939
However...

22
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,139
however, no matter how hard my wife and I have tried, she just couldn't get pregnant.

23
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,859
If Master has a way to help, I would be indebted with new life.

24
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:05,000
I definitely will shed tears of gratitude.

25
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,259
Sit here.

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,160
Please speak, Master.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,878
Near Jiangning City there is a town called Watang.

28
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,918
In the town, there is a river called Tongqu. This river flows from the north to the south.

29
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:21,360
I will need you to find eighteen pebbles from the bottom of the river,

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
take these pebbles and place them under your bed cover. After sleeping peacefully with them for about a month,

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,060
you will be blessed with many children

32
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,110
and have continuous good fortune.

33
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,519
Many thanks, Master!

34
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,539
No need for formalities.

35
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,119
Now, you may leave.

36
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,660
I will take my leave, Master.

37
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,539
Hero, sorry to have bothered you.

38
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,220
I would have never thought

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,860
that you would understand a lot about these dishonest practices.

40
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,659
I must have some skills that I am good at when walking around Jianghu.

41
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,320
What's the matter, Leader Chen?

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,390
Do you also have hidden trouble that is hard to mention? How about I give you some advice?

43
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,018
Me? That would be unnecessary.

44
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:04,578
I've never believed in those things meant to trick the mind.

45
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,600
Furthermore, the more I look at you, the more I think you are like...

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,799
...like a swindler!

47
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,500
Feng Yuan!

48
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,180
You dare slander Master Ning?

49
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,339
There are plenty of people who know Master Ning's name.

50
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,518
Everyone in Jianghu is trying to impersonate him.

51
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,198
Looking at this guy, he is most likely in his early 20s.

52
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,759
It's obvious with one glance that he's a swindler.

53
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,339
What do you know? This is called looking healthy and young despite being older.

54
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,959
The two of you should stop arguing.

55
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,259
Why does it matter if it is real or not?

56
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,139
Hurry and go rest!

57
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,399
Early tomorrow morning, we still need to count up the rations.

58
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,039
All right, Master Ning.

59
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,979
I won't keep arguing with you only on Master Ning's behalf.

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,620
Hold on.

61
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,200
This matter is concerned with the military counselor's honor.

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,140
There mustn't be negligence.

63
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,678
What do you mean, Hero?

64
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:14,699
Isn't what Hero meant clear? Whether the Master is real or not can be determined by a test.

65
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,479
Testing him? How?

66
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,518
That's easy. As long as he can figure out my origin, life experiences,

67
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:24,299
and my family background, I'll believe that he is the real Master Ning.

68
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,799
What if you deliberately make things difficult by not admitting the truth

69
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,939
even if Master Ning correctly answered?

70
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,900
That's also easy to handle. I shall write down my life information beforehand,

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,139
so it would suffice if he is able to say exactly what's on the paper.

72
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,879
Excellent!

73
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,320
Come inside.

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,580
[ My last name is Feng and name Yuan. My courtesy name is Wen Quan...]

75
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,539
Please have a look, Hero.

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,400
Military counselor, please go ahead.

77
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,899
Master Ning.

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,578
What's wrong? You are unable to figure it out?

79
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,139
How about you go outside to look at the star configurations?

80
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,460
Look at the lines on my palm?

81
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,519
Swindler!

82
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,400
It's not that I can't figure it out,

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,678
it's just you have a very enriching past.

84
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:17,079
If I say too little, those two wouldn't dare believe me.

85
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,360
If I say too much,

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,839
I am afraid that you will lose face.

87
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,440
There will be no harm in what you say.

88
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,239
Then I am sorry for offending you.

89
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,599
Your last name is Feng and name Yuan. Your courtesy name is Wen Quan.

90
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,638
You originally were a herbal businessman in Wu Du city.

91
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,219
It was because when you were eight, your father was infected by a drug addiction, so your family fortunes started to decline.

92
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,319
Your mother had no other choice but to bring you Jiangning to search for your Uncle.

93
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,339
However, the debt collectors started to go after you again, encircling and intercepting along the way.

94
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,198
You were unable to return home, so you lived in the study room of the school.

95
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,499
If I'm not wrong, on your left chest,

96
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,660
there is a scar left by the branding iron from the debt collectors.

97
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,880
I…

98
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,840
This...

99
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,819
I have never told anyone about this scar.

100
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,940
Unless...

101
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,679
you really are Master Ning?

102
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,878
Master Ning!

103
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,758
Master Ning, please forgive my offenses committed by me with low moral stature.

104
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,338
I told you that you were acting like a snob.

105
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:14,218
Yes, I did. I ask Master Ning to show me the right path.

106
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,478
Master Ning, please give us advice!

107
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,120
Come here, you two.

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,079
Many thanks, Master.

109
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,319
Master Ning, right?

110
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:45,339
Please give me some advice, too.

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,398
Are-Are you sure she-she is a young lady of a noble house?

112
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,599
Can you give me more specific details, Military Counselor?

113
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,379
I am absolutely certain.

114
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,658
This lady is not only from a noble family,

115
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,939
but is also proficient in lute-playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting. (accomplishments of a well-educated person)

116
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:15,878
As for her looks, she is exceedingly beautiful.

117
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:19,600
I will say congratulations to Leader Chen beforehand.

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,179
That... and... I want to ask you how she conducts herself?

119
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,479
Can she do martial arts?

120
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,098
A lady from a noble family, naturally, she is gentle ad cultivated with beauty and intelligence.

121
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:35,440
Why would she practice martial arts, those vulgar sorts of things?

122
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
That's not right.

123
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,300
Why is that so?

124
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Nothing.

125
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,258
I just feel... right? Someone like me whose sword is tainted with blood every day

126
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:58,219
wouldn't be suitable for that kind of girl.

127
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,720
Master, before, when you used geomancy to tell Liu Xigua's fate in marriage.

128
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,579
I thought you were talking nonsense.

129
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,199
But just now that you have shown me the right path in my fate in marriage.

130
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,579
I'm sincerely convinced now.

131
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,679
So… So…

132
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Master, is there a way to avoid this ill-fated relationship?

133
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:28,119
To avoid this ill-fated relationship?

134
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:44,180
When paired with alcohol, the distinctive flavor is even better.

135
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,258
How was it? Is he passed out?

136
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,519
With the five of us working together, why couldn't we outfool him?

137
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,439
What does it have to do with us two?

138
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,958
Let's go, Brother Ning. This is not a place to dawdle. Let's go!

139
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,119
- Wait a moment.
- What is it?

140
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,519
Let's bring them with us, too.

141
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Come on, everybody.

142
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
This way. This way.

143
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Hurry up! Quickly!

144
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
Come on! Keep up.

145
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go. Be careful. Slowly.

146
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Auntie, are you all right?

147
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Quickly, get up. Can you still walk?

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,900
Let's go. Be careful. Come on. Let's go.

149
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,400
Hang in there.

150
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,398
This way.

151
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
Be careful. Slowly.

152
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
Follow the light.

153
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Everyone, we have arrived.

154
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,800
The passage in front of us will take you to a camp for refugees.

155
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
We have to go back to Jiangning.

156
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
So let's say goodbye.

157
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
See you again.

158
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Thank you so much for saving us from him.

159
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,700
We will never forget your kind help.

160
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,100
- You're welcome. Hit the road soon.
- Yes.

161
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,400
Take care. Take this torch.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
- Thank you, hero.

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
- See you.
- Take care.

164
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
See you.

165
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Thank you.

166
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Be careful.

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Did you hear that clearly?

168
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,800
They called us heroes.

169
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
No wonder there are so many people who are ready to help the weak.

170
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Now I have learned how it feels to be a hero.

171
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
It's a pity that there are still so many more people

172
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
like them in Lin'an City.

173
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
It's already good to save some of them.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
You really think of yourself as a hero?

175
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,700
Did you hear that?

176
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Is that from the bandits?

177
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't panic.

178
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,900
What…

179
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,100
Who…

180
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,400
Are you from Lin'an City?

181
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah.

182
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
What-What's the matter?

183
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you have food?

184
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,400
Auntie, even the people in Lin'an City have no food.

185
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
How can we have any?

186
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
We…

187
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
We have.

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Our families are trapped in Lin'an City.

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
The bandits closed the city gate.

190
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,700
We couldn't get in.

191
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,600
Could you please take this food to them?

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
Auntie,

193
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,200
please keep the food for yourself.

194
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
It's impossible for us to find your families

195
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,800
since Lin'an City is in a mess right now.

196
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,000
We couldn't help you with that.

197
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Big brother, please, please save my father.

199
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,600
Big brother, please save my father.

200
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Once the war begins,

201
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,300
only the common people are suffering.

202
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,600
They have no food.

203
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,300
I want to stay and help them.

204
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,700
Kid,

205
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
what did you just say?

206
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Save my father, will you?

207
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
Yes, I will.

208
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Auntie, though we couldn't bring the food to your families,

209
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,000
we could collect grain

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,800
to feed all your families and people in Lin'an City.

211
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
Hero.

212
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Hero,

213
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
we heard you.

214
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
Although we are old and weak,

215
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,800
we can still help with carrying the supplies

216
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,000
and saving the people.

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
So we are not leaving.

218
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
We are not leaving.

219
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Good.

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
It's so noisy! Be quiet.

221
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
My lordship.

222
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm coming.

223
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
Are you awake, my Lordship?

224
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Nonsense!

225
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,300
If I'm not awaken by the loud noise outside, I'd be a dead pig.

226
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,800
What happened? Say it!

227
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,900
My lordship, there are some people out there demanding us

228
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
to open the granary.

229
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,700
Saying they want to deliver food to Lin'an City.

230
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
Lin'an City?

231
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, no.

232
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
It must be the bandits!

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Good.

234
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Let me kill them all.

235
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,700
My lordship, they are not bandits.

236
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
Not bandits?

237
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,300
Then, who could they be?

238
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,900
Please go out and have a look.

239
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,400
[County Goverment]

240
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Silence.

241
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
They really are the weak and the old.

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes.

243
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Make way!

244
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,700
Don't hurt them.

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Seniors, neighbors, please calm down.

246
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
You want food, right?

247
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Adviser, go get some food from the granary and give it to them.

248
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes, my lordship.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's far from enough for all of us.

250
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
How much do you need, then?

251
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
The world changed all of a sudden.

252
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
People are suffering.

253
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Food is what we need.

254
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
We need 500 tonnes of grain.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
How much?

256
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
500 tonnes?

257
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
Are you crazy?

258
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,500
We don't even have that much in our granary.

259
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
Yes, what you say is true.

260
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,000
You don't have that in your granary.

261
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
You can ask for food from door to door.

262
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
You don't have that much in your town.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You can borrow from other towns.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
I don't care how you will collect it.

265
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Before the sun rises, I want to see it done

266
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
at the shabby house on that crossroad.

267
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
How dare you!

268
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,600
How mischievous!

269
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
You disobedient young man,

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,700
how dare you show up at my door, and talk wildly.

271
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,200
500 tonnes.

272
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Yes, I don't have that much.

273
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,500
But even if I did, tell me, why should I give it to you?

274
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Because of this.

275
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,600
- This?
- This?

276
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
Look.

277
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
It works.

278
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
I see.

279
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,199
He wants to kill me.

280
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,600
Guards, take him down.

281
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Stop! Stop!

282
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,800
You-You'd better have a closer look at this.

283
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Yeah, I did.

284
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
It's nothing but a concealed weapon.

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you really think you can kill me using that?

286
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is not a concealed weapon.

287
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
This dagger belongs to Minister Qin Siyuan.

288
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Qin-Qin Siyuan? Who's that?

289
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Minister?

290
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,900
What's his official rank? Is it higher than mine?

291
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,400
Open your eyes and look at it!

292
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,300
Do you know him?

293
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Higher than mine?

294
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,300
My lordship.

295
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
Get off him.

296
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,500
We, Three Towns of Lin'an, will spare no efforts in

297
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,400
gathering the grain as soon as possible.

298
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
- Great.
- Great.

299
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,400
Hurry up.

300
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,100
Move quickly.

301
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Hurry up.

302
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,100
Your Lordship, how about the progress now?

303
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
According to my estimation,

304
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
there are over 300 liters here.

305
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
300 tonnes?

306
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,200
We still need 200 more.

307
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
Go. Follow up.

308
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,500
Your Lordship, the food from the two towns nearby has arrived.

309
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
Here it comes.

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Hurry up.

311
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,138
Where is Ning Yi?

312
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,000
- Where is Ning Yi?
- Here!

313
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,220
What's going on here?

314
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,078
Take a look.

315
00:22:15,078 --> 00:22:19,079
There are 1,000 liters of food, with none missing. There are also some fruit and vegetables as well.

316
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,319
Those should be enough for the Lin'an people for a while.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,160
I actually fell asleep?

318
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,018
Yeah. Isn't that a good thing?

319
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:30,100
It means that you have a healthy body and nothing you are worrying about.

320
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,440
That's not what I mean.

321
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,838
It doesn't matter what you mean.

322
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,319
When we return to the camp, if the Ladyship asks about this,

323
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,039
you will definitely also get a share of the credit.

324
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,759
Military Counselor is really generous!

325
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,238
But… I still don't know how you prepared so much grain in just one night.

326
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,740
You must not ask.

327
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,459
This matter is just like your fate in marriage.

328
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:53,299
It was originally fate dictated by the heavens. How can it be changed by mere mortals?

329
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,159
It's just that you met me, a Master.

330
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,499
If this matter is disclosed, it would stop working.

331
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,719
Master must have reasons for doing what you do.

332
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,958
All right. That... if anyone asks about it when we get back,

333
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,158
you have to keep it a secret for me. I wouldn't want more problems to arise.

334
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,939
Master, rest assured. I will not say a word.

335
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:12,139
Let's go. Look how far they have gone already.

336
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,918
- Look at you.
- I feel a little dizzy.

337
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:16,419
See, your sleep made you all muddled up.

338
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,319
Brother Fan, these brothers of mine have also helped a lot.

339
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,619
Don't let them sleep in prison. Find them a nice room they can settle down in.

340
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,119
- Of course, you can count on me.
- Go and unload the carts.

341
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,878
- Okay!
- Okay!

342
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,659
Military counselor is back. Leader Dabiao has been waiting for you.

343
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:38,820
Hurry and go in!

344
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,098
Okay. It's up to you now.

345
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,439
I won't go. I'm too tired from not sleeping for a whole night.

346
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,018
I'll take a bath and go to sleep.

347
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:46,918
- This?
- What this? Didn't you hear?

348
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,299
Military counselor wants to bathe. Hurry and have someone heat up some water.

349
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,019
- What?
- No need for what.

350
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,218
- Brother Chen Fan.
- Brother Chen Fan.

351
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:56,759
That's right, also for these four brothers, go find a room for them to settle down in.

352
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,239
Let's go.

353
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,939
My performance?

354
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,790
[Domineering Camp]

355
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,818
At that moment, I used the move, "White Crane Spreads its Wing" (Tai Chi Move) to protect the Military Counselor.

356
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:12,540
Because I know if I retreated even a half step back

357
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,658
those soldiers would surely start to swarm around and kill us on the spot.

358
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:18,179
During this point of the difficult time,

359
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,358
you could only hear my shout as I pulled my sword out and charged into the enemy's camp.

360
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:25,040
In that split second, the heaven and earth changed its color and the stars and the moon visibly moved.

361
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,838
I was like a tiger in a flock of sheep.

362
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,759
I killed to the point where the enemy was defeated and dispersed.

363
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,119
Speaking of this, at that time it was a near escape from death.

364
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,220
Luckily, however, in the end I used every thing I learned in my life

365
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,818
and risking my life, opened the granary.

366
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:46,099
That was how I brought back the whole amount of 1,000 liters of grain.

367
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,739
What exactly were you jabbering about?

368
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,860
Did you go to collect the grain or to steal it?

369
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,159
I admit. I did act impulsively at the time.

370
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,740
However, in a lifetime it is hard to come by these kinds of fights.

371
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,918
At this time of calamity, only by putting one's all into the fight can a slim chance of survival be gained.

372
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,319
Leader Chen is so amazing!

373
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,460
Then according to what you said, you must have been surrounded by perils last night.

374
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,599
Then, why do you look so tidy right now? Even your hair is still all neat and tidy.

375
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,619
This... This... Well this...

376
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:20,120
Just forget it. You can stop your fabricating.

377
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,438
Where is the military counselor? Bring him over. I'll ask him.

378
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:26,918
Reporting to Leader, we just heated water for him to take a bath. He should be sleeping now.

379
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:28,579
Taking a bath?

380
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:31,678
He still has the ability to take a bath? Bring him to me now!

381
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,560
Wait.

382
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,999
Military Counselor has been busy all night long. He has finally, with great difficulty, time to rest.

383
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,219
Let him have a peaceful sleep.

384
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,759
Since when did you start caring about him?

385
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,239
Military Counselor and I in any case are brothers who fought a war with our lives together.

386
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:49,419
It is natural for brothers to look after one another.

387
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,698
Anyway, Military Counselor normally works hard without complaint.

388
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:57,119
Not only does he help review documents for you, but he is also in charge of large and small matters of the camp.

389
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm not blaming you,

390
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,050
but Dabiao, as a leader, you should be more sympathetic towards your subordinates.

391
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:04,318
Military Counselor is someone who should only care about major issues.

392
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,820
We shouldn't be bothering him with these trivial and minor matters.

393
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,719
What exactly happened last night?

394
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:17,299
I'm only talking about this one matter as it stands. Don't think I'm favoring him.

395
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,840
Leader,

396
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:23,998
the grains have all been sorted and counted. They are ready to be distributed at any time.

397
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:27,418
What are you waiting for, Dabiao? Hurry and set up some stands outside the camp to distribute the grains.

398
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,219
No, we can't!

399
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,719
If we distribute the grains so brazenly,

400
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:35,819
I'm afraid Bao Wenhan will take the grain before the common people receive them.

401
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,620
Then, what should we do?

402
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,639
It's grain! Grain!

403
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,340
Grain!

404
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,459
Thank you, Heroes!

405
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:20,939
- Thank you!
- So good!

406
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,019
- Thank you!
- This is grain!

407
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:06,419
Oh, shoot! I've slept for so long that there's a time difference now.

408
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:13,579
Forget it. I will go eat some breakfast.

409
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,079
Gao Qiu?

410
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,118
It wasn't me! I-I only took a steamed bun.

411
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,380
What are you doing here?

412
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,919
I…

413
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,639
What happened?

414
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,459
Didn't I let Chen Fan arrange rooms for you?

415
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:27,118
Rooms to live in were arranged. There was no arrangement for food.

416
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,139
When we lived in prison before, at least we had a meal to eat with some diced meat.

417
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:37,281
But now, there's not enough for the four of us to share a pot of porridge.

418
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:40,459
I'm sorry. Sorry. I was too tired.

419
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:44,140
When I get up tomorrow, I'll treat everyone to a nice meal.

420
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,078
Brother Feng, hurry up and eat. Otherwise, the rest of us will finish this pot of porridge.

421
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,779
Hurry and eat!

422
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,638
I suddenly thought of the pot of bird's nest porridge my wife personally made me.

423
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:02,398
That time, I kept complaining about this and that.

424
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,040
Now that I think about it, I never did anything respectable, but anger her.

425
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,878
I don't know how she's doing now.

426
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,619
Is she worrying about me?

427
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:15,380
Brother Feng, after this grain matter is dealt with,

428
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,480
let's all return to Jiangning.

429
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:23,340
These days, I am also in a sort of trance.

430
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,180
Sometimes, I feel that Tan'er is right next to me.

431
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,119
She smiles at me.

432
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,419
She calls my name.

433
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,559
I also have that feeling.

434
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,300
She also called your name?

435
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,039
No. I hear my wife calling my name.

436
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,399
That shouldn't be.

437
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,419
Weren't the feelings between the two of you...

438
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:52,099
You don't understand.

439
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,800
For some matters, you only know to cherish when you have lost it.

440
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,480
Recalling those years, I used to argue with my wife every day.

441
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,060
Now my ears are experiencing peace and quiet,

442
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,280
but... I have also started missing those days of arguing.

443
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,320
Stop thinking about it.

444
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,038
Based on how annoyed your wife was of you, she probably has already remarried.

445
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,320
No, you–

446
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,658
Or-Or perhaps she thought you were dead and remarried.

447
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,159
You–

448
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,959
No, I must go back to find my wife.

449
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:49,359
- I want to go back! I must go back to find my wife!
- Brother Li. Brother Li.

450
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,779
We only have enough grain for ten days.

451
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:53,758
If we leave, what should the common people of Lin'an City do?

452
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,859
What can we do if we stay?

453
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:59,599
We can save them for a while, but not a life time.

454
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,480
Since we decided to return, wasn't it because we wanted to offer even a meager bit of help?

455
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,420
I understand these reasons. I understand them all.

456
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,079
But… this matter ultimately is all the fault of these bandits.

457
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,999
Fang Tianlei, you bastard…

458
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,919
- Brother Li!
- Brother Li!

459
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,640
We are on other people's land.

460
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:28,200
I miss my wife!

461
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:34,440
My wife! My wife!

462
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
My wife!

463
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,800
My wife!

464
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,000
There actually is such a remarkably beautiful woman in this world.

465
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
If I can have you,

466
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,800
I will have no regrets in my life.

467
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,400
Greetings, Leader.

468
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Did you find the person on the portrait?

469
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Not yet.

470
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,600
I have another matter to report.

471
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Go on.

472
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,200
Three days ago, the amount of our grain sold has greatly reduced.

473
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Until today, we have actually not sold a single bit of grain.

474
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
What is going on?

475
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,100
I have no idea.

476
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,200
I've already sent someone to investigate.

477
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,198
It's been three days!

478
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,600
It has been three days and you still don't know why.

479
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,800
Hurry and go investigate! See who is behind all of this.

480
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Yes!

481
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
Did I scare you?

482
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,300
Military Counselor!

483
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,800
Why didn't you tell me that you were awake?

484
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I just woke up.

485
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,600
What's this?

486
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,900
What? I can't eat it?

487
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,500
Why would I stop Your Ladyship from eating?

488
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,198
Get another bowl.

489
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Your Ladyship, it's a hot summer day.

490
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,100
You came all the way here just to eat my free meal?

491
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,300
You are finally willing to return it to me.

492
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,400
I've wanted to return it to you a while back.

493
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,800
But I can only give you enough gun powder to defend yourself.

494
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,900
There are camp rules.

495
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
All right! As long as there's enough to use.

496
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,600
Thank you, my Ladyship.

497
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,100
That's right, I had someone calculate

498
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,600
that the amount of grain you brought back

499
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,200
can only solve the problem for a short while.

500
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,400
There are too many refugees in Lin'an City.

501
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
I am afraid we can't hold on for too long.

502
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,800
So, I wanted to discuss with you to see if there is any other way to collect more grain.

503
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
There's not.

504
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,100
All the grain from the towns nearby are here.

505
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,300
For a short period of time, we can't find any.

506
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
I also know.

507
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,700
That's why I'm worried.

508
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,600
I was the one who conquered Lin'an City.

509
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Even though it wasn't my intention,

510
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm indeed responsible for the refugees here.

511
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,200
Do you understand what I am saying?

512
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Military Counselor.

513
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes, I do.

514
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
All right, stop worrying about it.

515
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,800
I'll think of ways to deal with the grain problem.

516
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,200
Thanks.

517
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Why are you still so polite with me, your Ladyship?

518
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,000
Stop calling me 'your Ladyship' in the future.

519
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Why?

520
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,400
Because it sounds no different from calling me "Princess".

521
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,200
There is a pretty big difference.

522
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,600
You may call me Liu Dabiao. Dabiao is also fine.

523
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,300
If you don't want to call me that, I have a nickname, Liu Xigua.

524
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,800
If you want to call me Xigua,

525
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
I wouldn't mind it too much.

526
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,400
As long as you are not my enemy, I can tolerate anything.

527
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,000
Because you truly are a capable person.

528
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,200
All right, I will trouble you with the matter of collecting grain.

529
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,400
When you think of a reward, tell me.

530
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,600
I don't need any reward,

531
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,100
Dabiao.

532
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,800
When you are in the camp, don't call my name out so loudly.

533
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I am, at the very least, your leader.

534
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
I still need to save face.

535
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
I understand,

536
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Dabiao.

537
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
You're here.
[Xuan Wei Camp]

538
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,400
Leader,

539
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,200
I've found out the reason.

540
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,600
Turns out there are people distributing grain to the masses.

541
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Who?

542
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,600
They should be from Badao Camp.

543
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Liu Dabiao?

544
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,200
Leader, what should we do now?

545
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,900
Should we lower the price of our grain?

546
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,400
No.

547
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Since she has such a kind heart, I will let her distribute it.

548
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,300
Let's see how long she can do this.

549
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,000
Holy Master, I've finally finished a thousand guns

550
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,600
through seven days of supervision.

551
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,500
With these firearms,

552
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,700
we can attack and seize cities with repeated victory.

553
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,400
After we finish training the soldiers, we should start our departure.

554
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm so sick of this place.

555
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,200
Where are we going for our next station?

556
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Are we going to Xinwu or directly straight to Jiangning?

557
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,000
Don't ask what you shouldn't know.

558
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Where can we examine the goods?

559
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,400
We're here.

560
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
We rematched the weight

561
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
so it's easier to hold it.

562
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
The fuse has also been improved.

563
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The trigger is much quicker.

564
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
- Zheng Biao.
- Here.

565
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Reward him.

566
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Yes.

567
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,600
The Wu Dynasty possessed such a large powder magazine,

568
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
but it was only used to build artillery,

569
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
those cumbersome playthings.

570
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,500
Their ideas are too outdated.

571
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,000
In the future, the battleground will definitely be dominated with light weapons.

572
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Possessing these abrupt firelocks means we have an army that is invincible.

573
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
- Fang Qiong.
- Here.

574
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,300
Distribute these to all the camps starting tomorrow.

575
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,200
Get ready for training.

576
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,800
Yes.

577
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,400
Old Mister, if we change this into a curved handle,

578
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,200
won't it be easier to hold?

579
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Holy Master excels much more greatly

580
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,000
at constructing weapons than I do.

581
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,800
You see. You really are able to talk well.

582
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,300
You were so blindly stubborn in the beginning.

583
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,500
Holy Master,

584
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,600
I have one more weapon that I'd like to show you.

585
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,800
There's one more?

586
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
Hurry and let me see.

587
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Holy Master, please go ahead.

588
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
Older Brother, be careful of any tricks!

589
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,500
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask

♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫
