[My Heroic Husband]

2
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,810
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,699
- What's your type?
-Wind!

4
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,630
The wind is too strong!

5
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,800
My cloth will be blown away!

6
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,219
Tenderness!

7
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,480
Could he be a wind type?

8
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,400
How dare you deceive us?

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,759
Where's the money? Give it to us!

10
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,999
Get out! I don't need your help!

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,119
My lord, why do we have to pay again?

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,639
Didn't you just rob us when you came here?

13
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,479
Again, our family was the first to sign the surrender statement that day at the execution ground

14
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,859
and we voluntarily surrendered.

15
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,979
Cut it out!

16
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:40,999
Our Leader Bao said that all the stores that have surrendered

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,359
must pay 10,000 taels of silver each month!

18
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,719
No bargaining!

19
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,738
Plus, aren't you merchants by the royal?

20
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,579
And you own the largest cloth store in Lin'an.

21
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,720
I know you can afford it!

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,519
My lord, all our money has been taken away by you!

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,079
We really don't have any right now!

24
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,298
No money, huh?

25
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,358
Good!

26
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:04,758
Then pay with your goods!

27
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,459
Guys! Take all the cloths away!

28
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,781
Don't! Please!

29
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:11,360
Please! Don't touch the cloth!

30
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,018
From today on, this cloth store will be closed!

31
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,239
I'll give you another five days.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,500
If you still can't get the silver ready by then,

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,840
we won't be as kind as this time!

34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,200
Get up!

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,500
Tell me the truth!

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,719
Do you still have any silver?

37
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,878
Brother, our store has been looted!

38
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,959
My expenses have always been managed by you.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,399
I don't have any money!

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,779
You rubbish!

41
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,519
Aren't you good at doing business?

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,600
Hurry and think of a solution!

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,380
Listen! I don't care even if you should beg on the street! Just get me the money!

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,560
Father.

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
Let's go!

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,518
Hurry! Move!

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,598
Line up! Side by side! Line up!

48
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,078
Line up and let our Leader take a look at you!

49
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,479
Line up!

50
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,819
Leader!

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,380
Common looking!

52
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,559
All faded beauties!

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,659
Leader, it's the fourth batch today.

54
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,339
Why don't you just pick one

55
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,040
and make do for today?

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,740
Make do?

57
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,280
You want me to make do?

58
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,719
Look! Have a look!

59
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,819
Which one I can make do with?

60
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,079
Which one? I'm asking you!

61
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,959
Which one do you think can I make do with?

62
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Leader!

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,460
The girl who stood there just now!

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,878
Did you see her? The one that just ran away!

65
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,719
Get her back for me!

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,918
Get her back or I'll kill yourself! Now!

67
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,140
Move! Come on!

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,340
Get out!

69
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,119
Where did she go?

70
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,119
Keep looking! Come on!

71
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,179
Your Ladyship! Your Ladyship!

72
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:18,060
After I helped you get rid of Young Master Dou last time,

73
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,479
your auntie gave me a lot of men's birth dates.

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,539
She asked me to find out if any of them

75
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,579
are a wind type that would be the perfect match with you.

76
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,899
Look. I have to help you review the documents

77
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,039
and now I also work as a part-time fortune teller.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,479
I'm really up to my ears!

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
What match?

80
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,659
None of your business!

81
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,439
Just tell my auntie

82
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,979
that all men of wind type are dead！

83
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,879
Don't sound so absolute.

84
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,198
What is wind type, anyway?

85
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,280
It's been windless these days.

86
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,379
It's all because of the blind date.

87
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,100
To prevent my aunt from forcing me, he made up a story to trick her.

88
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,620
That's great!

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,799
All right, I'll deal with it myself in the future.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,159
I won't make it difficult for you again.

91
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,320
When I go back, I'll tell my aunt that I don't want to meet those ugly men anymore!

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,679
That's great, Your Ladyship!

93
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
Can you write me a note?

94
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,479
Why do you bring a brush with you?

95
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,398
What can I say?

96
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,920
I was born to be thoughtful. I always offer timely help.

97
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,159
So weird!

98
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,638
It's a sunny day! Why are you using an umbrella?

99
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,799
The sun is scorching.

100
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,838
Thanks to my thoughtfulness, I brought this oil-paper umbrella

101
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,700
to protect you from getting sunburn!

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,760
You must be out of your mind!

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,400
Go on! Keep going!

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,159
You are thoughtful, right?

105
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,860
You recognize that!

106
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,758
This handkerchief alone isn't enough to prove my thoughtfulness.

107
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,758
But the shredded ice can be stronger proof.

108
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,679
Come and wipe your sweat.

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,919
Then have some shredded ice to cool down.

110
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,758
Chen Fan, what's wrong with you today?

111
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,278
Just go back if you are drunk!

112
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,318
Don't bother me here!

113
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,819
Go back! Go back!

114
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,359
Wait!

115
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,599
Go back!

116
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,838
It's not our problem.

117
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,639
It's hers!

118
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,758
Just go back first.

119
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,779
I'll figure it out for you!

120
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,479
Go back! Go!

121
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,878
Leader! According to your instruction,

122
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,799
we've posted notices in all the streets and 48 alleys.

123
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,738
How's their response?

124
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:54,439
At first, people got quite panicked.

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,518
But as time went by,

126
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,500
they found that our Ba Dao Camp is very disciplined.

127
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,439
So, they are all relieved now and have gone back to their normal life.

128
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,959
How's the food supply in town?

129
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,479
Well… Xuanwei Camp has always been in charge of the granary.

130
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,559
I still don't know about the details.

131
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,339
Okay!

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,918
I got some cloth the other day when I searched the local government.

133
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,239
Distribute them to the refugees.

134
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Yes!

135
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,719
Your Ladyship, though you are quite young,

136
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,199
you do care about the people here!

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,419
Of course!

138
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,299
While water can carry a boat, it can also overturn it.

139
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm the one with a grand plan after all.

140
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,419
What the heck?

141
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,160
Give me a hard time, huh?

142
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,939
Neither tenderness nor toughness works!

143
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,900
How on earth can I make you satisfied?

144
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,079
Why are you still eating?

145
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,020
It's all because of your sh*tty idea!

146
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,399
Thoughtfulness?

147
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,719
I've never seen you being thoughtful!

148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,999
Come on!

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,558
You can't blame it on me!

150
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,918
I asked you to be thoughtful.

151
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,120
I didn't ask you to lick her boots!

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,179
You should pay attention to your ways.

153
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,138
The timing!

154
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,579
What timing?

155
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,719
I won't listen to your crap again!

156
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,419
Chen Fan! Grab your weapon and follow me!

157
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,239
Where to?

158
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,558
To Xuanwei Camp to rob the food!

159
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,900
Go and get all our people!

160
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,040
All of them! Grab the weapon!

161
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,758
- Okay! Let's go!
- Let's go rob the food!

162
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,359
Come on!

163
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,220
What did you forget?

164
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,959
Hurry, go and get it!

165
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,278
Don't worry about me!

166
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,679
I-I'm cleaning up the kitchen, and then I'll go back for sleep.

167
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,858
Do you need me to wait for you? Or I'll just lock the door.

168
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:23,159
Would you like to eat something in the night? Some night snacks, like noodles.

169
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,520
Well…

170
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,320
I think I'll stay here.

171
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,720
I only studied when I was little.

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,780
I've never fought with anyone.

173
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,340
Don't! No.

174
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,739
I-I'm not used to being made fun of.

175
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:42,879
Please don't make fun of me!

176
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,739
Come on! So, you aren't used to being made fun of, either?

177
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,559
What-What are you doing?

178
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,939
I'm good staying here!

179
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,259
I can't fight.

180
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,399
You'll be protected.

181
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,979
No need!

182
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
It's quite safe here!

183
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,920
Do you like holding onto the pillar?

184
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,358
Brother Fan! Brother Fan!

185
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,699
What are you doing now?

186
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,919
I don't think it's necessary.

187
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,999
I'm sorry. But if you run away, no one can afford to be responsible for it.

188
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,819
I would never do that!

189
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,558
Think about it! When did I ever do that?

190
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,759
All I did was for…

191
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,639
Let me go!

192
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,800
Is this all the food we've got for today?

193
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,919
Help!

194
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,599
Let us go!

195
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,900
We are really Leader Fang's appointed servants!

196
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,420
We are not escaped prisoners!

197
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,379
Looks like that Heroine Fang doesn't have much influence here.

198
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,000
It's not working!

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,399
I think you are right.

200
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,959
It's all your fault, Feng Yuan!

201
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,459
You encouraged us to come to Lin'an and open new stores.

202
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,699
Yet we did not. Instead, we've been put in jail twice!

203
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,860
Are you serious, Li Pin?

204
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,419
How can you blame me?

205
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,260
If you hadn't asked us to run away from Leader Fang,

206
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,160
we could have had a nice life!

207
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
Why should we run away?

208
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,020
- So, you want to live with those bandits?
- But now at least we can–

209
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,100
Stop arguing!

210
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,920
Actually, both of you have nothing to do with it.

211
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,880
If somebody has to take the blame,

212
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,779
it should be Ning Yi.

213
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,159
Correct! That's right!

214
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,599
This shameless guy surrendered!

215
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,699
He's such a disgrace among

216
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,500
our matrilocal husbands in Jiangning!

217
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,079
But as far as I'm concerned, guys,

218
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,740
I don't think Ning Yi looks like a traitor.

219
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,520
When we were climbing over the wall, he was together with us!

220
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,240
Pah! He's the Counselor of those bandits!

221
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,719
How can you defend him? People's hearts are incomprehensible, Feng Yuan! You–

222
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,979
We were all fooled by that bastard!

223
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,000
Will you all stop fighting?

224
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,899
The priority right now is to get us out of this prison.

225
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,120
Drill through this wall!

226
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,218
This is our only chance to get out! We have no other choice!

227
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,520
- What are you doing?
- Get away!

228
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Get out of here if you don't have money!

229
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:13,959
Thank you!

230
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,459
Thank you!

231
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,459
My lord, please help us!

232
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,539
- Please give me some food, Mister!
- Get out!

233
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:22,799
- My lord! My lord!
- Please help me! My lord!

234
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,838
- Get out of my face!
- Help me, please! My lord!

235
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:25,579
Get away!

236
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,079
- My lord!
- This-This is mine!

237
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,579
My Lord!

238
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,640
Get lost!

239
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,540
Come on!

240
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,100
Let's go! Hurry!

241
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,579
Whoever dares to steal the grain will end up just like him!

242
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,778
- Don't…
- Really?

243
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:05,039
What if I have to steal?

244
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,000
Leader Liu, what are you trying to do?

245
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
Let's do it!

246
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,019
Leader!

247
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,000
Leader!

248
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Get out of my way!

249
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,040
Leader!

250
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,780
She was going to cut my throat!

251
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,239
Liu Da Biao,

252
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,639
what's wrong?

253
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,139
Your Ba Dao Camp is out of food or what?

254
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:22,960
Why do you come to our Xuanwei Camp to steal our food?

255
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,260
How about this?

256
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,419
You can give up your military leadership

257
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,599
and hand Ba Dao Camp over to me.

258
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,640
I promise I'll feed them and treat your men very well!

259
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
So?

260
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,040
Should I kick you out of here

261
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,380
or let the Holy Master ask you to leave?

262
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,120
It's your choice!

263
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,659
They are all gone?

264
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,400
Feng Yuan!

265
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
I think you should forget it. Stop drilling!

266
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,319
By the time you drill through it, those bandits will be dead!

267
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,418
Shut your mouth! You are the one who asked me to drill!

268
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:13,279
Constant drilling can even make a hole in an iron wall!

269
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,739
Shush! Shush!

270
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,558
- Why are you here?
- Guys, hurry! Hurry!

271
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,119
The bandits are all out!

272
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,320
It's the best chance to get out of here! I still need to go find Tan'er!

273
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,010
Come on! Hurry up!

274
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,419
What are you doing, Li Pin?

275
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,910
What am I doing? You are now their Counselor!

276
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,790
You betrayed your friends for your own sake!

277
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,860
That was just my makeshift plan.

278
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,639
If I hadn't done that, they would've killed me already!

279
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:55,759
What do you mean?

280
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,899
I don't have the time to explain! Just hurry! They'll be back soon!

281
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,358
Brother Li, I don't think he's lying. I trust Brother Ning.

282
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:02,979
Even if he's telling a lie, I don't want to stay here anymore!

283
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:05,339
- Yes! That's right!
- Wait! Hold on!

284
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,358
Are you telling the truth?

285
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,370
If I were lying, why would I come here to help you?

286
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,820
They'll be back soon! Come on!

287
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,860
Hurry! Hurry up! Let's go!

288
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,200
I'll only trust you one more time!

289
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
If you lie to us again, I won't forgive you!

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,980
Go now!

291
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,039
But they hooted us out!

292
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,979
You criminal!

293
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,019
Hadn't I found out, you would've escaped!

294
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,519
Don't just stand there! They are running away!

295
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,939
Running away?

296
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:50,359
We are not! Seriously!

297
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,160
How dare you run away? You bastard!

298
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,319
You bastard! You will be my enemy from now! I…

299
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,258
- Don't hit us!
- Beat them up!

300
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,159
Didn't I tell you before?

301
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,480
The prison is the most important place in the camp.

302
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,000
No matter what you do, you need to have someone watch the prison.

303
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,620
If it hadn't been me, they would've escaped already!

304
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,639
Yes! You are right, Counselor!

305
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,279
The cell was pretty solid.

306
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,119
How did they get out?

307
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,660
Where's your leader?

308
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,700
Tell her the prison needs to be reinforced!

309
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,940
How dare you run away? Beat them up!

310
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,839
Ning Yi, I won't forgive you!

311
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,281
Running away?

312
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,480
You… You…

313
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,338
Running? Bastard!

314
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,400
Stop hitting us! We won't do it anymore!

315
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,179
Who broke out the prison?

316
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,819
Ning Yi.

317
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,700
Liu Xi Gua, do you see this?

318
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,079
It was cut so neatly!

319
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,959
But I tied him up like that yet he still managed to cut it!

320
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,300
Our Counselor has become more capable now!

321
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,439
I think you've become more capable!

322
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:24,519
You've just had a conflict with Bao Wen Han's people this morning.

323
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,940
Even Holy Master knew it.

324
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,039
And you still went to rob their grain at night!

325
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,420
Of course, they'd be on guard!

326
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,359
Besides, robbing the grain is such a severe matter.

327
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,078
You should discuss it with me first.

328
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:39,340
Am I still your Counselor?

329
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,158
You brought a bunch of idiots, smashing their door and running right inside,

330
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:45,199
and you even rushed in from the front gate!

331
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,358
I'm really speechless!

332
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,039
Are you really the ones who took down Lin'an City?

333
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,540
What do you know? You weren't there!

334
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,878
You have nothing but sarcastic comments!

335
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:56,239
I wouldn't go there even if you asked me to!

336
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,778
Moreover, you tied me up like that. Where could I go?

337
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,358
I couldn't go at all!

338
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:04,000
You know why I tied you up! This isn't the first time.

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,439
No matter how many times it's been, they all prove that I was innocent

340
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:09,999
and you were stupid!

341
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:11,598
Especially this time!

342
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,759
Chen Fan, do you have any idea what you were doing?

343
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,399
You were wasting our opportunities! Speed is critical in war!

344
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,118
I already knew it when I was home alone.

345
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:22,239
I just knew that you'd be ambushed this time!

346
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,158
So I wanted to go and help you out!

347
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:26,819
Luckily, Bao Wen Han just gave you a deterrent.

348
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,220
If he really hurt Her Ladyship,

349
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,179
what am I supposed to do?

350
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,978
I can't argue with you!

351
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:39,680
All right, then let me ask you.

352
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,639
Where did you go?

353
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:44,039
I heard that you went to the prison!

354
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,318
Oh, come on!

355
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:48,379
It makes me even angrier since you brought that up!

356
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,679
Chen Fan, what on earth have you done in Lin'an City?

357
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,239
You should be in charge of security and patrol, right?

358
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:59,439
Shouldn't you be held accountable for any escaped prisoners?

359
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:05,040
I stopped four escaped prisoners and brought them to justice,

360
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,959
and you should have dealt with this!

361
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,918
If you don't trust me, just ask them!

362
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:12,400
Ask A Life for a Life Gang if what I said is true!

363
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,959
- It is true!
- Yes!

364
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:17,839
- Counselor Ning even asked us to reinforce the prison and change the lock!
- Exactly!

365
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

366
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,298
Counselor is really good!

367
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:23,698
That's enough!

368
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:25,299
We beat them up!

369
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,060
Untie him! Do it now!

370
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,539
Hurry!

371
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,279
Xi Gua, I really think he…

372
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,699
The granary is under the watch of that jerk Bao Wen Han right now.

373
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,199
There's nothing I can do with him.

374
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:49,599
But if it goes on like this, there will be a severe famine in town,

375
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,619
and the citizens will suffer.

376
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,599
Do you have an idea to help them?

377
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,859
I…

378
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,920
I do!

379
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,619
Don't listen to him! He wants to run away every day! What would he know?

380
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,180
Shut up!

381
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,819
Your Ladyship,

382
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,819
give me a dozen people

383
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,240
and a dozen carts.

384
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,879
I'll bring them outside of the town to collect grain tomorrow night!

385
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,598
I promise I will let the people in Lin'an fill their stomachs

386
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,940
within 10 days!

387
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,539
Great!

388
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,699
As long as you keep your word,

389
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:28,479
I can give you the entire Ba Dao Camp, let alone a dozen of them!

390
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,780
Sha, Ren, Chang, Ming!

391
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,959
Yes!

392
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,679
Call all our fellow brothers over tomorrow!

393
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,358
Let Counselor Ning pick his personnel!

394
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:35,959
Yes!

395
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:39,500
Counselor, go back and have a good sleep tonight!

396
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,180
Okay.

397
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,759
Leader Chen, I'll go back to sleep now.

398
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,560
Would you like

399
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,218
to tie me up again?

400
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:55,319
Chen Fan! Don't you dare tie up my Counselor again!

401
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,880
Don't let me see it again!

402
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,138
Look! It's…It's so big!

403
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:20,559
Come on! Stop crying!

404
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,160
We made a mistake! Sorry!

405
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,980
The wheel mark on my side was left from our jaunting!

406
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,100
I'm 100% sure!

407
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,099
And the one on my side was left from Ning Yi's!

408
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,399
It's true!

409
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,539
Why were they heading to Lin'an City instead of anywhere else?

410
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,040
Who knows?

411
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,240
Did they have to do this just for a honeymoon?

412
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,479
Son, it's not right!

413
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,838
We need to keep going following the wheel marks!

414
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:28,179
Father, are you out of your mind?

415
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,660
It'll lead us right into the enemy's home!

416
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,020
Think about it!

417
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,220
All the places marked on the map were wrong!

418
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,158
The map says that this road leads to Lin'an.

419
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,839
So, it means this can't be the way leading to Lin'an!

420
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,119
What are you worried about?

421
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,039
It makes sense, father!

422
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,118
Father, then let's… Let's go!

423
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,878
Let's go! Come on.

424
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,520
Be careful, father!

425
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,270
[Lou Manor]

426
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,500
My home!

427
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,480
My home!

428
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Father! Look who this is!

429
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,240
-Isn't this…
- Yes! It's Shu Wan!

430
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,439
You know what?

431
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,459
The bandits are looking for her all over the city!

432
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:41,980
I heard that the bandit leader Bao Wen Han is sweet on her!

433
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,199
If we give Shu Wan to him, I'm sure we'll be highly rewarded!

434
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:49,360
We can not only be freed from the heavy levies,

435
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,440
but also get to reopen our cloth store!

436
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,320
What do you think?

437
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,618
Not good! None of them is useful!

438
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,600
What?

439
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,700
No! No! I… I just…

440
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,318
These guys are the best I have in my Ba Dao Camp!

441
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:36,700
They have gone through hell and back with me!

442
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,540
They are even capable of conquering several bandit camps,

443
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,938
not to mention collecting grain!

444
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:42,818
- Right?
-Yes!

445
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:44,439
You see?

446
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,059
Over here! Over here!

447
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,918
Your Ladyship. You said it yourself.

448
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,859
We're collecting grain, not robbing it.

449
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,719
When a group of tough guys like them

450
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:04,699
show up in front of the citizens, even if the citizens wanted to help us, they'd be too scared to do it.

451
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:08,619
Besides, they are quite eye-catching.

452
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:10,899
It's too obvious to see they are bandits.

453
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:12,918
The soldiers will recognize them right away.

454
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:16,480
What if they were arrested right after they got out of the camp?

455
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,080
Makes sense!

456
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,239
So, what should we do?

457
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,730
I think…

458
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,910
I think You can just leave it to me.

459
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,458
Fan! Let's…Let's go together!

460
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,400
Come on! Let's go together!

461
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,519
You are dismissed!

462
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,840
Let's go!

00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,699
Shu Wan! You are finally back!

465
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:17,680
Here! Have a seat! Sit!

466
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,539
Brother, I'm sorry that I couldn't borrow any money.

467
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,219
I was only able to beg for two bowls of warm rice.

468
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:27,939
You and father can eat first. I'll go and think of something else.

469
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:29,339
No rush!

470
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,978
Here. Take a look at this.

471
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,779
Leader Bao is looking for you all over the streets!

472
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:38,219
He is sweet on you!

473
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,658
They'll come collect money again the day after tomorrow.

474
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:43,279
We'll have nothing to pay them!

475
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,199
Brother, I… I will figure something out!

476
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,900
Come back!

477
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,558
The bandits have robbed every single house in the city!

478
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:54,799
There is no way you can borrow any money.

479
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,599
Don't you understand?

480
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,460
You are the only hope of our family!

481
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,819
As long as you are willing to throw yourself on Leader Bao,

482
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:07,258
our father and I will get to survive!

483
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,040
Otherwise, all our family will be decapitated!

484
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,440
Nonsense!

485
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,838
What did you just say?

486
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:17,899
How can you give your younger sister to the head of bandits?

487
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,000
Father, I'm doing this for our family!

488

- Get out!

you've been having a tough life.

493
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:42,979
I care about you the most.

494
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,960
Don't worry.

495
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,440
I'd rather get killed

496
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,710
than send you to the bandits!

497
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:57,779
Otherwise, how can your mother rest in peace in heaven?

498
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,599
Father,

499
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,099
please eat something first.

500
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,899
I'll go figure something out.

501
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:10,159
Okay. I have no appetite. You eat it.

502
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,680
Who are these people?

503
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,380
Will it work?

504
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,380
Can they to do it?

505
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,699
They can! They surely can!

506
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:51,379
They are not capable of robbing.

507
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,118
But they are perfect for collecting grain outside the city!

508
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,938
Look! Look at their skinny bodies,

509
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,899
the fear in their eyes,

510
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:01,499
and their helpless looks!

511
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,120
It's amazing!

512
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,918
If you were a soldier, what would you think when you see them?

513
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,818
They must haven't eaten for days.

514
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,219
That's right!

515
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,418
So, the soldiers will only try to help them.

516
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,238
They'd even give them food,

517
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:17,639
and they'll never relate them to the bandits…

518
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,180
heroes of your Ba Dao Camp.

519
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,998
It does make sense!

520
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,158
Right?

521
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,239
There are also four idiots in different body shapes in the prison.

522
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,499
I think they can join this mission.

523
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:39,299
Let's bring them along later!

524
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:40,900
Yes!

525
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,420
Counselor Ning, just do as much as you can to collect grain.

526
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,018
If you encounter any danger, your safety is the most important.

527
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,619
Come back safely!

528
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,619
Your Ladyship, rest assured! I won't let you down!

529
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,900
Rest assured. I'll protect our Counselor.

530
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,960
He will come back safely.

531
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,879
Your Ladyship, he's also going?

532
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,959
Of course!

533
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,980
I've talked to Xi Gua.

534
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,399
You're all old and weak people.

535
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:21,319
It'd be a big trouble if any accident happened on the way.

536
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,620
That's right!

537
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,398
You are the mainstay in the camp.

538
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,718
I feel much more relieved with Chen Fan following you!

539
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,819
Alright, you can go now! I'm going back now!

540
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,138
Don't worry! I will watch you closely!

541
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,240
I'll get in the carriage now!

542
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:52,519
Counselor, you want these four idiots, right?

543
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,660
Take them away!

544
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,619
Move! Stop talking like an idiot, got it?

545
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,239
It's getting late now. Where are they taking us?

546
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,019
Take a look around.

547
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,979
We are surrounded by a bunch of aged men and scrawny refugees,

548
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:43,619
who are all the useless people in the town.

549
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,138
Maybe they don't want to waste food on us

550
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:49,959
and are going to bury us alive together with these refugees!

551
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,238
Bury us alive?

552
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,840
Fate pushed through the bowels of men. I'm shocked that my friend betrayed me.

553
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,399
I can't hold back my disappointment. Now I will end our friendship forever!

554
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:03,658
I won't leave you alone until the end of the world!

555
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:07,878
Ning Yi! You bastard!

556
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:12,059
Didn't I already tell you last time? I only pretended to surrender!

557
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,098
Nonsense! You bastard!

558
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,838
Last time you told us in the prison that you'd save us and get us out.

559
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:19,880
And then what? You pinned me down and offered us to those bandits!

560
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,459
If I hadn't done like that, they would've put me in jail, too!

561
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,259
Anyway, I will never trust you again! You are such a bastard!

562
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:28,939
If I die today because of you,

563
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,819
I'd hunt you down even if I became a ghost!

564
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:33,939
You won't die. We'll survive together!

565
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:36,279
I got a plan! This grain collection is just a cover!

566
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:39,339
We can run away using this chance!

567
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,800
Grain collection?

568
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,240
Nonsense!

569
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,860
Why are you bringing a bunch of refugees to collect grain?

570
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,280
If I brought a bunch of bandits, would you be able to escape?

571
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,880
See this drug?

572
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,758
You bastard! How dare you want to poison us?

573
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:03,900
You…

574
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,820
It's not for you guys!

575
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,299
See that tall idiot? This is a sleeping drug.

576
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,879
I'll find a chance to knock him out, then we can run away!

577
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:14,219
What this bastard said makes sense!

578
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,440
This bastard's words always make sense!

579
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,360
How about we trust this bastard one last time?

580
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,219
Bastard, if you dare… Can you at least respect me?

581
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,600
From now on, I'll be Expert Ning!

582
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,700
Expert Ning?

583
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:41,819
Go! Keep up! Hurry up!

584
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,738
Keep up! Walk faster!

585
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,720
You in the back, hurry up!

586
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,460
Keep up!

587
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,519
Go!

588
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,960
Come on!

589
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,559
Move!

590
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,419
Leader Chen.

591
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:02,919
Go.

592
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,719
After you!

593
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,279
Please let us out, too! Please let us out, too!

594
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,300
Ning Yi!

595
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:40,640
Five kilometers away from here to the northwest is Huzhou.

596
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,038
Qingde is located in the north, while Qiantang is northeast.

597
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:47,939
As far as I know, though these three places are not wealthy,

598
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:50,799
they have fertile land and a mild climate.

599
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:53,138
And now it's the harvest season.

600
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:55,358
I'm sure each family will have some extra grain.

601
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,719
In my opinion, we should just lead a group of people and march into the cities

602
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,140
to search each household for grain one by one.

603
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,558
I didn't expect that you'd do so much research, Leader Chen!

604
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,359
You are really well-prepared.

605
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
Not really.

606
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,679
When I was an outlaw, I was in charge of this area.

607
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,279
I had a lot of fights with those city gate guards.

608
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,199
I've familiarized myself with the situation in the cities.

609
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,659
But if we adopt your plan, we'd have to search all the families one by one.

610
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:20,099
It'd waste too much time.

611
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,299
What if we can't return to Lin'an in time?

612
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:24,078
Then, how about this? Let's attack the local government directly.

613
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:26,279
We'll kidnap the magistrate and force him to open the granary.

614
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,040
And by doing that, it will save us a lot of time!

615
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:33,199
Take a look around.

616
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,158
You want to lead these people to attack the local government,

617
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:39,519
kidnap the magistrate and force him to open the granary?

618
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,700
I even doubt if they can get off the cart and walk by themselves.

619
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,999
So, since what I said doesn't work, what do you think we should do next?

620
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,779
You are really having a good time here!

621
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,699
Is this your plan?

622
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,779
Listen, it's already past 9:00 p.m.

623
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,339
If we still can't find any grain by 3:00 a.m. the next day,

624
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:27,379
our plan for today will go in vain!

625
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:31,860
As you just said, it's only 9:00 p.m. now.

626
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,559
You can yell at me when it's 3:00 a.m.

627
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,979
Don't give me that! You are wasting our opportunity!

628
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:41,200
If you can't find grain today, Liu Xigua won't be able to protect you!

629
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,158
You don't need to tell me that now. I know it.

630
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,630
Just wait and see.

631
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,940
By 3 a.m., the grain will be orderly laid outside of the door.

632
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:56,319
I'll see what kind of a trick you'll play!

633
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,099
Excuse me!

634
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,718
Are you by any chance the Expert Ning from Mount Dianzu?

635
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,380
I can't believe someone'd recognize me

636
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,979
in this middle of nowhere!

637
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:09,900
Come in.

638
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,440
Are you really Expert Ning?

639
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,419
I thought it was you that day

640
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:18,579
under the city wall, but I wasn't sure about it.

641
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,179
I'm Li Pin! Nice to see you, Expert Ning!

642
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,619
You, too!

643
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,058
What Expert Ning? What the heck is that?

644
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:28,359
Expert Ning is very illustrious! Hero, you've never heard of him?

645
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,978
Expert Ning is a legendary figure who lives on Mount Dianzu!

646
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:35,380
He's quite intelligent and well-read.

647
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,138
He can even tell people's fortune!

648
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,599
In our Wu Dynasty, he even enjoys the reputation

649
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,539
of "the Expert Ning who is renowned

650
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:45,940
for his intelligence and keen mind."

651
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,379
Hero, have you really never heard of him?

652
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,810
♫ When did the bright moon begin to appear?
Raise a glass of wine to the sky to ask ♫

653
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,320
♫ I don't know what year is the heavenly palace ♫

654
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,000
♫ I wish to return to the heavens on the wind;
But I'm afraid of the beautiful jade moon palace ♫

655
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,590
♫ It'll be too lonely at the top for me ♫

656
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:02,920
♫ Dancing lightly and enjoying the clear shadows
under the moon is like living in the mortal world ♫

657
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,660
♫ The moonlight spills over the bright red pavilion
through gauze-draped windows ♫

658
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,490
♫ Soft to shed her light upon the sleepless bed ♫

659
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:17,330
♫ The moon should not have any regrets
but why is it full when lovers are parting? ♫

660
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,470
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

661
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,770
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

662
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,760
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

663
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,210
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

664
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,240
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

665
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,520
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

666
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,550
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

667
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,930
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

668
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,990
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

669
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,360
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

670
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,270
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

671
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,660
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫

672
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,740
♫ People have sorrow and joy, they separate or meet again.
And the moon has the transition of cloudy and clear ♫

673
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,050
♫  There has not been anything perfect since the olden days ♫

674
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,110
♫ So let us wish that people live as long as they can! ♫

675
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:20,660
♫ They will share the beauty of the moon
from thousands of miles away ♫
