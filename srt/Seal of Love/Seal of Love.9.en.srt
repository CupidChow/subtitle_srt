=Episode 9=

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,715
Humph, Demon Queen?

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,500
She's a mere loser
who can't fight at all.

5
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:14,875
My master died because of her.

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,915
I'll torture her as far as I can.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,140
However,

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:21,225
I don't see her a lot recently.

9
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:22,695
I guess

10
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:24,375
she's doing hard work in her yard.

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,620
Hard work?

12
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,635
She thinks hard work
can make her immortal?

13
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:28,955
But she's originally a demon.

14
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,350
Silly woman.

15
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:32,850
Who?

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,125
No one.

17
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,400
Let's go.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,900
Who are you?

19
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,850
I'm wrong.

20
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:05,865
What happened?

21
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,185
Sang Luo was bewitched.

22
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,595
Someone evil must have got in.

23
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:12,875
Demon.

24
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:13,955
A demon must have come for revenge.

25
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,195
Let's go tell Chief and Lord Qing Chen.

26
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:15,825
Go.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,975
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

28
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:20,335
What's wrong?

29
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,925
Someone evil has broken in.

30
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:23,155
But the Sky-bell Shield
has been activated.

31
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,995
No demons or devils can still hide.

32
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:26,950
Search the sect.

33
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:29,155
Your Lordship,

34
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,375
that evil guy disappeared

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,910
near Fusheng's room.

36
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:37,315
Leave me.

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,435
- Aye.
- Aye.

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,835
Go.

39
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,755
Instead of being fierce, you're now tame.

40
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:02,955
Is this the life you want?

41
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,635
Go check over there.

42
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,175
Aye.

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,530
What a big fuss!

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,800
Who are you?

45
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,725
You're not one of us.

46
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,600
(Did she lose her memory?)

47
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:30,650
Demon.

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,250
A demon broke in.

49
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,975
You're a demon?

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,460
Guess.

51
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,125
It's you who tricked Sang Luo?

52
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:47,650
Yes, because she bullied you.

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,450
Do I know you?

54
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,220
Honey,

55
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:57,700
don't you remember me?

56
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm your husband.

57
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,700
Husband?

58
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,635
You and I used to be a sweet couple.

59
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:07,785
It's my bad.

60
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,000
I lost you.

61
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,075
And a bad guy tricked you
into doing immortal cultivation.

62
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,025
But luckily,

63
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:15,345
I've found you now.

64
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,195
(What's this all about?)

65
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,275
(Humph, now you're mine.)

66
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,435
Fusheng.

67
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:30,525
Are you asleep?

68
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,750
Wait a second, Master.

69
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:34,755
Let me get dressed.

70
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,795
What brings you here, Master?

71
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,375
Someone broke
into the dungeon earlier today.

72
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,375
Did you see anyone suspicious?

73
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,750
No, no.

74
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,950
Who broke in?

75
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:56,995
We haven't found him yet.

76
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,675
Look, Master.

77
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,555
Do the flowers look good?

78
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,075
Wait.

79
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,400
Master, I'm a little bit sleepy.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,275
In this case,

81
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,500
go to bed early.

82
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,825
As for what just happened,

83
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,075
I'll take care of it.

84
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,625
