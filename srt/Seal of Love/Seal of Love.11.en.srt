Honey.

00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:28,455
Shh.

5
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,315
Don't let others find you.

00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:33,825
Looks like

7
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,600
you worry a lot about me.

8
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:38,875
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,275
In case someone bullies you,

10
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:43,905
I'm here to check on you.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,570
My master is around.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,130
He'll protect me.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,170
He will?

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,570
Let me take you somewhere.

15
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:55,745
Your Lordship,

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,050
you removed her demon energy.

17
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,985
But she's a demon, after all.

18
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,300
You shouldn't have helped her
with immortal cultivation.

(Demon?)

20

(Are they talking about me?)

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,290
I heard she made huge progress
in a very short time.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,770
If things go on like this,

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,210
we don't know

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,975
if she'll become a demon again.

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,250
What makes you say so, Chief?

26
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:18,865
Now, she's doing

27
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,090
immortal cultivation.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,300
Your Lordship,

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,700
he made sense.

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,010
Demon energy can be removed
as well as cultivated.

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,370
Oh, you remind me of something.

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,690
I should have exposed that.

33
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,375
Our disciple cheated.

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,610
During the test,

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,780
Sang Luo used someone else's power.

36
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:37,150
She shouldn't have won.

37
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,650
- Sang Luo cheated?
- And she should give back the reward.

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,370
Shall I help you vent your anger?

39
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:42,085
Mm?

40
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,810
Don't bother.

41
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,575
Honey,

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,425
wait for me.

43
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,490
With the Immortal Spirit Fruit,

44
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,450
I'll make quicker progress.

45
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,470
Fusheng

46
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,750
will just be nobody.

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,550
Nobody?

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,068
That's the Demon Queen Fusheng I know.

49
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,125
Help!

50
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,505
She's gonna kill me!

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,675
Where is everybody?

52
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,410
Anyone here?

53
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,835
Help!

54
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,385
Fusheng is gonna kill me!

55
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,375
Anybody?

56
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,890
It's a beautiful day today.

57
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,290
Somebody!

58
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,610
Help!

59
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,275
Fusheng,

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,730
I warn you. Stay away from me!

61
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,925
So bloody.

62
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,575
But I love it.

63
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,250
This morning,

64
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,850
I went to ask Sang Luo to have breakfast.

65
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,925
I heard

66
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,825
that someone beat her yesterday.

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,900
She seems to be furious.

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,050
Just...

69
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,010
Wait!

70
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
I can see she's furious.

71
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,570
Fusheng, go feed the Demon-eating Beast.

72
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,525
I'm in the middle of something.

73
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,850
Now, you're not.

74
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,525
Sang Luo,

75
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:15,375
let me go for...

76
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,975
New girl,

77
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,475
you're in no position to talk.

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,760
You slapped me?

79
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,350
Yes, so what?

80
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,625
I didn't slap you
for the first time, anyway.

81
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,850
You want me to feed
the Demon-eating Beast, huh?

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,130
I'll go.

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Or losers like you

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,575
would never shut your mouths.
