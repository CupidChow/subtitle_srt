=Episode 22=

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,675
You must find Jing Yuan.

4
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:11,250
Aye.

5
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:17,435
Chief,

6
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,235
our men have set off.

7
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,355
Good.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,460
When the mission is done,
take Jing Yuan back.

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:24,785
Yes.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,840
This is half the antidote
to the Soul-eating Sorcery.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
Complete another mission

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,175
and you'll get the other half.

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,450
When you see the girl in this portrait,

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,525
kill her.

15
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,875
Meng Fusheng,

16
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:30,575
you'll like the gift I prepared for you.

17
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,235
What? Failed to catch a hare?

18
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,925
What's the hurry?

19
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:52,195
At the foot of the mountain,

20
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,595
I saw some suspicious men in black.

21
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:54,600
I heard them say...

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,835
What?

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,400
I didn't hear clearly.

24
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:01,835
But,

25
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,025
I kind of heard them call your name.

26
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,075
Leave from the back door.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,995
What about you?

28
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll lure them away.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm not their target, anyway.

30
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,755
Aren't you scared?

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,385
I am.

32
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,475
But I'm more scared of you getting hurt.

33
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,155
I just don't want to
take care of a patient.

34
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:32,525
Just go.

35
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,550
Hey, why are you back?

36
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,030
I just want it.

37
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:41,975
Wait for me.

38
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,905
Tell me why you're back.

39
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:45,875
Guess.

40
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,750
Come on, tell me.

41
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,750
What if I hadn't come back?

42
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,355
I'll hide, then.

43
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:05,645
On this mountain,

44
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,915
I know more about where to hide.

45
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,955
Never take a risk anymore.

46
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,225
I did that for you.

47
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,470
Not even for me.

48
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:31,715
You look

49
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:33,755

50
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,400
