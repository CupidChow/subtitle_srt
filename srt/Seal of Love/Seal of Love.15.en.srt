But just enough.

23
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,960
I've kept her core for quite a long time.

24

You think I didn't do anything on it?

take it easy.

27

If I took it easy,

28
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,350
I would be way too generous.

29
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,925

Fusheng,

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,630
you mustn't hurt her.

37
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,495
You're not in charge.

38

No!

40
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,200
She dug my demon core.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,520
Now,

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,400
she dies.

Today,

44
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,725
no one can save her.

Fusheng,

46

if you don't hurt her,

47
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,975
you can both live.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,320
When she dug my core,

49
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,625
did she want me to live?

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,960
I can't let you make a big mistake.

51

Big mistake?

52

Today,

even if the sky fell,

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
I would defend her against it.

55
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,405
Do you know the consequences?

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,175
I do.

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,450
Just the Heart Sorcery.

I'll have the Heart-eating Bug

59

eat up her heart bit by bit.

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
Then the curse will be over.

of a hundred years.
