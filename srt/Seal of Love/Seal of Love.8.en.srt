=Episode 8=

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,740
What?

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,420
Who are you?

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,450
I'm your master. Don't you remember?

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,360
Master?

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,740
Yes.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,925
His Lordship used
his energy of a hundred years

9
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,019
to cultivate that wicked demon.

10
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,300
Now, she's his favorite disciple.

11
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,050
Goddess, His Lordship shows
incredible partiality for her.

12
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:52,475
You shouldn't have kept her alive.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,575
I have her core now.

14
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:03,025
It means I decide
whether she lives or dies.

15
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:06,925
She's in the palm of my hand.

16
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,540
But His Lordship favors her.
If they get along day and night,

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,900
they may fall in love. Goddess, you...

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,575
Shut up!

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,820
Are you saying I'm not
even as charming as a demon?

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,475
I don't mean that.

21
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:26,395
Unfortunately, I was badly injured
in the Demon-trapping Formation.

22
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:28,780
When I lock myself up for the healing,

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,900
keep a close eye on Fusheng.

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,100
If possible,

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,780
do with her.

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,140
Master,

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,125
how's my cultivation?

28
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,340
Your cultivation?

29
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,140
Not bad.

30
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:56,650
What am I best at, then?

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,980
What you're best at?

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,342
A lord like you

33
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:03,361
used a dirty trick?

34
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:14,550
You're good at lying.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,300
Lying?

36
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,375
Do I have an enemy then?
Who do I hate most?

37
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,250
A kind girl like you
doesn't have an enemy.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,425
Then...

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,160
Who do I love most?

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,500
Fusheng,

41
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,850
where on earth are you?

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Master, why are your ears reddening?

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,580
The wind...

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,940
The wind is too strong.

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,020
Master,

46
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,225
you look charming.
