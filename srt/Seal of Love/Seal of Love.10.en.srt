How about you do three moves first?

Aah!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,825
No need.

(how did she make such great progress?)

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,225
What a surprise! Fusheng went through
six successive stages.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,125
Fusheng,

26
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,725
do you dare to challenge me?

Don't tell me

28
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,000
you're scared of me.

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,160
Rest assured.

30
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,525
If you lose,

31
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,875
that won't be surprising.

32
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:50,475
You know what?

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,925
I used to think you were annoying.

34
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,700
But now,

35
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,857
I think you're annoying and silly.

36
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,800
And you're a loser

37
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,900
who only dares
to talk instead of fighting.

38
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,125
This mind game doesn't work on me.

39
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,850
But I think

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,780
I should make you know

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,450
where you have to stop.

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,125
Loser!

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
In less than one month,

44
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,185
I'll complete my cultivation.

45
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:27,100
By then,

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,825
you'll get a problem,

47
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,400
Wicked Demon!

48
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,155
Just now, I budged.

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,710
Now,

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
I won't.

51
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,520
She dreamed to defeat Sang Luo.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
She really has little self-knowledge.

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,125
His Lordship judged quite poorly.

54
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,925
He picked such a useless disciple.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,840
Sorry, Master.

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,700
I disgraced you.

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,390
You surprised me, actually.

58
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:37,425
In such a short time,
you passed all the stages.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm quite relieved.

60
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,665
No ordinary disciples can do that.

61
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,125
But I just lost.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Too bad.

63
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
I didn't get the Immortal Spirit Fruit.

64
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,105
I let go of your disciples last time

65
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,550
and you should return the favor, huh?

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,825
Give me the Fruit or marry me.

67
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:57,935
Or I could have made more progress.

68
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:03,700
It's...

69
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,450
The Immortal Spirit Fruit.

70
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,675
But Sang Luo had it, didn't she?

71
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,700
We have more than one fruit.

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,825
Besides,

73
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,150
it's supposed to be yours.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,275
