3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,475
Qing, you're still awake so late.

4
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,225
Waiting for me?

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,600
How did you get in?

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,575
Such barriers can't stop me.

7
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,775
With these flowers,
you indeed look more handsome.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,960
What's this about, Your Grace?

9
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:49,350
Don't be nervous.
I'm here to get something.

10
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,135
What?

11
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,435
With no doubt, I'm here for...

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,520
...your heart.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
When you blush,
you look even more charming.

14
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,950
Sacrifice herself?
She's just seduced by his face.

15
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,475
I want the Immortal Spirit Fruit

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,120
to build my disciple's body.

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,590
Immortal Spirit Fruit?

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,160
So, she came here for me?

19
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,535
It's the Sacred Treasure of our sect.
You can't pick it.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
That's why I'm here.

21
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,840
I hear only you can pick it.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,800
I let go of your disciples last time

23
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,165
and you should return the favor, huh?

24
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,525
Give me the Fruit or marry me.

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,620
Make your choice.

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,580
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

27
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,025
Time is running short. How about tonight?

28
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,700
That's why I'm here.

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,775
She is Demon Queen Fusheng?

30
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,255
Her face...

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,938
It can't be.

32
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,675
She died a thousand years ago.

33
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,550
Fusheng just has a similar face, I guess.

34
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,225
Time is running short. How about tonight?

35
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:32,950
She...

36
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,300
How shameless!

37
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,650
Who cursed me?

38
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,200
It's cold at night.
Your Grace, you should go.

39
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,335
Don't you walk me out, Qing?

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,870
It's midnight.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,300
And I'm afraid of the dark.

42
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,850
(I won't let you get what you want.)

43
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,675
He sounded indifferent,
but he's indeed caring.

44
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,960
Master, you and Lord Qing Chen

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,760
make the perfect couple.

46
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,125
What a wicked demon!

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,850
How dare she try to marry His Lordship!

48
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,165
She's the Demon Queen but I don't care.

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,200
Now that she came personally,

50
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,400
her death would not be a big problem.

51
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,245
This is the Demon-killing Spell
our grandmaster handed down to me.

52
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:11,875
Hit by it, a demon will lose
all his or her power.

53
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,370
Within moments, he or she
will disappear forever.

54
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,470
Killing the Demon Queen
will be a great merit.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,725
Sang Qing.

56
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,440
Master,

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,860
I'm ready to do it for you.

58
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,150
I've been waiting for a thousand years.

59
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,925
This time,

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,070
I allow nothing to go wrong.
