3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,846
It's weird.

4
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,575
Your Grace,

5
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,700
this man is badly wounded

6
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,575
as if his bones and tendons
were peeled off.

7
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,250
Luckily, he has a strong healing ability.

8
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,049
He won't die now.

9
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,225
Maybe he's a demon
caught by immortal sects for experiments.

10
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,350
He must have suffered a lot.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,825
Demon?

12
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,375
But Your Grace,
he doesn't have a demon core.

13
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,550
Oh?

14
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,490
He doesn't have a core.

15
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,275
Either he's too weak to have one,

16
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,820
or...

17
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,250
He isn't a demon.

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,580
Your Grace, our disciples are waiting
in the hall for some time.

19
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,220
(My Lord, did she find out who you are?)

20
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,955
(Then I'm more curious to know)

21

(what she's going to do with me.)

22
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,380
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,650
Your Grace,

24

(Yin Chonglou, elder of demons)
immortal disciples caught demons

25
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,250
(Yin Chonglou, elder of demons)
right under our noses.

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,580
(Chi Batian, elder of demons)
That's a provocation! We can't let it be.

27
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,630
What do you think
we should do, Elder Chi?

28
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,660
We want an eye for an eye, of course.

29
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,100
Let's also catch some immortal disciples
for experiments.

30
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,550
What experiments?

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,125
Eating little kids for extra nutrition?

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,025
Sounds good.

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,100
Elder Chi, go with me.

34
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,875
We can share captive immortal disciples.

35
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,560
What do you say?

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Humph, we can't eat little kids.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,150
You're doing wicked stuff.

38
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,900
You just talked rubbish.

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,975
The Demon Queen provoked us
and we disturbed you, Your Lordship.

40
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:21,039
(Mu Yao, immortal
of the Immortal Spirit Sect)

41
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,056
As the chief of the Immortal Spirit Sect,

42
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:22,982
(Feng Shili, elder
of the Immortal Spirit Sect)

43
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:23,675
I feel quite ashamed.

44
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:25,005
She didn't provoke us.

45
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,700
Sang Luo hurt her disciples first.

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,650
Is... Is there a misunderstanding?

47
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,600
Sang Luo acted rashly.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,040
But our sect is obligated

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,380
to kill devils and demons.

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,900
She wasn't wrong to hurt a demon.

51
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,300
All demons should be killed.

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,780
Some other disciples were also hurt.

53
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,600
Chief, are you going to let it go?

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,180
You!

55
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,740
We do our cultivations.

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,300
Demons do their cultivations.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,700
We go different ways,

58
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,380
but we both strive for better.

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,950
Wicked immortals and kind demons exist.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,550
Let's not judge others by race.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
Ridiculous!

62
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,110
Demons are demons.

63
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,825
How can they be compared to us?

64
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,545
Sang Luo, you seem to be badly wounded.

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,775
How about you go to the Medical Palace
for some treatment?

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,475
Chief, my master has healed me.

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm all right, now.

68
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,620
The Demon Queen is cunning.

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
I was so inattentive
that I fell into her trap.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,725
She saved who she wanted to save
and captured who she wanted to capture.

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,820
She was straightforward, using no trap.

72
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,395
Demon Queen Fusheng is said
to have vanished for years.

73
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:33,600
So, she's hiding on Phoenix Mountain.

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,340
It's only thirty miles away from us.

75
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,300
But we didn't know it.

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,725
I'm afraid the demons
have been hiding deliberately.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,575
So what?

78
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,550
Sang Luo got something, after all.

79
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,525
I accidentally entered
the Demon Queen's lair.

80
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,300
I've secretly memorized
the topography of the Phoenix Mountain.

81
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,460
To fight the demons,
I'd like to lead from the front.

82
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,390
Sang Luo endured humiliation

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,400
and got to know
the big secrets of the demons.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,325
Sang Luo, well done.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Because of you, we would be able
to steal a march.

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,180
Demons have plagued the world for years.

87
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,275
Your Lordship, please come out

88
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,075
and lead all immortal sects
to exterminate the demons

89
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,300
and defend the right path!

90
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,460
Exterminate the demons!

91
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,140
- Exterminate the demons!
- Exterminate the demons!

92
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,575
Defend the right path!

93
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:20,900
- Defend the right path!
- Defend the right path!

94
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,075
Exterminate the demons!

95
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,380
- Exterminate the demons!
- Exterminate the demons!

96
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,750
We're demons.
We certainly cultivate demon tricks.

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,350
Such evil tricks you do

98
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,850
will only disgrace our reputation.

99
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,700
What did you say?

100
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:30,750
Enough.

101
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,545
Stop quarreling.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,560
Brain is useful.

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,220
And I hope you can have one.

104
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,570
Who else can give some useful advice?

105
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Your Grace,

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,025
immortal sects have been
our enemies for years.

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,320
Year after year, demons at the border
have been suffering.

108
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,575
If only we can

109
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,455
deal with this issue once and for all!

110
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,875
Right, it's time.

111
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,700
Report.

112
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,140
It's... It's from the Demon Queen.

113
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,860
(Sang Qing, disciple
of the Immortal Spirit Sect)

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,925
It's a letter of challenge.

115
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,300
Letter of challenge?

116
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,216
Qing Chen is an exceedingly handsome man.

117
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,450
He's gentle and reasonable, too.

118
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,820
To marry him, here's my bride price.

119
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,740
- Hope he and I can grow old together.
- It's...

120
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,220
It's a letter of proposal.

121
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,940
Proposal...?

122
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,725
Nonsense! This is going too far!

123
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:44,775
She's so shameless.

124
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,449
How dare she want
to marry Lord Qing Chen!

125
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,150
- He wouldn't marry her.
- This is an insult.
