3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,040
Why would they meet us here?

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,410
Is this where the wedding will be held?

5
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,855
I was indeed pathetic.

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,875
Beware of traps.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hurry. Activate
the Demon-trapping Formation.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,680
She just got her core
and she's far weaker.

9
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:46,300
Perfect timing to kill her.

10
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,055
Another dirty trick?

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,960
This is all that you can do.

12
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,450
Enough to kill you.

13
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,200
You?

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,775
It's your Thunder Strike.

15
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:36,225
With the core back,
the Thunder Strike comes again for you.

16
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:38,379
I'll see how you can

17
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:40,000
get away this time.

18
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,845
How did you dodge so easily?

19
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,200
You haven't recovered yet.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,549
You're far weaker now.

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,075
The Thunder Strike will kill you.

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,450
So, Master,

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,800
I'll take the Thunder Strike for you.

24
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:01,450
You two are really affectionate.

25
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,925
Yuan.

26
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm fine.

27
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,345
Just a flesh wound.

28
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,625
You're a mere demon.

29
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,285
How could Thunder Strike
just give you a flesh wound?

30
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:54,845
Both of you will die.

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,100
Fusheng is taking the Thunder Strike.

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,280
Ancient Demon Dragon?

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,390
He is Overlord of Devils?

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,775
Yuan.

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,640
He doesn't have a core.

36
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:37,240
Either he's too weak to have one,

37
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,465
or...

38
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,885
He isn't a demon.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,380
To remove the Heart Sorcery from you,

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,760
he lost the cultivation
of a thousand years.

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
I'll have the Heart-eating Bug

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
eat up her heart bit by bit.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,575
Fusheng will only lose her power
of a hundred years.

44
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,925
Now, he forcibly revealed his real body.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,550
He will be doomed.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,040
Heart Sorcery?

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
So, he...

48
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,800
Yuan?

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,600

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,600

No!

58
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,925
He asked for that.
