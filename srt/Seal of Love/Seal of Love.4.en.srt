=Episode 4=

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,100
Your Grace, you must be kidding.

4
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:13,875
Yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:14,600
Your Grace,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,300
no woman has ever proposed to a man.

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,925
I'll be the first, then.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,025
I'm a demon and there is no rule for me.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,925
But...

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,140
I was so busy talking to you

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,950
that I forgot about my little disciple.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,650
This is absurd.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,660
I don't think so. I want that, too.

14
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,325
How about we propose
to an immortal disciple, too?

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,940
Then we'll have mixed-blood children.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,050
(Your Grace, he's haunted
by demon energy.)

17
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:56,580
But he doesn't have a core.
He's a mortal, I guess.

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,900
Mortal?

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,140
Yes.

20
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,900
It's never easy for a mortal
to become a demon.

21
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:06,700
He'll always be harassed
until he gets a core.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,075
Over time, he might be swallowed up
by evil creatures.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,540
A mortal has to risk his life
for becoming a demon

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,020
and he may not even succeed.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,700
Why is he trying to be a demon
instead of an immortal?

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,820
Interesting.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,425
Get up. Stop pretending.
I know you're awake.

28
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm new here, Master.
Please show some mercy.

29
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,775
You flicked me too hard.

30
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,305
Do you know who I am?

31
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:58,540
Demon Queen Fusheng
of the Phoenix Mountain.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,380
Wrong.

33
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:04,750
I'm your master.
Once a master, always your senior.

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,140
I'll watch your back from now on.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,304
Mm.

36
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,525
(Shangqing Knack)

37
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,460
You've got a serious internal injury.

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,380
From nine to eleven every night,
go take a bath in the Phoenix Pool

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,200
and cultivate Shangqing Knack.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,900
(Shangqing Knack)
You'll recover soon, I believe.

41
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:21,980
Shangqing Knack?

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,925
The ancient secret book
of the Phoenix Clan?

43
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,010
Throughout the world,

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm the only living phoenix.

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,380
Don't bother about the clan.

46
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,575
Why did you pick me?

47
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:52,025
Because...

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,140
You look handsome.

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,060
If one day I no longer look handsome,

50
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,660
will you discard me, Master?

51
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm the queen of demons.
I wouldn't be a face-judger.

52
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,290
Report, Your Grace.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,180
Lord Qing Chen rejected your proposal.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,225
(Proposal?)

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,325
I didn't propose to him
for his handsome face.

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,180
For the peace of the two races,

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,675
- (I'll see what story you can make up.)
- I was just trying to sacrifice myself.

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,620
Besides, there are a lot of treasures
on the Immortal Spirit Mountain.

59
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,875
I hear

60
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,100
the Immortal Spirit Fruit is
very beneficial for body building.

61
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,200
The doctor said your crushed core
must be restored soonest.

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,300
So, Master,

63
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,675
you did that for me?

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,420
Now that I'm your master,

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,740
I won't make you an imperfect demon.

66
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,260
Mm. Mm.

67
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:56,575
Don't worry.

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,060
I will

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,650
always be responsible for you.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,540
Your Grace, Lord Qing Chen...

71
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,460
Say no more.

72
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,500
I will get the Immortal Spirit Fruit.

73
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,020
Go.

74
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,340
(My Lord, is the Knack real?)

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,475
(I'll know after I try it.)

76
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,620
Your Grace, shall we
assemble our troops?

77
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,825
I'm ready to inform

78
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,140
other Demon Kings to dispatch troops
to the Immortal Spirit Mountain.

79
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,370
Forget about the troops.

80
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,100
No wonder you're always single.

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,050
Now that he doesn't accept my proposal,

82
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,675
I'll have to go get his token of love.

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,100
As I have much contact with this man,

84
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,980
I'll eventually get him.

85
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:49,300
(Congratulations, My Lord.)

86

you'll breach the seal in your body.)
