What's wrong?

191
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,624
Human lives are really fragile.

192
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:18,905
People do die suddenly.

193
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:26,025
In the past, we kept telling people

194
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,144
that everything would be fine

195
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,185
when we were around

196
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,864
and that we would rescue them.

197
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:40,705
However,

198
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,465
we cannot even guarantee

199
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,144
our own safety.

200
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,304
Just take a look at Liu Xu.

201
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,104
It's the same for Fang Huai.

202
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:02,465
Sometimes,

203
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,665
I would ponder.

204
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,665
Could I become a superhero,

205
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,584
rescue all of my buddies,

206
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,985
and protect everyone,

207
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,144
including myself?

208
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,104
It turns out that I can't do so.

209
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,665
We're just ordinary beings.

210
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,185
You can protect everyone.

211
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:50,064
I'll protect you.

212
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:55,425
Thank you.

213
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:08,185

Don't worry about it.

382
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:42,745
If so...

383
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,705
Your gift isn't surprising enough.

384
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:47,465
Keep it with you.

385
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:48,864
Give me some time, okay?

386
00:25:49,104 --> 00:25:49,425
Okay.

387
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:50,784
I'll leave the room first.

388
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:12,624
Babe.

389
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,945
What are you doing here?

390
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,824
I woke up early during my rest day.

391
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:18,624
As your boyfriend, it's my duty

392
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:19,584
to send you to work.

393
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:22,705
It's your personal seat.

394
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:23,905
Get on the bike.

395
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,144
You and your honeyed words.

396
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,144
Let's go.

397
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:30,824
Sit tight.

398
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:49,465
You were the reason

399
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,344
I managed

400
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,025
to make a quick recovery.

401
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:55,544
You always treated me

402
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,864
when I was injured.

403
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:00,584
I'm really lucky to encounter you.

404
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:02,465
I've made up my mind.

405
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:04,304
I'll treat you well

406
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,265
and cherish my fortune.

407
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:08,465
I feel lucky

408
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:09,624
to encounter you too.

409
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:11,185
It's just like the road

410
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,025
we're on right now.

411
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,265
It's covered by sunlight.

412
00:27:15,144 --> 00:27:16,584
Ever since you came to me,

413
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,304
I felt like my life

414
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,505
has been reignited.

415
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,425
Are you my little sun?

416
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:22,784
Of course.

417
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:24,864
I was pretty down

418
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:26,505
for some time.

419
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:28,864
I made a comeback because of you.

420
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:30,505
Thank you.

421
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:32,945
I should thank you instead.

422
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:36,104
I feel like

423
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:37,624
the journey to my company
is getting shorter and shorter.

424
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:40,025
What did you say?

425
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:41,505
What did you say?

426
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,544
I said you were too slow.

427
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,584
I'm going to be late for work.

428
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:47,584
Sit tight then.

429
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:56,225
It's ready.

430
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,584
Baby girl, try this.

431
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,384
Your mother made these braised pork ribs

432
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:03,185
for you especially.

433
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:04,784
Thank you, Dad, Mom.

434
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,864
Didn't Jin return with you?

435
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:08,265
No.

436
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:09,584
He's very busy lately.

437
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:10,864
He didn't tell me what he was busy with.

438
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:11,985
He's being mysterious.

439
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:13,945
He's working
right after being discharged?

440
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:15,344
Can his body stand that?

441
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:18,745
He's just like your father.

442
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:19,745
Work is the only thing on their minds.

443
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:22,824
Comrade Lin Quan,

444
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:25,624
why am I dragged into this?

445
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:27,225
You always think about me

446
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:28,344
no matter what it is, huh?

447
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:29,985
You just have to tell me off.

448
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,465
I finally understand now.

449
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:32,745
Our daughter takes after me.

450
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:33,304
We're destined

451
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:34,624
to fall for irritating guys
like you all.

452
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:38,344
You and Jin have been through several

453
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:39,425
life-or-death situations together.

454
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:40,905
And, you're sure that
he's the one for you.

455
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:43,544
If so, you guys

456
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,025
should proceed with the next step.

457
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:46,864
What do you mean?

458
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:48,705
Of course it's marriage.

459
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:50,104
You're no longer young.
Stop delaying it.

460
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,064
It's time for you to get married.

461
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:52,265
Mom,

462
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,144
why the rush?

463
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,425
And, I don't think

464
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:56,624
I should take the initiative this time.

465
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:57,584
I was the one

466
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,985
who courted Jin Shichuan before this.

467
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:00,025
I can't just

468
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:01,705
propose to him
before he proposes to me.

469
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,624
Didn't Jin mention anything
about marrying you?

470
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,905
If so, you should take the initiative.

471
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:08,465
You can...

472
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:10,425
You can give him some hints.

473
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:12,225
How many times have I told you?

474
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:13,425
Just leave it to our daughter.

475
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,025
We shouldn't interfere.

476
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:15,705
Here, try this.

477
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:17,905
What do you mean by interfere?

478
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,425
This is my daughter's marriage,
you know?

479
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:21,824
Of course I'm worried.

480
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:22,824
Moreover,

481
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:24,144
our daughter is deeply in love with him.

482
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:25,745
How could he make
my daughter wait for him?

483
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:28,344
Are you afraid

484
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:29,425
that your son-in-law might run away?

485
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:31,384
Of course.

486
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,025
You must take the opportunity

487
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:34,425
when there's a good man by your side.

488
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,185
Back then, your mother

489
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:40,144
cherished the opportunity

490
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,104
by winning my heart.

491
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,025
She proposed to me first.

492
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:43,784
If not,

493
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,344
I think I would've run away.

494
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:46,465
You do take after your mother.

495
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,945
Who said I proposed to you?

496
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:49,025
Don't listen to your father's nonsense.

497
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:52,304
He tricked me into saying that on purpose.

498
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,665
Run away, huh?

499
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:54,665
Try it if you dare.

500
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,544
Who said I was running away?

501
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,505
Even if I run,
I'll run into your embrace.

502
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,344
I did stay by your side

503
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:02,784
all these years, didn't I?

504
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:05,384
Baby girl,

505
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:06,544
your mother is right.

506
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,425
When we're in love,

507
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,144
it doesn't matter

508
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:11,945
who takes the initiative.

509
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:48,784
(Hello?)

510
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:49,864
(What are you doing now?)

511
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:51,344
I just returned to the dorm.

512
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:52,225
I was just about to rest.

513
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:52,905
What about you?

514
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,465
I just left my parents' house.

515
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:55,465
I'm returning home.

516
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:56,945
(The weather is pretty cold.)

517
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:57,784
(Don't tell me)

518
00:30:57,945 --> 00:30:58,824
you rode a bicycle
to your parents' house?

519
00:30:59,185 --> 00:30:59,945
(I didn't.)

520
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,104
Good.

521
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:02,665
If not, you'll catch a cold.

522
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:05,384
(Don't walk back home at night.)

523
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:06,025
(Call a cab.)

524
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:11,745
Jin Shichuan.

525
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:13,104
What's the matter?

526
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:15,624
I miss you.

527
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:16,665
I want to see you.

528
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:17,905
Right now.

529
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,225
Didn't I say I would look for you?

530
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:47,584
Why did you come here by yourself?

531
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,144
I was reaching the fire station

532
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,185
when you were on the phone.

533
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,265
Do you feel cold?

534
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:55,064
A little.

535
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:00,025
Aren't you cold?

536
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:04,665
Give me your hands.

537
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,624
Do you feel better?

538
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:18,304
In the future,

539
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,104
you should wear thicker clothing.

540
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:21,265
I'll be heartbroken if you catch a cold.

541
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:21,985
Just tell me

542
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:22,784
if you want to find me.

543
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:23,905
I'll go and find you, okay?

544
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:24,985
But I can't wait any longer.

545
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,384
I want to see you immediately.

546
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:33,465
Jin Shichuan,

547
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,304
although

548
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,705
we didn't date each other
for a long time,

549
00:32:39,384 --> 00:32:40,705
we did know each other since long ago.

550
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:43,144
Chinese New Year is nearing.

551
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:43,864
- I was thinking...
- Oh yeah.

552
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,544
I'm sure there'll be plenty of
emergencies by then.

553
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:49,104
I don't think we can have

554
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:50,225
a reunion dinner together this year.

555
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:51,624
Why don't you

556
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:53,225
join us at the fire station

557
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,185
during Chinese New Year?

558
00:32:59,064 --> 00:32:59,584
Sure.

559
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:02,265
It's our first time celebrating

560
00:33:02,384 --> 00:33:03,144
Chinese New Year together.

561
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:03,985
I'm looking forward to it.

562
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:06,544
Me too.

563
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:01,224
That's fine.

564
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:02,144
This is common.

565
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,505
Why don't we take a break

566
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:04,345
and wait for their return?

567
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:05,505
Sure.

568
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:06,704
Let's go.

569
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:19,544
Initially, I wanted

570
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:20,825
to propose to him today.

571
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:23,385
But he went on a mission.

572
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,785
Are you sure Jin Shichuan
is the one for you?

573
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:27,744
Of course.

574
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:29,785
I knew he was the one for me

575
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,064
since ten years ago.

576
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,264
What about you and Lu Fangqi, huh?

577
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:36,064
He's way younger than me.

578
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:38,025
I can only submit to fate.

579
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:41,664
Time does fly, huh?

580
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:43,305
I never expected myself

581
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:44,744
to celebrate Chinese New Year
in the fire station this year.

582
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:46,224
Yeah.

583
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:47,744
Time does fly.

584
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:49,385
However,

585
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:51,465
it's pretty meaningful, isn't it?

586
00:35:58,264 --> 00:35:58,905

When did you guys prepare for that?

620
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:22,505
I didn't expect it

621
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:23,544
to be such a meaningful surprise.

622
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:25,905
Captain Jin spent
the entire day preparing for

623
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:27,025
his proposal.

624
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,385
Look at my dark eye circles.

625
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,624
Are you sure you got them

626
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:32,104
because you didn't sleep lately?

627
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:33,744
It's all your fault.

628
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,184
I can't sleep

629
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:35,865
when I think of you.

630
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,385
That's why I have dark eye circles.

631
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:39,305
You and your sweet talk.

632
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,144
What do you think about

633
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:46,184
Captain Jin's proposal?

634
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,025
I was very touched.

635
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:49,385
After all, I was there

636
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:51,184
during the start of their relationship.

637
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,064
It's difficult for them
to reach where they are now.

638
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:57,905
I'm very happy for them.

639
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,184
When I propose to you,

640
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,064
I'll surely find a place

641
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,425
that's more romantic than this place.

642
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,865
For example, in the sky,

643
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,385
under the sea,

644
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:10,785
or even on the beach.

645
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:12,825
What do you think about the beach?

646
00:40:19,465 --> 00:40:20,345
I don't want to get married.

647
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:31,144
Zang Qiu,

648
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:33,224
I'm serious about our relationship.

649
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:34,744
I thought about

650
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:36,664
marrying you from the moment I fell for you.

651
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:39,184
I've thought about the scene of our wedding

652
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:40,664
countless times.

653
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,465
Can we just maintain this relationship?

654
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,785
But why?

655
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:47,825
I guess you don't like me enough, right?

656
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,144
That's why you don't want
to be married to me.

657
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,264
Of course not. I like you a lot.

658
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:54,104
However, I was married before.

659
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:56,025
I know the difference

660
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:57,025
between getting married and dating.

661
00:40:58,224 --> 00:40:59,144
There are plenty of attachments

662
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,465
and responsibilities behind a wedding.

663
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:00,905
I...

664
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:02,584
I don't want to restrain you.

665
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:04,025
But I want to be restrained.

666
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,345
I want you to be mine.

667
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:08,785
Wait.

668
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,144
So what if you were married before?

669
00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:14,064
Does that mean you cannot get married again?

670
00:41:14,184 --> 00:41:14,544
This...

671
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:17,104
This is unfair to me.

672
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:23,945
If you can't accept that,

673
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:25,905
you should reconsider

674
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:26,985
our relationship.

675
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:31,985
I dedicated myself

676
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:33,025
to this relationship from the start.

677
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:34,945
There's no need for me to reconsider it.

678
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:35,825
You're the one who doesn't plan

679
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,704
to spend the rest of your life with me.

680
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:00,064
Dr. Zang,

681
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,184
where's that boyfriend of yours?

682
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,865
He hasn't been around lately.

683
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:05,785
Him?

684
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:08,104
He went on a mission.

685
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:09,104
He hasn't returned yet.

686
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:11,624
I was wondering.

687
00:42:12,144 --> 00:42:13,584
He was always here to find you.

688
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,465
Now that he's not here,

689
00:42:14,544 --> 00:42:15,905
I'm not used to it.

690
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:17,664
Although your boyfriend

691
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,184
is pretty young,

692
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:20,624
he's truly nice to you.

693
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,144
He only has eyes for you.

694
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,025
Guys like him are pretty rare nowadays.

695
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,865
You have to cherish him.
