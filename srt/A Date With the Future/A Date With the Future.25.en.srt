(Team Effort Wins Parental Approval)

22
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,407
Did you stay up all night?

23
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:01,968
That has nothing to do with you.

24
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:05,127
Get up.

25
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:07,328
What are you up to?

26
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:10,367
I'm free today.

27
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:11,527
My assistant isn't around too.

28
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,608
I need someone to keep me company.

29
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:14,647
I'm borrowing you.

30
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:16,448
Get up.

31
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,848
Nope. Go away. Don't annoy me.

32
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:19,967
You don't get to choose.

33
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,288
Get up! Let's go!

34
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:22,767
Get up!

35
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,247
Yu Shishi, what are you up to?

36
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,207
Get up!

37
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,048
Come on!

38
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:28,207
Let's go.

39
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,087
Get up! Let's go!

40
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:32,728
Let's go.

41
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,048
Why did you bring me here?

42
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:39,848
I brought you here for facial treatment.

43
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,008
A man needs to maintain his appearance too.

44
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,608
Moreover, you have a face I like.

45
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:46,647
I'm not willing to let you

46
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,328
suffer for the sake of other women.

47
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,168
I'm not doing it.

48
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:51,448
I don't care if you like it or not.

49
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,008
Come on!

50
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,168
Yu Shishi, have you lost your mind?

51
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:55,728
Everything is ready. Come on.

52
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:56,888
Stop pushing me.

53
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,008
Please give him a soothing treatment.

54
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:21,247
Don't wake him up.

55
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:22,927
Okay, I'll get the scented candles.

56
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:23,647
Thank you.

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,180
(Amy)

58
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,448
I left the set because of you.

59
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,087
I'm sure my agent is going crazy now.

60
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:51,967
Why am I so nice to you?

61
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,927
I'm even touched by my own actions.

62
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,087
Even so, you didn't react to me at all.

63
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,288
Why are you hurt?

64
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,447
You never learn to protect yourself.

65
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,807
Sleep well.

66
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:10,648
When you wake up,

67
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:12,768
you should forget about

68
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,807
the person who broke your heart,

69
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:16,168
okay?

70
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:50,168
Not bad at all.

71
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,968
You became handsome again.

72
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:53,367
I spent a lot of efforts

73
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:54,887
just to help you become handsome again.

74
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,288
How do you plan to thank me?

75
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:58,768
Why are you looking at me?

76
00:05:59,048 --> 00:05:59,807
Are you touched by my actions?

77
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,220
(Amy)

78
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:10,608
Get back to work.

79
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,208
Don't look for me again.

80
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:13,968
What do you mean by this?

81
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,487
You're chasing me away after waking up?

82
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,927
Our deal is already over.

83
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:22,408
Aren't you afraid

84
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:23,807
that I'll tell the reporters

85
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:24,768
about our fake relationship?

86
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,048
If you wish to do so,

87
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:27,208
you can go ahead.

88
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,127
Are you angry?

89
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:32,367
I was just joking.

90
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:33,728
Don't be mad.

91
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,608
I told you this on the first day we met.

92
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,127
I don't like to joke around.

93
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,048
You breaking our promise

94
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,648
has already disrupted my plan.

95
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,687
I'm already showing you mercy

96
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,728
for not holding you accountable for it.

97
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:49,728
Huo Yanzong,

98
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,648
do you even have a human heart?

99
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,487
I do.

100
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:54,968
But it's not for you.

101
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:57,728
No matter how much you like Xu Lai,

102
00:06:58,447 --> 00:06:59,528
she'll never choose you.

103
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:00,567
How would you know she wouldn't?

104
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:03,447
Stop wasting time on me.

105
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:04,848
My business has nothing to do with you

106
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:05,807
from the start.

107
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,768
You're just inviting trouble
upon yourself.

108
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,608
It's impossible between you two.

109
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,367
It's impossible between us too.

110
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,807
Are you done?

111
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:19,608
Leave when you're done.

112
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,408
Do not bother me again.

113
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,567
Don't you understand human speech?

114
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,048
Just leave.

115
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,007
Huo Yanzong, you jerk!

116
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:33,528
I hate you!

117
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:04,608
Hate me then.

118
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,487
It's better than loving me.

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
(Mom)

120
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:31,111
(Mom)

121
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,008
Here, drink up.

122
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,327
Back then, I allowed you to stay here

123
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,128
because I didn't want the tension

124
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,288
between you and your mother to escalate.

125
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,327
However, you can't solve
the issue by avoiding it,

126
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,168
am I right?

127
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,087
It's time to go home.

128
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,408
I'm not avoiding her.
This is my tactic.

129
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,567
Timing is vital in negotiations.

130
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,327
I intend to wait for two more days

131
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:03,687
before I let my mother know about

132
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:04,528
my determination.

133
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,327
This way, she will soften up.

134
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:08,967
Besides,

135
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:10,687
I want to use this chance

136
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,807
to spend more time with you.

137
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,567
Don't chase me away.

138
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:14,927
No one is chasing you away.

139
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,128
But think about it.

140
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:17,368
The relationship between us

141
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:18,567
is already terrible.

142
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:19,807
If your relationship

143
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,288
with your mother worsens,

144
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,488
she'll think

145
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,488
that I'm abducting her daughter.

146
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,567
What should we do by then?

147
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,048
If so, my relationship with her

148
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,648
will never improve.

149
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:29,368
Am I right?

150
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:31,567
But I...

151
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,408
No more buts. Think about it.

152
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,408
Think about my relationship
with your mother.

153
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,768
Can you consider my feelings
for a second?

154
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,847
Can you please consider it?

155
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:46,008
Alright then.

156
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:47,648
For our sake,

157
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,648
I have to deal with my mother.

158
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,248
Good girl.

159
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,807
When you go inside,

160
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,768
you should communicate
with your mother properly.

161
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,248
It all depends on you whether or not

162
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:12,687
I get to marry into your family.

163
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,168
Do you want to get married
into my family that badly?

164
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:17,567
If I want you

165
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,128
to be a part of my family officially,

166
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,888
first, I have to pass
your parents' test.

167
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:23,168
Your mother is my future mother-in-law.

168
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,368
I cannot afford to offend her.

169
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,807
You're already calling her
mother-in-law, huh?

170
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,528
Jin Shichuan,

171
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,288
I realized you've gotten bolder

172
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,567
after you started dating me.

173
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,408
It's all because of you.

174
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:36,288
Fine then.

175
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:37,807
For the sake of our future,

176
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:38,847
I will accomplish my mission.

177
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,048
If so, don't you think you should

178
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:42,888
give me some energy?

179
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:58,128
See you.

180
00:10:58,648 --> 00:10:59,128
Break a leg.

181
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:00,327
Don't throw a tantrum, okay?

182
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:01,847
Control your emotions.

183
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:02,408
Don't worry.

184
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:19,648
Dad.

185
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:20,528
Our baby girl is back.

186
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:21,327
Where's Mom?

187
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,048
Our girl is back.

188
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,207
You still remember
where your house is, huh?

189
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,008
Mom, I'm sorry.

190
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,807
I was too impulsive last time.

191
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,168
I shouldn't have talked back.

192
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,207
This isn't about you talking back to me.

193
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,048
Xu Lai,

194
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,087
when it comes to getting a boyfriend,

195
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,248
you have to listen to me.

196
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:42,768
When you find a partner,

197
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:44,327
you need to find one
with a stable and safe job.

198
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:45,528
And, he needs to
take care of the family...

199
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:47,048
Jin Shichuan will be the one for me.

200
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:51,687
I don't care if you like it or not.

201
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,048
He will be my other half.

202
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:55,888
What do you mean by that?

203
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,248
Why are you so sure that
he's the one for you?

204
00:11:59,087 --> 00:11:59,768
What gives him the right

205
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:00,528
for you to lay down your heart for him?

206
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:02,008
It's because he saved me ten years ago.

207
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,168
Ten years ago?

208
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:06,488
Explain yourself.

209
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,888
What's going on?

210
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,648
When you guys got divorced
ten years ago,

211
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,248
I went to Huining to take a breather.

212
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,207
In the end, I was met with
an earthquake.

213
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,528
I was trapped in the ruins
for one full day and night.

214
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,488
Did you guys know that?

215
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,128
No, you guys didn't.

216
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,248
I would've been dead

217
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,288
if it weren't for Jin Shichuan.

218
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,687
He was the one who rescued me

219
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,648
from the ruins.

220
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:37,248
If so...

221
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,048
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

222
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:40,607
What's the use of it?

223
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,648
You guys only knew how to argue.

224
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:44,087
You guys never cared about how I felt.

225
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,008
What's the use of telling you?

226
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,567
You only care about the military!

227
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:50,528
You don't care about your family!

228
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:51,207
Listen.

229
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,687
Let's get a divorce
if you don't want to stay.

230
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,927
First, the nation. Then, the family.
Am I right?

231
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,288
Don't lecture me!

232
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,528
I don't care about that!

233
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:58,648
I just want to lead a normal life!

234
00:12:58,768 --> 00:12:59,607
Do you know that?

235
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:00,447
Now,

236
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:01,967
you're being unreasonable.

237
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,967
I am the only one
who cares about our child.

238
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,368
I even gave birth to her alone.

239
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,528
You weren't even by my side.

240
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,207
You have no right to tell me off!

241
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:09,807
Do you want to stay here?
If not, let's get a divorce!

242
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,648
What's wrong with you?

243
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:11,207
You're complicating things.

244
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:11,967
I'm hurt.

245
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:13,687
I'm complicating things?

246
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:14,607
How am I complicating things?

247
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,408
I want to lead a normal life.

248
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:17,087
I wish to come back too.

249
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,648
I only want a normal life.

250
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,768
I want someone to care about me

251
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:19,687
and our child!

252
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,008
Do you know that?

253
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,168
I can't count on you for anything!

254
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:24,207
You're still

255
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:24,847
lecturing me here!

256
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,528
Just stop!

257
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:51,567
Lai,

258
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,927
we've decided to get a divorce.

259
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:15,168
That's pretty good.

260
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,128
This way,

261
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,327
I'll have two shares of living expenses.

262
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:19,528
I think

263
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:21,768
you two don't need to argue

264
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,488
when you see each other.

265
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,087
Our child is all grown up.

266
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,248
I think

267
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,528
we should hear her out.

268
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:39,447
We should respect her choice,

269
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:40,528
am I right?

270
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:47,927
All mothers wish the best

271
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,927
for their children.

272
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,087
I was just afraid that
she might make the wrong choice.

273
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:58,648
I want to protect her.

274
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:03,488
I never expected

275
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:05,807
Jin Shichuan to be the one

276
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,248
who rescued our daughter ten years ago.

277
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,248
We should treat him well.

278
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,128
After all,

279
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,927
he did save our daughter twice.

280
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:17,447
Twice?

281
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:19,488
I went to the fire brigade

282
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,087
in secret once.

283
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,368
I wanted to know more about

284
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,567
Jin Shichuan.

285
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:26,048
After that, I encountered

286
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:27,288
their commissioner there.

287
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,327
He said

288
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,207
our daughter was kidnapped some time ago.

289
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,648
Jin Shichuan risked his life

290
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,807
to save our daughter.

291
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,807
What exactly has Lai experienced?

292
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:49,327
Why do I know nothing at all?

293
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,128
I was just afraid that
you might be worried and upset.

294
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:53,567
That's why I didn't tell you.

295
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,567
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

296
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:02,927
I know.

297
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:04,607
You care the most

298
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,807
about our daughter.

299
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:08,367
However,

300
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,367
everyone has a different perception.

301
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,327
Even if you think it's good for her,

302
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,607
it might not be what she desires.

303
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,127
Your so-called happiness

304
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,847
might be a shackle to her.

305
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,167
We can't make decisions for her

306
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:30,008
based on our life experience.

307
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:30,968
Don't you think so?

308
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,448
I just don't want her to
follow in my footsteps.

309
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,248
I'll say the same thing.

310
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:43,367
Our child is all grown up.

311
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,607
Let her pursue the path she desires, okay?

312
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,407
Besides,

313
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,048
what's wrong with
following in your footsteps?

314
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:54,807
It's not necessarily

315
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,008
the wrong path for her.

316
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,248
I'm still here for you

317
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:02,688
ever after all this while.

318
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,288
It's not the end yet.

319
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,248
How could you know

320
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,248
that I am not your best choice?

321
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,567
It's all your fault.

322
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,248
Yeah, it's my fault.

323
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,048
I know that.

324
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,087
What do you know?

325
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:22,807
Look at you.

326
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,488
You're throwing a tantrum again.

327
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,728
Stop crying.

328
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,048
I know we need to care

329
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:30,847
about our child.

330
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,248
However, you need to set her free.

331
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:43,607
I thought you went home?

332
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:46,887
I didn't accomplish my mission.

333
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,768
I messed things up again.

334
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:12,807
When I went back,

335
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,288
I said a lot of mean things.

336
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:15,928
But I regretted it immediately

337
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:16,847
after that.

338
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,728
I knew that I'd break my mother's heart

339
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:21,367
when I did so.

340
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:25,367
Do you know something?

341
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:27,008
When I was young,

342
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,647
I hated it the most
when my parents argued.

343
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,127
But after I grow up,

344
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:31,968
I end up doing

345
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,248
the thing I hate the most.

346
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:37,488
However, I cannot control

347
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:38,288
my emotions.

348
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:45,807
Tell me.

349
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:47,847
Why do people always

350
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,407
show their worst side

351
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,327
to their dearest kin?

352
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,048
Maybe it's because they're too close.

353
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,008
That's why they don't
hide anything from them.

354
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,327
I think you two

355
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:00,087
lack communication.

356
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,688
Sometimes,
it's better to clarify things.

357
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:04,448
Only then, your mother

358
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:05,367
will understand how you feel.

359
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:11,847
I hope so.

360
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,127
What? Are you troubled by something?

361
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:47,968
Grandpa,

362
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:51,048
how did Mom get married to Dad?

363
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:53,208
Why are you asking me this
all of a sudden?

364
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,567
I remember Grandma

365
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,167
told me about this when I was young.

366
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,528
She said she was against Mom's decision

367
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,607
to marry Dad.

368
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,048
It's because she thought

369
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:03,807
Dad's job was risky.

370
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,768
But I don't know what Dad did

371
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,688
to make Grandma change her mind.

372
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,008
Why did you drag your Grandma into this?

373
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,087
Is it about you?

374
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,647
Is Xu Lai's family upset about

375
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,728
your relationship with Xu Lai?

376
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:21,407
Yeah.

377
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:22,728
Is it her father or mother?

378
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:23,688
Her mother.

379
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,288
She's worried about

380
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:28,248
the nature of my job too.

381
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,367
She thinks it's risky.

382
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:30,928
She doesn't hope that Xu Lai

383
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:31,688
will get together with me.

384
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:35,968
I can understand
her feelings completely.

385
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,327
Being a firefighter

386
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:38,607
means you have to be ready

387
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:39,928
to risk your life 24/7.

388
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,647
They're not the best choice
if you want a partner.

389
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,407
All parents

390
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,407
want their children

391
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:48,448
to lead a stable life.

392
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,807
Don't you think so?

393
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,208
Yeah.

394
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:54,248
But I don't want them

395
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,847
to argue because of me.

396
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,008
I feel like I'm letting down Xu Lai

397
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:59,087
and her mother.

398
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:02,807
Silly boy.

399
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,887
You don't need to feel sorry.

400
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,327
Let me ask you this.

401
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,968
Do you still want to
be together with Xu Lai?

402
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,167
Of course.

403
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:12,448
Alright.

404
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:16,048
Did you know how your father

405
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,248
managed to marry your mother?

406
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:19,288
I don't know.

407
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:22,688
Silly boy. Just you wait.

408
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:25,008
Seems like

409
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,327
I have to do something

410
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:28,208
this time.

411
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:51,288
Hello.

412
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,607
Hello. You are?

413
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:56,327
You must be Xu Lai's mother.

414
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:57,688
Yes.

415
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:00,647
I'm Jin Shichuan's grandfather.

416
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:15,488
Okay, thank you.

417
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,607
I heard that you were a soldier.

418
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:19,367
Yes.

419
00:23:20,928 --> 00:23:22,167
I was a soldier all my life.

420
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,567
That's good.

421
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,367
All three generations of my family
were soldiers.

422
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,167
Me, my son,

423
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:32,248
which was Shichuan's father, and Shichuan.

424
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:33,567
Back then, we were known as

425
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,367
armed police firefighters.

426
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:39,288
Today, we know them as firefighters.

427
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,488
Since both of us were soldiers,

428
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,208
I was thinking

429
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:44,208
that we should chat like soldiers.

430
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:45,647
Let's cut straight to the chase

431
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,887
without beating around the bush.

432
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:47,728
Okay.

433
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,087
I'm here today

434
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:54,248
because I know that you two

435
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:57,087
have opinions regarding
Shichuan and Xu Lai's

436
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:58,087
relationship.

437
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,528
I just want to ask

438
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:02,167
whether it is because
he isn't refined enough.

439
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,688
Or is it because of the risky nature

440
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,327
of his job?

441
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,488
What's the reason?

442
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,048
I do respect firefighters.

443
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:12,567
However, as Xu Lai's mother,

444
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:13,647
I do have my concerns.

445
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:16,127
I divorced her father a long time ago.

446
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,647
I feel like we've let down our child.

447
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:19,567
Therefore,

448
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:21,448
I take her marriage seriously.

449
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:24,647
I understand.

450
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:26,887
I understand your feelings completely.

451
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:29,167
I just want to tell you

452
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:30,248
about my experience

453
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,407
and how Shichuan grew up.

454
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:37,567
Have you regretted

455
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,327
being a soldier?

456
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:45,048
I did.

457
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,647
I regretted it after divorcing her mother.

458
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,248
I never regretted it.

459
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,327
I never regretted it,

460
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:03,127
even when my son sacrificed his life

461
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:04,928
during a rescue mission.

462
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:07,688
I never regretted it before.

463
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,528
It's because I know that
I belong to the country

464
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,567
once I wear the uniform.

465
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,647
I have to obey the country

466
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:16,528
and its people.

467
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:18,728
However,

468
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:20,768
when Shichuan

469
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:22,847
wanted to be a firefighter,

470
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,488
I objected to it.

471
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:27,567
It's because I know

472
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:28,807
this occupation is too risky.

473
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:31,928
Back then, I had much more concerns

474
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,367
than you guys.

475
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:35,688
I was afraid

476
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,728
that I might lose my grandson.

477
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:41,567
He is the core of our family.

478
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,607
He's my only kin.

479
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,567
However, Shichuan kept trying

480
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,248
to persuade me.

481
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:55,367
My mindset

482
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,768
was transformed gradually.

483
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:01,607
I think Shichuan is right.

484
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,367
We are able to live in peace

485
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:10,407
only because of their existence.

486
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:11,528
This occupation

487
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:15,327
should be respected by society.

488
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:18,008
However,

489
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,607
they cannot pursue love

490
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:24,208
like ordinary people do.

491
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,048
They cannot ask for love,

492
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:28,807
love others,

493
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,288
or establish a family.

494
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,167
I think

495
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:35,448
that's pretty unfair.

496
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,208
I came here today

497
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:40,167
just to ask you guys

498
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,008
to give Shichuan a chance.

499
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:46,008
Give him a fair chance.

500
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,847
Give him the right to love others.

501
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:51,488
Give him the right to accept love.

502
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:53,607
Give him the right
to establish a family.

503
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:56,928
I'm not eloquent.

504
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:57,728
I don't know

505
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:00,688
if you guys get my point or not.

506
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:03,448
I came here abruptly
without notifying you guys.

507
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:04,607
Sorry for the interruption.

508
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,008
I...

509
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,167
As a retired soldier,

510
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,607
let me give you a salute.

511
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:21,968
Thanks.

512
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:25,847
Sorry for the interruption.

513
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:45,807
Go back.

514
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:05,448
Again!

515
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,288
Nice shot! Again!

516
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:37,407
Come!

517
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:41,688
I...

518
00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:47,807
Why didn't you tell me

519
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:48,968
that you were coming?

520
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,968
I have something very important to tell you.

521
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,248
What is it?

522
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:56,127
My father called me just now.

523
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:57,847
He said your grandfather
went to my house.

524
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:00,087
After that, my mother
had a change of heart.

525
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,087
Grandpa is amazing indeed.

526
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:04,407
Was it your doing?

527
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,167
I've spent a lot of efforts

528
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,847
in order to win your parents' hearts.

529
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:09,887
Why are you so nice?

530
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:12,607
However,

531
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,887
my mother hasn't
been convinced completely.

532
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,288
You have to perform well
for the next few days.

533
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:18,367
You must strike while the iron is hot.

534
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,248
Don't worry. I'll perform well.

535
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:21,928
Do you know what to do?

536
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,407
I do.

537
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:24,968
Put me down, Jin Shichuan!

538
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:25,807
Is this okay?

539
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,607
Her parents said yes!

540
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:28,448
Put me down!

541
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:30,887
Her parents said yes!

542
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,248
Her parents said yes!

543
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:34,768
Put me down first!

544
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:35,847
Her parents said yes!

545
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:38,528
- Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

546
00:29:38,728 --> 00:29:41,248
- Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

547
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:47,728
I'm a little nervous.

548
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:51,887
Don't be nervous.

549
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,567
You can do it.

550
00:29:58,647 --> 00:29:59,127
After you.

551
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:01,647
Look at how terrified you are.

552
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:06,488
Dad, Mom.

553
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:07,887
Our baby girl is back.

554
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:08,928
Jin, you're here too?

555
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:10,728
Everything is ready.

556
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:11,448
We were waiting for you guys.

557
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,087
You're here, huh?

558
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:21,887
Come inside.

559
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:22,728
Come.

560
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:23,968
Come inside.

561
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:25,448
Mr. Xu.

562
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,248
Look at this child.

563
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:28,567
He bought so many things for us.

564
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,127
What a waste of money.

565
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:34,928
Mr. Xu,

566
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,167
are you changing the light bulbs?

567
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:36,807
Yeah.

568
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,847
I think the house is pretty dark.

569
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:39,688
I'm changing the bulbs.

570
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:41,528
Let me do it.

571
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,288
Be careful.

572
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:44,928
Mom, I'll help you out.

573
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:01,488
Don't get shocked.

574
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:03,367
It'll be fine.

575
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:04,807
Here you go.

576
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:06,887
Be careful.

577
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,248
You did it in one go.

578
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:12,807
Look at you.

579
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:14,847
Jin,

580
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,807
change that bulb too later.

581
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,887
Okay. Jin, come.

582
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:21,728
Let's lift the sofa.

583
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:22,327
Okay.

584
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:23,567
I'll remove the carpet.

585
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:24,768
Lift this side.

586
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,607
This side?

587
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:26,887
I'll remove it.

588
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:27,847
You want to remove it?

589
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:33,048
Jin, you're really muscular.

590
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,167
I'm sure you're very fit.

591
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:39,248
Do you go to the gym often?

592
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,528
That's not it. We just have
plenty of physical training.

593
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,647
I'll lift this side.

594
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:44,647
Slowly.

595
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:47,048
Mom, you can find Jin Shichuan

596
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:47,887
when you need help.

597
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:49,248
He's amazing. He knows everything.

598
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,208
You can find him if you have

599
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,968
faulty electronic devices or circuits.

600
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:54,448
He's a firefighter. He knows everything.

601
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:55,847
I'm looking for a son-in-law,

602
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,167
not a technician.

603
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,728
We have to be practical in life, right?

604
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:03,488
You can rest at ease

605
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:05,567
when he's able to
take care of me, right?

606
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:14,728
Good job!

607
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:21,208
Dad!

608
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:23,488
Dad!

609
00:32:25,688 --> 00:32:26,647
Dad, what's wrong?

610
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:28,688
I sprained my waist.

611
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:30,528
Jin Shichuan,

612
00:32:30,768 --> 00:32:31,607
carry my father to the hospital!

613
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:32,768
Hurry!

614
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:34,367
Are you sure he can carry me?

615
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:34,887
He can!

616
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:36,288
Alright then.

617
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,407
Carry me then.

618
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:39,928
Come.

619
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:41,968
Okay.

620
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:44,327
Okay.

621
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:46,087
I'll head to the hospital then.

622
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:48,248
Slow down.

623
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,248
I can't walk now.

624
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:53,327
Slowly.

625
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:53,768
Be careful.

626
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:54,968
Jin, be careful.

627
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:55,407
Slow down.

628
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:56,008
Hug me tighter.

629
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:57,127
Am I heavy?

630
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:58,607
I'm used to carrying weights

631
00:32:58,807 --> 00:32:59,567
while ascending stairs.

632
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:00,528
Is that so?

633
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:01,407
How's your waist?

634
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:02,807
My waist is fine.

635
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:03,647
Xu Chengyun,

636
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,288
stop pretending.

637
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,248
Do you think I'm a fool?

638
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:11,567
You broke the bulbs

639
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:12,327
and pretended to sprain your waist

640
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,127
so that he could

641
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:14,288
show his skills, right?

642
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,288
That's dirty of you.

643
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,127
Do you think he's a laborer?

644
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,048
Get down.

645
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:25,847
Stay here for dinner.

646
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,488
You didn't get to
try my cooking last time.

647
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:28,688
You can try it this time.

648
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:30,807
Mission accomplished!

649
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:32,488
Thank you, Mrs. Xu!

650
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:33,728
Let's go.

651
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:35,647
Are you sure your waist is fine?

652
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:36,208
Yeah.

653
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,208
Be careful.

654
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:37,728
I'm fine.

655
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:39,807
Kid, slow down.

656
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:42,327
Jin, eat up.

657
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:43,288
Come.

658
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:44,367
Have a try.

659
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:45,248
Have a try.

660
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,208
Listen,

661
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,127
you contributed a lot today.

662
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,048
Later,

663
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,288
your mother and I will head home

664
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,607
after dinner.

665
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,327
Your mother can't sleep well

666
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,567
if she's not sleeping on her own bed.

667
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:57,528
Yeah.

668
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,048
I'll head home later.

669
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,327
You should come back too.

670
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,528
Don't stay outside.

671
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:04,208
People will gossip about you
if news of this gets out.

672
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,528
You're not married to him yet.

673
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:06,768
You need to be more reserved

674
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:07,887
when you date Jin.

675
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:10,328
Why are you staring at your food?

676
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:11,727
You should thank your mother.

677
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:13,048
Your mother

678
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:14,647
has given you her approval.

679
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,087
Not entirely.

680
00:34:16,808 --> 00:34:17,368
Alright.

681
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:18,767
It depends on Jin's performance.

682
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:20,808
I won't agree to it

683
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:21,687
if he lets my daughter

684
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:22,928
suffer.

685
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:25,567
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu,

686
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,328
I promise you guys

687
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:29,127
that I'll treat her well.

688
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:31,127
I won't let her suffer at all.

689
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,287
You two can supervise,

690
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:35,408
test, and inspect me at all times.

691
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:36,928
Okay.

692
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:39,008
Eat up.

693
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:39,767
Eat up.

694
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:49,328
Are you bringing your pajamas?

695
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:50,448
Nope.

696
00:34:59,207 --> 00:34:59,727
What about this?

697
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:00,968
Nope.

698
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:02,567
Fine then.

699
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:05,767
What's on your mind?

700
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:08,448
I am thinking about this house.

701
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:10,488
Look.

702
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:12,808
Your house was empty in the first place.

703
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:14,207
Once I leave,

704
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:15,567
it'll be more desolate.

705
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:17,207
Yeah.

706
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,687
I'll return to the station
while you'll move back home.

707
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:21,567
The house will become vacant again.

708
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:24,328
But I've already developed feelings

709
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:25,167
for this place.

710
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,607
Whenever I feel helpless,

711
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:29,888
this place acts as my shelter.

712
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,687
It provides me with a sense of security

713
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:33,368
and warmth.

714
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,048
But I think it is because

715
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:36,928
you are around.

716
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,087
A home should look like a home.

717
00:36:16,328 --> 00:36:17,448

722
00:36:26,048 --> 00:36:27,087
You took this photo

723
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,287
as I was training them.

724
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:29,287

00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,767

Morning, Zhou.

00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:27,647
Zhou?

772
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:30,767
Ms. Xu, were you calling for me?

773
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,287
You looked distracted.
What's on your mind?

774
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:35,767
Ms. Xu,

775
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:39,087
today the internship-to-full-time-employee
name list

776
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:39,848
will be coming out.

777
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,328
I'm a little worried.

778
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:43,328
Don't worry.

779
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:44,647
You perform well.

780
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:45,848
I'm sure they'll let you stay.

781
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:50,767
Come.

782
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:51,767
I'm returning to work today.

783
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:52,968
I'm buying everyone here coffee.

784
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:54,647
Everyone has one.

785
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,328
Why are you guys still sitting? Come.

786
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,368
Come here.

787
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:00,647
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

788
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:01,808
Here, have some coffee.

789
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:02,928
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

790
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,127
Don't mention it.

791
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:04,928
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

792
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:05,647
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

793
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:06,567
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

794
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:07,328
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

795
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:07,848
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

796
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:08,968
Take it yourself.

797
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:09,567
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

798
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:10,207
Take it yourself.

799
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:10,687
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

800
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:11,968
Thank you, Ms. Jiang Xin.

801
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:12,647
Don't mention it.

802
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:13,087
Thank you, Ms. Xin.

803
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:14,727
Do you know how many interviews

804
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,888
she had done prior to coming back?

805
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,767
I heard that her interviews
were pretty well-received.

806
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:21,207
She's experienced after all.

807
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:22,287
Of course she's capable.

808
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:26,287
Xu Lai,

809
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:27,607
here's your coffee.

810
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:29,607
Thanks. But I don't
take coffee in the morning.

811
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:30,368
I'll have a gastric attack
if I take coffee.

812
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,247
Actually, I've been
doing some reflections

813
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:35,968
during my suspension.

814
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,368
I was too competitive in the past.

815
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:41,247
Let me apologize to you.

816
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:43,008
Let's get along in the future.

817
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:45,127
You don't need to apologize.

818
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:46,567
We're colleagues after all.

819
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:49,408
Ms. Xin, I will get along with you

820
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:50,247
as long as you don't

821
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:51,008
make things difficult for me.

822
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:52,328
Excuse me, I have something to do.

823
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:01,207
Zhou, here's your coffee.

824
00:40:03,408 --> 00:40:04,968
I have an important announcement to make.

825
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:07,448
Our station has already
issued a notice.

826
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:08,848
Next month,

827
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,127
I will be transferred away

828
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,647
from my position

829
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:14,408
to assume a post
in the provincial TV station.

830
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,287
Okay. Thank you.

831
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:20,767
After my departure,

832
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,687
the position of Chief will be vacant.

833
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,528
After my observation,

834
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:26,368
I think

835
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,567
Xu Lai has always excelled in her work.

836
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,848
And, she has
an optimistic attitude as well.

837
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,607
That's why I've recommended

838
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:38,127
Xu Lai to be the next Chief.

839
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:38,888
Thank you, Chief.

840
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:40,008
I will work hard

841
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:40,767
so that I won't let you down.

842
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:42,247
You can do it.

843
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:44,528
Besides that,

844
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,687
the internship-to-full-time-employee
name list

845
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,767
will be out soon.

846
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:49,207
It will be announced in two days.

847
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:51,968
Any questions?

848
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:54,207
If not,

849
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:55,368
we'll end our morning meeting here.

850
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:56,368
Get back to work.

851
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:12,888
Chief,

852
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:15,368
I have a question.

853
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,287
Is Zhou included in

854
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:18,368
the internship-to-full-time-employee
name list?

855
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:19,928
I think

856
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:20,647
he has great potential.

857
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:21,368
He's hardworking too.

858
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,207
I want to keep him around.

859
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,087
About that,

860
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:27,687
that's under the HR department.

861
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:29,008
Don't worry about it.

862
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:31,008
Remember this.

863
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,048
Although I did recommend you

864
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:34,607
to be the next Chief,

865
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,528
it still depends on your performance

866
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,727
whether you get the post or not.

867
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:41,287
Try your best not to mess anything up

868
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,808
during such a crucial moment,

869
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:43,448
okay?

870
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:44,968
Okay.

871
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,167
What are you doing now?

872
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:06,247
Have you eaten?

873
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:10,687
No.

874
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:12,647
This sounds too childish.

875
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,207
I should be more mature.

876
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:20,808
Remember to take your meals on time.

877
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:22,888
I'll be worried

878
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,647
if your gastric issue acts up again.

879
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:31,808
Captain Jin?

880
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:32,607
You...

881
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:34,008
Did you hear that?

882
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:36,528
I would rather I didn't.

883
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,287
So now, you can draw comics too?

884
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:48,207
Don't look.

885
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:52,488
As if I want to look at it.
I'll take a bath.
