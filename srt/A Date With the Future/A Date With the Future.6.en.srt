25

I hear you.

I hear you.

I...

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,199
I'm worried

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,799
about Zang Qiu.

31
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,919
Help me tell her.

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,479
Tell her she must live a happy life.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,359
Promise me.

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,199
Don't let Zang Qiu

35
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,679
see

36
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
how I look now.

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,320
I promise.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,079
I promise.

39
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,600
I...

40
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,040
I hope

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I can always be

42
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,479
how I looked like

43
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,640
in her heart.

44
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,879
Fang Huai.

45
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,439
Fang Huai.

46

Fang Huai!

Doctor!

49
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:09,640
Mr. Huo.

50
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,119
The information
you wanted me to investigate.

(Jin Shichuan, Huaigang Fire and

The new mall at Nangang Road

53
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,679
will operate next week, right?

54
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes.

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,319
Contact the fire brigade

56
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,799
and say

57
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,359
we can provide them

58
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,439
a safe drill venue.

59
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,359
The venue is the new mall.

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
All right. I'll arrange it.

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,439
This is our

62
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:46,879
latest console.

63
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Do you think it's fine?

64
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:51,239
Captain Jin.

65
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
It's clean inside

66
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,080
and it's not leaking.

67
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,799
The date is normal. There's no problem.

68
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:57,919
Captain Jin, over here.

69
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:00,879
This is

70
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,799
our latest system.

71
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:02,799
Take a look.

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,080
Captain Jin.

73
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,119
Many cars are parked here.

74
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,200
It affects the fire escape.

75
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,720
All right. Let me mark it down

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,879
and deal with it immediately.

77
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,080
This way, please.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
This is our fire safety equipment.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:24,919
Here.

80
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,960
Take a picture.

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
We are familiar
with the surroundings now.

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,520
You just need

83
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,879
to take note of the few points

84
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,960
we mentioned just now.

85
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:32,840
Sure.

86
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,119
Thankfully, we got

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,840
Captain Jin

88
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,840
to check the situation

89
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,600
before the mall opens.

90
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:37,999
Otherwise, we won't know

91
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,200
there are so many points

92
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,879
that we need to take note

93
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,359
regarding the mall's safety.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
- Thank you.
- Captain Jin.

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,559
We meet again.

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,359
Mr. Huo.

97
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,400
Thank you for sparing some time

98
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
from your busy schedule

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,520
to give

100
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,840
precious suggestions to my mall.

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,960
You're welcome.

102
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,280
Preventing safety hazards

103
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
is our duty.

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
You saved Xu Lai previously.

105
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,439
I have been trying to

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,479
find a chance to thank you.

107
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
Since we meet today,

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,799
why don't we have a meal together?

109
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,439
There's no need.

110
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,520
We need to return to the brigade.

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,080
Yes.

112
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,799
Captain Jin.

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,119
Can I speak to you alone?

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,919
Captain Jin.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,559
I grew up with Xu Lai.

116
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,559
She is very important to me.

117
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,040
Since Mr. Huo made the effort

118
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,080
to bring me here,

119
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,319
there's no need to beat around the bush.

120
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
Just be direct.

121
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,280
I'll be straightforward then.

122
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,919
Xu Lai is pure.

123
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,919
She might make mistakes

124
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,080
in terms of her relationship
and the person she fell in love with.

125
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't want to see her get hurt.

126
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,512
As you mentioned,

127
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,119
I need to prevent safety hazards.

128
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,720
So, I hope

129
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,040
you can

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,999
keep your distance from Xu Lai.

131
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,160
Captain Jin, you are smart.

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,319
I'm sure you know what I mean.

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Xu Lai is an independent adult.

134
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,520
She has her own choice

135
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,919
and her own judgement.

136
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:01,999
If she is

137
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,840
very important to you,

138
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:04,999
you should advise her directly

139
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,919
and not say these words to me.

140
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,439
After all, she is your friend

141
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,760
and I'm not.

142
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,119
Farewell.

143
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,080
Hu is finally

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
willing to step outside

145
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,760
and go downstairs.

146
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,799
He even interacted with many people.

147
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,000
He likes to communicate with people.

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,799
That's great.

149
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,319
Perhaps Hu will understand

150
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,719
after this incident

151
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,679
that the family

152
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,679
can no longer rely on you alone.

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,839
Hu.

154
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,559
Granny Mo is old.

155
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm sure she wants you

156
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
to be independent soon

157
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,040
so you can take care of yourself.

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,280
Shichuan.

159
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Captain Jin.

160
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,520
Granny Mo.

161
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,160
Hu.

162
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,280
I bought this for you.

163
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,040
- Look.
- Thank you.

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,959
Why are you here?

165
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,559
Captain Jin.

166
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,360
You must cherish

167
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,839
a girlfriend like Ms. Xu.

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,719
Next time,

169
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,199
both of you can

170
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,240
got to my house together.

171
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Let me cook a good meal for you.

172
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:06,480
How is that?

173
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,040
Granny Mo, you...

174
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:07,760
Thank you, Granny Mo.

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,640
We will go.

176
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:09,752
See?

177
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:10,799
You need to

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,719
listen to your girlfriend
when it matters.

179
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,120
We will be leaving then.

180
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,120
Bye.

181
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,199
Come together next time.

182
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,760
Sure!

183
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,160
Let's eat together.

184
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,640
Sure!

185
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,439
I can't drink according to

186
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,360
the brigade's rules.

187
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,719
It's fine.

189
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,679
I'll drink then.

190
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,160
You actually

191
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,439
asked me to have a meal with you.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,559
Cheers.

193
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Actually, I asked you out

194
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,839
to make something clear to you.

195
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't want you to confuse

196
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,919
what's known as a relationship.

197
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,040
If you want to
return the favour of saving you,

198
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,679
rushing into the fire
to save me that day

199
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,919
was already good enough.

200
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,959
We are even and don't owe each other

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
anything now.

202
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:33,959
Fine.

203
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm no longer

204
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,760
the child from ten years ago.

205
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,599
If you say that ten years ago

206
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
I mistook you saving me

207
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,480
as having feelings for you,

208
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,120
I might be able to accept it.

209
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,199
Ten years already passed now.

210
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,120
Liking someone might be on impulse

211
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,360
but love is not.

212
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,480
My feelings for you
are not out of kindness

213
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,959
and not on impulse.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
It's a women's love towards a man.

215
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:16,559
Do you know me?

216
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,520
I used to

217
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,559
see my teammate

218
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,079
die in front of me.

219
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,400
Do you understand

220
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,120
the feeling of the person closest to you

221
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,360
sacrificing in front of you?

222
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,199
Have you seen a broken

223
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
hyperaemic arm?

224
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
There was once

225
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,799
when I tried to
rescue a person in the rubble.

226
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
I wanted to pull him.

227
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,799
When I did,

228
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,079
his arm snapped off.

229
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,599
Things like these

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,480
might be scary for most people

231
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,120
but all of these

232
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,640
are what I usually face.

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,319
Danger

234
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,199
and sacrifice

235
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,400
is my job

236
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,919
and my life.

237
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,120
I have no time and energy

238
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,880
to love someone else

239
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,959
because my mission is to save people

240
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,079
and fight fires.

241
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
I won't start a family

242
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
and fall in love with anyone

243
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,000
because I have no way

244
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,520
to give anyone a promise

245
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:36,719
and a future.

246
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,959
Since you asked me out for a meal,

247
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,160
I thought

248
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,240
you were ready

249
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,319
to accept me.

250
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,199
However, I still got rejected.

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,959
Making things clear

252
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,480
is good for both of us.

253
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,640
Actually,

254
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,480
I admire your ideal

255
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
and respect

256
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,199
your passion

257
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,240
for being a firefighter.

258
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,679
I also have no way

259
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,919
of refuting your reason
for rejecting me.

260
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
However, I want to tell you

261
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,679
that I won't give up.

262
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,319
Apart from

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,559
your reason for being a firefighter,

264
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
Do you

265
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,599
really don't have any feelings

266
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,319
towards me?

267
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:10,919
No.

268
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,319
Stop drinking.

269
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:44,640
Do you know?

270
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,480
In order to see you,

271
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,400
I've waited ten whole years.

272
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,480
To me,

273
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,520
you are my youth.

274
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,480
From the moment I decided to come back,

275
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,760
I told myself

276
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,520
that I must

277
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,880
make up for the ten years

278
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,280
I lost.

279
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,640
I will also

280
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,439
love you unreservedly

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
because you are the one for me.

282
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,280
I also know

283
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,040
that you are worth it.

284
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,319
Do you think

285
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,360
I get myself rejected by you every day

286
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,319
because I've lost my dignity?

287
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,559
Do you think

288
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,199
I'm waiting for your reply
while holding my phone every day

289
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,719
because I'm too free?

290
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,719
Do you think

291
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,079
I went into the fire to save you

292
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,959
only because I was brave?

293
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,640
Do you think

294
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,559
I pretend to be indifferent every day

295
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,919
but my heart

296
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:26,679
does not feel sad

297
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,599
and disappointed?

298
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,000
I did everything

299
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,640

Captain Jin is still out.

It'll be lights out soon.

328
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,079
This isn't like him.

329
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
He doesn't really come back late.

330
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,920
Yes.

331
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:35,280
Isn't this Captain Jin?

332
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,119
Captain Jin.

00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,280

Something's wrong with Captain Jin.

337
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,960
Something must have happened.

338
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,440
This speed is too fast.

339
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,119
Captain Jin.

340
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,839
Did you not sleep well last night?

341
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
You look pale.

342
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,079
Do you have something on your mind?

343
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,480
What's wrong?

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,760
I don't know.

Captain Jin.

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,280
Are you all right?

347
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:54,119
Keep up.

348
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:00,920
Final five kilometres!

349
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,760
Keep up!

00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,200
Did something instigate him?

352
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't know.

353
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
He was like this
since he came back last night.

354
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,920
Talk to Captain Jin.

355
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,559
If we run five kilometres

356
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,319
with this speed,

357
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,680
we will die.

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,599
Why talk to him?

359
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,480
Captain Jin is in a bad mood.

360
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:16,480
Let's vent his frustration with him.

361
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

362
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,119
We also want to do that

363
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,119
but we are

364
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,839
out of breath.

365
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,520
Forget it.

366
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,119
Right?

367
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,040
It's just five kilometres.

368
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:22,879
Come.

369
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's shout it out

370
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,399
and show Captain Jin our support!

371
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,760
Yes.

372
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,520
One, two, three.

373
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,399
Five kilometres! I love you!

374
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,280
Five kilometres! I love you!

375
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,159
Five kilometres! I love you!

376
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
You kissed Jin Shichuan?

377
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,799
It was also your first kiss?

378
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,200
Although I got rejected again,

379
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,359
I didn't lose anything.

380
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:09,920
At least

381
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
I gave my first kiss

382
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,280
to my first love.

383
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,559
If Huo finds out about this...

384
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,879
What does it have to do with him?

385
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,960
No.

386
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Not just Huo.

387
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I think so too.

388
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,440
Don't you think the speed

389
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,839
of your relationship's development

390
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,040
is too fast?

391
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,879
I was drunk

392
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,280
and I was shocked.

393
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
I failed to control myself.

394
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,040
Are you planning to catch him again?

395
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,119
Of course, not.

396
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm telling you.

397
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,520
There's no point

398
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,480
in clinging on to him anymore.

399
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,200
What will you do then?

400
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:46,839
I admit

401
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:47,960
that I like him a lot

402
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,359
but that doesn't mean

403
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,159
I need to

404
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,280
throw away my dignity.

405
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,639
Do you know?

406
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
In a relationship,

407
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,319
it's not necessary
that the person who falls for the other

408
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,399
must be acting petty.

409
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,399
A relationship where you throw away

410
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,240
your dignity is cheap.

411
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,280
No one will care about it.

412
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,680
Are you saying

413
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,319
that you want to give up?

414
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,559
Of course, not.

415
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
I want to change my strategy now.

416
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,399
I'm going on the offensive.

417
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:27,720
Squad Leader.

418
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,440
Come here.

419
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,159
Come here.

420
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,040
What is it?

421
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,399
Do you want to remind Captain Jin?

422
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,319
He has mopped the floor five times.

423
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,159
If he continues,

424
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
the floor will become a mirror.

425
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,399
Is something wrong

426
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,680
with Captain Jin recently?

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,399
Do you realise

428
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,399
that Xu Lai

429
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,680
hasn't been coming here for a long time?

430
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:56,879
No.

431
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:57,639
What does it have to do with Xu Lai?

432
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,799
It has everything to do with her.

433
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,480
What do you mean?

434
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,639
Ever since Xu Lai disappeared,

435
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,480
Captain Jin has been like this.

436
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,240
He seems out of his mind.

437
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm guessing

438
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,440
that he realises how good she is

439
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,280
after losing her.

440
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,566
He is feeling lovesick

441
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:13,879
and is sad.

442
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,240
No way.

443
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,760
Captain Jin is not someone like that.

444
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,920
He won't be affected

445
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,359
because of a woman.

446
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,520
Get to work.

447
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,280
Commissioner.

448
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,000
Jin Shichuan, come here.

449
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,359
Jin Shichuan!

450
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,119
Yes!

451
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:39,839
Come here.

452
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,040
See?

453
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,440
What you said

454
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,639
might be right.

455
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,599
You know nothing.

456
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,680
Shichuan.

457
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,520
The higher-ups have decided to form

458
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,119
a professional earthquake rescue team.

459
00:24:55,672 --> 00:24:56,432
Before that,

460
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,000
they will choose elites
to form a training team

461
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,520
to be in charge of training

462
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,079
before the rescue team is formed.

463
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,159
I've already recommended

464
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,240
you to the higher-ups

465
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,200
to take on the role of
leader of the rescue team.

466
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:07,920
Thank you

467
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,280
for the branch
and the higher-ups' trust.

468
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
The rescue team will have
a search-and-rescue dog unit.

469
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,280
I know

470
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,399
you have experience

471
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,680
in training search-and-rescue dogs

472
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,000
so your first mission
after the training team

473
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,799
is formed

474
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,319
will be to lead everyone

475
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,440
in training search-and-rescue dogs.

476
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I can't train dogs.

477
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,079
Commissioner.

478
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,040
Shichuan.

479
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,879
I know.

480
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,839
The dog you trained

481
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,760
sacrificed during a mission.

482
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,240
Its sacrifice caused huge trauma

483
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,599
and shock

484
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,280
to your heart.

485
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,399
That was why you gave up

486
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,799
on the search-and-rescue dog job

487
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
and came to
the emergency response brigade.

488
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:48,559
However, I want to tell you

489
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,760
that a man should

490
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:50,599
face everything bravely.

491
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,839
Escaping will not solve any problems.

492
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,119
I'm not ready yet.

493
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,599
I have no time for you to get ready!

494
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,280
This is an order!

495
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,520
The higher-ups know about the situation
of the emergency response brigade

496
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,440
and borrowed a professional

497
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,280
dog trainer

498
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,639
from the public

499
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,079
to assist you in your training.

500
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,639
You must cooperate well

501
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,359
with the others.

502
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:13,440
Commissioner.

503
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,720
I have a request.

504
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,359
Say it.

505
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,040
I will only train the team members

506
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,200
and not the dogs.

507
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,839
All right. I agree.

508
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,760
I came up with

509
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,920
a name list of the team members.

510
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,319
When you are in the training team,

511
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,680
there will be

512
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,399
newly recruited firefighters joining in.

513
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:43,799
Familiarise yourself

514
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,480
with their information

515
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
so it's easier for your work later.

516
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,359
Your order letter is also inside.

517
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,910
(Folder)

518
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,440
Yes.

519
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,150
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief Unit)

520
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,340
(Regarding Jin Shichuan's
appointment order)

521
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,100
(Rescue Dog)

522
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:10,170
(Rescue Dog)

523
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,260
(It's a special shooting effect
without the injury of animals.)

524
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:09,260
(It's a special shooting effect
without the injury of animals.)

525
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,720
(Letter of Appointment)

526
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,319
(Ms. Xu Lai is appointed
as Search-and-Rescue Dog Trainer for a month)

527
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,440
Specially Invited
Search-and-Rescue Dog Trainer?

528
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:37,920
Xu Lai.

529
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,000
How many skills

530
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,079
do you still have that I don't know of?

531
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,040
No.

532
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,720
Training dogs has been

533
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,319
a hobby of mine.

534
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,159
When I was abroad,

535
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,040
I got a certificate.

536
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:45,920
After coming back,

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,359
I joined the civil rescue organisation.

538
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,520
Besides,

539
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,799
my main duty is also

540
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,079
in firefighting

541
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,680
so I want to use this opportunity

542
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:54,720
to document

543
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,240
the process of forming
an earthquake rescue team

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,359
and make a special report regarding it.

545
00:30:59,359 --> 00:30:59,960
This is

546
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,720
a very rare
interview opportunity indeed.

547
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,240
Especially when you are participating.

548
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
You can go in-depth

549
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,280
with the interview content.

550
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:09,920
Go ahead.

551
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,680
I approve.

552
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Wait.

553
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,231
You can't leave
and join the rescue team.

554
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,799
Otherwise, I will lose

555
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,720
another capable member.

556
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,639
Don't worry.

557
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:18,319
Being a reporter

558
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,520
is my main job.

559
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:20,639
Reporting

560
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,639
is my final goal.

561
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,159
Give me good news.

562
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,720
Thank you, Chief.

563
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,000
I heard Xu Lai is taking a leave

564
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,079
to become
a search-and-rescue dog trainer.

565
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,200
Trainer?

566
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,960
No wonder I always see her

567
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,960
going around with dogs.

568
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,871
I heard the team leader

569
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is Jin Shichuan again.

570
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:38,960
Previously,

571
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,399
she insisted on
doing the firefighting topic

572
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,839
and goes to become a trainer this time.

573
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,319
Do you think...

574
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,119
That's impossible.

575
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,960
Isn't she

576
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,920
with Huo Yanzong?

577
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,359
Who would abandon a rich man

578
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,680
and go be with a firefighter?

579
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,799
Hello, Huo.

580
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,280
Let's have a meal at Qiancao tonight.

581
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,559
Tonight?

582
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:05,040
Sure.

583
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,240
See you after work.

584
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,040
I haven't contacted him for a week.

585
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,599
I wonder how he's doing now.

586
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,520
No.

587
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,559
I must endure.

588
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,440
Endure.

589
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,000
I heard

590
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,079
you took a leave
to join the rescue team.

591
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,000
How do you know that?

592
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,440
I'm being considerate.

593
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't really want

594
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,520
to see you go away for a month.

595
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,559
Will you not want me to go away?

596
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,639
Previously,

597
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,839
I didn't like you indeed.

598
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,559
When I think about it,

599
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,599
it's better to have
another friend than an enemy.

600
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,879
Even if we can't be friends,

601
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,399
there's no need
to fight against each other.

602
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,359
We are in the same team after all.

603
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:04,720
When you are doing well,
I'll also benefit.

604
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,280
Right?

605
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,671
It's best

606
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,760
if you can think that.

607
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:12,960
Go with peace of mind.

608
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,240
I'll ask Liu

609
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,399
to take care of your work here.

610
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,440
She will keep you updated.

611
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,040
Thank you.

612
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:21,760
I saw the photo

613
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,799
on your phone.

614
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,520
Isn't he

615
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,680
the captain of the fire brigade?

616
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,720
I heard

617
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,720
you are close to him.

618
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:28,399
Who did you hear it from?

619
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm going back to work.

620
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,000
Am I being too obvious?

621
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,260
(Huaigang TV Station)

622
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,399
Mr. Huo.

623
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Are you waiting for Xu Lai?

624
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,799
What is it?

625
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,079
Xu Lai took a month's leave

626
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,239
to join the rescue team.

627
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,239
Did she tell you about it?

628
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,800
It seems like
you still don't know about it.

629
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,239
Well,

630
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,599
why would she tell you anyway?

631
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,559
After all,

632
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,719
she is going there for another man.

633
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,040
What are you trying to say?

634
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,239
It's nothing.

635
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,480
I only think

636
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,679
you will be interested.

637
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,599
I heard the rescue team's leader

638
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,079
is Jin Shichuan.

639
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,599
I'm just

640
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,920
giving you a kind reminder.

641
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,840
You have been supporting Xu Lai.

642
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,239
I hope

643
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,360
you don't end up
with nothing in the end.

644
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,559
Here.

645
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,599
Your usual.

646
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,520
Soda water.

647
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,279
Thank you.

648
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,199
Why isn't Han Fang here yet?

649
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,719
Let me call him.

650
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:11,880
There's no need.

651
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,639
It's just the two of us tonight.
He won't be coming.

652
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Did he go on a date again?

653
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,599
I wanted to see him

654
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,480
before I leave.

655
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:21,920
Once I leave,

656
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I won't be able to see him for a month.

657
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,279
You'll be leaving for a month?

658
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:25,800
Where are you going?

659
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,599
Our city's fire brigade

660
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,239
wants to form an earthquake rescue team.

661
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,559
They also set up

662
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,679
a search-and-rescue dog unit

663
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,239
and need dog trainers.

664
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:34,392
I took a leave from the station

665
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,119
and am going to join them.

666
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,840
Are you going there for Jin Shichuan?

667
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,800
How do you know?

668
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,840
I heard he is the leader

669
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,520
of the earthquake rescue team.

670
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,520
You know so much.

671
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,040
I'm not going

672
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:54,920
for him especially.

673
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
Dog training

674
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,559
is also a hobby of mine.

675
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,159
This is alcohol.

676
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,159
I know.

677
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,360
I just feel like drinking suddenly.

678
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,040
Is something on your mind?

679
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm heartbroken.

680
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,880
Seriously?

681
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:17,920
Were you dating someone?

682
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,480
When was it?

683
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,199
Why didn't I know about it?

684
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Not really.

685
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,920
It's just

686
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,719
a one-sided love.

687
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,119
Who is it?

688
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,920
Do I know her?

689
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,079
No.

690
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,480
Does the girl know you like her?

691
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,960
I have yet to tell her.

692
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:35,759
How would she know?

693
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
This is your fault.

694
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,480
If you like someone,

695
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,840
you should tell her as soon as possible.

696
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,440
But I don't know her feelings.

697
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,559
I'm afraid I will lose her
after I tell her.

698
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,639
We might not even be friends anymore.

699
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,639
You are right

700
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
but I think...

701
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,199
I think you should be brave
and give it a try

702
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,520
if you like someone.

703
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,440
It's better than regretting here.

704
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,159
Are you saying

705
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,800
that I should fight for it?

706
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:05,840
Of course.

707
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,559
We live

708
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
a short life.

709
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,320
Who knows

710
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
what will happen in the future?

711
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,559
I think

712
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,400
if you like someone,

713
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,480
you should grab hold of the person

714
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,520
when the person is still by your side

715
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,559
so you won't have regrets in the future.

716
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,599
Sounds reasonable.

717
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,000
Come.

(China Fire and Rescue)

719
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,840
If there are girls

720
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,040
clinging to you in the future,

721
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,199
just show this.

722
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,520
I guarantee no one

723
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,320
will approach you anymore.

Captain Jin.

725
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,719
It's time to join the training team.

726
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,400
Let's go.

728
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,679
Have you heard?

729
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,480
The leader who will be training us

730
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,360
is Jin Shichuan.

731
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,239
Are you talking about

732
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,360
the Jin Shichuan

733
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,679
who has many achievements
and is one of the top firefighters

734
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,400
in the country?

735
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:50,719
I heard

736
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,679
he is very cruel

737
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,279
in training firefighters.

738
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,040
He is a famous trainer from hell.

739
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:54,960
Besides,

740
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,880
he was born into a military family.

741
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,040
Look how scared all of you are.

742
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,960
Is he as scary as you say he is?

743
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,520
I want to see how capable

744
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,639
this Captain Jin is.

and haven't been
allocated to a unit yet.

who got first place in the
firefighting assessment,

Yes.

of this training

is to form

search-and-rescue dog unit.

767
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,679
Let me tell you my rules.

768
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,599
I don't care how you behave

769
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,559
in the past

770
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,000
or how excellent you were.

771
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,599
In my team,

772
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:01,800
you are my team members.

773
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
You need to do things

774
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,000
according to my standards.

775
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:07,639
In a firefighting team,

776
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
it's all about unity,

777
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,079
efficiency

778
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:11,599
and obedience.

779
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,159
I won't allow anyone in my team

780
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,520
to slack off.

781
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,320
Understand?

782
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,440
Yes!

783
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,279
At ease.

784
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:20,639
Attention!

785
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,239
Gather at the field

786
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,800
in ten minutes.

787
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,040
Attention, everyone!

788
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:25,880
Dismissed!

789
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:26,800
Yes!

790
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,639
Am I mistaken?

791
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:50,639
Isn't this Xu Lai?

792
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
That's right.

793
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:53,639
It's her.

794
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,639
No.

795
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,719
Why is she here?

796
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,440
Hello, everyone.

797
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,599
I am the person in charge

798
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,360
of Extremewind Dog Training Centre.

799
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,559
Our centre

800
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,719
has been in charge

801
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,520
of training dogs for various units.

802
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,840
We are honoured to welcome

803

the police, the fire brigade
and the military police's

804
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
three training teams.

805
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,440
In the coming days,

806
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,559
all of you will

807
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,800
will be led

808
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,639
by our professional trainers

809
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,000
in skill training
for detection dogs, police dogs

810
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,000
and search-and-rescue dogs.

811
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,119
Mr. Zhao Kai

812
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,040

813
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,119

816
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,040

will be in charge of
search-and-rescue dog training.

818
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,040
Everyone,

819
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,119
let's give a round of applause

820
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,001
to welcome the three trainers!

821
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,239
Hello, everyone.

822
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,679
I am Xu Lai.

823
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,599
In the coming days,

824
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,159
I will guide all of you

825
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,639
in search-and-rescue dog training.

826
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,639
Please take care of me.

827
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,400
If you have any questions,

828
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,520
you can ask me directly.

829
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:08,599
Ms. Xu,

830
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,599
is dog training hard?

831
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:11,119
Which dog is easiest to train?

832
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,279
Ms. Xu,

833
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,880
if we have any questions

834
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,559
in dog training,

835
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,920
can we ask you in private?

836
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,480
What?

837
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,719
Do you want her number

838
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,440
or WeChat contact?

839
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,440
Today is the first day of training!

840
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,400
Your dorms

841
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,360
have been assigned.

842
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,199
Go back and clean up.

843
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,440
Yes!

844
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:29,840
Xu Lai.

845
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,159
I didn't expect you

846
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:31,920
to be a dog trainer.

847
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,520
You are amazing.

848
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,000
I learned it when I was abroad.

849
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,000
Don't disturb Xu Lai.

850
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,239
If you have nothing important,

851
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,159
go back and clean up.

852
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,800
I think Captain Jin

853
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,599
should call me

854
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,800
Ms. Xu instead.

855
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,079
I am your trainer.

856
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,639
We are colleagues.

857
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,239
It's not right to call my name directly.

858
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,840
