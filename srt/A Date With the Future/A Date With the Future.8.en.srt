00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:46,646
Okay.

19
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:47,646
I'll go with Peace.

20
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:48,725
He is trained in search and rescue.

21
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:50,006
Okay.

22
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:51,566
Then... What about us?

23
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,006
I'll go with Xu Lai.

24
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:53,926
You go inform Captain Jin.

25
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:54,486
Go.

26
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:55,885
Wear this.

27
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,085
Come, Peace.

28
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:02,365
Mighty!

29
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:04,766
Champ!

30
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:07,365
Mighty!

31
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,165
Champ!

32
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:12,366
Wait.

33
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:13,445
Let's split up.

34
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:14,725
I'll go this way. You search there.

35
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:17,686
Okay. Stay safe.

36
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:18,286
You too.

37
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:19,126
Peace, go.

38
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,406
Mighty!

39
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:22,406
Champ!

40
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:30,366
(After the earthquake,)

41
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:31,925
(I'm afraid)

42
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,286
(to be in a dark space)

43
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,366
(whenever it's raining and thundering.)

44
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:47,686
Captain Jin!

45
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:49,526
Captain Jin!

46
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:52,325
Captain Jin.

47
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,526
What's happened?

48
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,566
Champ and Mighty have gone missing.

49
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:57,765
Ms. Xu

50
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:58,966
and Liu Xu

51
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,725
went to the back of the mountain
to search for them.

52
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:02,165
I'll look for them.

53
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:03,526
Tell me if they come back.

54
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:03,885
Got it.

55
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:16,445
Champ.

56
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,645
Mighty.

57
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:24,165
Champ!

58
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:03,366
Xu Lai!

59
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:20,645
Peace.

60
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:23,366
Peace.

61
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:43,885

Don't be scared.

67
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:01,085
Are you hurt?

68
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:03,686
I'm okay.

69
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,606
Just a sprain.

70
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:11,926

The rain's too heavy.

81
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:45,366
When it slows down,

82
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,486
we'll go and search again, okay?

83
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:52,806
Put me down.

84
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:00,166
Are you okay?

85
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:01,606
Yeah.

86
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,325
I think I sprained it.

87
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:16,645
Your clothes are wet.

88
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,645
Change into this.

89
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,085
As a trainer,

90
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:26,166
you sure lack safety knowledge.

91
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,085
If I hadn't

92
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,046
gone to look for you at the dorm,

93
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:30,845
I wouldn't have known

94
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,285
you went up the mountain.

95
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,126
It's raining so heavily

96
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:36,405
and it's so late.

97
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,285
Didn't you think it'd be dangerous?

98
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,645
Precisely because I'm a trainer

99
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,845
that I had to go up the mountain.

100
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,525
Mighty and Champ are not

101
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:43,525
fully-trained yet.

102
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:44,126
In this circumstance,

103
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,405
they could easily get into trouble.

104
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,366
Also, I said this before.

105
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:49,325
The dog is a handler's companion.

106
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:50,845
Even if I am scared,

107
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:51,726
I would never

108
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:52,445
abandon the dogs.

109
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:54,765
So I must find them.

110
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:55,726
It's my duty.

111
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:02,366
I know

112
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,126
you are a good handler

113
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:05,126
and a good companion.

114
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:06,606
But I still worry.

115
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,246
Next time, you mustn't act on your own.

116
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,486
Inform me beforehand.

117
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,445
You can only do things
with my permission.

118
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:19,806
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,006
By the way,

120
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,126
you said you went to the dorm
to look for me.

121
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:24,965
What for?

122
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:34,926
I went there

123
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:36,965
to give you this.

124
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:39,765
You said you're scared of thunder

125
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:40,806
and darkness, right?

126
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:42,765
Next time it's thundering,

127
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:43,645
turn this on.

128
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:45,246
You won't be scared then.

129
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,126
Huddling closer together

130
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,405
can keep both of us warm.

131
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,366
I wonder if Champ and Mighty

132
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,246
have gone back.

133
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,126
When the rain lets up,

134
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,246
let's look for them again.

135
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:56,525
Don't worry.

136
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:57,846
Search and rescue dogs

137
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,246
won't leave their handlers.

138
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,006
Although their training

139
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,006
is not complete,

140
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,966
they will not forget the scent

141
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,525
of their handlers.

142
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:08,726
No matter where they go,

143
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,565
they'll be able

144
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:11,486
to find their way home.

145
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:12,885
Did such a thing happen to you too?

146
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:14,165
At the time, Windchase...

147
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,006
Are you thinking about Windchase?

148
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:30,765
I know you don't like

149
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:31,765
talking about Windchase.

150
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:35,606
If there comes a day

151
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,206
when you feel like talking about it,

152
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,486
I hope you'll be able

153
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:41,765
to tell me honestly.

154
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,165
Just like how I'm scared of thunder.

155
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,285
You lit this light for me.

156
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:50,606
I hope

157
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,326
I'll be able to light up

158
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,645
the light in your heart too.

159
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,726
I'll go check if the rain is lighter.

160
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:22,206
You're back.

161
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:22,925
Champ.

162
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:26,765
Is Xu Lai back?

163
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,126
Right.

164
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:29,366
I better call Captain Jin.

165
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:29,966
Do it.

166
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:47,486
Windchase!

167
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:56,246
Down.

168
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:56,966
Down.

169
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:58,246
Lie down.

170
00:10:59,486 --> 00:10:59,805
Down.

171
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:02,326
Windchase.

172
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:02,645
Let's go!

173
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:12,486
(Hello?)

174
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:13,565
Hello, Captain Jin.

175
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,126
Liu Xu is back with Champ

176
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:15,885
and Mighty.

177
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:17,925
Got it.

178
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:19,366
(I'm with Xu Lai.)

179
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:20,966
Okay.

180
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:22,285
That's all then.

181
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:24,285
He's with Xu Lai.

182
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:25,246
Okay.

183
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,285
That's good.

184
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:32,645
Wake up.

185
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:37,525
Xu Lai.

186
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,764
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)
Outpatient Department)

187
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:55,846
Doctor.

188
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,086
What's the matter?

189
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:15,925
She got caught in the rain last night.

190
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,405
I think she has a fever.

191
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,726
She also sprained her foot.

192
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:19,525
Please check on her.

193
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:21,726
First, take her temperature outside

194
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,606
and then get an X-ray.

195
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:24,285
Okay.

196
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:26,645
As her boyfriend,

197
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,086
you are really considerate.

198
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:29,645
She's lucky

199
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:30,765
to be your girlfriend.

200
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,126
Not my boyfriend.

201
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,285
But my fiancé.

202
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:42,285
Here.

203
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:43,765
Thanks.

204
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,045
Why am I in the hospital?

205
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,086
Your fiancé brought you here.

206
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:17,805
Fiancé?

207
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:19,645
Your fiancé is so sweet.

208
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:20,525
He stays right here

209
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,366
the whole morning.

210
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,405
Look, he's still holding your hand.

211
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:28,525
I'm not holding your hand.

212
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,206
You're holding onto mine.

213
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:41,246
Here.

214
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,486
But you didn't deny

215
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,966
that you're my fiancé.

216
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,765
Currently, I don't see
any bone fracture.

217
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,486
Just that there's a bit of swelling.

218
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:56,165
The inflammation is quite severe.

219
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,086
Her fever has gone down.

220
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,246
You need a follow-up tomorrow.

221
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,285
So you can stay here today

222
00:15:59,326 --> 00:15:59,966
to be monitored.

223
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:01,086
Stay in the hospital?

224
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:02,525
No way.

225
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,165
It's going to disrupt the training.

226
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,086
I'll get her admitted.

227
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:08,486
Okay.

228
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:10,326
Zang Qiu.

229
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:15,366
Thank you.

230
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:44,645
Why are you sneaking behind my back?

231
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,645
You were so focused

232
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,726
so I didn't want to disturb you.

233
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:51,525
Is it about your injury?

234
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:53,805
Come with me.

235
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:07,605
Lie down.

236
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,166
To check your injury.

237
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,246
What are you doing?

238
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:25,886
Hey.

239
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:27,045
At least say something

240
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:28,285
before you take off my pants.

241
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:30,285
How am I supposed

242
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,446
to check your wound
if I don't take off the pants?

243
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,285
The wound has healed.

244
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:41,686
You got all your shots.

245
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,726
No need to come back.

246
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:44,446
That won't do.

247
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,285
This is the hospital in our area.

248
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:47,325
If I get hurt again

249
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,605
or fall sick,

250
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,325
I'll still have to see you.

251
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:52,125
Then you...

252
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:53,325
Doctor Zang.

253
00:17:59,045 --> 00:17:59,565
Besides,

254
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,085
shouldn't you pay more attention

255
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:01,966
to your blind date?

256
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,446
Shut up, Lu Fangqi.

257
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,045
I think you need
psychiatric intervention.

258
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:13,406
Let's go eat, Doctor Zang.

259
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:14,966
I'll pass.

260
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:15,646
You guys go ahead.

261
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:16,845
I have a surgery at 2 p.m.

262
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,486
Okay, see you later then.

263
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:21,966
It's not good to skip meals.

264
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,045
If human is the iron, food is the steel.

265
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,446
Three meals a day is imperative.

266
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:25,765
I know you work hard.

267
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:27,085
But it's important
to look after your health.

268
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:31,486
What has it got to do with you?

269
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,805
I'm just concerned about you.

270
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:36,845
Why are you concerned?

271
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:39,926
I don't know.

272
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:41,006
I...

273
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,365
Still, I want to be concerned.

274
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:43,605
Although

275
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,805
you are cold and fierce,

276
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:48,125
deep down, you're actually...

277
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,206
Excuse me, Lu Fangqi.

278
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:50,406
Get this straight.

279
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:51,886
You and me

280
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,486
are just doctor and patient.

281
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:54,565
Outside of the hospital,

282
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,125
we're no more

283
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:56,726
than passing strangers.

284
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,166
So keep your concern to yourself.

285
00:18:58,325 --> 00:18:59,006
I don't need it.

286
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:00,325
Understand?

287
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,406
I hope you'll be able

288
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:44,446
to tell me honestly.

289
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:58,966
Hello?

290
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:01,686
Okay.

291
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:02,726
I'll be right there.

292
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:12,603
(Inpatient Department)

293
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,246
Huo.

294
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:39,886
What are you doing here?

295
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:43,406
I heard from Han Fang that
you're in the hospital.

296
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:44,246
Feeling better?

297
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:45,446
Yes.

298
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,006
Li's fried dumplings.

299
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,166
The shop is so far from here.

300
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:54,765
Isn't it about two hours drive?

301
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:56,966
I know it's your favorite.

302
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:58,486
Whatever you like,

303
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,325
I'm willing to get it for you.

304
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:01,166
You're the best.

305
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:04,325
Do you remember?

306
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,166
When we were young,

307
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,486
I always made you skip class with me.

308
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:07,446
We'd take the bus for an hour

309
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:08,565
just to eat these.

310
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:10,886
Of course I remember.

311
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,085
I learned how to climb over walls

312
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:13,805
from you.

313
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:18,686
How nice it is to be young.

314
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:20,125
Free of troubles.

315
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:21,805
Unlike now.

316
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,686
I can't even leave the hospital.

317
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:30,365
Huo.

318
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:31,966
How about we escape one more time?

319
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:44,686
Is the nurse there? Is she gone?

320
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:45,726
No.

321
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,006
What is that?

322
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,406
Captain Jin already has a love rival?

323
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:10,446
Captain Jin.

324
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,006
What are you

325
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:12,805
still doing here?

326
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,206
The enemy is already
knocking at the door.

327
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:15,486
Speak properly.

328
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:16,765
Not in riddles.

329
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,285
I went for a check-up today.

330
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,686
I thought to visit Xu Lai
in the meantime.

331
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:22,646
Guess what I saw?

332
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,686
I saw her hugging

333
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:29,966
another man.

334
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:31,565
They seemed very close.

335
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:32,446
They were almost...

336
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:36,605
Captain Jin.

337
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,246
I know how you feel.

338
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:39,605
Just say the word

339
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:40,605
and I'll go to the hospital with you

340
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:41,486
to take Xu Lai back.

341
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:44,285
You can go on your own.

342
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:47,646
Wait.

343
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,125
That guy was very aggressive.

344
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:49,686
He...

345
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:50,805
What if he wins

346
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:51,285
Xu Lai over?

347
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:53,726
Mind your own business.

348
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,961
(Extremewind Training Center)

349
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,246
Okay, you can go now.

350
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:19,006
See you.

351
00:23:19,926 --> 00:23:21,325
Hold on. There's an eyelash.

352
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:22,565
Where?

353
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:23,966
Here.

354
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,085
What's the deal?

355
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,246
This is a training camp.

356
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:34,006
Not a place

357
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,125
for you two to be cuddling.

358
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:36,565
Who's cuddling?

359
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:41,325
Huo.

360
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,246
Did you mean just now?

361
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:56,565
Just now, an eyelash fell.

362
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,686
Huo was helping me remove it.

363
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,246
Are you fully recovered?

364
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:03,325
Why are you back?

365
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:04,765
I brought Xu Lai back.

366
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:08,325
She's worried about her work.

367
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:10,006
If she's not fully recovered,

368
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:11,525
she should stay in the hospital.

369
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:12,406
She doesn't like

370
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:13,246
being alone in the hospital.

371
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:14,246
Okay, stop it.

372
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:15,646
Let go.

373
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:20,686
Enough!

374
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:24,006
Huo.

375
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:26,285
Jin Shichuan is just worried about me.

376
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:27,966
Don't take it to heart.

377
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,006
I made Huo

378
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,845
bring me back here.

379
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:34,006
I'm better.

380
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:35,765
Besides,

381
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:38,765
I miss you.

382
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,125
Since you're back,

383
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:46,646
go back to the dorm then.

384
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,246
Is this my shirt?

385
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:52,765
I'm taking it then.

386
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:07,765
Outsiders are prohibited

387
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,525
from entering the camp grounds.

388
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:20,045
Huo.

389
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,006
Please don't let what Jin Shichuan said

390
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:23,085
get to you.

391
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:23,805
He can be

392
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:25,085
a little stern sometimes.

393
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,206
But he's a good person.

394
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:29,406
I don't care about him.

395
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,446
I care about you.

396
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:33,365
I know that.

397
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,646
I know you're good to me.

398
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:35,845
Still, I hope

399
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,406
you'll think more favorably of him.

400
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,966
Is my impression of him

401
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,325
really that important?

402
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:44,765
Of course it is.

403
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,006
One is

404
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,125
the person I adore.

405
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:48,726
The other

406
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:50,125
is my most cherished friend.

407
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:51,406
To me,

408
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:52,646
both are equally important.

409
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:00,646
Your mind is already somewhere else.

410
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:01,446
Just go.

411
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,966
Drive safe on your way back.

412
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:06,560
(Extremewind Training Center)

413
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:07,085
I'm off.

414
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:07,926
Bye-bye.

415
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,045
Go on.

416
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,406
Captain Jin, you're still here.

417
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,525
My laces are loose. I'm retying them.

418
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:25,285
Take your time then.

419
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:26,486
Hold on.

420
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:36,565
Didn't I tell you to inform me

421
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,246
when you're leaving the hospital?

422
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:40,206
I did tell you.

423
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,605
Tell me beforehand.

424
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,246
No acting on your own.

425
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:44,325
Did you forget?

426
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:46,285
But I did tell you.

427
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:46,845
See?

428
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,285
You even replied and said "got it".

429
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,686
Huo dropped by to visit me.

430
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:56,006
I got him to cover me

431
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:56,966
so I could escape.

432
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:59,045
You keep talking about this Huo.

433
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:00,686
Are you two very close?

434
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,006
We grew up together.

435
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,045
But don't get me wrong.

436
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,166
We two are practically family.

437
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,325
You're the only one in my heart.

438
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,166
I don't care about your relationships

439
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:17,845
with other people.

440
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:19,765
Is that so?

441
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,886
Do you really not care?

442
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:23,085
Yes.

443
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,125
Really?

444
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:27,365
Are you sure?

445
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:31,325
What's this?

446
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:40,486
You're awake.

447
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:42,166
Let me check your temperature.

448
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:48,966
This is your fiancé's clothes.

449
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:49,805
He left it at the nurse's station.

450
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:50,765
I'll leave it with you.

451
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:51,966
Where is he?

452
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:52,926
He just left.

453
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:53,926
He left?

454
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:55,565
He said something came up

455
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:56,486
and he had to hurry back.

456
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:57,646
But he reminded us

457
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:58,446
before he left

458
00:27:58,446 --> 00:27:59,325
to take good care of you.

459
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:00,726
You shall take the temperature.

460
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:01,565
I'll come back to check later.

461
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:02,246
Thanks.

462
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:18,646
(Jin Shichuan)

463
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,646
(is carrying my hair tie with him.)

464
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,045
I forgot to throw it away.

465
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,045
From what I remember,

466
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,085
you weren't wearing these clothes

467
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:37,605
the day I gave it to you.

468
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:39,605
If you didn't want it,

469
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,325
why did you keep it in your pocket

470
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,646
and carry it around with you?

471
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:46,565
Think whatever you wish.

472
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:49,045
Alright.

473
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:50,285
Then throw it away

474
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,085
in front of me.

475
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:56,726
Childish.

476
00:28:58,605 --> 00:28:59,365
You can throw it away if you want to.

477
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:02,886
You not throwing it away
means you don't want to.

478
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:04,365
It means you care about me!

479
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,845
Double-faced fella.

480
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,285
(You not throwing it away
means you don't want to.)

481
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,845
(It means you care about me!)

482
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:39,966
Thanks.

483
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:43,605
Why aren't you eating?

484
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:44,565
No appetite.

485
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,646
I heard Xu Lai is back at the camp.

486
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:47,486
Did you see her?

487
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,486
Thinking about it some more,

488
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,325
the guy who hugged her seemed familiar.

489
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,125
I think I've seen him

490
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:56,805
on some news.

491
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:01,246
He's the boss of Yunkai Group
or something.

492
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,206
Don't talk so much when you're eating.

493
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:05,686
Okay?

494
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,565
Are you eating that?

495
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:19,325
Thanks.

496
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:20,406
Hurry up and eat!

497
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:21,805
You have ten more minutes.

498
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:25,406
Anyway, Captain Jin.

499
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:27,486
I cleaned your room today.

500
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,726
I emptied your trashcan too.

501
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:29,525
Thanks.

502
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:33,246
What did you say?

503
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,646
I said I cleaned your room

504
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:35,646
and cleared your trash.

505
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,845
You're welcome. Happy to do it.

506
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,125
Who said

507
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,325
you could touch my trashcan?

508
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:43,406
Without my permission,

509
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:44,886
don't touch my trash!

510
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:45,646
Wait.

511
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:48,006
It's trash though.

512
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:49,845
Where's the trash? Where is it?

513
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,805
The entrance.
The garbage station at the door.

514
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:12,246
Captain Jin, what are you looking for?

515
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:13,085
I can help you.

516
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:30,125
Nothing?

517
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:36,486
Found it.

518
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:40,325
You went through the garbage bins

519
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:41,886
just to look for this hair tie?

520
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,726
What's this about?

521
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,006
Clean this up for me.

522
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:01,365
When Xu Lai gets here,

523
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:01,926
you start first.

524
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:03,486
Me? Of course it's me.

525
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:04,006
Ms. Xu.

526
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:04,966
What's up, you two?

527
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:05,486
Ms. Xu.

528
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,325
We heard

529
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:08,206
you were discharged yesterday.

530
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,726
So we want to...

531
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:13,886
To...

532
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:15,646
What are you grumbling about?

533
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:16,565
I'll say it.

534
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:18,006
Ms. Xu.

535
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,166
We want to formally

536
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:20,765
apologize to you.

537
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:22,085
If we hadn't

538
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:22,926
lost the dogs,

539
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,525
you wouldn't have had
to go up the mountain at night,

540
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,325
got drenched in the rain,

541
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,125
and got sick.

542
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:29,686
So sorry.

543
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:31,006
Sorry.

544
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,006
It's okay.

545
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,365
Just don't upset

546
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:34,605
Captain Jin next time.

547
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:35,646
No way.

548
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:36,926
A man needs to be upright.

549
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:38,045
We should admit our mistakes.

550
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,365
That's what Captain Jin taught us too.

551
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:39,966
Yes.

552
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,206
We're really sorry.

553
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,805
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

554
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,006
It's our fault.

555
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:46,845
Looks like you two became buddies

556
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,365
while I was away.

557
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:48,926
Not too bad.

558
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,006
We are not buddies.

559
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:52,765
Okay, get ready for class.

560
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:53,926
In the upcoming lesson,

561
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,125
I'm going to teach some new skills.

562
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:55,765
Yes, ma'am.

563
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:57,605
Forget it.

564
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:04,006
Today's dog training lesson
has been cancelled.

565
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:05,726
Inform the others

566
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:06,726
to practice on their own.

567
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:07,406
Yes, sir.

568
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:09,365
Okay.

569
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:11,605
You may go.

570
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,125
Let's go.

571
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:14,726
Bye, Captain Jin.

572
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:15,486
See you, Ms. Xu.

573
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,805
Why did you cancel my training class?

574
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:20,125
You just recovered.

575
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,006
You're still weak.

576
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:22,845
Take the day off.

577
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,325
Are you worried about me?

578
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:28,045
I just

579
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:29,726
don't want to look after a sick person.

580
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,045
Why do you have to be

581
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,805
so double-faced?

582
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:52,166
Jin Shichuan.

583
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:53,605
What's with that smell?

584
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:55,446
You stink.

585
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:56,285
What did you do?

586
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:58,686
Did you not bath?

587
00:33:58,926 --> 00:33:59,886
No, I bathed.

588
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,166
Why do you stink?

589
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:05,045
Captain Jin, it's all done.

590
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,366
You stink even more.

591
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:10,125
What did you two do?

592
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:11,846
Captain and I

593
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:12,685
went through the garbage bins.

594
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:13,806
Garbage bins?

595
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:16,326
Were you looking
for something important?

596
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:17,766
No, it was just...

597
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,205
For fun.

598
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:23,926
For fun?

599
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,245
Let's take a shower, okay?

600
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:26,926
Okay.

601
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,446
Hold on. I'll help you.

602
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:11,605

Yes, let me grab it for you.

642
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:48,645
What's wrong with your back?

643
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:50,685
It's nothing. Just an old injury.

644
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,045
That won't do.

645
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:53,366
I have the ointment.
I'll get it for you.

646
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,406
No, it's okay.

647
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:00,085
Captain Jin.

648
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:01,926
We just saw

649
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,045
Ms. Xu leaving.

650
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,245
What was she doing here?

651
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:06,926
To take her umbrella.

652
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:08,045
Umbrella?

653
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:09,766
Really?

654
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:11,205
Perfect timing.

655
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,766
Help me with my shoulder.

656
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:13,565
Okay.

657
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,125
Ms. Xu really spares no effort

658
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:20,245
when it's Captain Jin.

659
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:22,006
Did you guys notice?

660
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:23,685
During the rope climbing exercise,

661
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,725
the way Ms. Xu looked at Captain

662
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,846
was full of love and adoration.

663
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:30,605
Right. She's head over heels for Captain Jin.

664
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,006
Stars were shooting from her eyes.

665
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,406
Stop making up stories.

666
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:36,085
Ms. Xu and I

667
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,605
are just colleagues

668
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:39,406
in a professional setting.

669
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,245
No need to deny it, Captain Jin.

670
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,006
Everyone knows that Ms. Xu likes you.

671
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,165
Don't tell me you're not the least bit

672
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:46,725
interested in her.

673
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:49,966
I'll say it one last time.

674
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:52,366
We are just normal colleagues.

675
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:53,605
It's not what you guys think.

676
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:54,926
It might be nothing now.

677
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:56,326
But who knows if there will be anything

678
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:57,645
in the future?

679
00:38:57,926 --> 00:38:58,525
Gosh.

680
00:38:58,886 --> 00:38:59,766
I told you. It's nothing.

681
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:00,565
We are

682
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:02,125
just colleagues, okay?

683
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,685
Co-workers.

684
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:04,725
What's that?

685
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,006
It's a professional relationship.

686
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,045
No, I mean...

687
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:10,406
Right.

688
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:12,245
Captain Jin is right.

689
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:13,406
We are just colleagues.

690
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:16,926
Nothing more.

691
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,565
Go after her, Captain Jin.

692
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:24,406
Aren't you going after her?

693
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,525
Just leave, okay?

694
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:33,446
Let's go.

695
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:34,245
Hurry up.

696
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:37,245
Rest well.

697
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,080
(Extremewind Training Centre)

698
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:47,446
If I knew Ms. Xu was there,

699
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:48,446
I wouldn't have said that.

700
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,006
Everything is fine with you,

701
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:51,446
except for that mouth.

702
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:53,886
You should give that critique

703
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:54,725
to Captain Jin.

704
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,326
Look at him being steely

705
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,326
in front of Ms. Xu.

706
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:59,326
He really made her upset.

707
00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:00,766
If you ask me,

708
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,245
Captain Jin is great

709
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:03,926
except for being dumb at love.

710
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:05,966
To be able to make things so awkward,

711
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:07,165
I have to say, Captain Jin

712
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:08,446
is impressive.

713
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,525
No one can deny his performance skills.

714
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:13,685
Who knew he's even more amazing

715
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:14,486
as an unromantic,

716
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:15,565
straight male.

717
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:16,125
Oh, stop it.

718
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,245
Enough comments from you two.

719
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:19,125
Come now.

720
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,045
Zhang Yang is new so he doesn't know.

721
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:21,886
Don't tell me

722
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:22,886
you don't know how Captain Jin is.

723
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:24,446
Obviously he was thinking about Ms. Xu

724
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,725
and didn't want to affect her.

725
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:26,806
That's why he denied it.

726
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:29,205
So dense.

727
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,006
Do you think Ms. Xu

728
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:33,525
will be able to handle Captain Jin?

729
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:34,605
Let me tell you.

730
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,006
Captain Jin is like an iceberg.

731
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:37,245
And Xu Lai is a fire torch.

732
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:38,565
She'll conquer him sooner or later.

733
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:48,605
The stir fry tomatoes and eggs
is pretty good.

734
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,605
Captain Jin, why aren't you eating?

735
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:56,565
The canteen is almost closing.

736
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:57,806
I worry that Ms. Xu

737
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:58,685
won't get any food.

738
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:06,926
Ms. Xu!

739
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,886
There's no more food.
I saved this for you.

740
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:24,486
It's okay.

741
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:25,966
I don't want

742
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:26,966
people to misunderstand again.

743
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:41,486
Is Captain Jin

744
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:43,125
looking depressed?

745
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:44,446
Don't jest.

746
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:44,846
He's coming.

747
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:45,406
He's coming.

748
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:52,605
If you ask me,

749
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:53,486
women

750
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,525
never say what they mean.

751
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:56,245
Right?

752
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:57,766
They say no,

753
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:59,605
but it doesn't really mean no.

754
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:02,525
They're just upset.

755
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:03,685
They want to be coaxed.

756
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,205
That's what they mean, right?

757
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:06,366
Yes.

758
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,446
Why should you coax her though?

759
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:11,205
You mustn't indulge her.

760
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:12,605
If she doesn't want to eat, so be it.

761
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:13,006
Let her starve.

762
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:14,045
Who cares if she starves?

763
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:17,565
Yeah, that's...

764
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:19,605
You can't spoil her like that.

765
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:22,366
You come late, and you don't get to eat.

766
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:23,886
That's the rule.

767
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:26,085
I... Captain Jin

768
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:27,406
surely won't break the rule

769
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,006
just for Ms. Xu, right?

770
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:33,565
Are you done eating?

771
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:34,806
Yes.

772
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:38,525
Finish this before you leave.

773
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:40,565
Eat it.

774
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:46,446
You and your big mouth.

775
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:47,085
Yeah.

776
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:48,645
Did I say anything wrong?

777
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:00,685
Are you asleep?

778
00:43:07,165 --> 00:43:07,766
Peace.

779
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:09,926
