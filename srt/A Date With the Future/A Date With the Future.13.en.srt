(Xu Lai, Let's Be Together)

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,319
Peace.

19
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,959
Do you miss me?

20
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,640
Peace has been in a bad mood lately.

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
Since you are his trainer,

22
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,239
I brought him here to see you.

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
You didn't reply

24
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:15,920
to my messages.

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,519
And you didn't pick up my calls.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,080
I was afraid that something
happened to you.

27
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:23,679
Are you okay?

28
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,239
What happened?

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,600
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight.

30
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,760
No problem.

31
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,320
I haven't seen you in a long time.

32
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:52,920
That's right.

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,679
What are you looking at?

34
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,320
Go and wait for me in the private room.

35
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:57,999
I'll be there later.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,999
I saw a friend of mine.

37
00:02:59,399 --> 00:02:59,920
Okay then.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,999
I never thought
that I would see you here.

39
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,040
Why are you alone?

40
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,040
I thought you didn't drink.

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,559
What is it? Are you in a bad mood?

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,719
Go away.

43
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,559
Stop pestering me.

44
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't worry.

45
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm not interested

46
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,600
in a man who is pining

47
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,440
for another woman.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,839
I just think

49
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,640
that you are a good man
whom I can be friends with.

50
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,679
What friends?

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,119
I have enough friends.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,679
What's wrong?

53
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,160
Have I stepped on your toes?

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,920
I've been acting as a friend

55
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,119
for 13 years.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,239
What I hate the most

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,559
and what I'm desperate to hang on to

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,799
is this status as her friend.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,559
But now,

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm not even qualified

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
to be her friend.

62
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,120
Can you tell me

63
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,760
what happened?

64
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,880
I hurt a friend.

65
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,519
And I feel guilty about it.

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,359
Do you believe in fate?

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
There's fate between family members,

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
between friends,

69
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,200
and there's fate in love.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,719
I always think

71
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,479
that life is like a crossroad.

72
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,399
Some may walk with you.

73
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,039
As you walk,

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,359
some may disappear

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,399
halfway through it.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,279
But for some,

77
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,719
you won't even

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
have the chance to say goodbye to them.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,599
Because they are already gone.

80
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,959
We don't know

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,640
whom we'll meet at the next crossroad.

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Just like me.

83
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,599
I didn't know that I would

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
meet you again at this crossroad

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,760
ten years later.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,240
You must be tired today.

87
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,399
Let your mind rest.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,320
Don't drink
if you can't hold your liquor.

89
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,039
Now that you are drunk,
I need to take care of you.

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
I am a superstar.

91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,359
Why do I have
to take care of a drunkard?

92
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,440
My new hairstyle is in a mess now.

93
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,800
Where do you live?

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,080
I'll take you home.

95
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,519
Wake up. Where do you live?

96
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:13,519
Wake up.

97
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,560
Tell me where you live

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,159
so I can take you back.

99
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Why did you drink so much?

100
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:49,599
This way.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,760
Be careful.

102
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,800
This way.

103
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,680
Are you awake?

104
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,359
Why are you here?

105
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
This is my house.

106
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,959
Your house?

107
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,080
Why am I...

108
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,680
You don't remember anything?

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,759
I forgot about what happened last night.

110
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,320
If I did something inappropriate to you,

111
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:27,680
I'll apologize to you.

112
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll make it up to you.

113
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,680
How are you going to do that?

114
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,040
I have enough money.

115
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:40,080
But you are quite attractive to me.

116
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,680
Fine. I won't play with you anymore.

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,479
Nothing happened last night.

118
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:51,920
I couldn't bear to see

119
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,759
the CEO of Yunkai Group

120
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,520
sleeping on the street
because he was drunk.

121
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,359
That's why I had no choice

122
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,400
but to bring you back with me.

123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,320
Why are you here?

124
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,160
Huo sent me this location.

125
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,440
Is this your house?

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
Of course.

127
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,080
Come in.

128
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,320
Huo stayed the night at your place?

129
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,239
Where is he?

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,719
He's locking himself in the room.

131
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
What happened between you and Yu Shishi?

132
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,999
What's your relationship with her?

133
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,400
Aren't you going to tell me about it?

134
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
There's nothing between us.

135
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,599
Why did you stay over at her house

136
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,999
if there was nothing between you?

137
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,479
Do I look like a fool?

138
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,239
I was drunk last night.

139
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,839
Nothing happened.

140
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,479
It's up to you to believe it or not.

141
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,680
Looks like I overestimated you.

142
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,359
I thought that you had got smart.

143
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,599
I thought that you found a new woman

144
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,879
after being rejected by Xu Lai.

145
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,040
You already knew?

146
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,959
Xu Lai came to me yesterday.

147
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,639
What did she say?

148
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,160
What else could she say?

149
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,200
She vented out her grievances on me.

150
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,479
But I could tell

151
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,639
that she was quite tormented.

152
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,479
What are you going to do next?

153
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,560
I know Xu Lai.

154
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,839
If I continue to pursue her aggressively,

155
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
she'll only get further away from me.

156
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,080
No.

157
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,320
Are you going to avoid her forever?

158
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,879
I won't give up on Xu Lai.

159
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I will make her come back to me.

160
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,800
(Let me interpret for Peace.)

161
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,040
(Good morning.)

162
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,479
(I just finished running.)

163
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,800
(The weather is great this morning.)

164
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,959
(Good morning.)

165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,479
(The sun is shining brightly today.)

166
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,639
(And it brightens up)

167
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,719
(my mood too.)

168
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,839
(Looks like you are in a good mood.)

169
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,239
(I don't have to worry about you then.)

170
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:56,902
(Xu Lai)

171
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,440
What is it?

172
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,119
Nothing.

173
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,560
I just want to thank you.

174
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Thank you for staying
with me last night.

175
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,959
(It's like you are always there)

176
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,959
(when I feel the most helpless.)

177
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,599
It was like that ten years ago.

178
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
And it's the same ten years later.

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,239
Time flies.

180
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,599
I never thought

181
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
that the girl I saved ten years ago

182
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,759
would come to me ten years later.

183
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,479
(Actually, I've been wanting)

184
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,639
(to ask you something.)

185
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,160
Do you remember

186
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,359
everyone that you've saved?

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
After you rescued me back then,

188
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,639
why did you visit me at the hospital?

189
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,599
Maybe because I saw myself in you.

190
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,520
I saw that you might need help

191
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,759
and comfort.

192
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,359
Because when I felt

193
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,479
the most helpless,

194
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,200
someone had given me the warmth.

195
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,239
He has a trauma on his head.

196
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,479
And it's putting pressure
on his optic nerve.

197
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,719
He'll be temporarily blind.

198
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,920
But don't worry.

199
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,400
He'll recover soon.

200
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,639
Okay. Thank you.

201
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,040
Don't move.

202
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
You are awake, Shichuan.

203
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,879
Don't move.

204
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,879
Where's my mother?

205
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,800
Your mother...

206
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,119
Where's my mother?

207
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,400
Your mother is working right now.

208
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,119
Shichuan, be good.

209
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:15,759
Grandfather.

210
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,239
My mother is hurt too, grandfather.

211
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:17,800
Yes.

212
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,639
I know.

213
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,440
Your mother is...

214
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
What about my father?

215
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,440
Mother said that my father
was in the hospital.

216
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,200
Your mother and father

217
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
have gone somewhere far away.

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
But I'm here with you.

219
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,879
Be a good boy.

220
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,560
Don't cry.

221
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,160
Grandfather, take me

222
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
to my father and mother.

223
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,119
Shichuan, be good.

224
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,800
I want my father and mother!

225
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
Shichuan.

226
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,639
I want my father and mother!

227
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,200
Shichuan, be good.

228
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,999
Shichuan.

229
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,239
I'm here with you.

230
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,359
Grandfather.

231
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,719
I want my father and mother.

232
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,359
I'm here with you.

233
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,800
Mother.

234
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,719
Shi...

235
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,959
Shichuan.

236
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,479
Shichuan.

237
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,719
Shichuan.

238
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:12,999
Shichuan.

239
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,639
What's wrong?

240
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,680
Why are you crying here?

241
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,879
Have you heard?

242
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,639
Something terrible

243
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,719
has happened to Ms. Hu's family.

244
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,920
Yes. It's horrible.

245
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,520
Her husband passed away

246
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,440
when he was on a mission.

247
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,879
And Ms. Hu got into an accident

248
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,040
on her way to the hospital.

249
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,119
Both of them passed away.

250
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,879
Only their son is left behind.

251
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:49,999
That's right.

252
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,359
What will happen to the boy after this?

253
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,119
He lost his parents at such a young age.

254
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,479
How pitiful.

255
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,879
(She's playing the song)

256
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,599
(that my mother wrote.)

257
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,560
Is it nice?

258
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,879
My favorite teacher taught me this song.

259
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,760
She loved to smile.

260
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,520
I'm sure she didn't want
to see you crying.

261
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,280
Can you play the song again?

262
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You have to promise me not to cry then.

263
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
(Did you see her again after that?)

264
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,119
No.

265
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
I just met her briefly.

266
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,839
(I went back to find her after that.)

267
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
But I never saw her again.

268
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,159
I don't even remember

269
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,520
what she looked like.

270
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,560
I can't remember.

271
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,159
Is that person a boy or a girl?

272
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,679
A girl.

273
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,639
Is she your first love?

274
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,199
Of course not. That's ridiculous.

275
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,879
What if she

276
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,159
comes back to you just like me?

277
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,480
What happened

278
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,439
between the two of you?

279
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:09,480
(Tell me about it.)

280
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,199
I'll tell you about it next time.

281
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,280
I have a question for you instead.

282
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,839
What is it?

283
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Why did you set the deal for ten years?

284
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Because you are an amazing person.

285
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,520
You shine so brightly.

286
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,919
And you make me

287
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,359
want to become someone like that too.

288
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,080
(Only then can I be with you.)

289
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,240
Actually, I was in the dark once.

290
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,280
You are the one

291
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,359
who brought the light back to me.

292
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,280
What did you say?

293
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:42,879
Nothing.

294
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,359
We can talk again when we meet.

295
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,480
Okay.

296
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,720
I'll hang up now.

297
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,199
Bye.

298
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,280
Bye.

299
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Hello, Zhou.

300
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,280
There has just been
a major traffic accident

301
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,280
on Nangang Road.

302
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,199
I don't have time to go back
to the TV station

303
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:21,960
to go with you.

304
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,480
Bring the equipment.

305
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,520
I'll meet you there.

306
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:27,560
What happened over there?

307
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,720
What's happening?

308
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,359
Officer.

309
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:30,520
What happened?

310
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,679
Officer.

311
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:34,839
Does it mean that I'm stuck here?

312
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,599
Take care of it now.

313
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,520
Father.

314
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,399
Father.

315
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,320
Little boy, don't move.

316
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll be there soon.

317
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,639
Don't move.

318
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,119
Little boy, don't move.

319
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,159
Father.

320
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,080
The firefighters will be here soon.

321
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,879
Father.

322
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,480
Stay still.

323
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,280
- Little boy, stay still!
- Father.

324
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,320
Little boy, don't move!

325
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,919
We'll get you out at once.

326
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,080
Stay still.

327
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,240
Sir,

328
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,720
someone is trapped inside the RV.

329
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:27,560
They need your help.

330
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,040
Leave it to us.

331
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,240
Okay. Thank you.

332
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,080
Tao, Dapeng,

333
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,399
secure the car with the chain.

334
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Liu Xu, Cui Jianan, Zhang Yang,

335
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
rescue the people in the RV.

336
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,520
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

337
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,040
Come with me.

338
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, Captain.

339
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,599
Anyone inside?

340
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,199
Anyone inside?

341
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,240
What's the situation?

342
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,520
So far, there's no sign of life.

343
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,679
Zhang Yang, Cui Jianan,
get ready to break open the vehicle!

344
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,240
- Roger that!
- Roger that!

345
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,040
Give me a lift.

346
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,280
Take this!

347
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,839
Why are you spacing out?

348
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,639
I know what to do.

349
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,240
Hurry up!

350
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,639
I'm a reporter from Huaigang TV.

351
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,879
Okay. Take it slow.

352
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:16,879
Be careful.

353
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,320
The woman is still breathing.

354
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,480
Take her to the hospital now!

355
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,520
The man protected his wife with his body.

356
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,439
That's why she was not burnt as badly.

357
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,800
Do you think she'll make it?

358
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,839
Firefighters are only responsible
for the on-site rescue.

359
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,480
The earlier we can rescue them,

360
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,960
the higher their survival rate will be.

361
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:49,760
Let's get back to work.

362
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,839
Zhou, what's the situation?

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,280
An RV has collided with a compact car.

364
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,159
The people who are trapped inside the RV

365
00:23:59,159 --> 00:23:59,919
have just been taken away.

366
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,919
The compact car is hanging off
from the bridge pier.

367
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,800
Let's go and take a look.

368
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,399
Okay.

369
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,760
Hurry up.

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,960
Liu Xu.

371
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
What's the situation?

372
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,679
Captain Jin and the others

373
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,280
are trying to save them there.

374
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,720
Let's go.

375
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:16,720
Father!

376
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,879
Lu Fangqi!

377
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,919
Father.

378
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,439
Father.

379
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,439
Little boy, stay still!

380
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,040
Be careful.

381
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:32,879
Father.

382
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,280
Little boy, stay still.

383
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,280
We'll get you out soon.

384
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:39,320
Don't move.

385
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,320
Yi'en.

386
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,639
Father.

387
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,879
Little boy!

388
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,639
Stay still!

389
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:58,720
Greetings.

390
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:59,800
I am a reporter from Huaigang TV,

391
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,560
Xu Lai.

392
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,919
There has just been
a major traffic accident

393
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,159
on Nangang Road.

394
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,000
An RV has collided with a compact car.

395
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,399
Fire broke out in the RV
and someone was trapped.

396
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,560
As for the compact car...

397
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
Don't be afraid, Yi'en.

398
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,839
Lu Fangqi,
push the rear of the car down!

399
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,359
Yes, Captain!

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,159
Do you want to take a look over there?

401
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,320
(Huaigang TV Station)

402
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:54,159
The firefighters are in charge of the on-site rescue.

403
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,560
My job is to report the news.

404
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's continue.

405
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,639
But Captain Jin is there.

406
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:01,960
I know that he's there

407
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:03,560
and I trust him.

408
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,599
Greetings.

409
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
I am a reporter from Huaigang TV,

410
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:10,760
Xu Lai.

411
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,599
Lu Fangqi, give me the sling!

412
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,159
Give me the sling.

413
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,399
Hurry up.

414
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,320
Hang in there.

415
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,480
Don't be afraid, Yi'en.

416
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Be careful.

417
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:05,879
Father.

418
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,520
Be good, little boy.

419
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,359
Stay still.

420
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:15,679
Be careful.

421
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:17,199
Father!

422
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,119
Don't move.

423
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,040
It's okay.

424
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,320
Trust me.

425
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,320
Give me your hand.

426
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm fine.

427
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,080
Save my father.

428
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,199
Make sure to bring my son to safety.

429
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,839
Trust me.

430
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,399
Give me your hand.

431
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,800
Give him your hand.

432
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
You are doing great.

433
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,720
Come here slowly.

434
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,839
Yes. Take him out now.

435
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,000
Here.

436
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:01,679
Be careful.

437
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,639
Take the kid.

438
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,119
Be careful of his head.

439
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,800
Here.

440
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,800
You are so brave.

441
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:08,320
Come.

442
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:09,159
Be careful.

443
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,240
Here.

444
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,560
Put your arms through it.

445
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,439
That's right.

446
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,080
Okay.

447
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:17,960
Let's go.

448
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,040
Slowly.

449
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,760
Slowly.

450
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:22,879
Be careful.

451
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:26,639
Captain Jin.

452
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,439
We have secured the car with the chain.

453
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,359
You can move forward
to rescue the victim now.

454
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm stuck.

455
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,399
Hang on.

456
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
I'll move your seat backward now.

457
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,720
Hang on. One. Two. Three.

458
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Lu Fangqi, give me the fire belt.

459
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,320
Give me the fire belt.

460
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:03,159
Here you go.

461
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,520
Catch.

462
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Come. Walk to the back.

463
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:57,119
Hurry up.

464
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:58,919
Pull!

465
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,919
They are going to fall.

466
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,960
Hold on to me!

467
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,399
Keep pulling!

468
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,320
Hold on tight!

469
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,439
Hold on!

470
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,720
Jin Shichuan!

471
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,839
Give me a rope!

472
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,240
Hurry up!

473
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,679
Catch!

474
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,080
Pull harder!

475
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,960
Pull harder!

476
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,599
Pull!

477
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Hurry up.

478
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,280
Pull harder.

479
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,639
They are saved.

480
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,599
That's great.

481
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:17,639
They are amazing.

482
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,520
Command Centre.

483
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,639
The site is clear.

484
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,639
The site is clear.

485
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,280
- Fantastic!
- We can resume the traffic now.

486
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
We can resume the traffic now.

487
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:28,639
Okay now.

488
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,119
Mister.

489
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,199
You are a superman.

490
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,480
Thank you for saving me and my father.

491
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I'm not a superman.

492
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm just a normal fireman.

493
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:44,800
This is my duty.

494
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,800
You are even more awesome
than a superman.

495
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Superman.

496
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,159
I want to be a fireman too

497
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,760
when I grow up.

498
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:55,639
Okay.

499
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:56,679
We'll wait for you.

500
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:59,199
- Okay! We'll wait for you!
- Okay! We'll wait for you!

501
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,000
- We'll wait for you!
- We'll wait for you!

502
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,359
Thank you.

503
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,240
Goodbye.

504
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,760
Let's wrap it up.

505
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,320
Pack up our equipment.

506
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:13,919
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

507
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,480
Is it painful?

508
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,320
No.

509
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:35,960
I was so afraid just now.

510
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
I forced myself to calm down.

511
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,359
But I realized that I couldn't calm down at all.

I was suddenly afraid.

518
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,159
I was afraid of falling.

519
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,159
Because if I fell,

520
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,439

Don't move.

What's the situation?

546
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
The patient has extensive burns

547
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
on her arms and thighs.

548
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,159
The wound is being disinfected now.

549
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,679
We need to proceed

550
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:31,920
with the scab removal and
skin grafting surgery next.

551
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,239
The male patient
who was sent here with her

552
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
was showing no vital signs.

553
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,960
His death has been confirmed.

554
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,840
I think he's her husband.

Doctor Zang.

556
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,560
The patient is agitated
and unwilling to cooperate.

557
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,480
She keeps struggling.

558
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,000
I know.

559
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,759
It's hard for you
to accept this reality.

560
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,440
But you can't resurrect a dead man.

561
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,880
The one who survives

562
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,360
has to stay strong to face the future.

563
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,360
Your parents and your husband's parents

564
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,599
are waiting for you.

565
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,199
Am I right?

566
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:03,719
Living

567
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,719
is the hardest thing to do.

568
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,840
I'm sure your husband

569
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,319
wanted you to live a good life.

570
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,000
Let's start.

571
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:18,639
Okay.

572
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,719
As I always say,

573
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
oldie but goodie.

574
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,759
All of us are exhausted

575
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:27,560
beyond doubt.

576
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,480
But look at Captain Jin.

577
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
He's so physically fit.

578
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,000
He looks as energetic as ever.

579
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,239
It has nothing to do
with his physical prowess.

580
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,279
This is

581
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,199
the power of love.

582
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,119
Stop it. Change out of your uniform now.

583
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:47,840
Are you okay?

584
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm fine.

585
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,199
Maybe because I got hit just now.

586
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,719
You've expended a lot of energy today.

587
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:53,960
You should go back and rest earlier.

588
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,400
Get changed now.

589
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,599
And go to eat first.

590
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,719
I'll meet you there later.

591
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,639
I'll get going now, Captain Jin.

592
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,319
I'll get going now, Captain Jin.

593
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,040
Let's go and eat, Captain Jin.

594
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,639
I'll get going now.

595
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,119
I'll get going now, Captain Jin.

596
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,560
I'll get going now, Captain Jin.

597
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,480
I'll get going now, Captain Jin.

598
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,080
Go.

599
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,119
What are you thinking

600
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,679
by sitting here alone?

601
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,759
You've been restless

602
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,679
since you came back.

603
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,239
I'm thinking

604
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,119
that if I didn't save her,

605
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:07,400
would it be a relief for her?

606
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,279
Looks like she's suffering more

607
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,679
by staying alive.

608
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

609
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,400
Liu.

610
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,480
We are firefighters.

611
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,679
It's our duty to rescue the people.

612
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,360
What are you thinking?

613
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,119
Zhang Yang is not as experienced.

614
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,799
It's normal for him

615
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
to be shaken up by this incident.

616
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:31,319
Give him some time.

617
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:44,719
Zhang Yang.

618
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:47,840
I have to remind you of this.

619
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,199
You have to overcome this emotion.

620
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:53,480
We are firefighters.

621
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,239
We'll only face more
life-or-death situations after this.

622
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,880
It can be someone we've saved before.

623
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,000
And it can be one of our comrades.

624
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,440
And it can even be ourselves.

625
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,239
This is the mission and duty

626
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:13,679
that we have to shoulder.

627
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
So, we need to have

628
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,639
a strong heart.

629
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,319
Tell yourself

630
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,599
that you have to get stronger and stronger.

631
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,159
Otherwise, it'll become a problem

632
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:25,920
for you in the future.

633
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:28,920
Do you understand?

634
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,319
Yes.

635
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,159
I was wrong.

636
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,520
I'll change.

637
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:43,480
Good.

638
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,159
Since Zhang Yang
already knows his fault,

639
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,000
you should stop lecturing on him.

640
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,759
Take him back and get some rest.

641
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:55,679
What about you?

642
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:57,639
I...

643
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,239
I have things to do.

644
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:13,325
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital
Emergency)

645
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:22,759
Doctor Zang.

646
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:24,360
Doctor Zang.

647
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,239
I know that you'll be here.

648
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,799
Why are you here?

649
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,239
This is the sandwich
that I saw you eating last time.

650
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,000
I bought this flavor specifically for you.

651
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,759
And this is human-insulated milk.

652
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:38,799
Take a bite of it.

653
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,599
I don't have the appetite.
I don't want to eat it.

654
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,119
You have a bad stomach.

655
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,560
You can't just take medicine for it

656
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,400
all the time.

657
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,520
You need to be healthy

658
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:48,599
to take care of your patients.

659
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,239
I am a doctor.

660
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,119
I know it better than you.

661
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,960
I don't need you
to worry about my stomach.

662
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:57,480
What's wrong?

663
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,880
Why are you asking me that?

664
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:07,840
Today,

665
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,840
I heard my teammates

666
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,799
talking about the topic of life and death.

667
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,000
And I suddenly thought about you.

668
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Doctors and firefighters

669
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,040
are used to life and death.

670
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:22,480
And our main duty

671
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,719
is to help the wounded and the dying.

672
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,360
But they always say

673
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
that there's a shadow behind the sun.

674
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,279
I don't want you to shoulder it alone.

675
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,199
I know that you know more than me.

676
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,000
But...

677
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,360
But I can't help myself

678
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,199
but to care about you.

679
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,799
Why do you care about me so much?

680
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,960
Do you like me?

681
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:44,920
I...

682
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,360
I don't know.

683
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,159
I...

684
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,440
When you are not with me,

685
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,480
I want to see you.

686
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,319
And when I see you

687
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,080
I want to care about you.

688
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,400
I don't know

689
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,000
if I like you or not.

690
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,719
That's not love.

691
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,199
Remember this.

692
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,679
You don't like me.

693
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,000
And you can't like me.

694
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,080
Why?

695
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm married.

696
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,719
I have a husband.

697
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,319
So, don't visit me again after this.

698
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:28,880
Well.

699
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,360
You still have to eat.

700
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,799
What is it?

701
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,960
Just now, you said

702
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,759
that you had something important to do.

703
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:32,239
What was it?

704
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,360
Did you go to see that female doctor?

705
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:38,639
I know all about it.

706
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,199
I'm talking to you.

707
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,920
What's wrong with you?

708
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,520
Why are you ignoring me?

709
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,239
It's none of your business.

710
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:43,960
What is it?

711
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,560
Were you rejected?

712
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,759
Even worse.

713
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,759
Were you hit?

714
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
I only realized

715
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:00,840
that I had fallen for her

716
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,920
