Mom!

79
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:34,405
Do you think this dress looks nice?

80
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,484
It shows too much skin. No.

81
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:40,205
See?

82
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:40,765
I think so too.

84
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,924
Not you. Don't give too many comments.

85
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,285
I think this dress is fine.

86
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:46,645
It's showing too much.

87
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,205
Look at all the skin she'd be showing.

88
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,004

00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:49,884
Do you like that dress?

90
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,725
I think your mother is right.

91
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:52,645
It's too revealing.

92
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,205
But you can wear it

93
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,085
just for me in private.

94
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:01,684

You're here.
Why don't you try on some dresses too?

99
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:12,965
Try on some dresses?

100
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:13,645
Yes.

101
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,004

102
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,045
Yes.

103
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:17,804

110

from my mother.

111
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:50,004
Right?

112
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,444
Yes. You are absolutely right.

113
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,725
All right. I tried on a dress

114
00:05:59,045 --> 00:05:59,684
and had my fun.

115
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,045
It's time to take it off.

116
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:03,364

117
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,605
You don't get many chances to wear this.

118
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,124
You look lovely. Don't take it off.

119
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:08,684

120
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:09,605

00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:10,205

125
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,645
Do you think it suits you?

126
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:16,405
I mean it.

127
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,324
Don't take it off. You look beautiful.

128

129
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:21,965
Well,

130
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,444
today,

131
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,645
you finally wore a wedding dress for once.

132

137

Over the years,

138
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:47,765
there is so much

139
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,244
I want to tell you.

140
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,484
I've been keeping them in my heart.

141
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,645
Today, I want to tell you all of them

142
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:57,765
while we're here.

143
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:00,645
I know

144
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:05,924
I made you suffer a lot in the past.

145
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:08,645
You had to endure a lot.

146
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:13,965
I left a lot of regrets in your life.

147
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:16,444
I kept trying to stay by your side

148
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,124
all these years

149
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:23,564
because I wanted to make up for those things.

150
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:27,684
I know

151
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:30,124
our first marriage was a failure.

152
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:32,605
So I was wondering

153
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,845
if you could give me a chance

154
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:42,605
and let me stay with you

155
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:48,285
and take care of you.

156
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:58,085
Ms. Lin… No.

157
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,444
Lin.

158
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,725
Will you marry me again?

159
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,804
I've been waiting
to hear that all this time.

160
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:26,244
I think

161
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:30,045
today was the best time to propose.

162
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,125
Dad. Mom.

163
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,724
Today deserves to be commemorated.

164
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,285
Let's take wedding photos together.

165
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,084
All right.

166

(Qiancao Train Restaurant)

167
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,485
You're getting married?

168
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,084
You didn't even give me a heads-up.

169
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,365
It's too rushed.

170
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:37,804
Not at all.

171
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,204
I was already preparing

172
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,165
to marry Jin Shichuan ten years ago.

173
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:43,405
Besides, I've been preparing
for this for ten years.

174
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,045
That's true.

175
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,165
You've been trying
to get him for ten years.

176
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:48,885
It's about time you two get married.

177
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,125
But this is going

178
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:53,444
to make someone sad.

179
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:54,684
Who?

180
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,724
Huo, of course.

181
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:59,084
The woman he loved for ten years

182
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,204
is marrying someone else.

183
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,444
He doesn't stand a chance anymore.

184
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:02,724
Nonsense.

185
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,084
We've already closed that chapter.

186
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,485
Just kidding.

187
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:07,125
Huo is probably annoyed

188
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,765
about Yu Shishi ignoring him.

189
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,564
Well, you have to invite Huo

190
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,005
to your wedding.

191
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:15,804
Have you invited him yet?

192
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,125
Of course.

193
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,765
But I'm not the one

194
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:22,324
who is giving him the invitation.

195
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:24,365
Captain Jin.

196
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,245
What brings you here?

197
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,324
I'm here to deliver you an invitation.

198
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,365
Xu Lai and I are getting married.

199
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,804
Are you here to taunt

200
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:38,125
or show off?

201
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,084
I don't think you'd mind

202
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,045
me showing off now.

203
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:46,724
You better treat Xu Lai right

204
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:47,924
after you marry her,

205
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,045
or else,

206
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,125
as her brother,

207
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,645
I won't let you go.

208
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:53,645
Don't worry.

209
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:54,924
I won't give you that chance.

210
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,204
I'll treat her well.

211
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:58,604
Don't forget to show up on time.

212
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:00,924
I will.

213
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:02,485
Thanks.

214
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,084
By the way,

215
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,885
I need a favour.

216
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:10,724
Invite someone for me.

217
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:32,245
Doesn't it look nice,

218
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:33,444
Mom?

219
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,245
When my father saw you

220
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,444
in that wedding dress,

221
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,204
there were sparkles in his eyes.

222
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:44,045
You have a way with words,

223
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:45,604
just like your father.

224
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:51,564
Mom,

225
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:54,084
I made you and Dad worry about me

226
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:54,924
all these years.

227
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,964
But you don't have

228
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:00,444
to worry about me anymore.

229
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:04,684
Jin Shichuan will look after me.

230
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:08,285
You and Dad should just

231
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,765
enjoy your life together.

232
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:17,765
Actually,

233
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,645
I owe you an apology.

234
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:22,045
When you were young,

235
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:23,045
we made you

236
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,245
see your parents fighting too often.

237
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,204
You had to endure a lot of grievances.

238
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,684
Looking back on it now,

239
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,485
we owe you so much.

240
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,645
I'm sorry, my dear.

241
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,165
It's okay.

242
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,245
We were young back then.

243
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:42,924
We didn't know
how to maintain a marriage.

244
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:44,724
It was our first time being parents.

245
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,444
We had to learn and figure out

246
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:49,684
how to get along through the years too.

247
00:12:51,765 --> 00:12:52,564
I wondered

248
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,964
why I kept arguing
with your father back then.

249
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:56,604
Then, I realized

250
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,485
that it was because I wanted to see him

251
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,045
but I couldn't.

252
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:05,724
Maybe that's what love is.

253
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,604
Before this,

254
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:13,765
I always wanted you

255
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,005
to marry an ordinary man

256
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,005
and live a peaceful life.

257
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:21,645
But I've seen your love

258
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,084
with my own eyes.

259
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,885
It's not easy
to be the wife of a firefighter.

260
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,604
But it is your decision,

261
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,245
and I will respect that and support you.

262
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,885
I hope my daughter will be happy.

263
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:49,444
Mom.

264
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,924
We will be happy.

265
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:54,844
We will.

266
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,045
We will be happy.

267
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,700
(Xu Lai  Jin Shichuan)

268
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,140
(Xu Lai  Jin Shichuan)

269
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:46,645
Captain Jin,

270
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,924
are you nervous?

271
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:50,245
No.

272
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:52,285
How can he not be?
It's his first time getting married.

273
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:54,604
Where's Xu Lai? Is she here yet?

274
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:55,405
No.

275
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,005
Congratulations, Captain Jin.

276
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:58,405
Thank you.

277
00:14:58,485 --> 00:14:59,045
Congratulations on getting married.

278
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,084
Thank you.

279
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:01,285
Congratulations, Captain Jin.

280
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:01,724
Thank you.

281
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,045
We've watched

282
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,724
Captain Jin and Xu Lai come a long way.

283
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:12,964
I suppose this is a happy ending.

284
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:14,804
They are two lovers

285
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:16,444
that were meant to be.

286
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,005
We can only be envious of them.

287
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:19,885
You should get a move on too.

288
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,645
Want me to introduce my cousin to you?

289
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,084
Do you have a photo of her?

290
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,245
Forget it. You're insincere.

291
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,165
Don't be like that, Peng!

292
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:37,084
What's on your mind?

293
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:38,844
Zang Qiu.

294
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,724
You look beautiful.

295
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:43,844
Commissioner.

296
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:50,765
My grandfather and the others are here.

297
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:51,924
They're here?

298
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,005
They're inside.

299
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:53,885
I'll go say hello.

300
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:55,724
This way, Commissioner.

301
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,084
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

302
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:59,125
Thank you.

303
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,005
I'm jealous of Captain Jin.

304
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:05,765
It's so nice being a groom.

305
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:14,245
In-laws, allow me to make the introductions.

306
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:14,765
Great.

307
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,245
This is the witness, Commissioner Wen.

308
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:18,324
Commissioner Wen. We know each other.

309
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,084
Commissioner Wen
was the one who received me

310
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:21,765
at the station.

311
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,604
Yes, we know each other.

312
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:24,525
It's nice to meet you.

313
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:25,285
It's nice to meet you too.

314
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,165
Thank you.

315
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,924
Not at all. We're a family.

316
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:29,245
This is my former superior.

317
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,724
We're a family.

318
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:33,285
Yes.

319
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:35,885
How are you feeling?

320
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:38,885

You can stop staring into each other's eyes.

352
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,925
You have an entire life ahead of you to do that.

is to get you guys married.

355
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,005
All right, everyone.

356
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,925
The wedding ceremony begins now.

357
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:22,364
Great!

358
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:27,564
Jin Shichuan,

359
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,285
do you take the bride

360
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:31,364
to be your wife

361
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,445
and stay true to your vows

362
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,084
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

363
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:38,285
in sickness and in health…

364
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:39,124
I do.

365
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:47,485
No matter what happens,

366
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,084
as your husband,

367
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:51,925
I will do everything I can

368
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:53,725
to protect you,

369
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:56,364
love you, and support you.

370
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,965
I once said

371
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,404
I would be your light.

372
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,245
From now on,

373
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:10,804
I will use my light and strength

374
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:15,124
to chase away all the clouds

375
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,164
that you will encounter

376
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,725
and be your strongest armour

377
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,925
and forever safe haven.

378
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,285
Xu Lai is the wife

379
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:29,525
Jin Shichuan will protect and love

380
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,245
for the rest of his life.

381
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:33,324
Great!

382
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,084
Captain Jin!

383
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:34,844
Way to go, Captain Jin!

384
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:35,324
Captain Jin!

385
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,005
Captain Jin!

386
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,205
Well said.

387
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,084
Xu Lai,

388
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,245
do you take this man…

389
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:48,844
I do.

390
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:53,604
Ten years ago,

391
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,005
you led me out of the ruins

392
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,445
and shone a light
in my time of darkness.

393
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,925
Ten years later,

394
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:02,604
I've finally gotten my wish

395
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,765
and become your bride.

396
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,884
I promise to be your wife,

397
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,005
your companion,

398
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,925
your comrade in arms

399
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:16,884
for the rest of my life,

400
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:19,404
no matter what happens.

401
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,364
To be with you, to take care of you,

402
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:24,364
respect you,

403
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:26,364
in good times and bad,

404
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:28,765
and love you forever.

405
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,124
Never change.

406
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:32,685
Never change.

407
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:33,685
Great!

408
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:35,765
Great!

409
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:16,564
And our new promise.

410
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,525
Can you promise me

411
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,364
that we'll meet again in ten years?

412
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,525
I want more than the next ten years.

413
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:26,045
I want to spend
all the next ten years to come

414
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,564
with you.

415
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:30,804
It's a promise. No going back on it.

416
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:32,604
Promise.

417
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:36,445
For the rest of our lives.

418
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,084
Jin Shichuan,

419
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:56,844
I finally married you!

420
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:01,884
Great!

421
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,084
Great!

422
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:23,109
Great!

423
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:24,164
Kiss!

424
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:33,884
Great!

425
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:42,485
Nobody moves! That's mine!

426
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:15,925
Hello?

427
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:18,725
Okay. Got it.

428
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,644
Major collapse at the City Stadium.

429
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:23,725
I need to get
to the scene to direct them.

430
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:24,445
I'll be leaving now.

431
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,285
Give us a kiss!

432
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:30,324
Give us a kiss!

433
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:31,084
Shichuan!

434
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:32,604
There has been a major collapse

435
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,084
at the City Stadium!

436
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:38,644
First Brigade!

437
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,364
Everyone, head out!

438
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,124
Wait for me!

439
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:47,564
Thank you, everyone,

440
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:48,685
for coming to our wedding.

441
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:49,685
But there has been a major collapse

442
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:51,005
at the City Stadium.

443
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,205
The groom must head to the scene,

444
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:53,725
and I will be reporting live.

445
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:56,324
This is our duty and our shared vision.

446
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:57,485
I hereby announce

447
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:58,844
that the wedding is over!

448
00:24:59,005 --> 00:24:59,685
Thank you, everyone!

449
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:17,364
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

450
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:18,725
There has been a major collapse

451
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:19,884
at the City Stadium.

452
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:21,245
There are people trapped
in the building.

453
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:22,844
Firefighters and paramedics at the scene

454
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,404
are providing
emergency relief and assistance.

455
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:26,404
Stay tuned to this channel for updates.

456
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:28,324
Stop staring.

457
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,725
She's someone else's bride now.

458
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,324
You're late.

459
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,644
No wonder Xu Lai would invite me.

460
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:41,925
Was it your idea?

461
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:44,404
Well, an occasion like this

462
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:46,765
warrants getting a drink somewhere.

463
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:48,404
Join me?

464
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:50,844
Well,

465
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,364
I guess I could oblige.

466
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:02,965
Sorry.

467
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:06,685
I can't believe

468
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:08,245
I get to see the day
you discover your conscience.

469
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:10,364
I've been trying

470
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,485
to find an opportunity to apologize to you.

471
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:15,884
And I've been meaning

472
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:17,005
to thank you too.

473
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,525
Your appearance messed up my plans,

474
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,245
but it taught me to let go.

475
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,925
So have you really let Xu Lai go?

476
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:29,844
I let go of my obsession,

477
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:31,525
and I gained friendship.

478
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,525
Well, I guess that means I did a good deed.

479
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:38,644
Now that my mission is complete,

480
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:40,765
I can leave without worry.

481
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:44,965
Where are you going?

482
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,084
I'm going to study abroad

483
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:48,324
and enrich myself.

484
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:51,124
Since entering
the entertainment industry,

485
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,725
I've always been living
as the celebrity Yu Shishi

486
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:58,404
for work, for fame,

487
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:00,005
for the audience,

488
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:02,285
but never for myself.

489
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:06,285
Even the time when I let myself go

490
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,564
and went to Huining

491
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:09,804
was for you too.

492
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,164
So this time,

493
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:14,925
I want to live for myself

494
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:17,564
and find somewhere

495
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,205
that belongs to me.

496
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:22,965
You've changed.

497
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:25,884
You're different
from what you used to be.

498
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,045
People change.

499
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:32,045
No one stays in the same place forever.

500
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,045
Isn't that right?

501
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:35,245
Yes.

502
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:39,564
People will change.

503
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,404
Well, I hope you get your wish.

504
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:46,685
Hope everything goes well for you.

505
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,644
Thanks.

506
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:03,965
Do you know that

507
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:05,765
I used to really like you?

508
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:08,564
I do.

509
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:11,844
Do you know

510
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,005
that I still really like you?

511
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:22,445
Got you.

512
00:28:23,124 --> 00:28:25,525
Did you expect Yu Shishi to still cling to you?

513
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:27,124
Dream on.

514
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:30,485
There's something

515
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,045
you don't know.

516
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:33,245
What?

517
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,005
Yu Shishi,

518
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,404
I've fallen for you.

519
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:44,685
I know

520
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:45,604
that it's too late,

521
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:48,485
and I don't have any right
to make you stay,

522
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,644
so just take it as a joke.

523
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:53,804
I don't like jokes,

524
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,005
but I think I have changed

525
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:58,245
because of you.

526
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,084
All right.

527
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:10,364
The two of us started with a joke

528
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:11,285
of a promise.

529
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:14,005
So let's end it with a joke.

530
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:17,245
That's a fitting end.

531
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:48,005
It's late. Let me send you home.

532
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:49,884
No, this will do.

533
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:51,965
Bye, Huo Yanzong!

534
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:24,765
I'm exhausted.

535
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,364
Who knew we would spend our wedding

536
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,644
in such a flurry?

537
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:42,604
We missed

538
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:43,644
our wedding,

539
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:47,965
but our wedding night is just beginning.

540
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:01,005
I think it's time the groom

541
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:03,564
fulfills his responsibilities

542
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:05,685
and gives the bride

543
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:09,084
an unforgettable wedding night.

544
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:47,525
After tonight,

545
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:49,685
you'll be my wife.

546
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,005
Trust me.

547
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,324
I will make you the happiest woman

548
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:56,164
in the world.

549
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:14,445
How long have you been staring at me?

550
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:15,965
A long time.

551
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:19,765
Aren't you tired of it?

552
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,485
My wife is beautiful.

553
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,245
I would never get tired of her.

554
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:26,045
So cheesy.

555
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:29,804
Good morning, Honey.

556
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:32,164
Good morning.

557
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:34,164
What should you call me?

558
00:33:35,084 --> 00:33:35,804
Jin Shichuan.

559
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:36,525
And?

560
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,245
You're Jin Shichuan.

561
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:44,884
Call me your hubby.

562
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:55,005
Come on.

563
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:58,005
Hubby.

564
00:33:58,965 --> 00:33:59,685
Louder.

565
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:02,285
Hubby.

566
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:05,124
With some emotion.
Say it into my ear.

567
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:11,604
Hubby.

568
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:17,805
That was so cheesy.

569
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:20,724
We're on our wedding holiday.

570
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:22,805
Let your husband hold you a while longer

571
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:24,284
in bed, okay?

572
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,805
Thanks, Honey.

573
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:36,485
(Every story)

574
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:37,965
(has a beginning and an end.)

575
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,965
(It took Jin Shichuan and me ten years)

576
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:42,045
(to get from the beginning of our story)

577
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:43,885
(to where we are now.)

578
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,365
(But our story doesn't end here.)

579
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:48,005
(In the long future ahead of us,)

580
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:49,204
(we will embrace)

581
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:53,164
(and create new stories)

582
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:55,644
(together.)

583
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:58,805
(And our friends)

584
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,644
(who have been with us)

585
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,045
(are still writing the stories)

586
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,564
(of their lives too.)

587
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:12,965
"Things Couples Must Do."

588
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,284
Why are you reading stuff
that women read?

589
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,405
Give it here. What do you know?

590
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:18,764
This is to ensure

591
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,525
our relationship
stays passionate and exciting.

592
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:26,005
Are you and Dr. Zang
still in your honeymoon phase?

593
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:26,805
Of course.

594
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:29,485
We made a promise to be in love forever.

595
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:30,445
We have to make sure it happens.

596
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:33,244
Thank you, Doctor.

597
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,045
Don't mention it.

598
00:35:35,564 --> 00:35:36,885
What are you doing tonight, Dr. Zang?

599
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:37,845
Let's get dinner together.

600
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:39,204
I can't.

601
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:41,045
I have a date with my boyfriend.

602
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,124
I'm off.

603
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,124
(Shishi,)

604
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,480
(Actress Yu Shishi retired from public life
and studied abroad)

605
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:49,604
(I don't know)

606
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:50,525
(if you'll ever finish this puzzle)

607
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:51,965
(or read this message.)

608
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:55,325
It's finally complete!

609
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:56,445
(The puzzle shows)

610
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,644
(Pluto and Charon.)

611
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,485
(Pluto is the farthest planet)

612
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:02,325
(from the sun in the solar system.)

613
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:03,284
Look.

614
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,564
(Almost no sunlight)

615
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:05,365
(reaches it.)

616
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:07,644
(Only Charon)

617
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:08,485
(keeps it company)

618
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:10,965
(and rotates in sync with it)

619
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:12,525
(in the infinite solitude
of the universe.)

620
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,325
(And you've been by my side)

621
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:19,005
(like Charon.)

622
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:21,845
(Thank you for being with me)

623
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,325
(on my loneliest)

624
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:24,244
(journey.)

625
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:26,564
(I hope)

626
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,124
(that you will soon find the meaning)

627
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:30,005
(you are searching for in your life.)

628
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,966
(One year later)

629
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:00,204
When you join the brigade,

630
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:02,244
you must be prepared to endure

631
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,965
and obey every order.

632
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:07,244
As long as I don't tell you to stop,

633
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,965
you can't complain,

634
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:10,885
give up,

635
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:12,845
or abandon your post.

636
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:14,604
The tasks

637
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:15,365
you will be facing

638
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,525
will be even harder

639
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:17,925
and more intense.

640
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:19,965
Take a look.

641
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:21,845
You did not complete your mission

642
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:22,925
within the designated time

643
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:23,925
today.

644
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:26,164
Keep running tomorrow!

645
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,805
- Yes.
- Yes.

646
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:29,045
Dismissed.

647
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:46,684
When did you buy this?

648
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:48,485
Isn't that the famous presenter

649
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:49,644
from the station?

650
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:51,604
Why is she here?

651
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:53,885
That's Captain Jin's wife.

652
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,244
Our "sister-in-law".

653
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:56,644
Sister-in-law?

654
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,204
How did they get together?

655
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:01,805
Tell me about it.

656
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,045
Their love story is better

657
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:05,644
than a romance.

658
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:07,885
(Xu Lai has been)

659
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:08,764
(through countless dangers)

660
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:09,805
(with Captain Jin.)

661
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,204
(She even saved him)

662
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:12,845
(from underneath the rubble)

663
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:14,405
(of an earthquake.)

664
00:38:38,644 --> 00:38:39,845
Are you alone, Miss?

665
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,965
Yes. What about it?

666
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:46,005
What a coincidence. I'm alone too.

667
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,284
Want to date me?

668
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,045
I'm very demanding

669
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:53,845
when it comes to dating.

670
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:57,485
I don't date guys who aren't my type.

671
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:01,045
So tell me what your type is.

672
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,604
I like someone with bushy eyebrows,

673
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,005
a high nose,

674
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,805
bright puppy-like eyes,

675
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,885
who knows everything about me

676
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,764
and never gives up,

677
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:20,405
and tells me

678
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:21,885
lots of stories

679
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:23,204
to make me happy.

680
00:39:26,684 --> 00:39:28,124
I happen to know someone

681
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:28,925
like that.

682
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:32,644
Care to meet him in person?

683
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:33,684
Sure.

684
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:36,805
But I want to test the goods first.

685
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:49,644
Satisfied?

686
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:53,805
How long is my probation?

687
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:56,925
For life.

688
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:39,124
Why did you
suddenly decide to come back?

689
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,325
I wanted to come back.

690
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:43,885
Have you found

691
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:46,204
where you want to be?

692
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:48,684
I've been to a lot of places,

693
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:50,244
met a lot of people,

694
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:51,724
and seen a lot of sights.

695
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,084
Then I realized

696
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:55,124
that this was still

697
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,284
the place I wanted to be.

698
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:05,805
Let's go.

699
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,564
You have the day off tomorrow.

700
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:16,724
Let's go out.

701
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:21,684
I'll go wherever you want to go.

702
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:23,325
Really?

703
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,005
Not bad, Hubby.

704
00:41:29,204 --> 00:41:29,885
