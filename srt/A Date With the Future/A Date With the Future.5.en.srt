Couldn't be any better.

43
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:34,810
Captain Jin.

44
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,490
You two...

45
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,570
Looks like you two are fine.

46
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:45,131
The fire is under control.

47
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,171
It didn't spread to the next block.

48
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,210
We also found Erhu.

49
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:48,411
Where?

50
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,291
Look at you.

51
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:52,090
Goodness.

52
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,291
The puppy is hungry.

53
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,690
Look, it must be hungry.

54
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,610
Check over there.

55
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:13,171
Which one of you is blind

56
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,371
and knocked my car?

57
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,850
He parked his car on the emergency route

58
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,690
and now he's blaming us?

59
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:17,931
Unbelievable.

60
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,011
Get out here. Get down.

61
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,011
I said, get out here.

62
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,090
Sir.

63
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,651
Your car

64
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,970
was parked at the emergency route.

65
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,011
That's illegal.

66
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,131
We couldn't get
a hold of you at the time,

67
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,051
and it was an emergency, so...

68
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,171
What do you mean emergency?

69
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,651
Don't move. Don't you move!

70
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:38,651
Step aside!

71
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,371
What are you guys doing?

72
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,131
You bunch of firemen.

73
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,450
I dare you to bully me,

74
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,610
a helpless citizen.

75
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,610
Go ahead and beat me up.

76
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,330
I'm not scared.

77
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,011
I have my rights.

78
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,051
No one is leaving this place
if I don't get compensated.

79
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,450
And you...

80
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,690
What's happening?
What are you people doing?

81
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,690
Firemen are beating people up!

82
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,771
Take photos.

83
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,610
Step back.

84
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,251
The firemen are beating people up.

85
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,171
I knew you wouldn't dare touch me.

86
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:07,291
Get lost.

87
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,291
Sir.

88
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:09,970
If you're not happy

89
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,610
with us firemen,

90
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,651
you could call 12345

91
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:12,171
to make a complaint.

92
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:12,651
What 12345?

93
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,051
I don't know what 12345 is.

94
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,251
They don't dare to beat you up?
Then I will.

95
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,371
You dare hit me, you crazy woman!

96
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:28,891
Are you all right?

97
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,011
Don't you touch me.

98
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:30,970
I'll report you.

99
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,730
I'll make you all lose your jobs.

100
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,371
Just try me.

101
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,610
People are all taking pictures.

102
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:37,730
See that?

103
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:40,011
This is how firemen act.

104
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,531
Zhou, did you catch that?

105
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,051
Yes, the whole thing.

106
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:44,411
What are you recording? Delete it!

107
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,011
The Fire Services Act states that

108
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,131
no unit or person

109
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,970
may use, seal

110
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,891
or block an emergency route.

111
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,291
Firefighters have no obligation
to compensate you.

112
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,970
You're deliberately picking a fight.

113
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,931
We've caught your antics

114
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,771
on tape.

115
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,490
If you report this,

116
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,531
you'll be the one detained.

117
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,330
I dare you to threaten my men.

118
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,531
If you don't walk away now,

119
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,690
the police will be here.

120
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:06,810
Fine.

121
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:08,450
You win.

122
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:10,411
I...

123
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,251
I won't quarrel with you today.

124
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,131
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

125
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,131
No, I'm fine.

126
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,210
Are you okay?

127
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,931
- Thanks, Ms. Xu.
- Thanks, Ms. Xu.

128
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,011
Thanks, Ms. Xu!

129
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,011
Move out.

130
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:36,090
Thanks, Ms. Xu.

131
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,690
All hail Ms. Xu!

132
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,371
What's wrong?
Is your back hurting again?

133
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,291
I'm okay. Just the usual.

134
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,090
Captain Jin.

135
00:11:58,891 --> 00:11:59,490
An old problem.

136
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:01,810
Even so, you should get it checked.

137
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,051
Take the day off tomorrow.

138
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,251
Get all the necessary check-ups done.

139
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:05,651
Aren't you hurt too, Captain Jin?

140
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,931
Why don't you go with me?

141
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,490
Yeah, your shoulder.

142
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm fine. Help him.

143
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:12,810
Let's go.

144
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,490
Slowly.

145
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,090
Bring the footage back first.

146
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,690
Your shoulder is injured.

147
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,651
I'll go to the hospital with you.

148
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,251
I'm fine.

149
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,531
No, right here.

150
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,171
You're hurt here.

151
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:36,450
Who allowed you to go into the fire?

152
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,330
How did you

153
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,450
get your hands on the fire suit?

154
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,970
Do you know how dangerous it is

155
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,330
if your oxygen tank

156
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,051
was not full?

157
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,251
I checked it.

158
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:48,131
The tank

159
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,171
had more than 25 MPa.

160
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,850
It was all good.

161
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,891
What if you got burned?

162
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,810
Did you think about that?

163
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:55,090
I told you.

164
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,450
I did search and rescue training.

165
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,771
I participated in similar drills.

166
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,210
I didn't do it on a whim.

167
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:02,810
Besides,

168
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,771
all the stuff I learned over the years

169
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:05,651
was because of you.

170
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:06,970
In order to get closer to you,

171
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,771
I became a dog trainer.

172
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,251
And I joined the civilian rescue team.

173
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,931
I know I shouldn't have done it.

174
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:12,570
But,

175
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,610
don't you think

176
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,011
that being able to use what I've learned

177
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,330
to save you from the fire

178
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,651
is all destined?

179
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,011
I don't need you to save me.

180
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,051
What you did

181
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:25,651
was against the rule.

182
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:26,531
There cannot be a next time.

183
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:29,011
I cannot be worrying about you

184
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,850
when I'm on a rescue mission.

185
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,131
You're worried about me?

186
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,131
You're worried about me.

187
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,090
You said you were worried about me.

188
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,730
Jin Shichuan, you care about me.

189
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:44,970
I can't talk to you.

190
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:47,330
You can do it, Ms. Xu!

191
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,570
Go get him!

192
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,610
(Anti-chemical decontamination vehicle)

193
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,651
Go, Ms. Xu!

194
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,931
Did you not hear me?

195
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,931
I said stop following me.

196
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,931
My feet made me follow me.

197
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,131
I can't control them.

198
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,291
What do you want?

199
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,970
I want to follow you and be with you.

200
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,570
Xu Lai.

201
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,411
I'm thankful

202
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:49,330
for what you've done.

203
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:50,371
- But...
- Don't worry.

204
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,931
These are all

205
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:53,131
done willingly by me.

206
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,531
You need not feel pressured.

207
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:56,171
Also, I'm not going

208
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,371
to guilt trip you with my feelings.

209
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,291
What I want

210
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,970
is for you to be attracted to me,

211
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,810
and not feel grateful or touched.

212
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,011
Xu Lai.

213
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,251
Huo, why are you still here?

214
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,090
I was worried about you

215
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:13,931
being here alone.

216
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:14,730
So I stayed to wait.

217
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,171
I thought you might need a ride.

218
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,011
Perfect. He's injured.

219
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:19,810
Take us to the hospital.

220
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:20,771
No need.

221
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,531
I can go by myself.

222
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,330
No, I'm going with you.

223
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,090
I can manage alone.

224
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:23,690
No!

225
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,411
It's not easy to get a ride here.

226
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:26,891
I'll drive you guys there.

227
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:27,931
Thanks. Let's go.

228
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:14,490
Does it hurt?

229
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,090
No.

230
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:21,690
Xu Lai.

231
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,330
You haven't introduced us.

232
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,251
Who is he?

233
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:27,011
I almost forgot.

234
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,450
He is the captain
of Huaigang Fire Department

235
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,330
1st Brigade.

236
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,730
The fireman who saved me years ago.

237
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,490
Jin Shichuan.

238
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,171
Hello.

239
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,291
Hello.

240
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,470
(Emergency)

241
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,050
Stop following me.

242
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,530
He's waiting for you.

243
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,530
Xu Lai.

244
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,091
Let me take you home.

245
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,411
It's okay. I have something to do.

246
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,490
Is it

247
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,290
related to Captain Jin?

248
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,690
So you found him.

249
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,050
Why didn't you tell me?

250
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,891
How far along is your relationship?

251
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:31,651
There's no relationship yet.

252
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:32,970
He turned me down.

253
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:33,931
I was going

254
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,050
to wait for him to say yes

255
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,010
before informing you guys.

256
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,490
Since he already rejected you,

257
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,891
you should give up on him.

258
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,690
Xu Lai, actually I...

259
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,250
How could I?

260
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,490
I've been looking for him for so long.

261
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,331
Now I finally met him.

262
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,290
How can I give up?

263
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,891
Enough talking. Bye.

264
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,131
Miss.

265
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,171
Can you be more gentle?

266
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:05,131
I will.

267
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:06,131
Are you going to take the shot or not?

268
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,811
Yes.

269
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:07,931
No, wait.

270
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,210
I'm not ready.

271
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,411
Let me take a breath.

272
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:11,331
Okay, stop fidgeting.

273
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,411
I wouldn't want to poke wrongly.

274
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,411
A grownup like you
is scared of injections?

275
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:18,851
It's you.

276
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:20,770
Do you remember me?

277
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,690
The fireman

278
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,811
who had a blind date with you

279
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,091
at the restaurant.

280
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,210
Aren't you getting an injection?

281
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:26,891
Yes, I am.

282
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,171
See,

283
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,651
we are acquaintances.

284
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:31,250
Right?

285
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,450
Fancy meeting you here.

286
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,490
It must be fate.

287
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,131
Tell the nurse.

288
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,931
Ask her to be

289
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,651
more gentle.

290
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,010
I'm a doctor.

291
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,010
I don't give injections.

292
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:50,891
Long time no see.

293
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,730
How have you been?

294
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:57,411
Not too bad.

295
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,371
You've been avoiding me

296
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:05,811
since that incident.

297
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,611
I tried to look for you.

298
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,851
Your work address, house address,

299
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,091
even your phone number had been changed.

300
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,970
A friendly reminder.

301
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,450
You scared me!

302
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,331
That woman employs cruel tactics.

303
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,490
She's heartless.

304
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,010
A formidable opponent.

305
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:48,931
Mind your own business.

306
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:52,490
I'll go pay my bill then.

307
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:57,931
I know

308
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,371
it had a huge impact on you.

309
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,450
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:03,730
I accept

311
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:05,530
that you hate me.

312
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:07,970
But I'm still hoping

313
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:08,891
you'd give me a chance

314
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,931
to make it up to you.

315
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:11,050
I don't want to talk about

316
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,250
what happened before.

317
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:13,851
And I've told you.

318
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,891
I won't forgive you.

319
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:31,571
Hold it.

320
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,010
Why are you here again?

321
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,131
There are so many scars on your back.

322
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,331
Do they hurt?

323
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:17,530
Let me help you.

324
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,331
No, I can do it myself.

325
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:18,931
I'll help you.

326
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,331
I'll do it myself.

327
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:19,891
I'll help you.

328
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,811
Give it to me. I'll do it.

329
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,651
I'll help you.

330
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,091
I can do it myself.

331
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,851
Cap...

332
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,331
I'll leave.

333
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,210
Get back here.

334
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,851
Take her away.

335
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,131
Okay.

336
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:44,891
I haven't put on the shirt for you.

337
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,651
Go.

338
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,730
What a weirdo.

339
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,131
Captain's order.

340
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,411
I can't say no.

341
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,891
Lu Fangqi.

342
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,331
Do me a favor.

343
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:04,970
What?

344
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:05,931
From what

345
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,571
I've observed with Jin Shichuan,

346
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,210
I doubt he's ever been
in a relationship.

347
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,651
I need to find out

348
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,331
what exactly he
and the doctor's connection is.

349
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:18,171
But it's a little hard

350
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,931
if I were to do it myself.

351
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,571
So the only suitable candidate

352
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,450
is you.

353
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,210
Me?

354
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,210
No. No can do.

355
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,651
That doctor and I don't get along.

356
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,331
We're nemeses.

357
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:35,651
Lu Fangqi.

358
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,571
Please help me out.

359
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:37,210
I'm not suitable.

360
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,131
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

361
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:39,050
Okay?

362
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,371
Get this straight.

363
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:42,611
If one day

364
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,770
I really become

365
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:44,730
your sister-in-law,

366
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,250
- then I...
- Fine.

367
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,250
I'll do it.

368
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:57,091
What's up with you today?

369
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,250
Something happened at work?

370
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,250
You're drinking
like there's no tomorrow.

371
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,730
I met him.

372
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,970
Who?

373
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:07,811
Jin Shichuan.

374
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,690
I knew you'd overthink it.

375
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:14,970
So I kept it from you.

376
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:16,490
But don't worry.

377
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,171
Jin Shichuan is 100 percent

378
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,730
not interested in Xu Lai.

379
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,091
But Xu Lai is serious about him.

380
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,091
See?

381
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,210
I told you before

382
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,851
to confess your feelings but you didn't.

383
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:34,131
Shame on me for being too confident.

384
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,050
At first, I thought

385
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,730
I'd find a good time

386
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,970
after Xu Lai returned from overseas

387
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,050
to tell her my feelings.

388
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,891
But today,

389
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,171
when I saw the way Xu Lai looked at him,

390
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,131
I knew it was game over for me.

391
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,611
Who would've thought

392
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,450
that brief encounter from ten years ago

393
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,411
could make Xu Lai so invested.

394
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:53,851
You know it yourself.

395
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,010
It's been ten years.

396
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:56,931
Can it survive on memories alone?

397
00:23:58,331 --> 00:23:59,411
Once she hits a dead end,

398
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:00,811
she'll naturally give up.

399
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,571
If I hadn't

400
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,050
missed the bus back then...

401
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,250
If I had been able

402
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,811
to go to her in time...

403
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,210
If I had been the one to save Xu Lai

404
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,210
and not Jin Shichuan...

405
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,770
Could things

406
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:17,730
have been different then?

407
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,331
Sir, how long will this traffic take?

408
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,651
Who can say?

409
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:29,210
It could take the whole night.

410
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,171
(Sorry.)

411
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,131
(The number you have dialed is not...)

412
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:45,730
I'll get off here.

413
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:46,931
Okay.

Hello, Han Fang.

434
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:53,730
(It's dangerous in Huining right now.)

435
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:54,730
(Are you really going there?)

436
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:55,891
It's because it's dangerous

437
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,970
that I must go.

438
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,091
Xu Lai is there.

439
00:25:58,371 --> 00:25:59,490
I have to make sure she's safe.

440
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,690
Got to go.

441
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,530
Drive, please.

442
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:18,450
Where to?

443
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,651
Huining.

444
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,611
Don't you know what happened?

Everyone's trying to leave.

446
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,770

447
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,530
Sir.

448
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,970
I'm going there to look

449
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:25,811
for someone important.

450
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,651
Sorry. Can't do it.

451
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,931
The situation there is bad.

452
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:28,970
The roads have been sealed.

453
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:32,371
Is there any other way?

454
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,571
I can pay you more, sir.

455
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,970
However much you want.

456
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,210
It's not about money.

457
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,371
You're asking me to put my life at risk.

458
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,770
Is this enough?

459
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,811
Please take me there.

463
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,210
How did you know I am here?

464
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:05,891
Xu Lai.

465
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,050
I finally found you.

466
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,210
I won't let you get hurt again.

467
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm never leaving you.

468
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:25,891
In the past,

469
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,450
I treated her like a little sister.

470
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,050
Until that earthquake happened.

471
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,010
I realized then

472
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,290
how scared I was of losing her.

473
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,891
So what are you going to do?

474
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,730
Are you giving up?

475
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,010
I can lose everything

476

I have right now.

477
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,250
But not Xu Lai.

478
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,851
I'll never let anyone

479
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,050
take her from me.

480
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:25,651
Chef.

481
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,530
Captain Jin, I'm so sorry.

482
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:28,931
I just started working here.

483
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,970

484
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:31,131
The dishes aren't ready.

485
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:32,010
It's not all on you.

486
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:33,331
We never know when we'd get dispatched.

487
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,851
Yes, right. It will be ready soon.

488
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:37,450
No need to apologize.

489
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:38,651
I'll help cook, okay?

490
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,690
You help too.

491
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,611
Captain Jin is cooking!

492
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:43,931
Where's the knife?

493
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,171
Here.

494
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:49,611
Time to eat!

495
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,250
Thanks, Captain Jin!

496
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,331
Thanks, Captain Jin.

497
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:05,611
Cabbage.

498
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:07,371
Thanks, bro.

499
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:08,530
Thanks.

500
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:13,050
Steamed buns.

501
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,091
Delicious.

502
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,730
Gosh.

503
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:19,450
It's so good.

504
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,131
- So good.
- Incredible!

505
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:22,490
The best!

506
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:24,770
This is what I'm talking about.

507
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:26,690
The carrots.

508
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,651

Ouch.

511
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,371
My leg hurts.

512
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:57,690
How is it?

513
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:58,851
Is your eye feeling okay?

514
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:04,730
It's a goner.

515
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,010
Ouch.

516
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,131
I can't.

517
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:08,571
What's wrong?

518
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:10,811
My leg hurts.

519
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,450
Isn't your old injury on the back?

520
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,290
What happened to your leg?

521
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:16,371
My back.

522
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,091
My back.

523
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,250
It hurts even worse.

524
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,411
I'm done for.

525
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,331
I'll get you another shot

526
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:21,770
later then.

527
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,131
No need.

528
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,931
I just want it checked again.

529
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:27,851
Okay.

530
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,811
I'll arrange for an X-ray.

531
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,530
We'll see

532
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:31,411
aside from your ligament,

533
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,611
if there's anything wrong
with the bones.

534
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:33,371
Okay.

535
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,131
Thanks, doctor.

536
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:38,371
I'll do as you say.

537
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:40,250
Good work.

538
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,250
The pharmacy is on the first floor.

539
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:49,891
Thanks.

540
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,050
Can we chat?

541
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,530
Chat about what?

542
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,611
I'd like to chat with you

543
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,530
about Doctor Zang.

544
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,331
How is she like?

545
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:17,050
Doctor Zang?

546
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,730
Doctor Zang is famous at the hospital

547
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,091
for her amazing surgical skills.

548
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,050
Great techniques, professional.

549
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,010
Very talented.

550
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,290
Any other traits

551
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:26,571
outside of work?

552
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:28,651
Outside of work?

553
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,891
She's quite the drinker.

554
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,331
At our last gathering,

555
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:35,331
she out drank

556
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,530
all the male doctors

557
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:37,411
in the department.

558
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,210
Is being a good drinker a trait?

559
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,611
Does she have something

560
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,450
like a boyfriend

561
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,571
or an ex-boyfriend?

562
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:46,811
Boyfriend?

563
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,811
Doctor Zang just transferred here.

564
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,851
I've not seen

565
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:53,891
anyone like a boyfriend.

566
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,891
But,

567
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,331
I heard that her former partner

568
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,411
was a fireman.

569
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,091
He won

570
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,371
first place in the National

571
00:31:59,371 --> 00:31:59,970
Fire Fighting Competition.

572
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:01,651
Captain Jin?

573
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,210
Thank you.

574
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,050
Captain Jin.

575
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,571
Xiaohan.

576
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,210
Give me the records for bed 15.

577
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,290
Thanks.

578
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:19,171
Doctor Zang.

579
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,250
Congrats.

580
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,010
Congrats for what?

581
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:22,811
Is that fireman

582
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:23,730
going after you?

583
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,811
No need to be shy.

584
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,010
We've all heard.

585
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,450
He's been asking about you
all over the hospital.

586
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,171
Our dear Captain Jin

587
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,651
has such a terrible taste.

588
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,210
He's interested in a tigress?

589
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:43,290
Shocking.

590
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,210
Nice.

591
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:48,290
Get out of the hospital now.

592
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,450
I think my back pain just got worse.

593
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,811
My leg feels numb now. Look.

594
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:56,490
I can't feel anything.

595
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:57,770
Don't feel anything?

596
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,371
How about this?

597
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:08,851
You're doing it too hard.

598
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,131
Do you want to test the other leg?

599
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:12,091
No, thanks.

600
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,250
You have three seconds.

601
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:14,611
If you don't leave,

602
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,210
I'll show you

603
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,651
what not feeling anything truly is.

604
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,611
Hey, wait.

605
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,131
Three.

606
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:19,331
Let me explain.

607
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:19,931
Two.

608
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,891
I'm the patient.

609
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,411
One.

610
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:36,010
I want this.

611
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,571
Basil chicken and garlic pasta,

612
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,970
with a grilled chicken thigh.

613
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:42,811
And this too.

614
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:43,371
That's enough.

615
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:44,010
Thanks.

616
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:45,331
Thank you.

617
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:46,931
Why are you out wearing that?

618
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,690
I just left

619
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,651
the hospital.

620
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,571
So you got

621
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:51,331
kicked out

622
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:52,290
by that Doctor Zang?

623
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,931
If I didn't leave,

624
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:54,851
my life would be in danger.

625
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,331
So,

626
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:58,490
did you find anything?

627
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:01,931
I asked everyone I could

628
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,611
in the hospital.

629
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,811
I learned that she's a workaholic.

630
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,891
Apart from work, it's still work.

631
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,331
She comes and goes by herself.

632
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,610
Very bland.

633
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:10,891
Stop. Just get to the point.

634
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,090
Her ex-boyfriend

635
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,771
was a fireman.

636
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,371
And he won first place

637
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:15,650
in the National Fire Fighting Competition.

638
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,170
A fireman?

639
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,931
Fire Fighting Competition?

640
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,371
Then...

641
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,170
That means it's Jin Shichuan.

642
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,530
No.

643
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:25,891
No.

644
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:28,610
Well, yeah.

645
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,010
It's true

646
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,251
that not many fire fighters

647
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:31,811
were champions

648
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,811
in the national competition.

649
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:38,530
I think,

650
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,050
Zang Qiu could very well be

651
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,130
Captain Jin's ex-girlfriend.

652
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:42,851
No way.

653
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:43,811
Moreover,

654
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,170
his feelings have not abated.

655
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:48,650
Captain Jin said it before

656
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:49,771
that Zang Qiu hates him.

657
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,331
People say the stronger you hate,

658
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,570
the stronger you love.

659
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,530
It's likely to be true.

660
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,170
Enough.

661
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,251
Eat your food.

662
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:01,970
I'll eat then.

663
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:20,010
Doctor Zang Qiu.

664
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:21,450
She can't

665
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,931
possibly be Jin Shichuan's ex, right?

666
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,450
Could it really be like what

667
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:26,970
Lu Fangqi said?

668
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,371
They still have feelings for each other?

669
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:35,450
Whatever.

670
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:37,490
Even if she's the ex,

671
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,931
that's in the past now.

672
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,090
Only those who have failed before know

673
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:43,771
how to cherish the right one.

674
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,731
What she had

675
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,691
was Jin Shichuan's past.

676
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:49,490
What I have

677
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,610
is Jin Shichuan's future.

678
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,371
Based on this alone, I've won.

679
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,650
I should focus

680
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,130
on Jin Shichuan instead.

681
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,331
I'm sure

682
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,371
I can make Jin Shichuan mine.

683
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,610
Captain Jin.

684
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,170
Can we chat?

685
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,251
What is it?

686
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:40,691
You came to talk
right after your hospital visit.

687
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,891
I got chased out

688
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,331
from the hospital.

689
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:44,891
So I wanted to find some comfort

690
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,010
from you.

691
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,490
Who chased you out?

692
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,411
Who else but that fierce Doctor Zang.

693
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,650
Captain Jin.

694
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:55,891
Did you know

695
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,130
Doctor Zang from before?

696
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,891
I feel like
she's particularly harsh on you.

697
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,931
Did you two

698
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:03,450
have some sort

699
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,811
of history?

700
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,211
It's almost lights out.

701
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:09,570
Go and sleep.

702
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,050
The lights are still on.

703
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,610
Your back is hurt, right?

704
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,771
Go and lie down.

705
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:32,090
I'll go sleep then.

706
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,050
Goodnight.

707
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,371
Goodnight.

708
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,331
(Did you two)

709
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,731
(have some sort)

710
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,371
(of history?)

711
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,650
I told you I'm fine.

712
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:53,251
No, it might get infected.

713
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:54,170
You need a shot.

714
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,570
Shichuan.

715
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,891
Go outside and wait.

716
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:15,891
Shut the door.

717
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:22,851
Hello.

718
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,050
Hi.

719
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:24,811
Take a seat.

720
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,450
What's happened?

721
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:34,691
Nothing.

722
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,130
Just a scratch on my leg.

723
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,050
Where? Show me.

724
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:48,970
Right here.

725
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:52,050
Take off your pants.

726
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,050
I'll take a look over there.

727
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,411
Why haven't you changed yet?

728
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,731
I've done

729
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:06,771
your discharge procedure.

730
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,731
Get changed.

731
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:08,371
Wait a minute.

732
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:09,371
For what?

733
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:11,331
Morning.

734
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:12,731
Good morning.

735
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,170
I heard you're getting discharged today.

736
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,211
This is already the second time

737
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:33,291
I met you in the hospital.

738
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,050
I hope there won't be a third.

739
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,490
Do you dislike me so much?

740
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:39,931
It's not that.

741
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,291
I mean...

742
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:45,371
I hope that you'll be healthy and safe,

743
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,530
and not get hurt again.

744
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:48,691
Then you won't have to come
to the hospital again.

745
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,771
This is for you.

746
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,811
Think of it as a farewell gift.

747
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,211
Thanks.

748
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:04,490
I like it.

749
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:06,650
Then...

750
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,050
Well.

751
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:10,771
I... I'll get going.

752
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,851
Wait. Hold on.

753
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,170
What is it?

754
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,490
But I

755
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,851
would still like

756
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,530
to see you more often.

757
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:27,411
But not

758
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:28,530
as a doctor and patient.

759
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,010
Can I?

760
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,500
(Civil Affairs Bureau
Marriage Registration Office)

761
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:49,771
Congrats.

762
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:52,050
- We're married.
- We're married!

763
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:57,090
Shichuan.

764
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,170
Take a photo of us.

765
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:58,891
Okay.

766
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,731
How should we pose?

767
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:01,610
I'll carry you.

768
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,090
Come on.

769
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,650
We are married!

770
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,050
Okay. Look here.

771
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:10,251
Fang Huai, look here.

772
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:10,771
Dear.

773
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:12,411
Dear.

774
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,331
Dear.

775
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,570
Dear.

776
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,450
Are you dizzy?

777
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,771
Shichuan.

778
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,450
What's the matter?

779
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:27,090
It's nothing.

780
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:27,851
Jealous?

781
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:30,450
Kid.

782
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:31,731
You'll find your happiness too.

783
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:33,891
Dear.

784
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,251
He's like the witness

785
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:37,570
to our relationship.

786
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:39,211
Why not ask him

787
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,450
to take a picture with us?

788
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,090
Sure.

789
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:44,050
Come on. Don't just stand there.

790
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,411
Ready.

791
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,050
Wait!

792
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,170
Here goes.

793
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,891
The tank's empty.

794
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,090
Fang Huai, let's go.

795
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:17,811
Retreat!

796
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,170
Everyone, get out, now!

797
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:29,851
Fang Huai.

798
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,130
