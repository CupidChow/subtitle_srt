00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:52,976
It was you who deceived me

188
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,216
into signing the contract with you.

189
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:55,496
I'm clear-minded now.

190
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:56,576
I want to focus on my career

191
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,216
and not be burdened by emotions.

192
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:00,137
Besides, didn't you always want

193
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:01,216
to draw a line between us?

194
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:02,816
I'm doing what you want.

195
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,616
That reason is not good enough.

196
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:08,576
Rejected.

197
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:09,657
Huo Yanzong,

198
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:10,336
did you lose your mind

199
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:11,696
after making that trip to Huining?

200
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:15,576
I'm very clear-headed.

201
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,377
When we signed the contract,

202
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:18,657
we did it voluntarily.

203
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:20,816
It was you who actively pursued me

204
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:23,137
and made promise to take care
of everything concerning me.

205
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,377
You know

206
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:25,377
I don't joke around.

207
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:26,897
I take everything seriously.

208
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,736
Since you promised to take charge of me,

209
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:30,976
then see it through.

210
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,496
No backing out.

211
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:34,216
Secondly,

212
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:36,257
if you want to strive for a career,

213
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:37,856
you should fulfill

214
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,216
our contract even more.

215
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:40,937
That way, the public will continue

216
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:42,576
to pay attention to our relationship

217
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:44,216
and maintain your popularity.

218
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:46,456
It will only benefit you.

219
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:47,417
You...

220
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:48,336
Thirdly,

221
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:51,816
right now.

222
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:58,976
I don't want

223
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,417
to draw a line between us.

224
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:06,057
You're...

225
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,576
You're simply unreasonable.

226
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,257
You're torturing me on purpose.

227
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,777
Huo Yanzong, you're despicable.

228
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:13,897
I was so blind to fall for you.

229
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,496
I didn't expect you
to be this kind of person.

230
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:18,937
What kind of person am I?

231
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:23,976
You can try to get to know

232
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,257
what kind of person I am gradually.

233
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:29,336
As to what kind of roles,

234
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:31,777
be it as a spokesperson or a girlfriend,

235
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,057
you can pick either one

236
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,137
or pick both.

237
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,177
I won't mind.

238
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:40,816
Shameless.

239
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:46,137
Get in.

240
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
(Dedicated Canine)

241
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:50,937
Go. Get in.

242
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:56,177
They want to come out and play.

243
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:01,336
What's the matter?

244
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,017
Captain Jin and Lu Fangqi

245
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:03,937
have girlfriends now.

246
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,096
I'm the only one who's still single.

247
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,216
Let me see.

248
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,640
(Lu Fangqi. Jin Shichuan)

249
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,017
Ms. Xu.

250
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:13,897
They look pretty happy.

251
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,257
Don't fret about it. You still have me

252
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:17,496
to stay single with you.

253
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,897
But you're leaving the team soon.

254
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:22,537
After you leave,

255
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,096
I'll be even lonelier.

256
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:26,576
By the way,

257
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,496
what's your plan after leaving the team?

258
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:31,976
I'll go home

259
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:33,897
and accompany my grandma.

260
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:35,976
After so many years,

261
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,576
I haven't done my duty as a grandson.

262
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,456
I don't think much about the rest.

263
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:41,736
In any case, I don't expect

264
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:42,657
to be rich.

265
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:44,937
I just want a simple

266
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,496
and contented life.

267
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:49,696
Working at the fire station
for so many years,

268
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,696
there were many thrilling incidents.

269
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:54,297
It's enough for me to boast
for a lifetime.

270
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,177
You're right about that.

271
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,057
I still need to find a wife

272
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,377
and have two children.

273
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,696
That's great but are two enough?

274
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:10,017
Once you get comfortable at home,

275
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:11,257
don't forget to come back

276
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:12,937
and visit the guys and me.

277
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:14,216
Don't worry.

278
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:16,657
You'll always be my kids' godfather.

279
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,576
All right. Godfather it is.

280
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:39,777
Zang Qiu.

281
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:41,417
What are you doing here?

282
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:42,417
It's my off day.

283
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:43,576
I want to take you somewhere.

284
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:47,616
Is your leg okay?

285
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:49,137
It's okay.

286
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:50,937
I just had surgery for a few hours.

287
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,057
It's a bit numb.

288
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:53,897
What are you doing?

289
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:54,937
If your leg is uncomfortable,
then don't walk.

290
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:55,816
I'll send you back.

291
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:56,496
I...

292
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,456
Dr. Zang, is that your boyfriend?

293
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:02,017
Put me down.

294
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,257
They're going to tease me.

295
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:04,537
Since they've already seen us,

296
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:05,856
let them envy us.

297
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:07,616
Put me down.

298
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:14,496
Didn't you say
you're taking me somewhere?

299
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,417

I like you.

314
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:35,297
What did you say?

315
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,456
I said

316
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:39,856
I like you.

317
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,257
It's the first time

318
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:46,057
you said you like me.

319
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:47,057
You used to say

320
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:47,897
you didn't like younger men.

321
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,216
When you said you like me,

322
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,297
it feels like I'm dreaming.

323
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,417
I'm not dreaming now, am I?

324
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,616
I like Lu Fangqi.

325
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,696
It doesn't matter
if he's older or younger.

326
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,137
I like you

327
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:00,816
because you're you.

328
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:02,897
Then what do you like about me?

329
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,216
I like

330
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:10,897
your thick eyebrows,

331
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,057
bright eyes like a puppy,

332
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,057
and tall nose.

333
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,177
I love your mouth the most

334
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:20,976
because it always says things

335
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,377
that make my heart flutter.

336
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,657
And...

337
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:26,736

I spent all afternoon

344
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,216
making these.

345
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,256
Try it.

346
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:09,337
What is this?

347
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,377
Potato shreds.

348
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,976
The cuts aren't very visually appealing.

349
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,456
The potatoes are too hard.

350
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,097
Why don't try and see how it tastes?

351
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,016
Okay.

352
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:26,337
Eat it.

353
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:33,696
Is it good?

354
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:36,617
Yes.

355
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:37,857
Try this one too.

356
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,097
It's delicious.

357
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,177
Then have some more.

358
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:54,696
By the way,

359
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,456
I have another surprise for you.

360
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:57,897
Another surprise?

361
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,200
(Dating Schedule)

362
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,337
Dating Schedule?

363
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:06,577
Yes, a dating schedule.

364
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:07,696
But don't worry.

365
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:08,577
It won't waste

366
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:09,736
a single minute of your time.

367
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,417
Just complete it

368
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,016
while you're resting. And that's it.

369
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,097
If there are any unexpected situations,

370
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:20,976
remember to report to me in advance.

371
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,296
Yes, I will strictly follow

372
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:25,776
the leader's instruction.

373
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,657
If you absent yourself from work
without reason,

374
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,937
the leader can impose punishment.

375
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:42,496
Ma'am,

376
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:43,976
what kind of punishment
do you have in mind?

377
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,296
Let me think about it.

378
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,456
Await for the leader's instruction.

379
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,937
So you're interrogating
your leader, huh?

380
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:56,536
I'll punish you now.

381
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:58,937
What kind of punishment?

382
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:01,776
I'll punish you

383
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,296
to do a hundred squats.

384
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:05,897
Report to the leader.

385
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:08,337
You're really
underestimating Captain Jin.

386
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:11,177
I hope to increase the load.

387
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:12,617
Increase the load?

388
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,056
I'm carrying you to see the stars.

389
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:26,377
Remember to say goodbye

390
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:27,577
to Liu Xu on my behalf.

391
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:30,696
Then I'll get going now.

392
00:19:43,736 --> 00:19:45,177
You're going to
the provincial team soon.

393
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:46,976
Remember to call me when you arrive.

394
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:49,456
Okay.

395
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,377
I'll get going.

396
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:00,857
It won't be easy to see you

397
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,337
in the future.

398
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,657
You'll be late for work
if you don't leave now.

399
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:35,296
Okay, I'm leaving now.

400
00:20:59,097 --> 00:20:59,897
Come here!

401
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,456
Give him applause!

402
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,410
(Squad Leader Liu Xu's Farewell Party)

403
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,857
Everyone is making such a fuss.

404
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:15,897
We still have to go through
the necessary procedures.

405
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,536
This weekend,

406
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,857
our squad leader Liu Xu

407
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:20,857
is leaving the team.

408
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,016
So today, our station

409
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:24,496
has prepared

410
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,216
a small farewell party for you.

411
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:27,776
Let's give him applause.

412
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:29,456
- Great.
- Nice.

413
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,256
Anyway,

414
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,937
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

415
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:40,976
Squad leader.

416
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:42,536
There's something I want to say.

417
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:43,296
You might not like it.

418
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:44,256
Then don't say it.

419
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:50,216
Well, everything about you is great.

420
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,137
It's just this mouth of yours

421
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,736
which is always making snide remarks.

422
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:56,897
I've been greatly affected by it.

423
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:58,577
- Me too.
- You're not the only one.

424
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,776
- That's right.
- Well, he does that.

425
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,577
As soon as I think

426
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:06,097
about how this mouth

427
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,216
won't be around the station anymore,

428
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:11,776
I suddenly feel that things
will be too quiet around here.

429
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,617
I'm not used to it.

430
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:19,897
Squad Leader.

431
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,056
Don't forget about us

432
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,137
after you go back.

433
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:30,897
Don't worry.

434
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,817
I will never forget everyone.

435
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:34,496
Well, I'm not sure about you.

436
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:36,577
What did you say?

437
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:40,177
Lu Fangqi,

438
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:44,417
I may always hurt you.

439
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,097
But you must be happy.

440
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:51,377
Understand?

441
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:53,617
Yeah.

442
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:11,536
Xu,

443
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,097
can you not leave?

444
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:15,817
You're kidding me, right?

445
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:16,736
What's wrong with you?

446
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:19,417
Why is a grown man like you crying?

447
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:20,256
Come on.

448
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:21,496
Are you still going to cry?

449
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:24,937
Listen to me.

450
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,296
After I leave,

451
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,496
I want you to cooperate
with Captain Jin well

452
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,296
and take over my position.

453
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:35,857
Understand?

454
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:38,496
Do you understand?

455
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:39,577
Yes, sir.

456
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:40,296
I can't hear you!

457
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:41,377
Yes, sir!

458
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:42,696
Let's hug.

459
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:54,056
Let's invite Captain Jin
to end the speech.

460
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:55,256
Give him applause!

461
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:56,897
Okay!

462
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:57,736
All right!

463
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,296
- Great!
- Nice!

464
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:15,456
Captain Jin,

465
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,296
these years at the fire station

466
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:21,536
have been the most memorable time

467
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:22,736
of my life.

468
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:26,736
You'll always be my leader,

469
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:29,976
and I, Liu Xu,

470
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,657
will always be your team member.

471
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:36,776
Firefighter 120099.

472
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:38,736
Yes, sir.

473
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:41,657
It's been 12 years.

474
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,817
You've been a firefighter for 12 years.

475
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:49,857
For that, I'm grateful.

476
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:54,296
Thank you

477
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:55,657
for saving so many lives,

478
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:59,216
leading our men,

479
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:00,736
and risking your life.

480
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:07,736
It's been five years.

481
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:09,857
Do you still remember that?

482
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:10,776
Come over here, Captain Jin.

483
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,016
This is our canteen.

484
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:13,817
The place is not bad.

485
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,937
The chef's cooking
is especially delicious.

486
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:18,976
And our meat buns

487
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,776
are so delicious. They're the best.

488
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:22,137
We also have

489
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:23,177
some stray animals in our station.

490
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:24,536
I would bring some food

491
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,296
to feed them.

492
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:28,177
By the way, Captain Jin.

493
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:29,776
I heard

494
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:31,137
that you used to be
in a search and rescue dog team.

495
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,016
How did you end up here

496
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,016
as a firefighter?

497
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,736
Personal reason.
I want a change of environment.

498
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:40,496
Captain Jin,

499
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,016
I'll tell you one secret.

500
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,456
I have a fear of fire.

501
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:47,056
It's true.

502
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:52,337
I got burned by fire when I was a child.

503
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:54,496
But I think real men

504
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:56,296
should face their fears.

505
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:59,337
Even though I knew the risks,

506
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:00,496
I decided to become a firefighter.

507
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:02,016
By extinguishing fire,

508
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:03,296
I feel like I'm conquering

509
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:04,337
the fear within myself.

510
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:05,256
The more I fear it,

511
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:06,296
the more determined I am to put it out.

512
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:07,937
Am I right?

513
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,337
Five years ago,

514
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:21,177
it was Liu Xu who welcomed me first.

515
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:23,776
It was right here.

516
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:27,216
Thank you.

517
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:30,657
Thank you for staying with me
for five years.

518
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:35,817
In my heart,

519
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,177
you're not just firefighter 120099.

520
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:42,817
I've always considered you
as an older brother.

521
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:50,456
In a few days,

522
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:52,696
you'll be leaving the team.

523
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:55,857
Get yourself together,

524
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:57,857
start a new life,

525
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:01,577
and live the life you want.

526
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,256
But don't forget

527
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,736
to send our regards to your parents
when the time comes.

528
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:14,496
Salute!

529
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:10,817
Mighty,

530
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,536
I'm leaving.

531
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:15,496
There will be a new trainer

532
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,536
to take care of you.

533
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,177
You must eat well, drink well,

534
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,296
complete every mission,

535
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,256
and be the most outstanding
search and rescue dog.

536
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:37,296
Mighty,

537
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:41,016
I'm leaving.

538
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:44,456
Don't miss me too much.

539
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,417
You're a search and rescue dog,

540
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,137
and I'm a firefighter.

541
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:53,056
We

542
00:28:54,937 --> 00:28:55,976
don't shed tears,

543
00:28:57,976 --> 00:28:58,657
only blood and sweat.

544
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:03,216
Attention!

545
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:09,177
Salute.

546
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:17,736
Goodbye.

547
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,490
(Firefighting)

548
00:29:26,736 --> 00:29:27,857
Today is the day you leave the team.

549
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,216
Isn't it better
if you stay in your room?

550
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,016
It's not even midnight yet.

551
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,216
So it doesn't count as leaving.

552
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:33,776
Let me do one last mission.

553
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:34,817
Are you ready?

554
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:36,496
Captain Jin,

555
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:37,216
why are you here?

556
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:37,937
The situation is urgent.

557
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,137
So I'm coming with you. Hurry!

558
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:40,177
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

559
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,337
Guys, there's a fire

560
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,536
at a small-scale oil refinery
on Yunke Road, south of the city.

561
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:00,417
We need to go there immediately

562
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:01,016
for coverage.

563
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:01,657
Zhang, Coco,

564
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,377
come with me to the scene.

565
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:03,417
The rest of you stay on standby here.

566
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:04,736
The situation is critical.

567
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:06,016
So everyone must stay focused.

568
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,736
Move back. Move back.

569
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:11,617
Move back a little!

570
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:46,857
Captain Jin,

571
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:47,577
this is the safety officer

572
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:48,256
of the oil refinery.

573
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,177
Is there any trapped personnel?

574
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:50,937
Where's the origin of fire?

575
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:51,817
Yes,

576
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,657
there are seven workers inside.

577
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:55,056
The fire started on level two

578
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:55,817
of Zone B

579
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,657
and is spreading from west to east.

580
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,056
The fire is getting bigger.

581
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:00,137
The east area of level two stores

582
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:01,496
a lot of hazardous materials.

583
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:03,016
The situation is extremely complicated.

584
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:04,296
If the fire gets too intense,

585
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:06,137
the storage tanks on level two
could explode,

586
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:06,976
causing a chain reaction

587
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:07,817
with the external tanks.

588
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:09,097
The consequences would be severe.

589
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:11,097
We need to send technicians in

590
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,417
to shut off the valves on the tanks.

591
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,577
Shichuan!

592
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:23,696
Commissioner.

593
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,496
We just received a notice
from the command center

594
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,056
that this oil refinery stores

595
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:31,256
highly flammable

596
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:31,857
and explosive chemicals.

597
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,657
If the fire gets out of control,

598
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:35,496
the external tanks will explode,

599
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,256
affecting

600
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,056
the surrounding residential areas.

601
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:42,296
The brigade
has dispatched reinforcements.

602
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:43,456
They're coming here

603
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:44,536
to handle decontamination
and containment.

604
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:46,337
Shichuan,

605
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,337
you should handle this fire.

606
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:50,817
And you must ensure the safety

607
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,216
of people's lives and property.

608
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:53,177
Yes, sir.

609
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:03,897
First squad, set up the water cannons

610
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:05,776
and continuously cool down

611
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:07,097
the building and tanks.

612
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:08,097
Yes, sir!

613
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,360
(Gangshuo Petrochemical Refinery)

614
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:13,016
(Second squad, assist)

615
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,377
(in constructing containment barriers
and decontamination tents.)

616
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,417
(Copy that!)

617
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,177
(Third squad is in charge of
search and rescue.)

618
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:19,736
Yes, sir!

619
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:21,496
(Prepare for
interior search and rescue!)

620
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,536
Put on heat-resistant suits now!

621
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:25,937
Lu Fangqi,

622
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,337
move all the hazardous chemicals
from the warehouse

623
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:28,456
to a safe area.

624
00:32:28,776 --> 00:32:29,216
Yes, sir!

625
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:30,736
Aerial ladder truck, move forward!

626
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,377
Fire truck, follow along!

627
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:33,617
Ma Shanglai.

628
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:34,296
Yes, sir!

629
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,776
You guys come with me.

630
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:37,137
Yes, sir. Follow me!

631
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,256
Make way! Make way! Make way!

632
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:40,097
Come on! Come!

633
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:42,736
Excuse me, please.

634
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:45,097
Zhang,

635
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,177
lead a few people to follow me.

636
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,056
Get ready for live broadcasting
at any time.

637
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:48,056
The rest stay here

638
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:48,696
to cover the scene.

639
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:52,776
Stay safe.

640
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:58,657
Everyone, check your headsets.

641
00:32:58,976 --> 00:32:59,817
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

642
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,817
Excuse me.

643
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,296
May I know who's in charge here?

644
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:07,097
It's me.

645
00:33:07,857 --> 00:33:08,216
Hello.

646
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,736
May I conduct an interview with you?

647
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:10,817
Well.

648
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:30,577
Aim higher! Aim higher!

649
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:31,337
A little higher!

650
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:33,657
Ms. Xu, we can start rolling now.

651
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,696
Ms. Xu? Ms. Xu.

652
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:38,216
We can start now.

653
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:42,776
I'm Xu Lai, a reporter

654
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:43,337
from Huaigang TV.

655
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:44,377
Next, I'll provide

656
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:45,377
on-site coverage for everyone.

657
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:30,937
Command center!
Come in, command center!

658
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:32,777
We're currently transmitting
drone footage.

659
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,616
We're currently transmitting
drone footage!

660
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,937
We need you to call for help quickly.

661
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,096
Move everything out.

662
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:46,697
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

663
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,417
A large number of gas cylinders
were found in the warehouse.

664
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:51,257
We need backup now.

665
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,016
Tao, Peng.

666
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,297
Come with me
and bring the technical personnel

667
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,417
to search on the first floor.

668
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:54,976
Yes, sir!

669
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:55,616
Liu Xu,

670
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,297
take Zhang Yang and Cui Jianan

671
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:58,496
to search the second floor.

672
00:34:59,377 --> 00:34:59,976
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

673
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,496
Help me.

674
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:21,176
Someone's there. Go!

675
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:21,656
Help.

676
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:41,897
There's someone ahead!

677
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,536
Hurry, move the rack aside.

678
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:00,937
Cool it down!

679
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:01,817
Yes, sir!

680
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,777
- Hurry!
- Keep up!

681
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:22,096
Go!

682
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:24,056
Quickly!

683
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:25,536
Hurry!

684
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,056
(The situation at the scene
is quite complicated.)

685
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:27,456
Hurry!

686
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:28,697
(There are many hazardous chemicals.)

687
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,096
We need backup.
I repeat we need backup.

688
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,176
Pull over to the side. Quick! Quick!

689
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:37,136
Hurry up! Hurry!

690
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:38,297
Move faster.

691
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:38,817
Quick.

692
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:40,576
Quick.

693
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:51,496
Bring the stretcher!

694
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:52,576
Over here!

695
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:04,616
The temperature
of the tank keeps rising.

696
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:05,697
If it gets hotter,

697
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:07,217
the storage tank
could explode at any moment.

698
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:10,496
Get the technical personnel here!

699
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:15,536
All seven people have been located.

700
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:16,777
We're now escorting them out.

701
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:19,777
You must help us

702
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:20,536
put out the fire.

703
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:21,737
- Back up. Back up.
- Speed up.

704
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:48,016
What's the situation?

705
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,136
The temperature here is too high.

706
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,176
The valve is not working.

707
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,337
It can't be closed.

708
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:53,377
Is there any solution?

709
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:55,656
We can only close
the valve manually now.

710
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:26,817
Tao!

711
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:27,857
The water hose!

712
00:38:28,257 --> 00:38:29,417
Suppress the fire!

713
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:19,897
The main valve on the first floor
is damaged.

714
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:20,937
Any other solutions?

715
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:21,857
On the east side of the first floor,

716
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:23,056
there are three manual branch valves.

717
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:23,616
The exact location...

718
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:24,217
Captain Jin.

719
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:24,976
Captain Jin,

720
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,176
there's another situation.

721
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,496
The plant underwent an upgrade before.

722
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:29,576
In the northeast corner
of the second floor,

723
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:30,656
there's an old compartmentalized tank

724
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,616
connected to the product storage tank
on the first floor.

725
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:34,217
If it gets heated and explodes,

726
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,417
it'll also endanger

727
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,096
the vertical storage tanks outside.

728
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:37,616
We must close the two valves

729
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:38,217
on the second floor.

730
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,536
Otherwise, the consequences
would be unimaginable.

731
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:41,857
Where exactly it is on the second floor?

732
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:43,937
Both are in the northeast corner.

733
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:45,576
In other words,

734
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,297
there are a total of five manual valves.

735
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:48,616
All of them must be closed

736
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,136
to cut off all internal circulation.

737
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,176
Only then the vertical storage tanks
outside

738
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,217
won't explode.

739
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:55,056
Whether it'll work,

740
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:56,096
I need to give it a try.

741
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:57,417
Shichuan,

742
00:39:58,576 --> 00:39:59,656
judging from the current fire situation,

743
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,217
we don't have much time left.

744
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:02,536
We must handle it quickly.

745
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:04,576
If we can't control the fire,

746
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:06,016
once the refinery explodes,

747
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,817
it'll affect the surrounding residents.

748
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,456
I have already consulted
with the command center

749
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:11,056
to request the television station

750
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:11,857
to broadcast the surrounding situation
on television

751
00:40:12,297 --> 00:40:13,217
and evacuate the nearby population.

752
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:15,297
Yes, sir. I'll make arrangements.

753
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:16,616
Put on your gear.

754
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:17,737
Get ready to enter the fire with me.

755
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:18,496
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

756
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:19,536
Hurry now!

757
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:23,337
Liu Xu. Zhang Yang.

758
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:23,897
Report your location.

759
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:26,857
Captain Jin, we're on the second floor.

760
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,056
There's a large tank in the northeast
of the second floor,

761
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,136
There are two valves next to it.

762
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:31,456
Search immediately and close the valves.

763
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:31,976
Yes, sir!

764
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:32,337
Yes, sir!

765
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:33,857
Let's go!

766
00:40:39,456 --> 00:40:40,136
Jin Shichuan,

767
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:41,377
are you okay?

768
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,096
I'm okay.

769
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:44,176
There's an emergency.

770
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:45,576
There is a certain danger

771
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:46,697
in the refinery now.

772
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:48,297
The external storage tanks may explode.

773
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:49,536
When that happens,

774
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:51,016
it may endanger
the surrounding residents.

775
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:51,496
Okay,

776
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:52,456
I'll release the information

777
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:52,937
as soon as possible

778
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:53,697
and urge the surrounding residents

779
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:54,337
to evacuate quickly.

780
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:55,777
Start a live broadcast.

781
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:56,857
Commissioner Wen

782
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,176
has already confirmed
with the command center.

783
00:40:58,737 --> 00:40:59,217
Release the latest news from the scene

784
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,417
to everyone.

785
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:00,937
Okay.

786
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:04,176
Be careful.

787
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:11,297
Zhang, prepare
for the live broadcast immediately.

788
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:12,176
Contact the higher-ups

789
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:13,136
and inform them
that a major news broadcast

790
00:41:13,176 --> 00:41:14,016
will be conducted at the scene.

791
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:15,217
Request the programs currently airing

792
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:15,737
to make way for it.

793
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:16,496
Switch channels as soon as possible.

794
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:17,697
We'll go live in 30 seconds.

795
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:18,136
Okay.

796
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:31,976
(Ladies and gentlemen,)

797
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:33,417
(now we focus on breaking news.)

798
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,056
(A fire has occurred
at a small oil refinery)

799
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:35,897
(on Yunke Road, south of the city.)

800
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:36,536
(Due to the large amount)

801
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:37,857
(of hazardous chemicals stored
in the refinery,)

802
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:38,616
(once it explodes,)

803
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:40,056
(it'll endanger the nearby residents.)

804
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:41,697
(The city's firefighting
and rescue team urges everyone)

805
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:42,616
(Sudden fire outbreak at oil refinery)
(not to panic.)

806
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:43,656
(Sudden fire outbreak at oil refinery
(Residents living nearby,)

807
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:44,976
(please evacuate in an orderly manner
with the assistance)

808
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:45,897
(of the traffic department.)

809
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,096
Tao, come over here.

810
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:50,377
Keep cooling down the temperature.

811
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:51,456
I'll go and close the valve.

812
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:51,817
Yes, sir!

813
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:12,536
Cool it down! Cool it down!

814
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:34,817
The first valve on the first floor

815
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:35,536
has been closed.

816
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:45,176
Captain Jin,

817
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:46,976
there's this unidentified liquid
leaking above.

818
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:48,456
Liu Xu,

819
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,016
there's a liquid leakage
on the second floor.

820
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:51,496
(Second Floor. 01 is closed)
Find the old tank quickly.

821
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:52,496
Be careful.

822
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,720
(Third Floor.
Old tank. Suspected leakage)

823
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:56,536
You go this way.

824
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:57,337
I'll go that way.

Xu!

828
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:22,697
