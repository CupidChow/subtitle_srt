Zhang Yang,

23
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:50,713
just tell me if you can't
bear to part with me.

24
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:51,672
Don't act like a girl.

25
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:52,832
Don't be so fickle.

26
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,752
Who said I couldn't
bear to part with you?

27
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:00,153
Alright.

28
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,832
I'll be leaving soon.

29
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,672
In the future, no one will argue with you.

30
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:08,033
Yeah.

31
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:12,432
No one will argue with me after you leave.

32
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:22,832
Actually,

33
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:27,872
I can't bear to part with you.

34
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,712
I can't bear to part with Mighty.

35
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:35,073
I can't bear to part with the guys.

36
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,353
I can't bear to part with
my uniform too.

37
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,432
Zhang Yang,

38
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,392
I promise you.

39
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,832
I will visit you and Mighty often in the future.

40
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,392
That's a promise then.

41
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,712
In order to commend the heroes
who had performed outstandingly

42
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,992
during the Huining earthquake rescue mission
on the 28th of June,

43
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,793

44
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,392

journalists, volunteers, and so on,

47
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,712
we will hold
a special recognition ceremony

48
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,353
for the disaster relief effort
during the 28th of June

49
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,753
in Huining City Hall.

50
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:46,633
Now, the ceremony officially begins.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,152
Next, let's welcome

52
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,753
all outstanding individuals
to come to the stage.

53
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,953
Let's welcome the leaders

54
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,793
to present the awards to them.

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,570
(Huining Earthquake Relief Mission
Outstanding Personnel Commendation Ceremony)

56
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:24,392
Salute!

57
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,152
Were you hurt
when you saved the drug addicts?

58
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:38,953
No.

59
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,073
Captain Jin.

60
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:40,832
I heard

61
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:41,592
that this is your second time
in Huining.

62
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:42,232
Excuse me.

63
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:43,152
Do you have any...

64
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:43,712
Miss,

65
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:44,673
do you have any questions?

66
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:50,673
Captain Jin,

67
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:53,032
how do you feel after receiving such recognition?

68
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,152
First, I'm very honored

69
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,753
to receive such recognition.

70
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,272
As a firefighter,

71
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,352
I've participated in
all kinds of rescue missions.

72
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,272
I felt the cohesion

73
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,792
each time I participated in it.

74
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:08,193
(That's the reason we're able
to move forward bravely.)

75
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:12,113
(Here, I would like to thank my comrades)

76
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:13,472
(who had joined me for many years.)

77
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:16,032
Next,

78
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:17,873
I would like to thank another person.

79
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,553
When I was in Huining,

80
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,912
a civilian and I were trapped under the ruins.

81
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:30,113
She's the one who risked her life to rescue us.

82
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,032
Can you tell us who she is?

83
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:34,912
She's my lover,

84
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,032
and the frontline journalist

85
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:37,953
of the Huining earthquake.

86
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:39,753
- A journalist?
- A journalist?

87
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:40,712
Who is she?

88
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:41,633
Who is she?

89
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,193
If so, Captain Jin,

90
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:44,953
how do you plan to thank her?

91
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:49,712
Only half of this recognition belongs to me.

92
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,113
Half of it belongs to her.

93
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,073
I hope to share this honor with her.

94
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:00,633
It's her?

95
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,993
Excellent!

96
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:32,912
Thank you.

97
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,104
(6.28, Huining Earthquake Relief Mission Outstanding
Personnel Commendation Ceremony was held.)

98
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,912
Captain Jin is so bold.

99
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,313
He announces their relationship
during the recognition ceremony.

100
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,592
I'm sure Xu Lai is very touched.

101
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,193
Not only that,
but he also gave her a medal.

102
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:56,832
I don't think any woman can stand that.

103
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:04,152
Squad leader,

104
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:06,232
help me apply for leave.

105
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,513
I have something to do.

106
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:08,953
Tell them for me.

107
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:10,513
Where are you going?

108
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,753
What's your reason then?

109
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,792
I'm sure something's off.

(Outstanding Firefighter)
(China Fire And Rescue Medal)

112
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:21,433
This is my merit medal.

113
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:23,472
Half of it is mine.

114
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:24,513
Half of it is yours.

115
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,152
Today, I will hand
my military merit medal

116
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:28,152
to the woman I love the most,

117
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,352
Zang Qiu.

118
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:34,152
Are you so touched that you can't speak?

119
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:37,113
You're copying Jin Shichuan.

120
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,032
You're so uncreative.

121
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:39,712
That's not it.

122
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:41,633
I already watched Jin Shichuan's interview.

123
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,352
Captain Jin and Xu Lai always steal my ideas.

124
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:46,753
I should return the favor,

125
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,673
you know?

126
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:48,673
You're so childish.

127
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:50,592
Men are childish

128
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,553
in front of their girlfriends.

129
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,272
Who's your girlfriend?

130
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,272
Didn't you say you would
stop pushing me away

131
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:57,633
when we were in Huining?

132
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,472
Moreover,

133
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:00,753
you were my girlfriend

134
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:01,633
when we first kissed.

135
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:03,313
You shouldn't play dirty.

136
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:04,392
You should bear responsibility for it.

137
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,433
I did say that.

138
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:08,912
But I'll only consider it

139
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:09,953
depending on your performance.

140
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:11,953
Stop considering it.

141
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:14,032
I'll bring the Civil Affairs Bureau here
if I have to.

142
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:15,873
Alright, you should head back.

143
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,032
Don't interrupt my work.

144
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:17,832
Go now.

145
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,792
Madam, I'll explain this to you again.

146
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:23,032
These medications are...

147
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:23,953
Dr. Zang,

148
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,993
that must be your younger brother.

149
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:28,753
Hello, Madam.

150
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,313
Your brother looks spirited.

151
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,393

He's a firefighter too?

152
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:37,793
(China Fire and Rescue Force)

153
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:38,313
Yeah.

154
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:39,433
How old are you?

155
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:41,592
Do you have a girlfriend?

156
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:44,232
He...

157
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,393
I had a girlfriend initially.

158
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:47,512
But she said

159
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:48,632
she needed to consider it.

160
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,273
That means you don't have one, right?

161
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,752
Great. My granddaughter

162
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:55,872
is almost the same age as you.

163
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,232
I'll introduce her to you next time.

164
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,352
Sure. Thank you, Madam.

165
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,632
I'm single anyway.

166
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:04,913
I don't have a girlfriend.

167
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:06,793
No need for that, Madam.

168
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:09,712
He has a girlfriend.

169
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,553
I thought he was single.

170
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,992
He isn't my younger brother.

171
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,193
He's my boyfriend.

172
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:20,433
So, he's your boyfriend?

173
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:21,832
Madam, rest well.

174
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:22,712
Okay.

175
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:23,472
Follow me.

176
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:25,712
Thank you, Madam.

177
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:28,913
Come on.

178
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:35,273
You know that it hurts, huh?

179
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,673
You're pretty happy to hear someone introduce

180
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:39,433
you to a girlfriend, huh?

181
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,393
That's not it.

182
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:41,273
Are you trying to rebel?

183
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:44,712
What are you laughing at?

184
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:46,953
You just admitted that
I was your boyfriend

185
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,553
when we were inside.

186
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,112
You can't go back on your words now.

187
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:53,393
I have a witness now.

188
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:55,273
I...

189
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,193
I didn't say that I wasn't going to
acknowledge you as my boyfriend.

190
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:00,592
You're no fun.

191
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:02,232
What did you say?

192
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:04,793
If you can't hear well,

193
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:05,953
you should go to
the Department of Otology.

194
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,352
I have a girlfriend now!

195
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:15,832
I have a girlfriend now!

196
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:26,872
Xu Lai,

197
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,472
where's the present
your boyfriend gave you?

198
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,673
Show it to us!

199
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:32,472
What present?

200
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:33,512
Stop pretending.

201
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,232
We saw the interview you did.

202
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,913
Didn't Captain Jin give you his medal?

203
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,632
Xu Lai, I'm so envious of you.

204
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:40,632
Your boyfriend is romantic

205
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:41,832
and is capable of providing you
with a sense of security.

206
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:42,913
I feel like

207
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:45,033
dating a firefighter now.

208
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:50,793
So what?

209
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:52,953
She can only depend on men
to shine in the limelight.

210
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:56,673
Captain Jin is truly nice to Ms. Xu Lai.

211
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,752
Xu Lai, congratulations.

212
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:04,992
Thank you, Chief.

213
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:07,433
There might be another piece
of good news for you.

214
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:08,793
Another piece of good news?

215
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,033
Due to Xu Lai's outstanding performance

216
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,232
in Huining,

217
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,193
our station has nominated her

218
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,673
to be the Outstanding Journalist of The Year.

219
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:28,832
Ms. Xin?

220
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,553
Contact the people who are responsible
for the data traffic.

221
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,393
Make sure the views I get on my topics

222
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:39,273
are higher than Xu Lai's.

223
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,393
But Ms. Xin, that's cheating.

224
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:43,673
If they find out, it'll be...

225
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,433
I have no time to worry about that.

226
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,512
I can't just let Xu Lai become the chief

227
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:49,832
and step on my nose.

228
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:52,712
The topics you covered

229
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,393
after returning here

230
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:53,992
were quite well-received.

231
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,673
That's why we gave you a chance.

232
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,512
However, the station wants you and Xu Lai

233
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,433
to cover a topic each.

234
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,112
The views of the topic

235
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:03,393
are one of the criteria

236
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:04,273
for the chief selection.

237
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,313
You should prepare for it.

238
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,953
This time, I will defeat Xu Lai

239
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:11,913
by any means necessary.

240
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:21,153
I'll make a move first. Goodbye.

241
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,153
Goodbye.

242
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,313
Emergencies occur all day long.

243
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:45,793
We haven't taken a break yet.

244
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:48,472
The worse kind is the false alarms.

245
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:49,913
Not only do they waste
our time and energy,

246
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,193
but it also keeps us from handling
true emergencies.

247
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:54,752
A prank like this might cause someone to die.

248
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,472
(I have good news for you.)

249
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:03,433
(I was nominated as)

250
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,553
(Outstanding Journalist of The Year.)

251
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,632
(Are you free tonight?)

252
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,112
(I'll treat you to a meal.
Let's celebrate it together.)

253
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:14,512
Did you guys realize something?

254
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:16,712
Captain Jin didn't check his phone
much in the past.

255
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,592
He totally changed after falling in love.

256
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:19,433
But now,

257
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,632
he checks his phone

258
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:22,112
whenever we return after a mission.

259
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:23,953
You reminded me of something.

260
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:25,712
I need to report what I did to Qiu.

261
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:26,832
See you.

262
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,232
Qiu?

263
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:29,752
He's showing off here.

264
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,040
(Xu Lai)

265
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:45,472
Hello?

266
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:46,553
Sorry.

267
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:47,553
There were many emergencies today.

268
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:48,673
I just returned to the station.

269
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:50,632
It's fine. I just reached home.

270
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,632
Don't tell me you were waiting for me.

271
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,033
That's not it. I was working overtime.

272
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:58,153
Why did you have to work until so late?

273
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:00,992
The station will select
a new chief soon.

274
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,352
Both Jiang Xin and I
are potential candidates.

275
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:03,992
The station wants us

276
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:04,913
to cover a topic each.

277
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,512
I searched a lot of materials.

278
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,553
I still haven't decided on my topic yet.

279
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,913
The interview will be aired
after the Qixi Festival.

280
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:12,913
I don't have much time.

281
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,553
Oh yeah, I forgot to congratulate you.

282
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,673
Congratulations,
Outstanding Journalist of The Year.

283
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:19,953
It's just a nomination.

284
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:21,073
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

285
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,553
You were always

286
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:23,992
the most outstanding girl in my heart.

287
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:29,352
By the way, how will you
spend the Qixi Festival?

288
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,112
This will be the first Qixi Festival
we're celebrating

289
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:32,073
after dating each other.

290
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:33,393
Do you want to celebrate it together?

291
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:35,512
But there are usually
plenty of emergencies

292
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:36,232
during such festivals.

293
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,793
I need to be on standby.

294
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:39,992
Maybe I won't be able to celebrate

295
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,793
Qixi Festival with you this year.

296
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:42,352
Alright then.

297
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,393
That's fine.

298
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:44,913
I was just asking.

299
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,193
I understand your feelings.

300
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:48,433
Sorry.

301
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:50,592
You cannot do the things

302
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:52,433
a girl can do in a normal relationship

303
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,632
when you date me.

304
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:54,832
I don't want to be like them.

305
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,512
I like things that are different.

306
00:14:58,673 --> 00:14:59,153
Alright now.

307
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,592
You must've been exhausted.

308
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:01,512
Rest early.

309
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:04,073
You too.

310
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,073
Good night.

311
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:12,553
Comrades,

312
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,393
the Qixi Festival is nearing.

313
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,793
It's time for us to crack our brains

314
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,153
and come up with surprises.

315
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,632
We have to buy presents
for our partners.

316
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:22,673
Squad leader,

317
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:24,153
what kind of presents do you buy
for Qixi Festival?

318
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:26,393
What?

319
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,232
Maybe some chocolates or roses.

320
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:30,953
But I forgot

321
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:31,752
whether men should
buy it for their partners

322
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,712
or the other way around.

323
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:33,793
Anyway,

324
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,112
we'll be in trouble
if we don't send gifts.

325
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,913
Why did you call me again?

326
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,232
Let's celebrate Qixi Festival together.

327
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,793
But didn't you say...

328
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:01,153
We can celebrate it one week earlier.

329
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,752
It's the Qixi Festival that only belongs to us.

330
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:05,712
Okay.

331
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:20,992
Welcome.

332
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:22,592
Do you need me to introduce them?

333
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,433
It's fine. I'll take a look around.

334
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,712

Seems like it's pretty serious.

364
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:40,752
Mister, I'm changing my destination.

365
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:42,072
I'll get off here.

366
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:42,953

00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:55,433
Give me a moment.

372
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,673

373
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:57,472

Sorry.

381
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,312
I encountered

382
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,193
a serious traffic accident.

383
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:02,833
I was dealing with the scene.

384
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,433
I rushed here immediately after that.

385
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,433
Were you hurt?

386
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:06,712
No.

387
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,833
I bought a bouquet.

388
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,752
But the fire just now

389
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,673
turned them into ashes.

390
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:19,232
This is the only surviving flower.

391
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:20,193
Initially, I wanted

392
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,752
to celebrate the Qixi Festival with you.

393
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:23,072
I ruined it.

394
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:25,792
Sorry.

395
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,752

is the most beautiful flower I've seen.

401
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:56,953
You're the most beautiful girl

402
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,153

00:20:58,913 --> 00:20:59,873
Your nose

404
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:03,153

408
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:18,193
I know what topic to cover

409
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:18,792
for this volume.

410
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,312
The rose you gave me inspired me.

411
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,370
(Burning Rose)

412
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:47,113
Begin!

413
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,633
Faster!

414
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:55,673
What are you doing here?

415
00:22:56,232 --> 00:22:57,113
I'm here to celebrate
Qixi Festival with you.

416
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,792
Stop messing around. I'm working.

417
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:04,512
I'm here as a journalist.

418
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,673
I'm going to record

419
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,633
how firefighters spend
their Qixi Festival.

420
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:08,833
I'm working right now.

421
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:10,913
Go ahead.

422
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:11,873
Keep the water hose!

423
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:12,873
Yes, sir!

424
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:36,633
The indoor fire was caused by

425
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,353
the burning curtains due to candles.

426
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,433
(To most, the Qixi Festival)

427
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,072
(represents romance and love.)

428
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:46,472
(But to firefighters,)

429
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,712
(it represents more work.)

430
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:50,353
(They keep guard over)

431
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:51,593
(other people's romance in secret.)

432
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:52,913
(They're also protecting)

433
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:54,673
(the romance of the city.)

434
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:56,792
I have a girlfriend.

435
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,433
But I can't celebrate

436
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,673
Qixi Festival together with her.

437
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,712
Can I say one more thing?

438
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:05,193
Zang Qiu, wait for me.

439
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,792
I'll definitely make it up to you.

440
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:09,113
What about you guys?

441
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,072
How did you guys spend the Qixi Festival?

442
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:16,633
By working.

443
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:18,232
We're always on standby.

444
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:21,992
Me? By working too.

445
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:24,673
I spend it with them.

446
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:27,833
Yeah.

447
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:31,232
Do you guys have girlfriends then?

448
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:36,752
No.

449
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:40,752
I want one, but I can't find one.

450
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:44,992
As for me, I'm married.

451
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:46,673
She loves me very much.

452
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:47,953
Thank you.

453
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,232
I'm a firefighter.

454
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,992
My girlfriend is a journalist.

455
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:57,673
We're doing our respective jobs

456
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:58,433
during Qixi Festival.

457
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:00,712
Initially, I wanted to celebrate

458
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:01,913
Qixi Festival with her
one week in advance.

459
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:03,193
But in the end,

460
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:04,552
I was delayed by work.

461
00:25:05,752 --> 00:25:08,992
I ended up giving her a burnt rose.

462
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:11,913
I'll get the porridge.

463
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,593
That guy who was trapped
after climbing the safety window

464
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,272
to propose to his girlfriend was hilarious.

465
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,792
When Captain Jin was rescuing him,

466
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:20,752
he asked Captain Jin

467
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,472
if he could send him to his girlfriend's window

468
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:24,593
and let him propose to her first.

469
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:25,512
You see,

470
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,633
love does make people
lose their rationality.

471
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:29,792
And the couple

472
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:31,593
who ended up burning their house
after a candlelit dinner,

473
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,673
the girl was so frightened

474
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:35,032
that she never wanted
something romantic again.

475
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:37,593
It's been tough on you guys.

476
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:39,272
You guys are working hard while people
are celebrating the festival.

477
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:41,633
It's the same thing every year.

478
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:43,232
We're already used to it.

479
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,433
However, helping other people
to celebrate such festivals

480
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:46,992
can be considered our romance too.

481
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:47,833
Am I right, my brothers?

482
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:48,873
That's right.

483
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:56,953
I've been busy the whole day.

484
00:25:58,232 --> 00:25:59,792
I didn't manage to speak to you.

485
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,472
Happy Qixi Festival.

486
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:09,992
It's past 12 O'clock, huh?

487
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,113
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:13,913
I guess Qixi Festival is over.

489
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:16,593
It's not over.

490
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:19,193
It's never over when you're around.

491
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,032
I'm sweaty and dirty.

492
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:23,673
I don't care.

493
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,673
I'm just as dirty as you now.

494
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,712
At least we're wearing
matching outfits now.

495
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:31,113
You're such a sweet talker.

496
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,393
Here's your present.

497
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:42,113
Who would anyone give a walkie-talkie
to their partner

498
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:42,953
during Qixi Festival?

499
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:45,113
Do you know something?

500
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,712
This is the walkie-talkie
our leaders use

501
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,072
to assign missions to us

502
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,873
during our daily lives.

503
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:51,193
We'll execute the missions.

504
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:54,873
Now, you're the leader of my life.

505
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:57,113
You can give me an order

506
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:58,393
with this walkie-talkie.

507
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,873
I'll execute it immediately.

508
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:02,272
I'll see it through.

509
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:04,113
Give it a try.

510
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:08,552
Calling for Jin Shichuan.

511
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:10,552
Reply to me if you hear this.

512
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:12,393
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:13,512
What's your order?

514
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,752
I hereby order you

515
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,312
to carry your girlfriend.

516
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:19,673

all of the other topics combined.

522
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,552
It was very creative and thoughtful.

Xu Lai, good job.

524

Besides that,

525
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,113
there's one more thing

526
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,312
that has embarrassed the news team.

527
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:55,913
One of the topics had fake views.

528
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:59,312
The station is infuriated about this.

529
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,032
They've decided to remove the topic

530
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:03,633
and punish the person in charge

531
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:04,712
of said topic.

532
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:07,472
This is what I want to say.

creating fake views

535
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:13,393
is one of the most shameful things
you can do.

536
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,512
I hope you guys

537
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:18,792
can learn from this lesson.

Is this the topic Xu Lai covered?

544

I suggest you stop watching it.

But why?

546
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:46,072
I think it's pretty good.

547

Don't say that I didn't remind you.

you might be jealous.

00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,153
the bond between Jin Shichuan and Xu Lai
personally.

559
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,393
That's why I've decided
to return to being her friend.

560
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,193
I'm fine as long as she's happy.

561
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:41,552
What about Yu Shishi then?

562
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:46,312
Why are you bringing her up?

563
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,673
I know she went to look for you
in Huining.

564
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:51,833
Didn't you contact her after coming back?

565
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:54,032
No.

566
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:56,512
I'm sure she doesn't want
to see me right now.

567
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,032
Maybe this is better for her.

568
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,032
Is that so?

569
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:05,913
I don't think she's doing too well.

570
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,153
What do you mean?

571
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,113
After Xu Lai's topic became popular,

572
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,193
an anonymous gossip post about

573
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:18,193
the four of you was posted.

574
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:20,353
It stated the four-way relationship
between you, Jin Shichuan, Xu Lai,

575
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,833
and Yu Shishi.

576
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,312
And, it even talked about

577
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:26,232
the true reason

578
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,232
Yu Shishi retired from work
and vanished.

579
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:31,472
Now, everyone is saying

580
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:32,593
that she's undedicated to her work.

581
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:36,752
I think she's in a pickle.

582
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:56,552
You must've waited for a long time.

583
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,792
I was caught in a jam.

584
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:00,953
Tell me. What's the matter?

585
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:02,673
We haven't seen each other

586
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:03,472
since returning from Huining.

587
00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:05,153
I just want to catch up with you. Here.

588
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,113
Is that so?
You called me here in a hurry.

589
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:09,153
I don't think it's that simple.

590
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:11,433
I can never hide things from you.

591
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:13,792
Have you read the anonymous post

592
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:14,393
online lately?

593
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:16,032
I have.

594
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:17,913
I'm investigating the source of it.

595
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:20,673
Will this affect you?

596
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:23,512
It doesn't affect me that much.

597
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:25,393
Yu Shishi will be affected the most.

598
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:26,873
After all, she's an actress.

599
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:28,433
Her image is vital to her occupation.

600
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:32,433
I called you out because of this.

601
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:35,032
I want to see

602
00:31:35,032 --> 00:31:36,752
if you can find any footage

603
00:31:36,953 --> 00:31:39,512
of her when she became a volunteer.

604
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:40,593
No problem.

605
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:43,153
But why do you need that?

606
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:46,472
I've repaid your favor.

607
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:47,552
However,

608
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,353
I need to make it up to another person.

609
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,552
Alright, I got it.

610
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:57,712
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.

611
00:31:58,153 --> 00:31:59,552
Thanks. Here.

612
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,552
He's here.

613
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:09,913
Mr. Huo.

614
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:10,433
Please make way.

615
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,072
Don't gather here.

616
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:12,472
Mr. Huo!

617
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,512
Mr. Huo, what's your opinion

618
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:14,393
on the four-way relationship rumor

619
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:15,913
between you and Yu Shishi?

620
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:22,752
Ms. Xu and I

621
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:23,792
have been great friends for many years.

622
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:25,752
Now, she's dating Jin Shichuan,

623
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:27,752
captain of the Fire
and Disaster Relief First Brigade.

624
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:28,992
I truly hope

625
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:29,873
that they can be happy.

626
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:31,633
Ms. Yu Shishi was rumored
to be undedicated to her work.

627
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:32,472
I heard that the Yunkai Group

628
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:33,833
would still collaborate with her.

629
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:34,712
As her boyfriend,

630
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,953
did you do so out of personal reasons?

631
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:38,472
I'm a businessman.

632
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:39,992
I've decided to maintain

633
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:40,873
the collaboration with Ms. Yu Shishi

634
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,992
out of rational and objective considerations.

635
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:43,552
Aren't you afraid

636
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:44,232
that negative news about her

637
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:45,312
might affect the Yunkai Group?

638
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,193
Ms. Yun Shishi and the Yunkai Group

639
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:50,552
have collaborated for a long time.

640
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:52,072
The entire Yunkai Group

641
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:53,472
knows that she has complete dedication

642
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:54,472
toward her occupation.

643
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:56,232
The rumors that are circulating online

644
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:57,512
are all baseless.

645
00:32:58,433 --> 00:32:59,873
I can clarify things for her.

646
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:02,072
However, Ms. Yu Shishi

647
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,752
went on a trip instead of working.

648
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,913
She didn't go on a trip.

649
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,433
She went to the earthquake-affected region
together with me.

650
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,512
She was a volunteer at the frontline.

651
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:18,673
Initially, we didn't want to tell anyone about this.

652
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:21,472
However, the baseless accusations out there

653
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,873
have damaged Ms. Yu Shishi's reputation.

654
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,913
We have no choice but to announce this.

655
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,270
(Amy)

656
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:52,673
Have you watched Huo Yanzong's interview?

657
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:53,992
(Nope. What's the matter?)

658
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,712
He dispelled the rumors regarding you

659
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:56,633
not being dedicated to your work.

660
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:57,792
He defended you in public.

661
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:03,353
(What kind of reaction is that?)

662
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:04,232
(You don't have any reaction at all.)

663
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,472
What kind of reaction should I give?

664
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:07,913
(Do you know something?)

665
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:10,992
(Now, public opinion on you has changed entirely.)

666
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:12,713
(They feel sorry for you.)

667
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,512
(And, they call you
an optimistic star now.)

668
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,112
(Those search terms became popular.)

669
00:34:17,072 --> 00:34:19,353
(This time, we need to thank)

670
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:20,992
(Huo Yanzong for helping us out.)

671
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,992
I know Huo Yanzong.

672
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:27,273
He did so in order to protect the Yunkai Group

673
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,512
and his beloved, Xu Lai.

674
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,393
That's why he defended my image for me.

675
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:36,592
There's no need to thank him.

676
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:38,472
(Shishi, listen to me.)

677
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:39,472
(Huo Yanzong is actually...)

678
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:40,072
Don't bring him up again.

679
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:45,152
I don't want to be involved with him anymore.

680
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:46,753
Okay?

681
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:48,913
(Did you drink?)

682
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:50,713
(I'll go and find you.)

683
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:52,953
No.

684
00:34:53,672 --> 00:34:54,472
Don't come.

685
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,072
If you come to find me,

686
00:34:58,072 --> 00:35:01,833
I'll run away.

687
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:12,433
Get off the car.

688
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:15,753
Yu Shishi is missing.

689
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:16,512
I need to find her.

690
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:20,833
Hurry.

691
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,393
In the past, you did this
because of Xu Lai.

692
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:34,313
Now, you're doing it
because of Yu Shishi.

693
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:38,592
You always abandon me
for the sake of women.

694
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:40,112
You've gone overboard!

695
00:35:48,753 --> 00:35:49,953
Another glass.

696
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:51,152
Okay.

697
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:01,472
Isn't that Yu Shishi?

698
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:02,713
Yeah.

699
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:03,552
What is she doing here?

700
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:04,552
What a coincidence.

701
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:09,592
Let's wait for her to turn around.

702
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,032
It's fine. I'll take another photo.

703
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:14,353
Delete it.

704
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,233
Who are you? Mind your own business.

705
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:19,192
I told you to delete it.

706
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:30,552
Let's go.

707
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,393
Another glass.

708
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:35,713
Forget it.

709
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:42,992
Should I stop drinking now?

710
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,112
Am I hallucinating things now?

711
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:47,913
You're drunk.

712
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,552
I saw that jerk again.

713
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:51,512
You're drunk.

714
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,873
Who are you?

715
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,793
Do you know me?

716
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:57,953
Come, I'll send you home.

717
00:36:58,793 --> 00:36:59,632
Don't touch me.

718
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:00,632
I don't want to see you.

719
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,152
Huo Yanzong,

720
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:18,793
I'm begging you. Don't leave me.

721
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,313
Don't abandon me.

722
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:25,072
Please.

723
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:28,793
Don't worry, I won't leave.

724
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,032
Don't abandon me.

725
00:38:32,753 --> 00:38:33,913
I won't abandon you again.

726
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:31,992
(Darn it.)

727
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:33,753
(I'm dreaming again.)

728
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,713
(I knew he was a jerk.)

729
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:39,713
(But he's truly good-looking.)

730
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:41,953
(No.)

731
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,233
(I mustn't be bewitched by his charm)

732
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:45,873
(even if it's a dream.)

733
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:50,873
Get up when you're awake.

734
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:51,913
Stop sleeping.

735
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:55,632
What are you doing here?

736
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:57,713
You got drunk last night.

737
00:39:57,753 --> 00:39:58,632
I sent you back.

738
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:03,713
Yu Shishi,

739
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,233
do you know that you're a public figure?

740
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,353
And, everyone knows

741
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,192
that you have a boyfriend.

742
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,072
Even so, you got yourself drunk

743
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,112
in a bar last night.

744
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:13,632
Aren't you afraid that the reporters
might take photos of you?

745
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:14,713
I don't care.

746
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,072
It's a fake boyfriend anyway.

747
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,632
This is better. You can use this chance

748
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:19,753
to announce our breakup.

749
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:21,833
Who said I wanted to break up with you?

750
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:24,032
Huo Yanzong,

751
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:26,873
what else do you want me to do?

752
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,393
Xu Lai already found out

753
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:30,552
that we were a fake couple.

754
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:32,913
I'm no longer useful to you.

755
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,353
Why aren't you breaking up with me?

756
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:36,913
I admit,

757
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:38,953
I did use you in the past.

758
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,112
But now, I...

759
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:41,313
I don't want to listen
to your explanation.

760
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,512
I swore a vow

761
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,833
that I wouldn't let myself get hurt again

762
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:48,753
after coming back from Huining.

763
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:50,472
Anyway, I object to the breakup.

764
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:51,833
But why?

765
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:56,273
There's no reason for it.

766
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:57,072
I just object to it.

767
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,953
You don't get to make the call here.

768
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,273
I'm sick of this love game.

769
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:03,793
You can play it yourself!

770
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,433
Scram!

771
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:39,273
You published that anonymous post, right?

772
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,032
You always use dirty tricks like these.

773
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:46,873
Aren't you tired of it?

774
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,032
I decided to end this early.

775
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:53,152
You can go ahead.

776
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:55,672
What do you mean by this?

777
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:56,753
Aren't you always afraid

778
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:57,833
that I'll be selected as the chief?

779
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:00,192
Before this, I was too lazy
to compete with you.

780
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:01,313
But this time,

781
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:02,753
I'll see it through.

782
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,713
I'll definitely be the chief.

783
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:06,353
Once I become the chief,

784
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:07,313
the first thing I'll do

785
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:09,032
is to kick you out of the team.

786
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:13,873
What gives you the right to do so?

787
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:15,632
Don't even think about it.

788
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:17,072
Let's just wait and see then.

789
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:18,913
Let's see who can help you out.

00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,433
Xu Lai,

792
00:42:31,713 --> 00:42:32,472
we need to interview

793
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,393

794
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,632
I've contacted the person in charge.

795
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:36,913
You can bring your men there.

796
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,032
I'll depart immediately.

797
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:39,313
Let me join her.

798
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,072
