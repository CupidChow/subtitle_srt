(Jin Shichuan's Life is My Life)

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,679
Xu Lai.

23
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,840
Huo?

24
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,840
Are you all right?

25
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,360
Why are you here?

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,039
How is your leg?

27
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,239
I'm worried about your safety
so I came here.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
Do you know that it's dangerous here?

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,279
Go back.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I know it's dangerous.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
That is why I'm here to bring you back.

32
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:17,920
Let's go.

33
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,080
I can't go back.

34
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,160
Why?

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
Is it because of Jin Shichuan?

36
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:33,999
Huo.

37
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,279
Is that how you see me?

38
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,239
I have a job to do.

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,839
I'm doing frontline reporting here.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,320
That's not what I mean, Xu Lai.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
I just care about you.

42
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,040
I'm afraid you will be harmed here.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,640
You want to be a reporter.

44
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,999
Why do you have to stay here?

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,239
I can sponsor the TV station.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
I can let you become a reporter
by using many ways.

47
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,399
Huo, I don't need your help.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,559
How many times do I need to say that?

49
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,480
Your care is not what I want.

50
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,080
Supporting me is letting me stay here

51
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,080
to do what I want.

52
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:19,880
Do you know

53
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,040
why I choose Jin Shichuan?

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,080
I become a reporter because of Jin Shichuan.

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,239
I want to help others with my role as a reporter.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,119
At the same time, I saw Jin Shichuan using his life

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,719
to save and protect more lives

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
and extend his love.

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
This is the purpose of life.

60
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,880
Love is not limited.

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,679
It can be broader.

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,959
Huo.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,959
You don't understand me as much

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,839
as you think you do.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,040
Xu Lai.

66
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,719
I don't expect you to accept me
by coming here.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
During that earthquake ten years ago,

68
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,680
I couldn't protect you.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,719
Right now, I can't see you

70
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,760
being in a place of danger.

71
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,399
I'm here to bring you away

72
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,560
from this dangerous place.

73
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,039
Huo.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,599
You disregarded your safety to find me here,

75
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,359
it makes me feel touched

76
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,240
but I'm going to tell you one last time.

77
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
Please stop doing this.

78
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,000
All right?

79
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,719
Please leave.

80
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,640
I have things I need to do

81
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,399
and people I need to protect

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,359
by staying here.

83
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,000
Sorry.

84
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
(I have someone I want to protect.)

85
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,800
(I also have someone I want to protect.)

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
(I've decided.)

87
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,440
(If you want to do)

88
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,519
(crazy and foolish things,)

89
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,039
(I'll be crazy and foolish like you.)

90
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,080
Get in.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,120
Liu Xu.

92
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,240
What happened?

93
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,320
Captain Jin and Zhang Yang

94
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,320
are covered under a pile of rubble.

95
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,599
We are bringing the dogs to rescue them.

96
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll go with you.

97
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,919
You can't go.

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,279
It's too dangerous.

99
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,120
How can I explain to Captain Jin

100
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,880
if something happens to you?

101
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm an instructor.

102
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,039
I can lead the dogs in the rescue.

103
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,359
No. You can't go.

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,080
If Captain Jin is here,

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,959
he also won't allow it.

106
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,560
Liu Xu.

107
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,159
If you don't help me,

108
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,519
I will regret it for life.

109
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,640
Jin Shichuan's life is my life.

110
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,959
My life will always be tied with his.

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,640
Obey every command.

112
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,320
Get in.

113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,480
(Huaigang Fire and Rescue Force)

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Come.

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,200
We are here.

116
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,479
Over there!

117
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,640

Something is here!

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,440
Hurry!

151
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,479
Jin Shichuan!

152
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,519
Move!

153
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,399
Move the rubble!

154
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:26,919
Hurry!

155
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,599

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,519
Slowly.

158
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,760
Captain Jin!

159
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,519
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Keep digging!

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,519
There's someone there!

162
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,560
Be careful!

163
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,839
Slowly!

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,039
Be careful.

165
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,880
Be careful.

166
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,680
One, two, three.

167
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,399
Be careful!

168
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,080
Slowly.

169
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,080
Be careful.

170
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,959
Zhang Yang.

171
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,880
Zhang Yang.

172
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,359
Where is Jin Shichuan?

173
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,240
Where is Jin Shichuan?

174
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,839
Captain Jin wanted me

175
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,959
to wait here alone.

176
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,919
He went down on his own.

177
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,880
One, two, three. Lift!

178
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
Didn't we promise each other

179
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,999
to return to Huaigang safely?

180
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,520
Jin Shichuan.

181
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,920
Why aren't you keeping your promise,

182
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,959
Jin Shichuan?

183
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,560
One, two, move!

184
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,160
Hurry!

185
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,680
Keep searching!

186
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:53,599
Yes!

187
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:53,959
Yes!

188
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,520
Yes!

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,239
Captain Jin!

190
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,281
Captain Jin!

191
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,200
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

192
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,359
Captain Jin!

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,440
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

194
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,200
Captain Jin! Can you hear me?

195
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,759
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

196
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,759
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

197
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,119
Captain Jin!

198
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,479
Captain Jin!

199
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,680
Captain Jin!

200
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,599
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

201
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
Captain Jin!

202
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,080
Captain Jin!

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,040
Xu Lai.

204
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,599
Take a break.

205
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,040
Xu Lai.

206
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Leave this place to us!

207
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,320
How is it?

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,920
Nothing.

209
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,200
Mighty.

210
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,560
Go. Search over there!

211
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
All rescue teams!

212
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,599
The situation at Lianhua Village
is serious.

213
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,879
There's a risk of an aftershock.

214
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,359
Everyone from rescue teams

215
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,239
must evacuate to a safe area.

216
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,719
I am Lu Fangqi from Huaigang's rescue unit.

217
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
Our captain is still buried under the rubble.

218
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,080
I request...

219
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,920
I request to evacuate
after rescuing my captain.

220
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,520
This is urgent.

221
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,920
You must obey the order!

222
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:54,999
Xu Lai.

223
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,800
This is the signal
for an emergency retreat.

224
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,239
We must evacuate now.

225
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,639
Before I find Jin Shichuan, I won't leave.

226
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,119
Xu Lai!

227
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,320
Liu!

228
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,959
Evacuate with them.

229
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,119
What about you?

230
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,200
I can't leave Captain Jin here.

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,440
I'll bear all the responsibility.

232
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,680
Get them out of here.

233
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,839
Prepare for evacuation!

234
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,719
Obey my orders!

235
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,800
Everyone, prepare for evacuation!

236
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,719
I volunteer to stay back.

237
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,959
Captain Lu, I'm staying too!

238
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,999
I'm not leaving!

239
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:54,734
I'll work!

240
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,920
Me too!

241
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,879
I'll work as well!

242
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,239
Captain Jin!

243
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,320
Captain Jin!

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,879
Captain Jin!

245
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,040
Come here.

246
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,040
Jin Shichuan!

247
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,320
Jin Shichuan!

248
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,479
He's here!

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I found him!

250
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,560
Captain Jin!

251
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,280
Captain Jin!

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,920
Jin Shichuan!

253
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,800
Jin Shichuan!

254
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,200
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

255
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,920
Jin Shichuan!

256
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

257
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,400
Captain Jin!

258
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,719
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,359
Hold on!

260
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,400
Prepare for demolition.

261
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,520
Get the rescue tools.

262
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,040
Hurry!

263
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes!

264
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Hurry!

265
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,879
Move!

266
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,560
Jin Shichuan!

267
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,920
Jin Shichuan!

268
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,440
Jin Shichuan!

269
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,280
Can you hear me?

270
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,879
Jin Shichuan!

271
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:18,959
Jin Shichuan.

272
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,920
You grabbed my hand like this

273
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,040
ten years ago.

274
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
This time,

275
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,520
you must hold my hand tightly

276
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
and never let go.

277
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,720
Xu Lai.

278
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:14,950
(Health Emergency)

279
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,439
Huo,

280
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,192
(Disaster is cruel, humanity is not.
Relief from the country gives warmth)

281
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,159
why are you still here?

282
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,199
This place is really dangerous.

283
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:21,240
How is Jin Shichuan?

284
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:22,560
He's feeling better.

285
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,320
Do you want to visit him?

286
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

287
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,800
Jin Shichuan is the only person

288
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,760
in your heart.

289
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,560
There's no space for anyone else.

290
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,280
I know

291
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
I will never have a chance.

292
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm saying goodbye

293
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,639
because I decide to let go.

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,639
Xu Lai.

295
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,679
I wish both of you well.

296
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,480
Of course.

297
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:56,960
If he bullies you in the future,

298
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,359
give me a call anytime.

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,639
I will always be around.

300
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,960
I will keep protecting you as a friend.

301
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,040
However,

302
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:14,119
I am really doing it as a friend
this time.

303
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,560
Take care.

304
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,800
Look at your own wounds.

305
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm leaving.

306
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,280
Huo.

307
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
You will definitely find

308
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,399
the person who belongs to you.

309
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,199
Take care.

310
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,919
Huo Yanzong, goodbye!

311
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,280
(I found a picture)

312
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,040
(on the shared cloud drive)

313
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,320
(by frontline reporters.)

314
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,240
(There's someone)

315
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,560
(who is always by your side.)

316
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:23,879
(Huo.)

317
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,760
(Go and find the light
that belongs to you.)

318
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,080
From now onwards,

319
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I will stop acting

320
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,040
because this is not an act.

321
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,199
I like you.

322
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
If you are tired,

323
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,520
I can lend you my shoulders

324
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
even if they are not broad.

325
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,159
In order to find you,

326
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,240
I suffered and am full of wounds.

327
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,520
Every time I see a victim,

328
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm worried

329
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:53,280
because I'm afraid that person is you.

330
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,679
Don't take it off.

331
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,040
Someone might see you again.

332
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,359
Wear it.

333
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:08,760
Sit tight.

334
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Seatbelt.

335
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,159
Yu Shishi.

336
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
You said you wanted to travel

337
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:21,919
but you ended up coming here

338
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,720
and went back with all the injuries.

339
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
Going back with a body full of injuries

340
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:29,679
is better than

341
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,280
bringing something
that I shouldn't bring back.

342
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
It feels nice to let go of

343
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:39,960
a certain person and some things.

344
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,679
Have you really let go?

345
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,480
Yes.

346
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,480
Hello, Doctor.

347
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,159
Hello.

348
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,040
I am Huo.

349
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:12,960
I called you previously.

350
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:13,639
Hello.

351
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,520
How is Yu Shishi?

352
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,520
Yu Shishi

353
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,960
is fine. She left.

354
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,040
Did she leave?

355
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Yes.

356
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:26,600
(Huining City Relocation Camp,
Temporary Medical Point)

357
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:27,280
Sorry to trouble you.

358
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,240
It's fine.

359
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,679
Thank you.

360
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,639
You're welcome.

361
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,240
(I hope you've returned safely.)

362
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,080
There's no more water?
Let me get some more.

363
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,599
Slowly.

364
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,320
Slowly.

365
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,000
Captain Jin.

366
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
He just has to meet you

367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,439
and thank you in person.

368
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,720
I recognize you.

369
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:21,119
You are the one

370
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,159
who saved me.

371
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,679
You saved my life.

372
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,199
Thank you.

373
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,240
Thank you.

374
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,800
Our captain

375
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,720
almost lost his life

376
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,800
in order to save you.

377
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,639
Is it worth it

378
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,560
to save someone like me?

379
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,240
Is it worth it?

380
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,839
It doesn't matter.

381
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
It's what I should do.

382
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,399
This is our duty.

383
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,080
Don't worry.

384
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,639
I will stop taking drugs.

385
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:17,919
I will turn over a new leaf.

386
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,599
I will start anew.

387
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,000
Do your best.

388
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,040
Definitely.

389
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,679
(After coming to the disaster area,)

390
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,520
(this report is the one)

391
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:47,278
(that makes me feel deeply)

392
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,760
(about a reporter's mission and purpose.)

393
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,760
(Jin Shichuan is fair to every life.)

394
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,439
(He only carries out his duty.)

395
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,839
(His attitude of leaving the lives)

396
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,199
(to be judged by law)

397
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:01,919
(made me understand)

398
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,679
(that a reporter only needs to be persistent)

399
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,439
(and report objectively)

400
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,240
(to fulfill their duty and mission.)

401
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,760
(I found my initial purpose and my passion)

402
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,720
(during this Huining trip.)

403
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
(I will keep going on this path)

404
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,919
(and become)

405
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,280
(someone who brings light to others.)

406
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,520
Xu Lai's report

407
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,679
is deep.

408
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:38,810
(Heavy Disaster Area in Mofang, Huining)
(Huaigang Firefighters Rescues Trapped Victims)

409
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,320
(Heavy Disaster Area in Mofang, Huining)
This is the type of objective thinking

410
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
(Heavy Disaster Area in Mofang, Huining)
required by reporters.

411
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,159
Why are you looking at me like that?

412
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,599
My girlfriend is so excellent.

413
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,439
I must look at her longer.

414
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
Many people called me today.

415
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:21,960
All of them praised me.

416
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,879
I felt so embarrassed.

417
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
I'm not praising you.

418
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,119
I'm only telling the truth.

419
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,879
Is there a reward?

420
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:32,359
Yes.

421
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:38,359
All right.

422
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,720
You are seriously injured.
Don't simply move.

423
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:43,760
Does it hurt?

424
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,119
It's just a minor injury

425
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,040
so it won't stop me

426
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,919
from doing other things.

427
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,760
What reward do you want?

428
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,919
I didn't expect

429
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,520
our courageous Ms. Xu,

430
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,439
who isn't afraid of
earthquakes and fire,

431
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
to be afraid of a small reward.

432
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,839
You are more dangerous than...

433
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,560
Is this reward enough?

434
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,199
Sorry.

435
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:49,639
I forgot.

436
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,399
It's fine.

437
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,960
How is it?

438
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,960
It's fine.

439
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:57,855
In this condition,

440
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't think I can hug you recently.

441
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:02,240
I'll hug you then.

442
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,240
Sorry.

443
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,560
It's fine.

444
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,879
This won't do?

445
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,760
I don't think this is possible too.

446
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,119
Let's look at stars together.

447
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,359
We will soon leave Huining.

448
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,639
I suddenly feel reluctant.

449
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
How do you feel?

450
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,439
I came to Huining twice.

451
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
The only similarity

452
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
is that you are by my side.

453
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,280
Last time, we knew each other.

454
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,720
This time,

455
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,480
we fight alongside each other.

456
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,119
Huining is where we made our ten-year promise.

457
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,159
Ten years ago,

458
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,599
I made the ten-year promise to you in Huining.

459
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,560
Now, it's time to extend the contract.

460
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,800
All right?

461
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,760
No.

462
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,560
I don't want just the next ten years.

463
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,328
I want to be with you

464
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,720
every ten years after that.

465
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:53,760
It's a promise.

466
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,520
We will always be together

467
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,720
no matter how many decades have passed.

468
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
Keep your promise and never change.

469
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,399
The frontline rescue operation

470
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,439
has concluded successfully.

471
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,000
The rescue team members

472
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
have also completed their final mission.

473
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,000
Binhai Rescue Team!

474
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,639
Huaigang Rescue Team!

475
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:39,520
Yongchuan Rescue Team!

476
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,240
Caps off!

477
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,919
Mourn!

478
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,800
Does this all

479
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,040
feel like a dream?

480
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,960
While we were in Huining,

481
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,839
our schedules are inverted.

482
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,000
We must be ready even if we are sleeping.

483
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
We had to always prepare
for an operation.

484
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,720
We can finally get a good night's sleep.

485
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,399
Right?

486
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,159
Since I went to Huining,

487
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,919
my wife couldn't sleep well.

488
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,119
His wife again.

489
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,439
Before I leave,

490
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,159
I got to participate
in this rescue operation.

491
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,760
I guess I can leave with pride.

492
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,480
Are you going to leave?

493
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
Why didn't I hear you mention it?

494
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,599
He's going back to find a wife

495
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
and is abandoning us.

496
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,760
My grandmother is old.

497
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,520
She is in a rush.

498
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,359
When are you leaving?

499
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,359
Let's see.

500
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,080
Maybe in a month.

501
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you...

502
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:19,879
Let me read it out.

503
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,439
Dear Qiu.

504
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,320
I missed you as soon as I left you.

505
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,760
I want you by my side.

506
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,760
I miss you so much.

507
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,240
I miss you!

508
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,119
Why is your relationship so cringy?

509
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,839
I can't stand you.

510
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,679
The one who got the most

511
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,919
out of going to Huining

512
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,320
is Captain Lu.

513
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:41,879
Yes.

514
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Yes.

515
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,760
He finally pursued the doctor and won her heart.

516
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,320
- Captain Lu!
- Who said so?

517
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,480
I'm not the only one

518
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,520
who won someone's heart.

519
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
There's also that guy.

520
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,359
You are different from Captain Jin.

521
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,839
Captain Jin is already in a relationship
with Xu Lai.

522
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,439
Lu Fangqi is right.

523
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,080
I got a lot out of this.

524
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,199
I got two things.

525
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,359
What are they?

526
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:09,119
One, I fulfilled my promise.

527
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,439
I've brought back every one of you.

528
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,080
What about the second one?

529
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,040
It's a secret.

530
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:25,879
Did Xu Lai call to say

531
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,199
she's coming back to eat with Jin?

532
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,280
It's scary when you are old.

533
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,040
You already asked me ten times

534
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,639
just this morning.

535
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,800
Yes.

536
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,839
Why haven't they come back yet?

537
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,439
Tell me.

538
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,320
Calm down.

539
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:46,639
Are they back?

540
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Mom. Dad.

541
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Come inside.

542
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,399
I brought Xu Lai back.

543
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,599
That's great.

544
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,960
Why are you crying?

545
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,159
Change your shoes and come inside.

546
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,839
Today, both of us should have a drink.

547
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,000
Sure.

548
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,240
The first glass is a toast to you.

549
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,919
Sure.

550
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,000
Sit down.

551
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,760
Drinking while standing doesn't count.

552
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,560
This is a toast to you

553
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,520
for your contributions to the country

554
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:31,879
and the people.

555
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,839
Mr. Xu.

556
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,639
This is a firefighter's duty.

557
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,919
I should be the one making the toast.

558
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,439
Good.

559
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,320
Good.

560
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,000
Come.

561
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,280
For this second glass,

562
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm happy.

563
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,080
Why am I happy?

564
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,599
I'm happy that our daughter

565
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,359
has found us a good son-in-law.

566
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,480
Come. Cheers!

567
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,480
Mr. Xu is happy. A toast to you.

568
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
Come. The third glass...

569
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,359
Enough.

570
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,879
Take a break.
You already had two glasses.

571
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,599
It's fine.

572
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,159
I'll make a toast to Jin
for the third glass.

573
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,000
- Sure.
- Is that fine?

574
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,000
Yes.

575
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,319
Jin.

576
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,119
Thank you for saving Xu Lai

577
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,360
and thank you for bringing her back safely.

578
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,840
No thanks needed, Mrs. Xu.

579
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,400
Protecting Xu Lai is what I should do.

580
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,319
This is also my promise to you.

581
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,199
She also saved me.

582
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,319
I should make a toast to you.

583
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm not done yet.

584
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
Promise me one thing

585
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,759
before drinking.

586
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Please say it.

587
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,040
I want to say that you must
take good care of yourself

588
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,920
under any circumstances.

589
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,799
You are a hero to other people

590
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,440
but in the eyes of your parents,

591
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,400
all of you are children.

592
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,520
Xu Lai is our child.

593
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,480
You too.

594
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,599
Every parent wants their children

595
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,319
to be safe and healthy.

596
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,400
I understand

597
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,279
and support your work.

598
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:14,799
But remember.

599
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,719
When you are out on duty,

600
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:19,960
remember

601
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,239
that there is someone at home

602
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,400
waiting for you to eat together.

603
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,960
All right. Can you promise me?

604
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,360
Yes.

605
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:42,599
Good! Come!

606
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,560
Our fourth glass...

607
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:53,480
Is this Peace?

608
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:54,679
Peace!

609
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,080
This is our Peace!

610
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,686
He looks nice after wearing the shirt.

611
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,840
He's amazing now.

612
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,400
- Look.
- Yes.

613
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,119
These are the children
rescued by Jin Shichuan.

614
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,159
There were many...

615
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,679
Jin.

616
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:08,880
Jin Shichuan.

617
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,040
Your face is flushed.

618
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,199
Jin Shichuan!

619
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:13,639
Are you all right?

620
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm fine.

621
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,360
Girl.

622
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,799
When you were in Huining,

623
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,880
your mom was always

624
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
staring at the TV.

625
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,040
When she saw a report on the rescue operation,

626
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,080
her eyes would open so wide.

627
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,080
When there was a firefighter

628
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,719
or a reporter getting injured,

629
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
she would be so nervous.

630
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,159
She couldn't sleep or eat.

631
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,440
I saw on the news

632
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000
that Jin saved a drug addict.

633
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,199
Jin Shichuan.

634
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,319
Jin Shichuan!

635
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,360
Yes!

636
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,799
He's drunk.

637
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,199
You made him drunk.

638
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,400
It's fine.

639
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:04,520
Xu Lai.

640
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,840
Everyone is here today.

641
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,159
Do you think we should

642
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,719
take a family photo?

643
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,599
Sure.

644
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,319
Good.

645
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,679
Good.

646
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,239
I've never seen my parents so happy
for a long time.

647
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,759
Since their divorce,

648
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,159
I remembered

649
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,599
they were always quarreling.

650
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,960
I also chose to avoid it.

651
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,920
Your appearance changed everything.

652
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,719
You changed me as well.

653
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,279
When I have you,

654
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,840
I get to feel the warmth of a family again.

655
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,159
In the future, my parents

656
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
will also be your parents.

657
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,360
My family will always be your family.

658
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,440
How are you?

659
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,360
Do you feel better?

660
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,327
You can't drink.

661
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,040
Why did you drink so much?

662
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,159
I wanted to make my future father-in-law happy.

663
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,279
I had to go all out.

664
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,279
I had to drink even if I couldn't.

665
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Why are you so good?

666
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,560
Do you know?

667
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,920
As a firefighter,

668
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,360
when we identified our goals,

669
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:16,119
we will rush to it at all costs.

670
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,560
I have identified you in my life.

671
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,599
I'm willing to do anything for you.

672
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,239
A little alcohol is nothing.

673
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,159
I've also identified you.

674
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,520
After making this stamp,

675
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,560
you will always be mine forever.

676
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,199
This is imparity clause.

677
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,199
You can't stamp it one-sidedly.

678
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,199
No. I want to go home.

679
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,360
No. I'm afraid of the dark too.

680
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,360
Welcome back, Xu Lai!

681
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,279
Xu Lai, welcome back!

682
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,040
Welcome back!

683
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,080
Welcome back, Xu Lai!

684
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,880
Your report at Huining was great.

685
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,239
You were amazing at Huining.

686
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,639
Xu Lai, you are so amazing!

687
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:43,840
You're back?

688
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:44,679
Yes.

689
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,759
I'm reporting to my superior

690
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:46,719
immediately after coming back.

691
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,840
Your performance in Huining

692
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,279
was exceptional.

693
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,759
The superiors of the station

694
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,599
praised you by name.

695
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,279
Since you are back,

696
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,679
have you gotten yourself together?

697
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,279
Will you run away again?

698
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,520
Of course, not.

699
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,599
After this period,

700
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:06,880
I already thought it through.

701
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,040
I will walk this path persistently.

702
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,400
Good.

703
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,480
I said I was only keeping it.

704
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm returning it to you now.

705
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,400
Thank you, Chief.

706
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,630
(News Department Reporter, Xu Lai)

707
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,279
Zhang Yang.

708
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,080
Isn't your off day today?

709
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,639
Isn't your home here?

710
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,759
Why aren't you going home?

711
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:40,920
Why are you ignoring me?

712
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,960
Did I offend you?

713
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,480
Champ.

714
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,360
Don't play with Mighty in the future.

715
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,159
You see him as your friend

716
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,719
but is he treating you the same?

717
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,719
Perhaps he would leave one day

718
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,440
and leave you here all alone.

719
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,279
Wasting your time and your feeling.

720
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,159
Got it.

721
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,799
You are not scolding the dog

722
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,040
but scolding me instead.

723
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,679
Are you angry

724
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,119
because I didn't tell you
about leaving the team?

725
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,639
Your leaving is none of my business.

726
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,319
It's better if you leave.

727
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,920
Your snores at night are so annoying.

728
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,480
Nonsense.

729
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,920
He misses you.

730
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,880
He won't go home on his off day

731
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,960
just to be with you.

732
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,360
Go and comfort him.

733
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,719
We are all men!

734
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,639
Why should I comfort him?

735
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,000
Zhang Yang!

736
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,040
