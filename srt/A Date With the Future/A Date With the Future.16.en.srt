(A Sudden Meeting With Parents)

18
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,039
I was actually quite scared just now.

19
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,560
I was still reeling from the shock.

20
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,000
And then the lights in the corridor
suddenly went out.

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,959
A person tends to imagine all sorts

22
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,760
of scary things
when they're enveloped in darkness.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,239
But thankfully you showed up.

24
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,440
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

25
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,200
With light,

26
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,799
you will be able to sleep well.

27
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:49,880
Then,

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm going to sleep now.

29
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:58,799
All right.

30
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,760
Goodnight.

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,040
Goodnight.

32
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,839
(I am not afraid)

33
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:06,920
(not because I see the light,)

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,719
(but because I see you.)

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,519
(With you around,)

36
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,200
(I don't need any other light.)

37
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Let me sleep with you.

38
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,039
Grandpa.

39
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,919
Grandpa...

40
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,399
Grandpa?

41
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,159
Grandpa.

42
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
It's not what you think.

43
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,359
Something happened yesterday

44
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,359
so we...

45
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,599
Is she the girl you mentioned?

46
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:14,719
Yes.

47
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,399
What is your name?

48
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,479
I am Xu Lai.

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,519
It means a light breeze.

50
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,519
Sounds nice.

51
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,440
Are you free tonight?

52
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:36,120
Yes.

53
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,760
Bring her home for dinner tonight.

54
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,599
Grandpa, that's not necessary.

55
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,800
It's decided.

56
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,479
I was so afraid.

57
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,760
Why would your grandpa visit suddenly?

58
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,640
I am not at home often.

59
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,839
He will tidy up the place when he is free.

60
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,159
That was an awkward first meeting.

61
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,399
Will Grandpa have a bad impression of me?

62
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,240
No.

63
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,760
Don't overthink.

64
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,800
Oh.

65
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,800
Did you mention me to your grandpa?

66
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,279
What did you tell him?

67
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Nothing.

68
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,760
Did you tell your grandpa

69
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
that I had been pursuing you?

70
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Although it's the truth,

71
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,399
will he think I'm the kind of frivolous

72
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,240
and clingy woman?

73
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm sure he has a bad impression of me.

74
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:01,959
Do you care so much

75
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,000
about what Grandpa thinks?

76
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,800
Of course.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
I will become his granddaughter-in-law

78
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,919
in the future.

79
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Xu Lai.

80
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Can you be more reserved?

81
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,200
No.

82
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,000
What did you tell him?

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,560
It's a secret.

(Huaigang TV Station)

85
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,359
Are you really angry?

86
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,959
I told Grandpa I like you.

87
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
What did you say?

88
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,479
I like you.

89
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,479
He said he likes me.

90
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
That's his first time
saying he likes me.

91
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,479
This is the internal information of TC.

92
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
It proves that they are

93
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
indeed using old parts,

94
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,040
causing X-2 mobile refrigerators

95
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,280
to have a serious safety hazard.

96
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,719
The more you dig into it,

97
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,200
the deeper this case goes.

98
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,759
I didn't expect it to be so complicated.

99
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,920
Besides, they even went to the hospital

100
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,639
to harass the victim to silence her.

101
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,160
Last night,

102
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,239
my house got broken into as well.

103
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,520
My hard drive was stolen.

104
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,080
I suspect that TC did it as well.

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,080
To stop them from harming others,

106
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,719
I think we should report the news

107
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,999
as soon as possible.

108
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,839
This is the time
when we shouldn't be reckless.

109
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Wait.

110
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,400
Here.

111
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,599

This is a lawyer's letter

114
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,639
sent by TC.

115
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
They are really using every method possible.

116
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,200
Accusing us when they are guilty.

117
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,119
If we want to beat a huge company like TC,

118
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,040
we need sufficient evidence.

119
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,920
It's best to have 100% confidence.

120
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,080
Otherwise, it's better to not do it.

121
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,520
It's best if we can prove

122
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,879
that this underground factory exists.

123
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:44,839
Don't worry.

124
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,320
I will gather evidence myself.

125
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:48,800
You need to be careful.

126
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm worried that they will take revenge on you.

127
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,879
I'm not afraid of their dirty tricks.

128
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
Now that it has come to this,

129
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,359
I will definitely fight to the death.

130
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,400

Bring the equipment

137
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,639
and go to the outskirts with me.

138
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,560
Bring small hidden cameras

139

instead of big ones.

140

142

Remember,

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,999
keep it a secret.

144

Where is Ms. Xu Lai?

146
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,719
She left in a hurry just now.

147
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
It's time to get off work.

I'm a reporter at the TV station's news department.

159

A reporter?

160
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,599
Good.

161
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
What do your parents do?

162
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm sure they are retiring soon.

163
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:17,400
Yes.

164
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,520
My father was a soldier.

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,759
My mother was a nurse.

166
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,280
They are both retired.

167

They usually do what they enjoy doing.

168

That's great.

169
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,839
They have their own lives.

170
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,959
What do they think about...

171

Grandpa.

172
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,999
Can you not interrogate her

173
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,920
like a criminal?

174
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,879
I am simply asking.

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,200
How is that an interrogation?

176
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,440
Fine. I'll interrogate you now.

Hurry up.

187
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Let me tell you.

188
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,719
Men in our family

189
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:12,231
must be responsible for the women

190
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,080
and not simply abandon them

191
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,080
I'll take responsibility.

192
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,239
If you want to take responsibility,

193
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,520
don't drag it out anymore.

194
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,520
A girl doesn't have much time

195
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,719
for you to waste.

196
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,839
We can't just get married right now.

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,160
Isn't that the way?

198
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,560
You love her. She loves you too.

199
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
What are you still waiting for?

200
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,599
Fine.

201
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,759
You don't get me.

202
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,320
I can't make it clear to you.

203
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,359
Grandpa.

204
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,999
Although I already decided
to marry Jin Shichuan

205
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,119
ten years ago,

206
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm not in a rush to get married.

207
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,680
I prioritize the results and also the process.

208
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,320
I don't want to be in a relationship
for the sake of it

209
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,959
and don't want to get married
for the sake of it.

210
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
Although we knew each other ten years ago,

211
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
we only met each other again recently.

212
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,160
We need more time

213
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,359
to know each other.

214
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,719
There's no rush.

215
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,119
I've waited for ten years anyway.

216
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
This is nothing much, right?

217
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,239
Yes.

218
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,320
You are right.

219
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,599
Do you hear what she said?

220
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,119
Her logic is clear.

221
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
She also understands things
better than you do.

222
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,599
Eat.

223
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,040
Help her peel the shrimp.

224
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,160
Sure.

225
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,119
Let's eat.

226
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,680
Here.

227
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,160
This is Grandpa's study.

228
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,520
He likes writing here usually.

229
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,999
Oh,

230
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,479
don't take what he said just now to heart.

231
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:40,759
That's his personality.

232
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,800
Of course, I won't.

233
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,359
Grandpa is really cute.

234
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Both of you are alike.

235
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,920
When I was young,

236
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,040
my parents died early.

237
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,800
Grandpa raised me up.

238
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,999
He speaks and does things

239
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,080
in a straightforward manner.

240
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I don't like to speak

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
so we seldom talk to each other.

242
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,080
But I know he cares about me.

243
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
I seldom hear you
talking about your parents.

244
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,119
My father passed away during a rescue operation.

245
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,440
My mother died in a car accident.

246
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,280
Let's not talk about the past.
It's fine.

247
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
There's a piano in your house.

248
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:24,920
Can you play the piano?

249
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:26,520
A little.

250
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
I also learned it when I was young.

251
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,879
My piano teacher taught me

252
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,680
a very nice song.

253
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:34,599
Do you want to hear it?

254
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,280
Sure.

255
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,839
Come here.

256
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,599
Chuan.

257
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,199
Is this song nice?

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,760
Yes.

259
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,679
Let me teach you.

260
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,679
When you learn it,

261
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,040
do you want to play it for Dad?

262
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,720
Sure.

263
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,199
Here.

264
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,359
Is it nice?

265
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,679
This is a song taught to me

266
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,679
by my favorite teacher.

267
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,839
(Why does he know
how to play this song?)

268
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,240
Why do you know how to play this?

269
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,280
My teacher composed this song herself.

270
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
Was the teacher's surname who taught you

271
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
how to play Hu?

272
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,320
She was my mother.

273
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,800
We have known each other in the past.

274
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,040
Grandpa.

275
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,520
Grandpa.

276
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm going back.

277
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,439
Thanks for the meal.

278
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,480
I'll visit you again.

279
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,399
Be careful.

280
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,199
Stay safe.

281
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,280
I'll send her back.

282
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,240
I like this girl a lot.

283
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,040
You must keep her.

284
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,839
Don't let my granddaughter-in-law escape.

285
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,240
No. I won't.

286
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,080
Go on.

287
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,879
What did Grandpa say

288
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,439
when we were leaving?

289
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,760
Grandpa said he likes you a lot.

290
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,960
Really?

291
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,919
Did he really say that?

292
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,000
He also said...

293
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,000
What did he say?

294
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,320
He also asked me to hold your hand tightly

295
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,080
and not let you escape.

296
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,159
You must hold tightly and not let go.

297
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,119
I will hold you tightly.

298
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,080
I finally found you

299
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,879
and I won't let you escape again.

300
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:56,879
Are you asleep?

301
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,040
Not yet.

What happened recently

303
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,839
feels like a dream.

Although I've been
dreaming for ten years,

305
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,040
it still doesn't feel real.

306
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:16,439
I think so too.

How do you know that?

342
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,320
Xu Lai mentioned it once to me.

343
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,119
I heard this case is quite complicated.

344
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,399
TC is a huge company after all.

Ms. Xu Lai said

347
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,760
there will be enough evidence to make a report

348
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,359

the factory exists.

00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,520
Who are you?

379
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,720
Why are you telling me all this?

380
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,439
Mr. Huo, thanks for waiting.

381
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,280
I need to go back to the office

382
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,199
to deal with the matter.

383
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Mr. Huo,

384
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,199
you can study the proposal well.

385
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,399
Regarding the increase in investment,

386
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,000
let's talk about it next time,
all right?

387
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,960
Sure. Go do what you should.

388
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,480
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Huo.

389
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,720
See you.

390
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,800
The female reporter is going
to cause trouble at the factory.

391
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,040
Contact the factory immediately.

392
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,760
How does she know about the factory?

393
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,879
How would I know?

394
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,159
Inform the factory immediately.

395
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:48,720
Once the female reporter appears there,

396
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,159
control her immediately.

397
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:51,359
Yes. Understood.

398
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,040
Think of a way to shut her up.

399
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,919
This time,

400
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,080
I'll teach her a lesson.

401
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,879
Understand?

402
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,879
Understand.

403
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,920
(Stop)

404
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,520
He's acting sneakily.

405
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,320
Something must be wrong.

406
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:43,720
Let's go.

407
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,919
Since they are already here,

408
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,520
don't let anyone leave.

409
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,040
Xu Lai.

410
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,359
2016?

411
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,320
These stocks are from six years ago.

412
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,040
All of these parts have expired.

413
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,879
It is a serious safety hazard.

414
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
This is evidence.

415
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,480
Let me take a picture.

416
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,480
Hurry up. This place is dangerous.

417
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,240
Yes.

418
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,119
Since you are already here,
don't even think of leaving.

419
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,639
Go!

420
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:12,679
Go!

421
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:13,119
All right.

422
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,399
After them!

423
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't run!

424
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,679
Let's go.

425
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,680
(Distribution and Preparation Area)

426
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,199
The factory?

427
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I need to

428
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,159
go back to the office
to deal with the matter.

429
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,080
(Xu Lai)

430
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:07,960
(Hello.)

431
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,040
(The number you are calling
has been switched off.)

432
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,800
(Please call again later.)

433
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,520
(Hello.)

434
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,520
(The number you are calling
has been switched off.)

435
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,159
(Please call again later.)

436
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,080
(Sorry.)

437
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,159
Where are you going?

438
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,159
There's a meeting later.

439
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,080
I'm going to find Xu Lai.

440
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,520
I'm worried
that something might happen to her.

441
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
I'll go with you.

442
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,399
Over here.

443
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,320
Call the police.

444
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,960
What about you?

445
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,839
Ignore me.

446
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,800
Where's my phone?

447
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,839
The passcode is your birthday. Hurry!

448
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:53,599
Hold it!

449
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,839
After them!

450
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,480
After them!

451
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,240
Over there!

452
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,599
Don't let him escape!

453
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,119
Where is the girl?

454
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,360
Where are the things?

455
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,560
Hello, 110?
I want to make a police report.

456
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,080
Beat him up!

457
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,199
Stop!

458
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,319
Jin Shichuan!

459
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,599
Jin Shichuan!

460
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,080
Wake up, Jin Shichuan!

461
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,440
(Chenguang Road, 11)

462
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,319
Jin Shichuan!

463
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:10,759
Get up!

464
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,080
Stop!

465
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,360
Stop!

466
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,520
Let her go!

467
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,119
Jin Shichuan!

468
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,360
Jin Shichuan!

469
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,400
Jin Shichuan!

470
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Xu Lai, are you all right?

471
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,759
Huo!

472
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,920
Call an ambulance, Huo!

473
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:28,639
Hurry!

474
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,159
Do you know who she is?

475
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,199
How dare you hit her!

476
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Stop it.

477
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:48,040
First Aid?

478
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,000
We have injured people here.

479
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,319
The address is Chenguang Road.

480
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,880
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital
Emergency)

481
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,520
Zang Qiu, we are here.

482
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,400
Do you want to go inside?

483
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,119
She needs to take care of Jin Shichuan.

484
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,759
It's better not to disturb her.

485
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,280
(Emergency)

486
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,199
Zang Qiu.

487
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,480
Zang Qiu, save him.

488
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:00,880
Vital signs.

489
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,921
Heart rate, 130. Respiratory rate, 40.

490
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,799
Blood pressure, 75

491
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,639
and decreasing rapidly.

492
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,679
Inform the blood bank

493
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:06,679
to prepare six units of red blood cells

494
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:07,560
and get ready for emergency rescue.

495
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,639
Family members should not enter.

496
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,580
(Operating Room)

497
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,480
(During The Operation)

498
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,530
(Family Member Waiting Area Rules)

499
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:46,400
How is he?

500
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
He has a mild concussion.

501
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,000
However,

502
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,840
there are no critical injuries.

503
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,679
He just needs to rest well.

504
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,159
What a relief. Thank you.

505
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,400
Go and accompany him at the ward.

506
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,480
He will wake up
when the anesthesia wears off.

507
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,119
Xu Lai.

508
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,480
It's nothing. Take good care of him.

509
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,480
Where is Huo Yanzong?
Ask him to come out!

510
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,560
Mr. Huo is busy.

511
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:35,880
Why don't you come back later?

512
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,719
Don't try this on me!

513
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,119
Mr. Huo, that's...

514
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,880
You may leave.

515
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,679
Yes.

516
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,080
Great timing.

517
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
I wanted to meet you.

518
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,599
Huo Yanzong.

519
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,279
Tell me honestly.

520
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,679
Did you tell the reporter about the factory?

521
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,400
What did she give you

522
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,599
for you to work with her to frame me?

523
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Are you going to stay silent?

524
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,279
Pretending to be deaf?

525
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,719
Fine. Let me tell you. I'm...

526
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,000
Didn't you want an explanation?

527
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,400
This is my explanation to you.

528
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm warning you.

529
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,119
Xu Lai is my bottom line.

530
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,880
I will make anyone

531
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,400
that touches my bottom line pay.

532
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,799
You are awake.

533
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,560
Let me get a doctor.

534
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,520
Does it hurt?

535
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,319
Do you feel hurt?

536
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,639
They hurt you.

537
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,159
I didn't protect you well.

538
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,119
Don't force yourself in the future.

539
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,159
Rest for a while.

540
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,480
Xin.

541
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,279
Hello, Ms. Xu.

542
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,080
I already sent you the mail.

543
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,560
Let me know if you need anything else.

544
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,199
Sure.

545
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:53,840
Where's Xu Lai?

546
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,080
Is she working outside again?

547
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,639
Ms. Xu Lai went to the hospital.

548
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,239
Hospital?

549
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,319
Something happened
when she was investigating the factory.

550
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
Captain Jin was injured.

551
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,520
Ms. Xu Lai is accompanying him.

552
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,040
Hello.

553
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,759
(Ms. Jiang.)

554
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,360
(Do you still remember me?)

555
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,639
(Why do you know me?)

556
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,319
Do you think it's difficult to find your identity?

557
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,279
Don't worry.

558
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,639
I'm not interested in you.

559
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,799
(I'm making this call today)

560
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,000
(to make a deal with you.)

561
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,759
What kind of deal can I make with you?

00:42:47,438 --> 00:42:51,208
