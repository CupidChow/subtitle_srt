00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,439
Roger.

26
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:03,599
Close the two valves immediately

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,519
and evacuate the area.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,399
Yes!

29
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,039
You'll close the valve.
I'll stop the leak!

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,719
We must not let the liquid
flow downstairs.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,519
All right!

32
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:24,040
There are still two valves here.

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,040
Let's keep searching.

34
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,360
Tao, lower the temperature.

35
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,399
Water!

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,999
Get the pipe over here.

37
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:53,760
Water!

38
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,320
The pipe that connects here

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,040
has broken from the explosion!

40
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:58,880
Find fire extinguishing equipment!

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,559
Over here!

42
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,399
Xu, are you all right?

43
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,080

Hurry!

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
Keep the water going! Hurry!

47
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:41,959
Over here!

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,719
The remaining valves on the second floor

49
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,399
are all here.

50
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,719
Keep lowering the temperature.

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll go close the valves.

52
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,399
Tao, what's the situation?

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,599
Four tanks have exploded.

54
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,880
The temperature is getting higher.

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,760
Control the temperature!

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,039
Yes!

57
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,880
Fire the water cannon towards the right!

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,279
Yes!

59
00:04:59,519 --> 00:04:59,880
Hurry!

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,279
Your oxygen tanks
are running out of oxygen!

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,399
Retreat!

62
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,680
Captain Jin,

63
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,440
what about you?

64
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,120
There are still two open valves.

65
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,640
I'll leave from the elevator shaft

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,240
after I close them.

67
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,519
Go! Change your oxygen tanks!

68
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,039
All right!

69
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,839
The second valve on the second floor

70
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:31,599
has been closed.

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Is it done?

72
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:07,839
Yes!

73
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,159
It's liquid fuel fire!

74
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,240
Run!

75
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,320
Fire upwards!

76
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,000
Hurry!

77
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Fire upwards!

78
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,159

79
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:12,959

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,599

please respond!

I can't contact Captain Jin now.

102

I'm sending Tao and Dapeng

103
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,200
to retrieve Captain Jin immediately.

104
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,719
I'll go and retrieve
Liu Xu and Zhang Yang.

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200

Hold on!

They are closed, Captain Jin!

00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,280
You can't go inside!

181

189
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,040
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

190
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,639
Tell me honestly.

191
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,240
When will Jin Shichuan wake up?

192
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,679
Will he wake up?

193
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:47,240
Although

194
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,679
he is safe for now,

195
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,399
the explosion

196
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,159
caused injuries including skull damage.

197
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,280
He might be

198
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,359
in a coma forever.

199
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:00,320
If you ask me

200
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,720
if he can wake up

201
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,240
and when he can wake up,

202
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,399
I really can't answer you.

203
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,961
Even if he can wake up,

204
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,359
there may be sequelae and complications.

205
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,480
You need to be prepared.

206
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,520
All right.

207
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,359
It'll be fine.

208
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,399
I know how you feel right now.

209
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
The process of waiting

210
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,159
is torturing and endless.

211
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,439
It'll be fine.

212
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Don't worry.

213
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,159
I'm already prepared.

214
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,000
I will keep waiting.

215
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,599
I will be waiting

216
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,720
until Jin Shichuan wakes up.

217
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:38,359
Xu Lai.

218
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,320
Grandpa.

219
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,359
Here.

220
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,560
Shichuan hasn't woken up yet?

221
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,439
But the doctor says

222
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,199
his condition is stable.

223
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,639
Don't worry.

224
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,520
I know you are worried about Shichuan

225
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,720
but you haven't slept for days.

226
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,800
You must go home to sleep

227
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,000
and get some rest.

228
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,240
I'll accompany him.

229
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,199
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

230
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm fine too, Grandpa.

231
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,280
On the other hand,

232
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,879
if Jin Shichuan wakes up

233
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:12,839
and sees how pale you look,

234
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:14,240
he will be sad.

235
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,919
Leave this place to me.

236
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,199
I'm fine.

237
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,800
Just let me stay here.

238
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,919
I hope he can see me

239
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,399
as soon as he wakes up.

240
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,679
(Xu Lai.)

241
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,159
(When you)

242
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,760
(watch this video,)

243
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,439
(I think
I've already transferred and left.)

244
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,240
(As a firefighter,)

245
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,480
(I am absolutely worthy)

246
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,480
(of my responsibilities)

247
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,080
(and mission.)

248
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,520
(I didn't let my country down)

249
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,119
(but I still have regrets.)

250
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,439
(I still feel regretful and
I still have things that tie me down.)

251
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,560
(My regrets and what tie me down)

252
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:32,800
(are all about you.)

253
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
(Because I think I've let you down.)

254
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,560
As your boyfriend,

255
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
I can't accompany you,

256
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,679
take care of you and be by your side.

257
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,040
Right now,

258
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,199
we might even need to

259
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,800
be separated for some time due to work.

260
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,359
(I hope you are not sad.)

261
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,240
(You always tell me)

262
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
(I am the light in your life.)

263
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,599
But I want to tell you

264
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,639
that you've also lit up my life.

265
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,879
I like to see your smile.

266
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,599
(It's cute and charming.)

267
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,639
Thank you, Xu Lai.

268
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,359
If you miss me,

269
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,639
you can always call me
or give me a video call.

270
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,760
If I can't answer your call,

271
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,199
I promise to call you back immediately

272
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,199
after my duty.

273
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:32,240
(Xu Lai,)

274
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,159
(I'll always be around.)

275
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,199
(That's all.)

(take care of you and be by your side.)

(Right now,)

(we might even need to)

280
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,399

wait for him to wake up patiently.

349
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,199
Why do you look so pale?

350
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,320
Did you not sleep well?

351
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,599
I'm worried about Lu Fangqi.

352
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,520
I think he's acting weird.

353
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:52,199
He wouldn't answer my questions,

354
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,399
nor reply to my texts.

355
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,879
I'm busy at the hospital

356
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,080
and can't visit him.

357
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,839
I heard from Tao

358
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,520
that the others in the station

359
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,480
weren't doing well too.

360
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:06,720
Well,

361
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,399
I'll go to the station tomorrow

362
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,159

All right. I'm leaving.

366
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,040

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,679
As your former instructor,

382
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,359
I hope

383
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,159
all of you can get yourself together.

384
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,280
Where is Zhang Yang?

385
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:32,879
Zhang Yang.

386
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,240
I know it hurts inside.

387
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,480
Everyone feels the same.

388
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,879
But work and life must go on.

389
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,639
You know the discipline of the team.

390
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,919
If you keep doing this,

391
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
you will be punished.

392
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,119
You have to get yourself together

393
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,040
even if it's for Liu Xu.

394
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:00,800
Liu Xu is gone,

395
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
but Mighty still needs a trainer.

396
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,520
Will you abandon Mighty as well?

397
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,080
Mighty!

398
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,199
During this period,

399
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,280
just let Mighty and Champ

400
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,439
get along with each other.

401
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:55,199
Mighty.

402
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,440
(Emergency Response Unit First Squad)

403
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:16,799
Help me

404
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,040
get everyone to the activity room.

405
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,719
I have an idea.

406
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,279
(Hi.)

407
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:48,960
(Hello, everyone.)

408
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,360
(When you see this video,)

409
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,480
(that means
I've left the team officially.)

410
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,719
(I am)

411
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,440
(uncultured.)

412
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,319
(Of course,)

413
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,400
(I'm not good at
saying emotional things.)

414
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,239
(But I can't see)

415
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
(people crying.)

416
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,279
(Firefighters like us)

417
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,840
(bleed and sweat,
but we don't cry.)

418
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,799
(Being a firefighter for so long,)

419
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,639
(it is an honor)

420
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,880
(to leave the team successfully.)

421
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,319
(So, I hope everyone)

422
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,840
(can smile and applaud)

423
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,520
(for my honor.)

424
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,920
(I know all of you are applauding.)

425
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,319
(My authority
as the squad leader still exists.)

426
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,840
(When I think about)

427
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,360
(not being able to see)

428
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,040
(my buddies)

429
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,440
(who are always
risking our lives together,)

430
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,319
(I still can't)

431
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,480
(get over it, to be honest.)

432
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,080
(My years in the station)

433
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,599
(is the most unforgettable time)

434
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,119
(in my life.)

435
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,319
(It's true.)

436
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,520
(I miss every one of you.)

437
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,520
(Shi Lei.)

438
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,080
(Tao.)

439
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,080
(Dapeng.)

440
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:42,759
(Zhao Bin.)

441
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,679
(All of you must
keep your feet on the ground)

442
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,759
(and live well.)

443
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,239
(Sorry, Captain Jin.)

444
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,319
(You said to leave no one behind)

445
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,360
(but I left first.)

446
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:16,400
(Sorry, Lu Fangqi.)

447
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,199
(No one)

448
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,199
(will tease you anymore.)

449
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,440
(No one will bicker with you anymore.)

450
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,119
(Zhang Yang.)

451
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,119
(You must be crying, right?)

452
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,759
Sorry.

453
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,679
I won't cry anymore.

454
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,040
(Promise me.)

455
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,440
(Stay strong)

456
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,520
(and stay stronger in the future.)

457
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,080
(And become)

458
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,840
(a real)

459
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
(and brave firefighter.)

460
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,199
Sure!

461
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,719
I promise!

462
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,239
(Xu Lai.)

463
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:03,960
(Thank you.)

464
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,400
(Thank you for neglecting the dangers)

465
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
(and reporting the real us)

466
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,759
(day and night.)

467
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,639
(I love everyone.)

468
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,000
Many things happened

469
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,400
in the station recently.

470
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,119
We lost Liu Xu

471
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,159
and Jin Shichuan is in a coma.

472
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,920
I can understand

473
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,040
what all of you are feeling now.

474
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,159
But the Emergency Response Unit

475
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,279
cannot continue to be depressed.

476
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,440
I believe this isn't

477
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,560
what Captain Jin wants to see.

478
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,480
Every year, you will

479
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,159
go through countless fire rescues,

480
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:19,599
social rescues,

481
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,119
and disaster rescues

482
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,080
to save thousands of people.

483
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,719
I remember Jin Shichuan told me

484
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,480
firefighters carve their badges
with their wounds

485
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
and take responsibility.

486
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,319
You are the ones

487
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,920
who bring the light of hope to people.

488
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,960
So, I hope

489
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,040
all of you can leave a ray of light

490
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,799
for yourself.

491
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Go and comfort heroes,

492
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,159
by continuing your mission,

493
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,639
and sticking to your responsibilities.

494
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:53,599
As their teammates

495
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,000
who fought alongside them,

496
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,679
the best way of comforting them

497
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,040
is not with grief and negativity.

498
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,400
But continue their pride instead.

499
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,799
At this critical time,

500
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,639
we must win this mental war

501
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,440
and wait for Jin Shichuan to come back.

502
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,960
Show him that First Brigade is great.

503
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,319
We are a group of firefighting elites

504
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
who have the will to fight.

505
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,000
Everyone!

506
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,239
Attention!

507
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,599
Salute!

508
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,679
- Thank you, Ms. Xu!
- Thank you, Ms. Xu!

509
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,440
Thank you, everyone.

510
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:39,440
Reporting.

511
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,050
(Commissioner)

512
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,679
Come in.

513
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,599
Instructor Xu Lai
has completed her mission.

514
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,400
The teammates' spirit has been lifted

515
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,679
as soon as you're here.

516
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,440
You've worked hard.

517
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,319
Not at all.

518
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,119
They are also

519
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,279
Jin Shichuan's teammates.

520
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,239
I believe

521
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
that's not what he wants to see.

522
00:41:59,199 --> 00:41:59,719
Please sit down.

523
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,880
Oh, Commissioner.

524
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,679
I want to ask

525
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
how Lu Fangqi is doing recently?

526
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Do you also think

527
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,599
something's not right with him?

528
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,080
A little.

529
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,880
When I wanted to speak with him,

530
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,000
he avoided it too.

531
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,920
After the explosion incident,

532
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,719
we immediately gathered

533
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,319
all team members
for a group mental counseling session

534
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,000
and carried out
psychological interventions.

535
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,400
Although everyone wasn't doing well,

536
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:36,279
most of them didn't
have much psychological trauma

537
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,119
except for Lu Fangqi.

538
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,119
Did you find

539
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:41,880
something wrong with him?

540
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,599
There's something wrong indeed.

541
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,279
But he refused to do
the psychological intervention.

542
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
I see he's not doing well

543
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,560
so I asked him to take a break.

544
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,440
He refused.

545
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,080
I asked him to take a day off
and he refused.

546
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,400
He only insisted on leading the team

547
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,960
and said there was nothing wrong with him.

548
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,480
It seems like

549
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:06,400
we need to find someone to talk to him.

550
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,799
Yes.

551
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,520
So, I want to invite Dr. Zang Qiu

552
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,921
to help us

553
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,040
carry out the psychological intervention
on Lu Fangqi.

554
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,880
They are lovers.

555
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,480
I think he will listen to her.

556
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:19,719
Don't worry.

557
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,080
I will pass on the message.

558
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:22,119
Good.

559
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,159
Have some tea.
