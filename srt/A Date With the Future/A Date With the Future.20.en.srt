(Don't Be Afraid, I'll Save You)

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Since we already broke up,

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,439
assume I wasn't here last night.

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,680
(No matter why you give up,
I will still persevere!)

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,650
(I'm not someone who gives up easily
and I won't allow you to give up!)

continue being my man!)

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,080
Jin Shichuan.

24
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,119
Don't give up on me, all right?

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,160
Hello.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Where is Dr. Zang's office?

27
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,640
This is it.

28
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,519
Zihao, you're here.

29
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:32,399
Come inside.

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Here. Take a seat.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,760
How is it?

32
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,920
I already showed my father
the medical report you gave me.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
He made a surgery plan specifically for it.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
He said this case is special.

35
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,080
The wound is ripped

36
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,679
before the old wound is healed.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,799
It is not the ideal condition
for surgery.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,200
He cannot guarantee the surgery
will be a success.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,440
In the end, it depends on the patient's decision.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,559
I understand.

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,999
If the patient agrees,

42
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,600
can I request your father
to carry out the surgery?

43
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,160
No problem.

44
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,480
I already told my father.

45
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,760
You went to the class reunion
because of this, right?

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
Seems like this person is very important to you.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,040
Yes.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,480
My husband exchanged his life for him.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,559
I found a specialist who is good at

50
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,440
leg nerve surgeries.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,399
(Surgery Plan)
This is his plan. Take a look.

52
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,760
Do it for Xu Lai...

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,679
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

54
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,239
Last night...

55
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:05,920
I want to rest.

56
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,239
I will arrange the surgery
as soon as possible.

57
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,399
I received the shareholders notice
about the transfer of shares

58
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,359
and you are the buyer behind everything!

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,159
Huo Yanzong, you fooled me!

60
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,159
You were the one who did everything
so I would stay.

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
I am only doing what you want.

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,440
I will not give you the company.

63
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,880
That's not your decision to make.

64
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,159
I got some information

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
which is the evidence
of you embezzling funds

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
and threatening to hurt people.

67
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,000
Tell me.

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,919
If I give it to the police,

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,479
how many years will you be imprisoned?

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Huo Yanzong!

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,440
Why are you doing this to me?

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,719
Why?

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
You started this game first.

74
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,760
If you want to play it...

75
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,599
You no longer have any chips on you.

76
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,080
I suggest you think about

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,640
how you are going to live your life in prison.

78
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,000
Huo Yanzong!

79
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,159
I won't forgive you

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
even if I'm in the depths of hell!

81
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,880
Without Captain Jin,

82
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,599
Peace has been feeling listless.

83
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,526
Not just Peace.

84
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't even have an appetite.

85
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,399
Tell me.

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,919
Why can't Captain Jin's leg recover?

87
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,200
I think

88
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,919
Captain Jin's injury is quite serious.

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
He always tells me he will recover soon,

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
but I feel like something's not right.

91
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,479
Peace!

92
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,200
Over here.

93
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,399
Let me take a look.

94
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,560
See what toys I brought you.

95
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,080
Ms. Xu.

96
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,599
Peace has lost weight.

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
He probably misses Captain Jin.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,719
He has been acting this way
since Captain Jin was in the hospital.

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,640
Why have you lost weight too?

100
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,680
What's going on with Captain Jin's injury?

101
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,159
Why hasn't he recovered?

102
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a little busy recently
and didn't go visit him.

103
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,000
(I think)

104
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,399
(Captain Jin's injury)

105
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,479
(is quite serious.)

106
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:17,959
(He always tells me
he will recover soon)

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,279
(but I feel like something's not right.)

108
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,519
Hello, Zang Qiu.

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you free tomorrow?

110
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,200
I want to talk to you

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
about Jin Shichuan.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,519
(Great. I want to see you too.)

113
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,640
Great. See you tomorrow.

114
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,160
Boss.

115
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,719
She's awake.

116
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
Ms. Xu.

117
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:53,879
Ms. Xu.

118
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,599
Did you not expect us

119
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,320
to meet again under this circumstance?

120
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,359
What are you trying to do?

121
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,479
What do you think?

122
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,560
I have nothing left.

123
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,719
Thanks to all of you

124
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,599
including Huo Yanzong.

125
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,879
You are the person

126
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,599
Huo Yanzong cares about most.

127
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
If something happens to you,

128
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,759
what will he do?

129
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,999
He will break down.

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,200
You are breaking the law.

131
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,040
I am breaking the law.

132
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,200
Huo Yanzong made me lose everything.

133
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,999
I also want him to know

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,599
what it feels like to lose something.

135
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,999
Hello.

136
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,520
(Hello. Is this Mr. Huo?)

137
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,280
(Do you know who this person is?)

138
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,800
Say something.

139
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,599
Say something.

140
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,959
I want you to say something!

141
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,999
Ms. Xu,

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,920
don't you talk a lot usually?

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Say something!

144
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,200
Xu Lai.

145
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,719
Is it you?

146
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,719
(Xu Lai!)

147
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,680
Huo!

148
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,719
Call the police, Huo!

149
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,359
Darn it!

150
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,759
Huo Yanzong.

151
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,639
Do you hear that?

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,560
Your woman is in my hands.

153
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,879
Come at me instead.

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,560
Fine.

155
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,440
Don't you want to save her?

156
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:24,320
Come here.

157
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,599
Don't come here, Huo!

158
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,839
I'm coming. Don't hurt her.

159
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,040
Send me the address.

160
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,040
If you want her to live, come alone.

161
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
Don't call the police.

162
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,920
Today, I will pay you back for everything.

163
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,839

169

Bark.

Bark.

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,680
Peace ran away.

190
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,999
I just called Xu Lai.

191
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,400
She didn't answer.

192
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,959
Her phone has been switched off now.

193
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,119
Sun Lei!

194
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,599
Where is Xu Lai?

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Mr. Huo.

196
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,520
I've been waiting for a long time.

197
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,719
You are finally here.

198
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,959
Where is Xu Lai?

199
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,119
Let her go immediately.

200
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,160
I realize you've become so naive.

201
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,119
You played me for a fool.

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,239
Do you think I will keep our promise?

203
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,359
Where is Xu Lai?

204
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,440
Relax, Mr. Huo.

205
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:52,280
I hid Xu Lai in a place where no one can find her,

206
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,119
especially you.

207
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,959
Sun Lei.

208
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,320
If something happens to Xu Lai,

209
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,599
I won't forgive you.

210
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,560
I put a bomb on her.

211
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,879
Sun Lei.

212
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,239
Are you mad?

213
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,719
I am mad!

214
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,040
I am mad.

215
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,239
You made me mad, Huo Yanzong!

216
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,920
From now on,

217
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,440
if you want to save your woman,

218
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,639
just listen to me.

219
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,800
Do everything I say until I'm satisfied.

220
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,599
Do you hear me?

221
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,359
If I'm satisfied,

222
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,280
perhaps I will tell you where I hid her.

223
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,759
Don't be reckless.

224
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,800
What do you want?

225
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,080
Kneel.

226
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,599
I'm asking you to kneel.

227
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,720
Fine.

228
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,320
Fine.

229
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,080
Stand up.

230
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,879
Huo Yanzong.

231
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,720
Are you satisfied now?

232
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Let go of Xu Lai.

233
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,119
Let me tell you, Huo Yanzong.

234
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,439
Xu Lai is waiting for you in hell.

235
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,040
I'll send you down there right now.

236
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,000
Both of you will be reunited soon.

237
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,359
No!

238
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,919
Anyone?

239
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
Anyone?

240
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,119
Anyone?

241
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,800
Anyone?

242
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:49,879
Huo Yanzong.

243
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,040
You asked for it.

244
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,800
Go and find Xu Lai!

245
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,399
She has a bomb on her!

246
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,320
Where is Xu Lai?

247
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,760
Jin Shichuan.

248
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,839
I won't tell you where she is.

249
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,359
She will be dead.

250
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,960
Where is Xu Lai?

251
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,800
I won't tell you where she is.

252
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,839
Peace.

253
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,879
No one is allowed to leave here today!

254
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,320
Go and save Xu Lai

255
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,320
I called the police.

256
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,159
Hang in there.

257
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,359
Let go.

258
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,520
Xu Lai!

259
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,639
Don't be afraid. I'm coming to save you.

260
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,800
Don't come here!

261
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,159
Don't come here, Jin Shichuan!

262
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't come here!

263
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,720
Don't come here!

264
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,599
Don't come here, Jin Shichuan.

265
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,040
Jin Shichuan!

266
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,679
Don't come here!

267
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,879
Jin Shichuan!

268
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Jin Shichuan!

269
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Don't be afraid!

270
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,280
Don't come here, Jin Shichuan.

271
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,599
Jin Shichuan, don't come here!

272
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Go. It's too late.

273
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,839
Time is running out, Jin Shichuan.

274
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,839
Go, Jin Shichuan.

275
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,839
Go!

276
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,399
The bomb is counting down.

277
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,119
It's too late.

278
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,119
Go! It's too late!

279
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:37,599
Don't be afraid.

280
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:39,439
I will save you.

281
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:41,639
Don't worry.

282
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:43,359
I will save you.

283
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:45,839
Don't be afraid.

284
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,240
Thank you.

285
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:52,800
Please find my friends
as soon as possible.

286
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,000
Jin Shichuan!

287
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,679
Jin Shichuan!

288
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,359
Jin Shichuan!

289
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:23,480
Jin Shichuan!

290
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,040
Wake up, Jin Shichuan!

291
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,280
Jin Shichuan!

292
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,439
Jin Shichuan!

293
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,599
Zang Qiu.

294
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,240
Take a look at him.

295
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,040
His leg is bleeding so much.

296
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,560
You haven't done the surgery yet.

297
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,439
Do you want to die?

298
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,679
Surgery?

299
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,561
His leg injury caused
a popliteal artery aneurysm.

300
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:52,639
It is very serious.

301
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,119
With the new and old wounds,

302
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,560
his wound has probably ripped again.

303
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,480
Hurry.

304
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,720
Jin Shichuan.

305
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,599
Listen to me.

306
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,439
The surgery plan I gave you

307
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,560
was proposed by a reputable specialist
in the country

308
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,080
after reading your report.

309
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,639
There's a possibility of success,

310
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,320
but...

311
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,119
As long as there's a slim chance,

312
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,200
I must take a gamble.

313
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
I must tell you the consequences.

314
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,679
You have movement difficulties now.

315
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,240
If the surgery fails,

316
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,159
you might be disabled.

317
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,679
Are you still willing to try it?

318
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,240
For Xu Lai,

319
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,919
I will do it.

320
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:27,760
All right.

321
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,040
Contact Professor Zeng.

322
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,760
Yes.

323
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,130
(Family members are not allowed)

324
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,280
Jin Shichuan's family member.

325
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:36,399
Here.

326
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,040
The surgery agreement

327
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,119
requires a family member's signature.

328
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,300
(Family member signature, Xu Lai)

329
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,570
(Relationship with patient: Wife)

330
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,280
(I finally understand at this moment)

331
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,080
(that everything happened)

332
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,240
(because this man had been)

333
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,520
(enduring his pain silently)

334
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,919
(while using his life to protect me.)

335
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,159
(Yet I knew nothing about it.)

336
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,320
The surgery is successful.

337
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,639
However, his body is exhausted

338
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,040
and needs time to recover.

339
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Previously,

340
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,320
he kept asking me to hide his condition from you.

341
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,679
Now, you finally know why he wanted

342
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,760
to break up with you.

343
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,040
His leg injury was serious
and he might be disabled.

344
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:27,359
He didn't want to drag you down,

345
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,000
and he had been receiving treatment in secret.

346
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,679
When he was sent inside,

347
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,599
he requested the surgery.

348
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,800
He said he would do it

349
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,199
regardless of the risk

350
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
as long as he can
stand together with you.

351
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,280
Xu Lai.

352
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
He loves you very much.

353
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,080
When will he wake up?

354
00:30:57,639 --> 00:30:58,280
In a day or two.

355
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:15,159
Chief.

356
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,359
Xu Lai, are you all right?

357
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,760
I heard about what Sun Lei did.

358
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,119
I didn't expect him to kidnap you
with a self-made bomb.

359
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,119
I'm fine.

360
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,599
I only got some scratches.

361
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,919
Jin Shichuan's injury is more serious.

362
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,000
I want to take a few days off

363
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,000
to take care of him at the hospital.

364
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,240
You got injured from working.

365
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,839
No worries. Go and take care of him.

366
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:31,679
Also,

367
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,000
I have something to report to you.

368
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,119
Why can't I ditch her?

369
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,679
Jiang Xin.

370
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,439
She's so annoying.

371
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:52,760
Come with me.

372
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,320
Sun Lei from TC has been arrested.

373
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,520
Do you know that?

374
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,439
I heard about it.

375
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,199
Didn't he kidnap Xu Lai?

376
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,520
What does it have to do with me?

377
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,839
How dare you pretend in front of me?

378
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,599
You better listen to this.

379
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,399
(Now that it has come to this,)

380
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,240
(even if I admit)

381
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,480
(that I am in contact with Sun Lei,)

382
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,439
(you still can't change anything.)

383
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,359
(No. Why are you doing this?)

384
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,480
How do you explain this?

385
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,800
I only received an anonymous mail.

386
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,679
I really don't know about anything else.

387
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,720
I didn't know he would do something illegal
like kidnapping.

388
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,679
Fine.

389
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,280
The kidnapping has nothing to do with you.

390
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,639
But do you dare say the TC case

391
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,159
has nothing to do with you at all?

392
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:51,720
I...

393
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,679
How did you get the recording

394
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
between Huo Yanzong and Sun Lei?

395
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,240
Don't think I will believe

396
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,599
that this is an anonymous tip-off.

397
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't you know who Sun Lei is?

398
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,480
Why did you get involved with him?

399
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you even want to remain as a reporter?

400
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,879
Thankfully, Sun Lei was arrested.

401
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,439
Otherwise, it'll be a mess.

402
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:15,000
What should I do now?

403
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,320
This recording has been reported

404
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,359
to the station's superiors.

405
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Just accept punishment.

406
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,839
You will be suspended temporarily.

407
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,359
Hand over your work.

408
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,760
Go back and reflect on yourself.

409
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:29,800
No.

410
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,399
Why should I be suspended?

411
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,520
All of this happened because

412
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,800
Xu Lai offended Sun Lei.

413
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,639
I was also threatened.

414
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,800
Do you still not know what you did wrong?

415
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:41,599
As a reporter,

416
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,839
you should focus your efforts
on making better news.

417
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,280
You only think about

418
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,439
winning through dishonest means.

419
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,080
You are an embarrassment
to the news industry.

420
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:53,240
Enough.

421
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
This is final.

422
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,639
Go back and reflect on
how to become a good reporter.

423
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,759
You gave the recording to Qin Ye

424
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,840
and asked him to give it
to Ms. Lv, right?

425
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Yes.

426
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,400
You are so shameless!

427
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:28,239
I only gave you a taste of your own medicine.

428
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:29,880
Xu Lai.

429
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,360
Don't be too happy.

430
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,639
I'm unlucky to be defeated by you.

431
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,960
You are not unlucky but you are wicked.

432
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,679
I thought you only played dirty

433
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,759
because you were competitive.

434
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,920
Looking at you now,

435
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't think you are fit to be a reporter.

436
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,279
Think about what you've done.

437
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,599
If you don't reflect on your mistakes,

438
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
you are destined
to face the consequences.

439
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm warning you one last time.

440
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,119
If you dare harm anyone around me,

441
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,440
I won't forgive you.

442
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,440
I promise.

443
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,560
No. 24, Jin Shichuan.

444
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,119
Wake up.

445
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,920
It's time to change the dressing

446
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,960
once the drip is finished.

447
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,159
Ask your lover to take off

448
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:50,960
your pants.

449
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'll change the dressing later.

450
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,880
When I signed the surgery agreement,

451
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,679
I wrote that I'm your wife

452
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,920
in the family member section.

453
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:20,840
Let me help you.

454
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,400
No need.

455
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,520
I can do it myself.

456
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
I can do it myself.

457
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
Sure. I can do it.

458
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,080
Call me when you're done.

459
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,199
Can you do it?

460
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,319
Yes.

461
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,319
Let me help you.

462
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,279
No need.

463
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,119
No need.

464
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:04,639
It's fine.

465
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,719
Let me help you.

466
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,360
I can do it.

467
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,040
It's fine.

468
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,000
There's no need. Thank you.

469
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,520
Let's go.

470
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,159
Come back!

471
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,599
Go out first.

472
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:28,440
Sure.

473
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,279
Not bad.

474
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:45,880
Not bad.

475
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,960
Change the dressing.

476
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:55,872
The nurse said
she wants to change my dressing.

477
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,560
She just left.

478
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:58,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes.

480
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,360
- Yes.
- That's right.

481
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,239
Call the nurse back.

482
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,000
Sure.

483
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,400
All right. Let me go.

484
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,199
Chat with Captain Jin.

485
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:07,880
Sure.

486
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,239
That was for changing the dressing.

487
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,679
Yes. I know.

488
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,639
Hello, Huo.

489
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,199
You finally called me.

490
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,440
I couldn't reach you

491
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,400
and you wouldn't reply to my text.

492
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,560
(Did something happen?)

493
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,719
Sorry for calling you so late.

494
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,880
(I got you involved)

495
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,000
(in Sun Lei's incident)

496
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,719
and shocked you.

497
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:49,679
Are you fine?

498
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
I am the one who got you involved.

499
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:53,440
I should be the one apologizing.

500
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,679
(Sorry.)

501
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,199
Hello?

502
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,520
I heard Jin Shichuan went there.

503
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,239
Is he fine?

504
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:07,960
Not really.

505
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,360
His injury is quite serious.

506
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,239
I'm taking care of him at the hospital.

507
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
Patient, time for your injection.

508
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,119
Patient?

509
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,080
What patient, Huo?

510
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,080
It's fine.

511
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,440
Well,

512
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,840
my secretary is calling me
for a meeting.

513
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,599
That's all.

514
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,319
Hello?

515
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,119
Seriously. You are also in the hospital.

516
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,880
Why won't you tell Xu Lai directly?

517
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,080
You also went to save her.

518
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,759
You are also seriously injured.

519
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,840
It's no longer important.

520
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,960
I don't want her to worry.

521
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:07,759
Besides,

522
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,560
it was Jin Shichuan

523
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:11,960
who rescued Xu Lai in the end.

524
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:15,040
You still shouldn't let him take all the credit.

525
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,239
I always thought

526
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,199
Xu Lai was living in a fantasy.

527
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,480
Jin Shichuan didn't love her at all.

528
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,159
Recently, I just realized

529
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,040
I was the one living in a fantasy.

530
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,520
When I saw Jin Shichuan

531
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,440
giving everything to rescue Xu Lai,

532
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,440
I realized

533
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,000
Jin Shichuan's love for Xu Lai

534
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,040
is far beyond my imagination.

535
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,440
Before this,

536
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:09,560
I hid Jin Shichuan's leg injury from Xu Lai.

537
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,239
That's enough. Don't you feel hurt?

538
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,480
Can't you worry about yourself?

539
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,119
Compared to the pain in my heart,

540
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,679
this is nothing.

541
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,799
Did they leave so early?

542
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,639
They returned to the station.

543
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,880
Where did you go?

544
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,119
Huo contacted me.

545
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,000
Is his injury better?

546
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,279
Is he injured?

547
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,159
When you were kidnapped,

548
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,199
he went there as well.

549
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,520
He didn't say he went there

550
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,759
when he called me.

551
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,480
Not only did he go there,

552
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,000
but he also got beaten up by Sun Lei.

553
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,199
I could find you in time

554
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,319
because he held Sun Lei off
and bought time for me.

555
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,119
Why did he hide it from me?

556
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,759
Call him.

557
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,159
His injury is not minor.

558
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:21,799
Han Fang!

559
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,480
Why are you escaping?

560
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:28,199
What a coincidence.

561
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,960
Stop acting.

562
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,920
Is Huo in this hospital too?

563
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,080
Take me to him.

564
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,319
No. That's...

565
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,199
