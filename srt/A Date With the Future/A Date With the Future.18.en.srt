(Let's Break Up)

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,250
So, you are using me as a shield
for that reporter?

19
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,289
Any problem with that?

20
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:00,409
Get out.

21
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,330
What?

22
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,570
Yu Shishi, what do you want?

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,089
Get out,

24
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,890
or I'll call the reporter

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,410
and tell her there's nothing going on between us.

26
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,850
What's wrong with you now, crazy lady?

27
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,850
Did you just realize that?

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,649
Too bad, too late.
Are you going to get out of the car?

29
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:31,769
Fine.

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,249
Fine. I'll get out of the car.

31
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,809
Why did you lock the door?

32
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:58,369
Can't we talk about this?

33
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,969
Last time,

34
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:00,809
you left me on the side of the road.

35
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:01,850
Have a taste of your own medicine.

36
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:09,689
Crazy!

37
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,130
By the way,
here's something else you should know.

38
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,570
You might be a charmer to others,

39
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,209
but to me,

40
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,769
you're nothing but a heartless scumbag.

41
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:41,050
Immature.

42
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,130
That's my car!

43
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,820
(How's your recovery?)

44
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,140
(How's your recovery?)

45
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,623

48
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,770
(The number you have dialed)

49
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,889

(Please try again later.)

51
00:04:59,210 --> 00:04:59,809
(Sorry.)

52
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,050
Look.

53
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,850
Don't you guys think

54
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,929
she hasn't been herself lately?

55
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:14,689
- She seems distracted.
- Yes she is.

56
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,689
Someone's old flame is in trouble.

57
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,249
She's about to lose her backer.

58
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:22,689
How can she be fine?

59
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,249
What's the big deal, Xu Lai?

60
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,129
You must've forgotten
to brush your teeth this morning.

61
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,730
I'll help you.

62
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,210
What are you looking at?

63
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:34,650
Get back to work!

64
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,129
I still have the video evidence of you

65
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,970
tampering with my computer.

66
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,730
You better watch yourself.

67
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,410
Or else, I might just give that footage

68
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,530
to someone you wouldn't like.

69
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:02,369
Latest news.

70
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,689
The president of TC just clarified
in an interview

71
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,770
that Yunkai had no knowledge
of the production problem.

72
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,449
I saw the news.

73
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,449
Why is it different
from the recording you gave me?

74
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,449
Did you plan this from the start?

75
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:35,730
You were going to burn bridges

76
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,290
after achieving your goal?

77
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,449
Ms. Jiang,

78
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,850
mind your tone.

79
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,249
I'm a businessman.

80
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,929
I have to weigh the pros and cons.

81
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,249
There's nothing more important to me

82
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,170
than Yunkai's investment.

83
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,489
Huo Yanzong is an old fox,

84
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,129
but he has his weakness too.

85
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,253
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)

86
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,290
Why was your phone off the entire day?

87
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:33,970
Don't you know I'm worried about you?

88
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,290
I fell asleep. I didn't know.

89
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,730
Come on. Time to eat.

90
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:42,129
I brought your favorite beef soup

91
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,530
and Cantonese food.

92
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,730
Eat them while they're warm.

93
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:46,929
I'm not hungry.

94
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,689
That won't do.

95
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,730
You need to eat more.

96
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,050
(Mom)
Hello, mom.

97
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,009
If I hadn't called you,

98
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,249
you would've forgotten

99
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,249
that you still have a mother.

100
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,129
I've been a little busy lately.
What's up?

101
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,730
(You're so busy with work all the time.)

102
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,569
(When will you find a partner)

103
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,290
(to take care of you and get married?)

104
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,730
You don't need to worry about that.

105
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,170
How can I not?

106
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:15,889
Listen to me, Xu Lai.

107
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,730
(You need to find a partner
with a good character)

108
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,530
(and a healthy body.)

109
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,090
(Someone you can settle down
and have a peaceful life with.)

110
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,050
(Do you understand?)

111
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,929
(You must learn from my lesson.)

112
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,170
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

113
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:26,689
Here.

114
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:27,889
Eat.

115
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,370
What's wrong?

116
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:34,370
Bad mood?

117
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,890
Did my mom's words

118
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,849
upset you?

119
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,929
Don't take it to heart.

120
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,449
That's just how she is.

121
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,089
Your mom is right.

122
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,809
I'm not your best choice.

123
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,329
My occupation doesn't guarantee fixed hours

124
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,410
or holidays.

125
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,490
You're not my best choice, either.

126
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,370
I want warm meals when I get home.

127
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,290
But you're even busier
than me with work.

128
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,370
How often can we meet

129
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,530
if we get together?

130
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:11,969
I want a traditional partner

131
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,089
who will take care of the house.

132
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,770
You need to find someone

133
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,410
who can give you a peaceful life.

134
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,569
You and I are not each other's best option.

135
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,609
What are you saying?

136
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,770
Are you saying this to upset me

137
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,250
because of what my mom said?

138
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:29,650
Warm meals?

139
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,329
I can make you anything you want to eat.

140
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:33,329
Right now,

141
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:34,490
you're the only one
my life revolves around besides work.

142
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,729
I've always been committed to our relationship.

143
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,689
Why can't you do the same?

144
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,969
What's the matter with you?

145
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,010
We need time to think about this.

146
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:41,809
Think about what?

147
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:42,609
We were fine yesterday!

148
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,490
What has gotten into you?

149
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:44,689
I'm tired.

150
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:46,449
Leave me alone.

151
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,329
I'm so disappointed in you.

152
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,010
(What's the worst that can happen?)

153
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,170
(Disability.)

154
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:33,609
(Xu Lai,)

155
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:36,929
(I'm sorry.)

156
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,530
Alcohol. Nice.

157
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,569
Drown your sorrows.

158
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,969
What's this?

159
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:05,770
You brought your own food?

160
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,650
Come on.

161
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,329
You can't call me out
in the middle of the night

162
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,449
just to drink.

163
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,250
Give me the gossip too.

164
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,089
Why are men always so calm?

165
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,170
Why do you guys have so many concerns?

166
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,050
Why can't you guys

167
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,370
have a little more faith
in a relationship?

168
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,929
Even if there's a problem,

169
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,490
two people can figure it out together.

170
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,689
Got it.

171
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,849
You got into a fight with Jin Shichuan.

172
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,170
Why?

173
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,689
It's because of my mom.

174
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,530
She told me over the phone

175
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,329
not to date someone

176
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:49,890
in a high-risk profession.

177
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,969
Do you know what he said?

178
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,530
He told me to think about it.

179
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,530
He even asked me if I wanted to give up.

180
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,729
Ridiculous.

181
00:11:58,849 --> 00:11:59,609
So that's why you got mad.

182
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:00,729
Shouldn't I?

183
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,530
He's thinking about giving up
just because of a few words.

184
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,609
That means he doesn't really care about me at all.

185
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,130
He's in that state because of you.

186
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,609
How could he not care about you?

187
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,410
Why is he acting this way, then?

188
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,809
Don't bother guessing
if you can't figure it out.

189
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,050
Love is just like liquor.

190
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,449
Some people find it bitter.

191
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:30,050
Others find it sweet.

192
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,250
If you ask me,
I say don't bother tasting it.

193
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,410
Who cares what it tastes like?

194
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,290
Too much of either makes you drunk.

195
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,010
That's why I've only ever

196
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:37,569
gotten a sip.

197
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,449
Be it love or liquor,

198
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,689
too much of either will hurt you.

199
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:53,410
Forget it.

200
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,609
I'll forget all my problems

201
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:56,849
with this bottle of beer.

202
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,689
I'll make up with him tomorrow.

(Yunkai Group)

204
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:13,770
Huo,

205
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,929
wasn't that Mr. Wang from TC?

206
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,170
Why was he here?

207
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,091
(Share Acquisition Agreement)

208
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,209
Share acquisition.

209
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,050
Are you buying TC?

210
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,530
I've met most of TC's shareholders.

211
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,809
They've agreed to sell me their shares.

212
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,010
You're pushing Sun Lei to the brink.

213
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:39,449
Did you think

214
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:40,290
I was messing around?

215
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,010
Well, I don't have it in me
to be concerned about this.

216
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,209
I've got a headache.

217
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,130
What did you do last night?

218
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,689
I spent the night drinking with Xu Lai.

219
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,650
I told her it was a bad idea
to drink so much,

220
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:55,929
but she wouldn't listen.

221
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:56,770
She kept drinking.

222
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,290
I couldn't just stand idly by.

223
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:02,969
What's wrong with Xu Lai?

224
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:04,929
Why did she ask you out for drinks?

225
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,609
It's because of Jin Shichuan.

226
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,569
He told her they should reconsider
their relationship out of the blue.

227
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,449
She was upset

228
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,650
and sought me out.

229
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:23,430
(Inpatient Department)

230
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,572
(Responsible Doctor: Zang Qiu)

231
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,329
Do you need help?

232
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,689
No.

233
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,170
Your leg...

234
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,490
You're not here to visit me, are you?

235
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,969
I want to talk.

236
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:00,209
Have a seat.

237
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,130
I heard

238
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,770
you've been cold to Xu Lai.

239
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:09,770
You made her sad.

240
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,209
I heard

241
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,329
that you got yourself
a celebrity girlfriend.

242
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,130
Better spend more time on her

243
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:18,410
than get into other's business.

244
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,530
Yu Shishi and I are not dating.

245
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,370
That's all fake.

246
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,490
Xu Lai is still bothered by my feelings for her.

247
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,609
This is the only way I can make her stay.

248
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,089
I've never given up on Xu Lai.

249
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,209
Why tell me all of this?

250
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,890
That looks like a serious injury.

251
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,770
You can't take care of her

252
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:44,849
in your current state.

253
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,490
She's the one
who has to take care of you.

254
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,130
Yet, you're still hurting her.

255
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:53,170
I urge you
to step out of her life sooner.

256
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,609
I want you to know

257
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,609
that I care a lot about her.

258
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,609
I won't let anyone hurt her.

259
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,089
That's all.

260
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:10,329
Wait.

261
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:17,449
(Can you really)

262
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,449
(take care of her?)

263
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,609
Of course.

264
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:31,449
I'll back out.

265
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,569
You're right.

266
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,130
I can't take care of her

267
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,569
in this condition.

268
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:47,809
If you can do it,

269
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:49,329
promise me

270
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,689
you'll let her be herself and do what she wants.

271
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,089
I promise...

272
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,969
I'll never show up in her life again.

273
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,129
Are you serious?

274
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,690
Yes.

275
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,490
Take care.

276
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,409
Hello?

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,770
Help me look up a person's medical record.

278
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:07,329
Don't come again tomorrow.

279
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,609
Captain Jin!

280
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,770
A guy who never says what he means.

281
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,290
He has always been like this.

282
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:41,809
Delicious.

283
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:56,409
This chicken soup will fix you.

284
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,680
(I don't care why you're giving up.
I'm going to see this through.)

285
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,250
Is he in?

286
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,889
Ms. Xu,

287
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:43,849
here to visit Captain Jin?

288
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,930
Yes. I brought him some chicken soup.

289
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,010
Why don't I give it to him for you?

290
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,169
He's resting.

291
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:48,849
I won't disturb him.

292
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,730
I'll leave after putting this down.

293
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:51,770
He specifically said

294
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,809
he did not want any visitors today,

295
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:53,970
especially you.

296
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:56,609
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

297
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,930
The hospital has to respect the patient's wishes.

298
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,329
I understand.

299
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,409
(I know you're still awake.)

300
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,210
(I worked hard

301
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,490
(to prepare this chicken soup for you.)

302
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:31,770
(I left it outside your ward.)

303
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:32,770
(Drink it while it's warm.)

304
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,169
(Also, I'll be waiting downstairs.)

305
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,210
I don't want to try to change your mind

306
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,530
because I know it's useless.

307
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:19,250
But as a woman,

308
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,490
I feel sorry for Xu Lai.

309
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,849
She doesn't know anything.

310
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,730
But you've taken her choice from her.

311
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:25,450
Don't you think that's cruel?

312
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,290
This is what's best for her.

313
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,609
No wonder you and Fang Huai were good friends.

314
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,649
You have the same vein
of self-righteousness.

315
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,889
Do you know this, Jin Shichuan?

316
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,609
Women are not as weak

317
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:42,450
as you think they are.

318
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,849
We can go through thick and thin

319
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,490
with the ones we love.

320
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:46,369
But what about you guys?

321
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,930
You claim to do it for the sake
of the ones you care about.

322
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,250
You push your loved ones away
without giving them a chance.

323
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,369
Do you really think

324
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:54,530
this is the best way to protect us, right?

325
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,050
But this actually hurts us the most.

326
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:00,530
The means might not be right.

327
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:05,250
But I can be certain

328
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,290
that there's nothing
Fang Huai wanted more

329
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:09,930
than for you to be happy.

330
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,290
You should drink the chicken soup
while it's warm.

331
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,690
Otherwise, it'll grow cold

332
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,409

(I won't let you
give up on us so easily, either.)

340
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:48,730

What did you wish for?

(Yes.)

360
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,250
(Why did you ask?)

361
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,050
Nothing.
I need to talk to him about something.

362
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:25,010

Xu, do you think Captain Jin will like this?

369
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,210
I'm sure he will.

370
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,050
Here he comes.

371
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,609
Did you buy the flowers?

372
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,730
Yes.

373
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,329
Where is it?

374
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:51,770
Here.

375
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:54,930
Are you for real?

376
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,290
I thought we were buying flowers.

377
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,609
Xu said that this one lives longer.

378
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:00,609
Yes.

379
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,569
Green. Potted plant. It's nice.

380
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:03,649
I can't believe you.

381
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:04,889
Hurry up! Come on!

382
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,010
Captain Jin,

383
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,369
we're here to see you.

384
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,050
Captain Jin.

385
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,889
Captain Jin.

386
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,329
Captain Jin.

387
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,649
Everyone misses you.

388
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,250
We can't wait for you to rejoin us.

389
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,010
Are you better?

390
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:17,730
Everyone is hoping

391
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,649
for you to come back to the team soon.

392
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:19,490
Is your leg any better?

393
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:20,530
Captain Jin.

394
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:22,849
This is a gift from us.

395
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,730
Thanks.

396
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,169
Captain Jin,

397
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,129
without you, we're missing our backbone.

398
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:34,169
I expect I'll need a much longer time to recover.

399
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,930
While I'm away,

400
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,490
you all need to concentrate on work.

401
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,809
Do not fall behind on your training.

402
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:41,889
No slacking off.

403
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,010
Don't worry, Captain Jin.

404
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,930
We just finished our physical training yesterday.

405
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:45,849
Every one of us is strong and fit.

406
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,409
Dapeng, show him.

407
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:48,530
Okay.

408
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,690
One. Two. Three. Four.

409
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,329
You're the vice captain.

410
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,930
When I'm not around,

411
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,369
you're the backbone of the team.

412
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,889
You need to set an example.

413
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,569
Pay attention to the usual day-to-day management
and work allocation.

414
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,250
Don't worry, Captain Jin.

415
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,530
I'll be sure to fill in your role well.

416
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,329
Liu Xu.

417
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:12,050
Present.

418
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,809
You're the squad leader.

419
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:15,730
Keep an eye on them

420
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,930
when you guys are out on duty.

421
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,409
Don't worry, Captain Jin.
Leave it to me.

422
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,609
They're well-behaved.

423
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:21,809
Zhang Yang.

424
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,329
Present.

425
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:23,169
Shi Lei.

426
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:24,409
Tao.

427
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:24,889
Present.

428
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:25,649
Dapeng.

429
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,569
Cooperate with them.

430
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,129
Be more attentive to the maintenance

431
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,569
of the station.

432
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:32,770
- Yes.
- Understood.

433
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:35,930
What's the matter with you today?

434
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,530
You sound like you're not coming back.

435
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,690
I'm fine.

436
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,930
I'm just worried about you guys.

437
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:44,210
Oh, right.

438
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,809
I saw Xu Lai in the lobby.

439
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,609
Xu Lai.

440
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,250
You're here to see Captain Jin, right?

441
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,210
Why aren't you upstairs?

442
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:53,730
He doesn't want to see me.

443
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:54,889
Did you guys get into a fight?

444
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,450
Not exactly.

445
00:26:58,649 --> 00:26:59,609
We had a little misunderstanding.

446
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,450
Well, you should just clear things up.

447
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,730
It's not as if you can't.

448
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,770
Captain Jin isn't a petty man.

449
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't worry.

450
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,050
I'll get him back.

451
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,490
Go get busy.

452
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,089
All right. I'm off.

453
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,490
Remember to tell him
to finish that chicken soup

454
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,970
and put in a good word for me.

455
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,010
No problem.

456
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:28,649
Did you guys have another fight?

457
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:30,930
I'm tired.

458
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,690
I want to rest.

459
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:34,010
You guys should
head back to the station.

460
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,770
Okay. Let's go, then.

461
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,770
We still have training this afternoon.

462
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:41,329
Right. We do have training.

463
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,089
Come on. Let's go.

464
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,609
All right.

465
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,129
We'll leave the plant here, Captain Jin.

466
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,849
Put it here.

467
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,490
Eat the fruits, Captain Jin.

468
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,050
All right.

469
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:49,609
We're leaving, Captain Jin.

470
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,290
We're off.

471
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:50,849
Bye, Captain Jin.

472
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,409
We're off.

473
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,290
Get well soon.

474
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:53,050
Take care.

475
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:53,530
Rest well.

476
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,690
We're off.

477
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,050
We're off, Captain Jin.

478
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:55,730
We're off, Captain Jin.

479
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,730
We're off, Captain Jin.

480
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,450
Don't you think

481
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,690
something's off with Captain Jin?

482
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,770
He must've had a fight with Xu Lai.

483
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,129
Can't you tell?

484
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,089
He wouldn't even let us ask about it.

485
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,569
Well, you take them back to the station first.

486
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,210
I have something to do.

487
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,609
Dr. Zang.

488
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,609
See you.

489
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:19,302
(Nanyuechun Hotel,
third floor, private room)

490
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,250
Excuse me, where's Dr. Zang?

491
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,930
You're here to see Dr. Zang again?

492
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,530
Dr. Zang is on leave.

493
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:39,889
On leave?

494
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,129
Did something happen?

495
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,169
I think she said

496
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,450
she was going to attend a class reunion.

497
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,089
She even dressed up for it.

498
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,409
It's a real shame.

499
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,129
She looked gorgeous. You miss it.

500
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:57,210
Thanks.

501
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:04,409
(What reunion?)

502
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,609
(She even dressed up for it.)

503
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,169
(Don't tell me it's another blind date.)

504
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:25,450
Zihao gave me this when he proposed.

505
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,329
How many karats is that ring?

506
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,889
Zihao always gives me the very best.

507
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:34,050
I'll get you some tea.

508
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,770
Hurry up.

509
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,569
Let me see it.

510
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,730
It has been a long time.

511
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,329
Zang Qiu.

512
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,210
- Zang Qiu, you're here.
- Come.

513
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,730
It has been a while, Zihao.

514
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,409
Indeed.

515
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:47,050
Zang Qiu hasn't changed at all.

516
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:48,490
She's as beautiful as ever.

517
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,329
As expected of the belle of the school.

518
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,930
How have you been?

519
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,169
I've been well.

520
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,649
We haven't seen each other in years.

521
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,129
I don't even have your contact.

522
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,409
Give me your number.

523
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:58,849
I have a favor to ask of you.

524
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,490
Sure.

525
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,970
Zang Qiu is the head surgeon

526
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,050
of our city hospital now.

527
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,889
I bet you guys didn't know this.

528
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:09,169
Zeng Zihao is working at his dad's hospital now.

529
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,649
His dad is one of the best

530
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,849
neurosurgeons nationwide.

531
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:14,129
How did you know that?

532
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,849
I've been transferred to their hospital.

533
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,730
I just remember something.

534
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,409
Zihao pursued Zang Qiu

535
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,210
when we were still in school.

536
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,129
Zang Qiu was his first love, right?

537
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:25,930
Really?

538
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:27,329
I think you're right.

539
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,649
First love?

540
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:30,409
The two of them never dated.

541
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,409
Didn't Zang Qiu marry a firefighter?

542
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:37,010
But I heard...

543
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:37,849
He died.

544
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:44,982
(Lu Fangqi)

545
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,770
Sorry.

546
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,649
Carry on.

547
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,569
I need to take this call.

548
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:50,450
Alas.

549
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,569
Nice timing, Lu Fangqi.

550
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,490
You sure know
how to pick the time to call.

551
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,530
(Are you all right?)

552
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,450
I'm fine. I feel fine.

553
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:06,809
(Zang Qiu,)

554
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,490
(where are you?

555
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:13,569
(Why aren't you saying anything?)

556
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,210
(What's wrong?)

557
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,210
All right. That's enough.

558
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:21,010
I'm hanging up.

559
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:22,730
(Tell me...)

560
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,849
Did you do that on purpose?

561
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,369
You know
what happened to Zang Qiu's husband.

562
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,129
Why did you still bring that up?

563
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:06,970
I couldn't stand her back in university.

564
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:08,369
She acted
as if she is better than everyone.

565
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,930
She looks like she's bad luck.

566
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,490
That's true.

567
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:15,490
Her husband died soon
after they got married, didn't he?

568
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,889
Belle of the school?

569
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,369
She's just a joke.

570
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,970
She's old.

571
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,129
No man would want her.

572
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:22,770
That's enough.

573
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,690
Let's not talk about her anymore.

574
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,329
Come on.

575
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,609
Zang Qiu.

576
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:00,329
Sorry about earlier.

577
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,690
I didn't know.

578
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,530
I misspoke.

579
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,329
By the way, I have a friend who just got divorced.

580
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,169
He's a little old, and he has a kid.

581
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,890
But I think he would be a good match for you.

582
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,330
Won't you consider him?

583
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,330
You're not young anymore.

584
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,649
You shouldn't put
your expectations too high.

585
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,890
You're not in a position

586
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,930
to choose now.

587
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,289
It's them choosing you.

588
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,050
That's right.

589
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:23,410
It's better to have a man

590
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,649
than to be alone.

591
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,930
Why don't I introduce you two sometime?

592
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,769
Don't bother.

593
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:29,850
She has a boyfriend.

594
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,010
Make room, please.

595
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:43,530
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

596
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:50,490
Why didn't you tell them

597
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:51,689
you have a boyfriend?

598
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,249
Boyfriend?

599
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:55,010
You look young.

600
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,810
You look like

601
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,569
you're in your early 20s at most.

602
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,490
Not at all, ma'am.

603
00:34:58,649 --> 00:34:59,530
I'm 26 this year.

604
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,450
"Ma'am"?

605
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,890
Sorry.

606
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,769
You do look much older than Zang Qiu.

607
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,089
Terribly sorry.

608
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:09,490
26.

609
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:11,050
That's four years younger than Zang Qiu.

610
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:13,370
Nice going, Zang Qiu.

611
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,530
You found yourself a handsome young man.

612
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:17,209
How did you two meet?

613
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,930
I went to the hospital
Zang Qiu is working at

614
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,209
and fell for her at first sight.

615
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,689
You don't know

616
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,249
how hard it was to get her to agree
to be my girlfriend.

617
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,330
But she agreed at last.

618
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:31,729
A woman as capable as Dr. Zang

619
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,249
is always surrounded by countless suitors.

620
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,129
How envious.

621
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,169
That's the belle of the school for you.

622
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,569
When she was 20,

623
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,930
she was pursued by 20-year-old men.

624
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,010
At 30,

625
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,010
she still has 20-year-old men after her.

626
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,450
She has the charm.

627
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:48,249
Unlike me.

628
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:51,289
My husband is a greasy middle-aged man.

629
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,569
Zang Qiu is classy and unconventional.

630
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,890
It's trendy
to date a younger man these days.

631
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:56,410
She's certainly a winner in life.

632
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,129
Not at all.

633
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,089
After all, I look like I'm bad luck.

634
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:01,850
No.

635
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,970
I'm old and widowed.

636
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,050
No.

637
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,249
No man would want me.

638
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,930
She's got character.

639
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:14,410
Isn't that right?

640
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,970
Qian? Yingying?

641
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,330
I don't care

642
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,729
what people say behind my back.

643
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:25,410
I just think

644
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:27,890
that it's so sad

645
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,089
we're still judging a woman

646
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,729
by her marital status
in this day and age.

647
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,410
Yes.

648
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:37,089
I lost my husband.

649
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:39,089
To me,

650
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,129
that's regret and grief.

651
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,050
It's not something to be ashamed of.

652
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,729
So I will not find another man to prove myself.

653
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,330
Come.

654
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:55,050
I raise a toast to all of you.

655
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,169
To our "friendship" that is dead.

656
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:58,930
Bottoms up for me.

657
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:10,129
Cool.

658
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,050
She's got attitude.

659
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,410
I'll be leaving now.

660
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,289
Enjoy.

661
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,649
Why did they leave?

662
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:16,850
Dr. Zang.

663
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,289
Why did you leave so soon?

664
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,530
Who told you to come?

665
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,970
Why did you claim to be my boyfriend

666
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:23,169
without my permission?

667
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:23,769
No, I...

668
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,729
I could tell that something
was wrong over the phone.

669
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:26,530
I was worried something had happened.

670
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:27,249
That's why I rushed over.

671
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:28,450
They were trying to humiliate you.

672
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,450
I just wanted to help.

673
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:30,450
I don't need your help.

674
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,050
I can settle my own problems.

675
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,330
Do you think I'll be moved

676
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,330
by you playing the hero?

677
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,729
How immature of you.

678
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:40,129
Yes.

679
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,129
I am immature.

680
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:42,530
Even so, I want to help you.

681
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:44,209
Lu Fangqi,

682
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,649
how many times do I need to say this?

683
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,450
I don't like you.

684
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,729
You're not my type.

685
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,370
It's impossible between us.

686
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:52,769
So what is your type?

687
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,530
Be specific. I can learn.

688
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:57,249
Fine.

689
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,089
I'll tell you.

690
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,609
He's tall.

691
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,850
He had broad shoulders.

692
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,209
He smiled like a kid.

693
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,330
He appeared mature on the outside,

694
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,649
but on the inside, he's gentle and romantic.

695
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,729
And he's intelligent.

696
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,890
When I was unhappy,

697
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,810
he'd do everything

698
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,089
to cheer me up.

699
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,930
He knew I like daisies.

700
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,850
So he brought a bouquet of daisies

701
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,729
for me whenever we met.

702
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,410
He was a fool.

703
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,689
Even...

704
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:57,050
Even when I poked
a needle in the wrong spot,

705
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,089
he told me

706
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,890
it was all right.

707
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,970
It didn't hurt at all.

708
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,249
Every wish he made

709
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:11,689
on his birthday
had nothing to do with himself.

710
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,490
He told me this.

711
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,089
"Do you know

712
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,609
what my birthday wish is?"

713
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,649
"My wish is for you

714
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,050
to be happy."

715
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,850
That man was Fang Huai, right?

716
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,729
I know it's hard to let go.

717
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,249
I know

718
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,289
that I might never surpass him.

719
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,330
But there's one way
I'm different from him.

720
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,930
I will never leave you behind.

721
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,609
I will always be with you.

722
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,930
I will always protect you.

723
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,289
I will never give up on you easily.

724
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,569
(I won't give up.)

725
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,010
(I'll be waiting for you downstairs.)

726
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:44,010
I knew you would come.

727
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,050
You always come

728
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,129
whenever I'm scared.

729
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,330
Why are you still here?

730
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,330
Didn't I tell you
I don't want to see you?

731
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,209
Don't you get it?

732
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:56,289
If that's true,

733
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,530
why are you here?

734
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,370
Go home.

735
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,649
Don't come again.

736
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,010
Wait.

737
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,370
Five.

738
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:11,729
Four.

739
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:12,890
Three.

740
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:13,930
Two.

741
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:14,769
One.

742
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,050
Time's up.

743
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,410
What you said
about not wanting to see me

744
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,450
