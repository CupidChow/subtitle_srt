(Peace Opens Up The Captain's Heart)

18
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,200
A normal colleague?

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,280
Fine, so be it.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
What's the big deal?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,399
You're not that impressive.

22
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,559
Are you hungry?

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,160
Let's eat.

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,799
Come on. The food is ready.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,320
Slow down.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm hungry too.

27
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,640
Forget about love.

28
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,040
Even the dog gets to eat,

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,839
my life is worse than the dog.

30
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,999
Hello, Huo?

31
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,559
Why do you sound so exhausted?

32
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:57,839
I didn't have dinner.

33
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,360
Why didn't you eat?

34
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,519
I don't have the appetite.

35
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,559
What's the matter?

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
I am right at the training camp front gate.

37
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,399
Come out.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,839
I brought you food.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,080
Really? I'm on my way.

40
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,480
Your delivery came just in time.

41
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,559
Here.

42
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,080
These are your favorite.

43
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,239
Dumplings.

44
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,519
Milk tea.

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,679
Straw.

46
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,080
Try the dumplings first.

47
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,279
Take your time.

48
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,200
Xu Lai.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,839
What's wrong?

50
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,800
Why didn't you go home?

51
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,719
My parents had a fight last night.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
I don't want to go home yet.

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,320
Alright.

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,719
Cheer up.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,240
Come with me.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,880
Where are we going?

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,080
Come and you'll find out.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,719
You built this?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,440
This will be our very own secret base.

60
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,719
If you ever feel upset,

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,640
come here.

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
This place will forever be our safe haven.

63
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,719
Thank you.

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,560
I love it.

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,839
This starry night is so beautiful.

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,200
As beautiful as the starry sky

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,399
we saw at our secret base.

69
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,320
Time flies.

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
The best thing about my childhood

71
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,039
is knowing you and Han Fang.

72
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,000
We became best friends.

73
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,320
What? What's with that look?

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,640
Do you regret it now?

75
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,919
Yeah. I regret it.

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,599
It's exhausting to be your friend.

77
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay?

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,519
It's too late to say that now.

79
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,440
Once a friend, always a friend.

80
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
We promised to be best buddies.

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,959
You're not going anywhere.

82
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,599
Are you asleep?

83
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Peace?

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,839
What's wrong with her?

85
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,279
Xu Lai.

86
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,599
Where is she at this late hour?

87
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:48,880
Peace.

88
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,039
Do you know where she is?

89
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,680
Tell me.

90
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:54,959
Peace?

91
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Why are you here?

92
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,320
Peace was worried about you.

93
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:36,839
He brought me here.

94
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,000
Now I know why you skipped your meal.

95
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,240
You had a date.

96
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,039
I didn't eat because of you.

97
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,959
A team member can't simply leave.

98
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,359
You broke the rule.

99
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,399
Come back to the camp now.

100
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,839
Peace.

101
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,240
I have to go now.

102
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:58,919
Hold on.

103
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,760
Peace, what's wrong?

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,240
Huo, I have to go.

105
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,919
I'm the instructor.
I must show discipline.

106
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,159
You should go too.

107
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,440
Whose dog are you?

108
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
Don't take it out on the dog.

109
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I don't care.

110
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,680
Don't talk to me.

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
You're acting like a child.

112
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,639
Still better than someone.

113
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,759
He wouldn't admit

114
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,839
that he cares and is jealous.

115
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,719
He always acts like he's very mature.

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,119
He thinks he's cool.

117
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Peace, come back to the kennel.

118
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,119
Come on.

119
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Captain Jin.

120
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:41,959
Looking for this?

121
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,680
Give me the key.

122
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:53,719
Did you come

123
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,759
to bring me noodles?

124
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Did you make this?

125
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,520
You already ate with someone else.

126
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,719
You're probably already full.

127
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,160
Nonsense.

128
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,759
You made the noodles

129
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,759
just for me.

130
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,080
I have to finish them.

131
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,879
Stop eating. They are cold.

132
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,800
The noodles are cold,

133
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,160
but my heart is hot.

134
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,879
These are the best noodles.

135
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:22,719
Thanks, Captain Jin.

136
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,599
In a mission,

137
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,879
the search-and-rescue dogs

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,400
will face all kinds of obstacles.

139
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,879
Fire is one of them.

140
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,639
They have to search for trapped survivors

141
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,040
after the fire is put out.

142
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,239
What if the fire starts burning again?

143
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,239
The training today

144
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
is to help the dogs overcome

145
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,639
their fear for fire.

146
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:52,479
Up next,

147
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,599
I'll demonstrate for you.

148
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,839
Peace, jump.

149
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,639
Hurry.

150
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:17,759
Okay.

151
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Next, we'll try it with the dog.

152
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,160
Who goes first?

153
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:23,959
Me.

154
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,239
Come on.

155
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:27,879
Are you sure?

156
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,959
No problem.

157
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,599
Come on, Mighty.

158
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,440
Stay still.

159
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:34,999
Mighty.

160
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,280
Go, Mighty.

161
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,080
Stop.

162
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,080
Walk.

163
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,599
It's not working.

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,999
It can't do.

165
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,599
It wouldn't do it.

166
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,639
What's so funny?

167
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,839
You're not any better.

168
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,999
I may do it.

169
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,680
Lu Fangqi.

170
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Give it a try.

171
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:57,479
Go on.

172
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:58,999
Give it a shot.

173
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,359
Go.

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,160
Give it a try.

175
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,879
Hurry up, go.

176
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,759
You're mean.

177
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,479
Don't move.

178
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,280
Stop.

179
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,479
Stop running!

180
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,759
Stay still.

181
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,280
Why you...

182
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:18,879
Move.

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
This way.

184
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,759
Quick.

185
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,280
This way.

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,160
Coal!

187
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,999
Coal!

188
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,920
Okay. Let's continue.

189
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,560
Who's next?

190
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:36,440
Me.

191
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,959
Come on, Zhang Yang.

192
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,239
Come, Champ.

193
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,040
Lean. Stop.

194
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,320
Lean.

195
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,879
Sit.

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
Good dog.

197
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,959
Okay, get up.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,599
Champ.

199
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Show them what you got.

200
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,879
Okay?

201
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,680
Champ, jump!

202
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,119
Quick, to the infirmary!

203
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,040
Zhang Yang, step forth.

204
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
How did Champ get hurt?

205
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,119
Captain Jin,

206
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,639
it's my fault for overlooking Champ's health

207
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,400
and giving it extra training

208
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:22,759
in private.

209
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,040
Come here, Champ.

210
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,359
Good dog.

211
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,800
As dog trainers,

212
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,800
the dogs choose you,

213
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,999
not the other way around.

214
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,879
From the moment they choose you

215
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,400
and start following you,

216
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,160
they are your comrades.

217
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,119
In my team,

218
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,800
I won't let anyone

219
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,400
put their comrades at risk.

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
The trainer and the dog
are in this together.

221
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,959
Now that Champ is hurt,

222
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,359
there's no need for you to stay.

223
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,759
Captain Jin!

224
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,239
Zhang Yang has been working hard.

225
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,560
Could you give him another chance?

226
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,839
He broke the rule.

227
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,080
His training stops now.

228
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,040
He'll be transferred to logistics.

229
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,400
No one shall appeal for him.

230
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,740
(Personal Record)

231
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,440
I'd like to talk to you

232
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,520
about Zhang Yang.

233
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,160
If you are here to make an appeal,

234
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,040
don't bother.

235
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
I think this punishment

236
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,080
is too much for Zhang Yang.

237
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
He could be a little too competitive.

238
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
But he is not a bad person.

239
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,440
The cause of his mishandling

240
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,200
was the lack of understanding about the dogs.

241
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,440
Protecting the dog

242
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,999
is the most basic skill for a trainer.

243
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,680
Zhang Yang should be responsible

244
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,440
for Champ's injury.

245
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
As the instructor,

246
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,680
you are responsible too.

247
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,879
Now is not the time to defend your trainee.

248
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,680
What about Windchase?

249
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,759
Shouldn't you be

250
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,639
responsible?

251
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,479
Sorry.

252
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
I didn't mean to bring that up.

253
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,639
That's enough.

254
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,320
I should be responsible.

255
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,920
From that day on,

256
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,800
I've never handled another dog.

257
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,800
That is the punishment for myself.

258
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,999
Sorry.

259
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,839
I shouldn't have brought that up.

260
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,520
But what I mean is,

261
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,160
whether it's Windchase

262
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
or Champ,

263
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,719
they wouldn't want

264
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,959
their trainers to be punished.

265
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,599
Trainers want to protect the dogs,

266
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,320
and the dogs would want to protect the trainers.

267
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
This isn't the outcome they'd want.

268
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,159
I can't decide Zhang Yang's fate.

269
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,480
The Commissioner will decide.

270
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,399
He's your teammate.

271
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,439
Are you going to forsake him now?

272
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,800
This is about discipline.

273
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,960
If I break the rule,

274
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,560
would you so easily forsake me?

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes.

276
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:33,280
You're as cold

277
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,080
and rigid as a rock.

278
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Hello, Commissioner.

279
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,159
Shichuan.

280
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,000
The application report Xu Lai sent us

281
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,119
has been approved.

282
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,359
What application report?

283
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,480
Didn't Xu Lai tell you?

284
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,800
She wants Peace

285
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
on the search and rescue team.

286
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,480
(When the higher-ups saw Peace's file,)

287
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,599
(they approved the application.)

288
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,919
But I must make one thing perfectly clear.

289
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,119
Like every other search-and-rescue dog,

290
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,560
Peace must pass the assessment

291
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,480
to make it on the team.

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,080
Yes. Understood.

293
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,399
Chief.

294
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,480
Report of the first batch

295
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,639
was sent to your mailbox.

296
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,639
Check it later.

297
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
Not bad.

298
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,320
I knew you're capable,

299
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,879
but this exceeds my expectation.

300
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,280
(You work multiple jobs)

301
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:30,800
(but are still just as efficient.)

302
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,800
I wish I could be more efficient.

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,159
I want to finish up and go back asap.

304
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,119
You can leave early.

305
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,639
But remember this.

306
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,240
(Before you leave,)

307
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,159
(interview Captain Jin.)

308
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,399
Okay, understood.

309
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,760
Xu Lai.

310
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Commissioner Wen just called.

311
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,320
I'd like to discuss Peace's assessment.

312
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,119
The higher-ups have

313
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,280
approved your application

314
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,679
for Peace's service.

315
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:57,679
But first,

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,879
he must pass the assessment

317
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,000
like the other dogs.

318
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,080
Lu Fangqi, come here.

319
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,439
Go on without me.

320
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,560
What's up?

321
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,439
Tell Captain Jin

322
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:12,520
I've received the notice.

323
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:13,720
No need to relay the message.

324
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,359
She said she had received...

325
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,040
Peace must pass the assessment.

326
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,040
For that,

327
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,199
he needs the right trainer.

328
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,839
Do you know any candidates?

329
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,760
Tell Captain Jin

330
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
there was a suitable candidate.

331
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,080
But now I think

332
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,240
he's not the right person.

333
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,199
She said...

334
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,240
Remember,

335
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,679
you need a candidate as soon as possible.

336
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,599
Otherwise, Peace's coordination with the trainer

337
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,599
will be affected during the assessment.

338
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,119
Tell Captain Jin I know what to do.

339
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,359
I don't need his advice.

340
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Tell Ms. Xu

341
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,399
that she is being too childish.

342
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,960
Tell Captain Jin

343
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,879
Peace is not his concern.

344
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,000
Hold on, you two.

345
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:57,879
Could you not use me

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,679
as a telephone?

347
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,240
It's not necessary.

348
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,359
I'm just standing here.

349
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,080
Are you done?

350
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Is it my fault?

351
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:35,520
Isn't that Zhang Yang?

352
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,919
He doesn't look so well.

353
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:41,919
Liu Xu!

354
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,599
Yes!

355
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,399
I have a mission for you.

356
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,520
Get working.

357
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,280
Another scoop.

358
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,320
Dig in.

359
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,439
What's going on?

360
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,480
How did you get so much meat?

361
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
Why don't I get this much?

362
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Feel free to grab some.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
Did Zhang Yang give it to you?

364
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,800
When did you two become so close?

365
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,720
Stop asking.

366
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:04,960
I won't tell you anything.

367
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,040
Who cares?

368
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,359
What do you need?

369
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,720
Some prawns.

370
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,280
What are you getting?

371
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,480
Some prawns.

372
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,199
This, this, and that.

373
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,399
What's going on between

374
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,320
Captain Jin and Ms. Xu?

375
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,399
They aren't talking.

376
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:34,679
This is...

377
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,040
I heard rumors.

378
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,839
Ms. Xu is upset at Captain Jin

379
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,080
over Zhang Yang's punishment.

380
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,040
For real?

381
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,560
Ms. Xu.

382
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,960
Zhang Yang.

383
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,480
How is it?

384
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,280
How is life in logistics?

385
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm doing well, Ms. Xu.

386
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,520
There's something
I'd like to talk about.

387
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,280
It's about Champ, right?

388
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,439
Don't worry.

389
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:05,919
I change its bandages every day.

390
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,760
It's recovering well.

391
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,159
Liu Xu told me about Champ.

392
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,760
I must thank you

393
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,879
for the quick recovery.

394
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,320
But I want to talk about Captain Jin.

395
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,439
What's wrong with him?

396
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,199
When I'm in the logistics,

397
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,240
Captain Jin has secretly sent Liu Xu

398
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,040
to help me out

399
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,320
and look out for me.

400
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,240
Captain Jin sent me to the logistics

401
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,599
to train me.

402
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
He hasn't given up on me.

403
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:30,280
Ms. Xu.

404
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,800
I know you've been making appeals for me.

405
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,280
But you misunderstood

406
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,919
Captain Jin.

407
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,919
Understood.

408
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,199
(I misunderstood Jin Shichuan.)

409
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:04,760
(And I said)

410
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
(those mean things to him.)

411
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,879
(No.)

412
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,960
(Text messages lack sincerity.)

413
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,240
(To the respected)

414
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,199
(Captain Jin Shichuan,)

415
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,159
(I was too absorbed)

416
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,040
(in my own opinions.)

417
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,199
(I misunderstood your decision)

418
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,040
(of punishment.)

419
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,040
(My actions and behaviors
were immature.)

420
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,040
(The things I said were unreasonable.)

421
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,159
(Therefore,)

422
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,159
(I am deeply sorry and I regret it.)

423
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,240
(I reflected on my mistakes.)

424
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,919
(I reviewed my own actions.)

425
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,119
(The result is as the following.)

426
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:09,839
(First off,)

427
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,119
(I shouldn't have intervened in)

428
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,240
(your method of management)

429
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,720
(or doubted your decision.)

430
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,159
(Secondly,)

431
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,040
(I shouldn't have criticized you)

432
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,480
(over Zhang Yang's punishment)

433
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:19,839
(and let my personal feelings)

434
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,720
(affect my work.)

435
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,359
(Thirdly,)

436
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,839
(and most importantly,)

437
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,960
(I shouldn't have
doubted your character)

438
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
(and uttered those hurtful words.)

439
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,159
(I apologize to you for my rash)

440
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:31,879
(and immature actions.)

441
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,960
(I've reflected on my mistakes)

442
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,240
(and will never repeat them.)

443
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,800
(Please give me)

444
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,000
(a chance to prove myself.)

445
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,159
(From: Xu Lai.)

446
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,919
(If you are willing to forgive me,)

447
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,040
(come to the field at 8 p.m.)

448
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,760
(I want to apologize in person.)

449
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Is he coming?

450
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:02,560
What if

451
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,320
he doesn't care?

452
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,679
(When he showed up,)

453
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
(all of my self-control,)

454
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,439
(all of my concerns,)

455
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,280
(and all of my worries)

456
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,399
(were gone.)

457
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,919
(Just like ten years ago,)

458
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,839
(he walked toward me with the light.)

459
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,720
(He lights up the world for me.)

460
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,000
You came.

461
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
I read your letter.

462
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:47,960
I think there is something

463
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,399
I should explain to you in person.

464
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,599
Sorry.

465
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,399
I am wrong this time.

466
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,439
I shouldn't have been so subjectively...

467
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,399
Don't apologize.

468
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,199
Actually,

469
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,359
I never told anyone

470
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,560
how I felt about Zhang Yang's punishment.

471
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,679
It's normal that you doubt me.

472
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,240
I understand that as an instructor,

473
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,439
you want to defend your trainee.

474
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,919
You're not upset at all?

475
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:17,760
Why should I be?

476
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,760
Would you change your mind

477
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,000
about me because of it?

478
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:23,720
What do you mean?

479
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,080
The impression.

480
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,720
It's like taking the exam at school.

481
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:27,960
Wrong answers take points off the score.

482
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,839
If you want to lower my score...

483
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,879
Well, seeing I'm so sincerely

484
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,679
admitting my mistake,

485
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,320
could I get those points back?

486
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,159
What is this nonsense?

487
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,320
Your brain does work differently

488
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,199
from the others.

489
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,199
So, did I lose any points?

490
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,599
What are you talking about?

491
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,119
So, did I lose any points?

492
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,839
Let me think about it.

493
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:52,599
Well?

494
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,520
No, you lost nothing.

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,679
Really?

496
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,159
Could you give me a final score?

497
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
What score does your heart give me?

498
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,000
Jin Shichuan.

499
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,119
I'm done playing hard-to-get.

500
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,199
I'm done hiding and testing.

501
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,359
I don't want any misunderstanding between us.

502
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,599
I want to be honest with you.

503
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,320
I like you.

504
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I really, really

505
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,320
like you.

506
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,040
I believe that

507
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,679
someday

508
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,599
you'll like me too.

509
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,639
Until then,

510
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,960
you won't get away from me.

511
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,040
How lovely.

512
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,204
(Extremewind Training Centre)

513
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,000
Defend!

514
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:25,599
Pass the ball!

515
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,000
Quick!

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Captain Jin.

517
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,839
Did you get a heatstroke?

518
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,679
Captain Jin.

519
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,199
Why didn't you move just now?

520
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,240
Carry on.

521
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,199
It wasn't a heatstroke.

522
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,679
It was Xu Lai in his head.

523
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:47,280
Let's go.

524
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,679
Going for a walk?

525
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,639
By the way,

526
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,240
I have something to tell you.

527
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,080
Let's talk on the way.

528
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,599
Sure.

529
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:03,800
This weekend,

530
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,439
I want to take our trainees on leave
and their dogs

531
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,439
to the beach.

532
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,320
Some training in a new environment.

533
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,679
That way,

534
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,560
the dogs can become closer to the trainers

535
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:12,280
when they are relaxed.

536
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,760
They will be more obedient.

537
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,040
Sure, no problem.

538
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,960
That was a quick answer.

539
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,480
I thought you'd think

540
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,679
it'd hinder the training progress.

541
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,439
The assessment is
just around the corner.

542
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
They must be nervous.

543
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,679
This is a great chance for some changes

544
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,800
and let them relax.

545
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,399
You are a professional.

546
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,119
I trust your judgment.

547
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,280
It's up to you.

548
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,040
It's up to me?

549
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,159
I'll inform the team.

550
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,760
I'm usually very strict with them,

551
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,520
but they are still in their 20s.

552
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,599
No one starts out

553
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,199
as a sensible and mature person.

554
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,439
When I was their age,

555
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:43,919
I was much more mischievous.

556
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,000
You sounded like an old man.

557
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,399
You're not that old.

558
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,720
My heart is.

559
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:59,199
You look great when you smile.

560
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
Just as youthful and brilliant as them.

561
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:03,760
I wasn't smiling.

562
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,520
Yes, you were.

563
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,720
The sun is too hot.

564
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,919
I can see your dimples.

565
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,919
Smile again.

566
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,919
Fine. I know you're the captain.

567
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,760
You're obliged to behave like one.

568
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,080
Let the training begin.

569
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,480
Come on. Let's go.

570
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:26,800
Quick.

571
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,439
Are the dogs ready?

572
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,199
Go. Go. Go!

573
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,720
Crouch!

574
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,960
Well done, Coal.

575
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,480
Jump!

576
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,280
- Coal!
- Rocky!

577
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,439
Peace, jump.

578
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,199
Peace, jump.

579
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,320
Jump! Crouch!

580
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:57,879
Peace.

581
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,520
No.

582
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,639
No.

583
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,119
No.

584
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,800
Peace likes you.

585
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:10,560
What do you want?

586
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:20,480
Well played!

587
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,399
Have you noticed?

588
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,480
Captain Jin seems different lately.

589
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,919
Trust me.

590
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,720
Ever since Xu Lai came here,

591
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,599
he's started smiling.

592
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,719
Come on. Sit over here.

593
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,520
Is this your first time at a beach?

594
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,159
Aren't you happy?

595
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,080
No. Don't move. Stop.

596
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,279
All set.

597
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,679
Coal.

598
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:25,759
Sit.

599
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:33,199
Sit.

600
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,599
Sit.

601
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,360
Sit.

602
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,840
- Sit.
- Alright.

603
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,799
Peace, up.

604
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's go.

605
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,360
Let's go.

606
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,960
Lean. Good.

607
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,279
What's on your mind?
Everyone is leaving.

608
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm thinking about Peace.

609
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,880
If he stays in the team,

610
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,199
who will be his trainer?

611
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,000
Have you decided?

612
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:25,880
Yeah.

613
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
Peace was brought here for you.

614
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,159
I don't train dogs.

615
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,840
But you like Peace

616
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,159
after spending some time with him.

617
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:46,840
Windchase is

618
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,599
the only dog I can train.

619
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,119
Get someone else.

620
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,040
Help!

621
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,199
Help!

622
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,520
Let's go, Peace.

623
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,080
Help!

624
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,920
Help!

625
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,679
Help!

626
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,639
Peace!

627
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,000
Help!

628
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,080
Hello? Emergency response?

629
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,119
Jin Shichuan!

630
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,239
Jin Shichuan!

631
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,639
Peace!

632
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,239
What are you staring at?

633
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,319
Captain Jin and Xu Lai aren't here yet.

634
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,319
They are having a private moment.

635
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,520
Mind your own business.

636
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,319
I know. I'm going to eavesdrop on them.

637
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,199
Tell the others to wait for us.

638
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,040
Hold on. I'm going too!

639
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,040
Lu Fangqi, quick!

640
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:48,719
Let's go!

641
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:15,679
He's awake.

642
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:16,960
Are you alright, pal?

643
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:18,880
He's awake.

644
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,319
Where is Peace?

645
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:26,960
Peace!

646
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,480
Peace!

647
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:40,880
Take him to the hospital.

648
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,799
Let's go.

649
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,159
It might have drowned.

650
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,440
Could be foreign objects in its stomach.

651
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,639
Its condition is critical.

652
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
We must examine it now.

653
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,040
What do you mean?

654
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,639
Will he live?

655
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,799
We don't know yet.

656
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,239
We must examine to know more.

657
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,400
Sir.

658
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,679
You can't come in here.

659
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,119
Close the door.

660
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Alright.

661
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,000
Believe in Peace.

662
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,599
Believe in the doctors.

663
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,480
Do you know

664
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,759
why I became a dog trainer?

665
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,520
I had been asking about you.

666
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,239
I learned that Windchase was gone.

667
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,119
You left the search-and-rescue team,

668
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,759
and became a firefighter.

669
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,239
I've been thinking.

670
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,319
Were you traumatized

671
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,480
when you lost Windchase?

672
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,480
I had been thinking

673
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,159
if I could do anything for you.

674
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,480
Then, I met Peace.

675
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,360
Windchase and Peace
have so many things in common.

676
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,239
So I hope

677
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,920
Peace can heal your heart.

678
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,119
Peace has been waiting for you.

679
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,520
Don't let it wait too long.

680
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,040
Hey.

681
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,119
You're here again.

682
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,119
How can Doctor Zang help you this time?

683
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
I injured my arm lately.

684
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,080
I want her to take a look at it.

685
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,400
We all know

686
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,080
only Doctor Zang can heal you.

687
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,159
Well, she is a great doctor.

688
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,520
I'm not making excuses to see her.

689
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,239
Alright.

690
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:49,960
You don't have to explain.

691
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,239
Doctor Zang is in the middle of surgery.

692
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,159
Wait here.

693
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,119
Sure.

694
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:10,520
Wake up.

695
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,719
This is not a place to sleep.

696
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:14,960
You finished the surgery?

697
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
I told you not to come here

698
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,679
unless you have to.

699
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:18,719
Hear me out.

700
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,080
Our team rescued someone today.

701
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,520
I was the one to send them here.

702
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,719
I thought I should drop by

703
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,639
and check on you.

704
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,480
Are you done?

705
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,239
If so, leave. I am busy.

706
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:28,880
I...

707
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,920
Are you alright?

708
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,400
Is something wrong?

709
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,239
It's nothing.

710
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,799
Gastric pain. I'm used to it.

711
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,080
Did you skip your meals again?

712
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,759
The surgery schedule is too packed
for me to eat.

713
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,400
You'll fall sick

714
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,080
if you don't eat.

715
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,319
