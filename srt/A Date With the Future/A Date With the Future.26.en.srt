(Do What You Want. I'm Here For You)

22
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,688
(Remember to take your meals on time.)

23
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,847
(I'll be worried)

24
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,287
(if your gastric issue acts up again.)

25
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:35,848
(All right.)

26
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,568
Let's eat together when we both have time.

27
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:47,687
(Let's eat together)

28
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:48,568
(when we both have time.)

29
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:12,608
Captain Jin.

30
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:16,767
You looked fine in the afternoon.

31
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,367
Why the long face?

32
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:22,207
Zang Qiu hasn't replied to my text

33
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:23,087
for a long while.

34
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,448
She's a doctor.

35
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:36,807
She has to perform surgeries

36
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,527
for several hours.

37
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:40,848
It's normal that she doesn't
reply to your text.

38
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:41,848
Was she like this too

39
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,207
when she was with Fang Huai?

40
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,168
Why?

41
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,448
I'm just curious.

42
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,128
Sometimes,

43
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,967
I feel that Dr. Zang doesn't really like me.

44
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,328
But sometimes I could feel something from her.

45
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:02,608
Captain Jin.

46
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,367
Can you tell me about Fang Huai?

47
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:10,967
Fang Huai

48
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,848
was like the sun.

49
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,127
He brought happiness

50
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:20,968
to everyone around him.

51
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:25,567
Speaking of which, both of you
share this in common.

52
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:28,327
Does Dr. Zang see me

53
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,687
as Fang Huai's replacement?

54
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:31,687
No, it won't be.

55
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:33,687
Though you're similar,

56
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,127
there's something different between you two.

57
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,007
He was like the rising sun
in the morning.

58
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:41,447
Bright

59
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,247
and lively.

60
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:49,367
While you are the sun after the rain

61
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,687
that brings warmth to everyone.

62
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,367
But the sun that appears in the morning

63
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:57,927
is there every day,

64
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,408
unlike the sun after the rain,

65
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,447
which isn't always present.

66
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,048
But life

67
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:11,168
isn't sunny all the time.

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,648
And that makes the sun after the rain

69
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,968
even more precious.

70
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:20,648
I get you.

71
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,127
I want to be that sun for Zang Qiu，

72
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,447
warming her up

73
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,687
and leading her out of the gloom.

74
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:30,807
Let's go.

75
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:54,728
Careful.

76
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:56,648
Slowly.

77
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,288
This is Xu Lai of Huaigang TV Station,

78
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,927
reporting live from the fire scene

79
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,848
at Nanxiang Nursing Home.

80
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:29,927
Hello.

81
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,408
We're the reporters from the TV station

82
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:32,807
and would like to interview you.

83
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,088
Was there only one

84
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,327
with critical injury at the scene?

85
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,768
I was sleeping

86
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:38,007
and didn't know what was going on.

87
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:38,887
The fire just broke out.

88
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:39,807
Right.

89
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,048
It was dark outside.

90
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:42,408
I didn't see anything.

91
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:43,408
I know something.

92
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:44,687
My room is next to hers.

93
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,168
Everyone, hush.

94
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:48,048
That's right.

95
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:48,927
The nursing home

96
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,848
evacuated all the elderly
in time.

97
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:52,768
But one elderly lady

98
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,127
couldn't escape in time

99
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,887
because she has difficulty walking.

100
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,247
That's why she was trapped in the fire.

101
00:06:58,968 --> 00:06:59,887
Are you the person in charge

102
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,728
of the nursing home?

103
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:04,528
I'm the director of Nanxiang Nursing Home.

104
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,567
Why did the elderly lady have no caregivers?

105
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,968
Since you knew
that she can't walk well,

106
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,927
why wasn't she rescued from the fire immediately?

107
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,687
The situation was chaotic

108
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,168
and the fire was intense.

109
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,528
We have limited hands.

110
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,968
So, it's possible
that one or two

111
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:19,487
would be left out.

112
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,528
Left out?

113
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,367
Is this the attitude of the nursing home

114
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,848
towards this fire incident?

115
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,247
That Ms. Zheng mentioned

116
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,487
was abandoned by her son

117
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:32,487
in the nursing home.

118
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,007
It has been three or four years.

119
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,327
And her son never visited her.

120
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:38,528
Because of this, she's upset

121
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,367
and has even attempted

122
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:41,687
to kill herself.

123
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:46,208
This fire is quite suspicious.

124
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,487
She's the only one severely injured.

125
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,168
I suspect

126
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:51,608
that it was Ms. Zheng

127
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:52,608
who started the fire.

128
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:55,447
Are you suggesting

129
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,327
that she wanted to commit suicide?

130
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,048
Last time, she even said
that she wanted to set a fire

131
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,127
to kill herself.

132
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:05,408
Hello.

133
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:06,687
May I ask...

134
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,528
The cause of the fire

135
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,807
is still unclear.

136
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:13,608
The nursing home

137
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,728
has also suffered significant damage.

138
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:18,687
If this incident is caused
by someone's action

139
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,367
and brought inconvenience
to other elderly people,

140
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,608
we'll hold them accountable.

141
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,208
Please rest assured.

142
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,288
As the director,

143
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:27,728
I'll take responsibility
and get them safe

144
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:28,728
no matter what.

145
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,687
Hopefully, everyone

146
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,847
could give us concerns and support.

147
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,528
Jin Shichuan, how are you?

148
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:45,607
Did you get injured?

149
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:46,727
No.

150
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:47,768
By the way,

151
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:48,967
how's the situation inside?

152
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,087
The director responded

153
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,207
that the elderly lady started the fire.

154
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:51,888
What do you think?

155
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,368
I can't answer you as of now.

156
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,327
We have to wait for
the fire investigation department

157
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,248
to examine the scene

158
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,488
and identify the origin point

159
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,128
before we analyze the fire incident.

160
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,008
But based on what happened earlier,

161
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,128
I don't think

162
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,528
it was the elderly lady
who started the fire.

163
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:10,648
Why?

164
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:12,528
I saved her just now.

165
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:14,128
When I found her,

166
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,648
she was crawling into the corridor

167
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,607
and she had some simple
protection on her.

168
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,128
She had a strong will to live.

169
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,967
I don't think she wanted
to kill herself.

170
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,288
The director acted weird too.

171
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:26,528
I'm thinking of digging deep.

172
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,888
Go ahead and do what you want.

173
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,207
I'm here for you.

174
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,327
I'll support you.

175
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,207
Step back. It's dangerous.

176
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,087
Be careful.

177
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:34,607
I will.

178
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:35,528
Raise the hose higher.

179
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,168
Higher.

180
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,327
Up there.

181
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,060
(Brave Dangers and Serve the People)

182
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:45,528
I interviewed the people involved

183
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:46,727
these two days.

184
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:48,447
Also,

185
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,327
these are the photos

186
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,048
I took at the scene.

187
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,048
But I couldn't go in deeper

188
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:51,847
the fire scene.

189
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,488
I couldn't know the situation inside.

190
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,327
It's fine. I was there.

191
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:56,447
I can work this out with you.

192
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,567
Look at the wall here.

193
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,368
There are bulges on the wall.

194
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:15,048
Maybe they used other materials
for expansion

195
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,488
after the construction is done.

196
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,008
I guess this is the partition

197
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,368
used to separate rooms.

198
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:28,927
I remember

199
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,368
I have seen many small rooms

200
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,567
divided from a big room

201
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,248
when I was there.

202
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,368
The internal structure is very complex.

203
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,847
Many emergency exits were blocked.

204
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,048
It seems that Wang Yi

205
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,168
has illegally expanded

206
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,567
the nursing home

207
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,927
for more accommodation.

208
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,490
(Xin'an Apartment)

209
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:54,408
Granny, let me help you.

210
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:55,847
Thank you.

211
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:57,967
The room is damp

212
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,288
and the bedsheets are moldy.

213
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:05,248
Granny.

214
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,128
Didn't you stay

215
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,168
in the nursing home before?

216
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,528
That's a private nursing home.

217
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,008
What can we expect from them?

218
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,567
They always mistreat and
neglect people like us

219
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,807
who have no children.

220
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,288
The temporary shelter

221
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,847
is at least a place to stay.

222
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:25,687
Granny Gao.

223
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,408
I heard

224
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,408
that you're close with Ms. Zheng,

225
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,368
who's injured.

226
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,128
I'm Xu Lai, a reporter
from the TV station.

227
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,327
I want to help Ms. Zheng.

228
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,607
Can I ask you about the incident?

229
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,008
Director Wang

230
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,008
was talking nonsense.

231
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,648
Zheng would never kill herself.

232
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,168
Every day,

233
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:50,327
she hopes that her son

234
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,447
could visit her at the nursing home.

235
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:55,927
So, the claim of her intention to set a fire

236
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,327
doesn't exist at all?

237
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:07,607
Director Wang.

238
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,248
It's you again.

239
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:10,528
I'm taking my wife
for a prenatal checkup.

240
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:11,368
I don't have time for the interview.

241
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,128
Can we talk about

242
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,248
how you mistreated the elderly

243
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:15,248
and created a false claim

244
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:16,528
about Ms. Zheng's suicide?

245
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:24,207
I warn you.

246
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:25,847
Don't make baseless accusations
when you don't have the evidence.

247
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:26,687
I do.

248
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,447
Look at the materials used
for partitions.

249
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,368
They are flammable.

250
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:34,607
And the electrical cords
that are exposed to the air.

251
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,288
Did you see that?

252
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:37,528
Apparently, these are old and worn-out wiring

253
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,648
with serious potential hazards.

254
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,648
So, the fire in the nursing home

255
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,447
is more likely to be initiated by these hazards.

256
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:49,447
That's why Wang Yi

257
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,248
put the blame on the elderly lady

258
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,607
to divert attention.

259
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:56,447
What do you want?

260
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:57,967
I just want the truth.

261
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,488
The truth is Ms. Zheng set on fire herself.

262
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,207
But the firefighter who saved her said

263
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,567
that she had a strong will to live.

264
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:04,768
Because she can't walk well.

265
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:05,727
She's useless.

266
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,327
Do you have no responsibility at all?

267
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,128
How did the fire start?

268
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:11,768
Do you really want

269
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:12,447
to push me so hard

270
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:13,528
for someone who can't live much longer?

271
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,408
Even without this fire,

272
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,168
she has not much time left.

273
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:17,888
Wait.

274
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,288
You're the director of a nursing home.

275
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:21,008
Is this your attitude
towards the elderly?

276
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:22,327
What's wrong with my attitude?

277
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,528
Her own son doesn't even care about her.

278
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,327
We're kind enough to take her in.

279
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,408
You better stop meddling.

280
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,168
Okay?

281
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,967
No one cares about the truth.

282
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,327
The truth is that she wanted
to set on fire to commit suicide.

283
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,687
These are all the potential hazards.

284
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:39,288
I can only give you a definite answer

285
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,648
after the fire investigation department

286
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,447
comes up with the report.

287
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:44,447
But I'm afraid

288
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,567
Ms. Zheng can't wait this long.

289
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,128
She's in urgent need of money
for the medical bill.

290
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,248
Did Ms. Zheng's family come?

291
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,008
Her family refused to communicate.

292
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,008
Her medical fee

293
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:57,847
is covered by the public donation.

294
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:00,607
But it's far from enough.

295
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:02,128
So, we can only

296
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,768
provide her with conservation treatment.

297
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,128
Shouldn't the nursing home

298
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:06,687
pay for the expenses?

299
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:07,768
The director said

300
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,768
that the cause of the fire remains unknown.

301
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,648
They're not going
to take the responsibility.

302
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:15,168
Well.

303
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,967
I'll go to the temporary shelter again

304
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,488
to see if I can gather more helpful information.

305
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,288
You can go to the site

306
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:26,368
and ask about the situation on that day

307
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:30,207
to find the evidence of the fire origin point.

308
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:35,087
Granny.

309
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,687
Do you still remember where the fire started

310
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,168
on that day?

311
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:43,248
The fire started from the east side.

312
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:44,087
East side?

313
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,447
Is Ms. Zheng's room on the east side?

314
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,648
During the fire,

315
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:51,847
I was downstairs

316
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,447
and I faintly heard someone shouting

317
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,967
that the second room on the east side

318
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:57,888
was on fire.

319
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:02,008
But Zheng's room isn't there.

320
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:04,447
Her room is the innermost room
down the corridor

321
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,168
on the east side.

322
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,768
Does anyone else know about this

323
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:10,847
besides you?

324
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,087
You can ask the person

325
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,207
in the second room.

326
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:19,048
I'll take you there.

327
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,648
I can't believe this.

328
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,607
They're truly heartless.

329
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:23,768
They saved the healthy person

330
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,087
in the second room

331
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:26,528
but ignored Zheng next door

332
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,168
who can't walk well.

333
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,967
This was killing her.

334
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:31,648
Granny.

335
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,008
Don't worry.

336
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,687
I'll seek justice for Ms. Zheng.

337
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:53,967
Ms. Xu, did you stay up all night?

338
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:55,927
You're early.

339
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:57,408
Perfect timing.

340
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:58,607
I've finished the script.

341
00:16:58,648 --> 00:16:59,528
Review it for me.

342
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:01,488
You're so efficient.

343
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,288
I'll read it.

344
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,688
Ms. Xu, you're amazing.

345
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,288
This report

346
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,407
is supported by arguments
and has clear logic.

347
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,567
Once you publish

348
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,048
the report,

349
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,087
you can clean Ms. Zheng's name

350
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:18,567
and use public voice

351
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:19,807
to pressure Wang Yi into admitting.

352
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,208
Zhou.

353
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:24,248
Remember this well.

354
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,407
The intention of news
is reporting the truth,

355
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:28,167
not manipulating public opinion.

356
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,127
Now the fire investigation report

357
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:30,887
isn't out yet,

358
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,167
as the reporters,

359
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,048
we have no right to convict anyone.

360
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:35,127
Understood?

361
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,008
Besides, we mustn't publish this report.

362
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:41,367
Most of the contents

363
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,288
are just my speculation.

364
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:44,288
Before the authority

365
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,647
figures everything out,

366
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,087
I'm going to meet with Wang Yi

367
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:47,887
to confirm the facts.

368
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,127
But will he admit

369
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,288
to what he's done?

370
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:53,807
The police arresting him

371
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:54,968
in front of his wife

372
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:55,928
is the last thing I want to see.

373
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,008
The best solution now

374
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:02,928
is that he can bear the responsibility initiatively

375
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,968
and compensate Ms. Zheng
for what she deserves.

376
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:07,688
I'll head out.

377
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,530
(User, Log in)

378
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:23,127
I heard

379
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,567
that you're not on the list

380
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:25,847
of promoted interns.

381
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,167
It seems that Xu Lai

382
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,327
doesn't think highly of you.

383
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:31,968
She didn't help you, though.

384
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,167
I won't blame her.

385
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,887
I'm prepared to leave, anyway.

386
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,407
Whether or not you can stay,

387
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,008
it's all up to you.

388
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:46,448
Zhou.

389
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,407
You're smart.

390
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:50,528
It's important

391
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,327
for a novice like you

392
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:53,607
to choose the right mentor.

393
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:55,807
If you choose the right side,

394
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:57,567
you can achieve things effortlessly.

395
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,928
You decide your own future.

396
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,167
Who can you rely on?

397
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,167
It's a no-brainer, isn't it?

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,210
(User)

399
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,450
(When the rescue arrived at the scene...)

400
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,800
(The director refused
to save the elderly.)

401
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:02,688
Wang Yi.

402
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:04,367
Why are you here again?

403
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,167
Will you stop?

404
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:07,847
I hope that you can stand up

405
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:08,887
to clear Ms. Zheng's name

406
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:10,407
and pay her bill.

407
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,367
That's impossible.

408
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,288
Why should I listen to you?

409
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,208
Read this.

410
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,210
(Interview Log)

411
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,448
Ms. Xu.

412
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,448
Must you really go to such extremes?

413
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:54,327
I haven't published this report yet.

414
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:55,288
So, I hope

415
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,528
you can consider it carefully.

416
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:10,768
Let me settle my wife first.

417
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,127
I'll visit Ms. Zheng later.

418
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:15,528
The nursing home

419
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,208
will make a statement to clarify

420
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:19,367
that we're responsible for the fire.

421
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:21,528
Okay.

422
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,208
Keep your word.

423
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,208
Why are you here?

424
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,127
The fire investigation report is out.

425
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:41,528
Fangqi and I

426
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:42,887
just returned
from the safety seminar.

427
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,567
I rushed to deliver the report to you

428
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,728
as I was afraid you needed it urgently.

429
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:47,928
You look terrible.

430
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:48,807
Didn't you get enough rest?

431
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,928
Captain Jin has been busy about rescue action,

432
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,567
and asking the fire investigation department

433
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:54,167
for the report of the nursing home.

434
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,208
He barely sleeps these days.

435
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:57,647
If he keeps straining himself,

436
00:21:57,928 --> 00:21:59,167
he'll collapse soon.

437
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:01,448
Thank you for paying

438
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,327
so much attention to this, Captain Jin.

439
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:05,448
By the way,

440
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:06,728
thanks to your guidance.

441
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:07,688
Wang Yi has agreed

442
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:08,887
to compensate the elderly lady.

443
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:10,847
Isn't this what you want to do?

444
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,248
I support everything you want to do.

445
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,327
Your speculation is correct.

446
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,087
The nursing home

447
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:20,968
should bear the primary responsibility
for this fire incident.

448
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,008
Ms. Zheng is innocent.

449
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:24,127
That's great.

450
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,248
Now Wang Yi

451
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,167
can't escape from his responsibility.

452
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,488
Thank you, Captain Jin.

453
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:31,847
This is a reward for you.

454
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:38,048
Good luck.

455
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:51,407
Xu Lai!

456
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:53,887
Why did you

457
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:54,928
send the script to other media?

458
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,208
Also,

459
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:57,448
you're a reporter.

460
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:58,327
How could you

461
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,448
publish such a subjective report
and your own speculation?

462
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,248
What are you saying?

463
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,448
You asked me?

464
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,607
You sent it out, didn't you?

465
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,327
You were eager to send it

466
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:06,167
to other self-media

467
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,288
before letting me review it.

468
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:08,288
Right here.

469
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,367
(Fire Accident of Nanxiang Nursing Home)
Read it.

470
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:09,688
(Fire Accident of Nanxiang Nursing Home)

471
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,887
The nursing home refused to help
the elderly in danger.

472
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:11,768
Scroll down.

473
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:13,647
Read the comments.

474
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,008
I found

475
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:16,127
Wang Yi's personal information.

476
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,488
Let's all send him funeral wreaths.

477
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:19,528
And this too.

478
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,688
The director is such a scumbag.

479
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:22,928
He tried to burn the old lady to death.

480
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:23,367
No.

481
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,008
I didn't send this out.

482
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:25,367
The content is altered.

483
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:26,008
I never said

484
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,327
that the nursing home refused
to save the elderly.

485
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,567
This script was sent out

486
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,127
from your IP address.

487
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,327
Who else can alter it?

488
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,968
(The nursing house is ridiculous.)

489
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:38,887
(They even tried to kill someone.)

490
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,208
(The director must be held accountable.)

491
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:40,768
(The elderly in the nursing home)

492
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:41,528
(are so pitiful.)

493
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:42,448
(Everyone, come on.)

494
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:43,728
(We mustn't)

495
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:44,048
(let this murder off easily.)

496
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:44,407
(Staying in the nursing home)

497
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:45,928
(is like entrusting
the rest of your days)

498
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,048
(to other's conscience.)

499
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:48,367
(The police must investigate this)

500
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:49,248
(and seek justice for the old people.)

501
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,327
Dear.

502
00:23:58,127 --> 00:23:58,807
Please calm down.

503
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,807
Come on. Don't scare me.

504
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:03,928
Dear.

505
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,008
I've failed you.

506
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:10,208
I've failed our child.

507
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,167
I no longer have the courage

508
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:13,448
to carry on.

509
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,607
Come down. Don't scare me.

510
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:26,647
He's emotionally unstable now.

511
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,728
Just in case,

512
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,567
Tao, and Dapeng,

513
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,208
you two flank him from both sides.

514
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:31,928
- Yes.
- Yes.

515
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:32,688
Zhang Yang.

516
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:33,528
Secure the anchor in place.

517
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:34,887
I'll go up for the rescue.

518
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,008
Make sure the air cushion
is ready downstairs.

519
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:38,448
Evacuate the residents.

520
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,288
Yes.

521
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:56,528
Don't come near.

522
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,288
Or I'll jump.

523
00:24:59,327 --> 00:24:59,807
Okay.

524
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:00,887
I won't come over.

525
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:01,968
Calm down.

526
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:03,367
Let's talk calmly.

527
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:04,448
Please calm down.

528
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:05,448
Step back.

529
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:06,528
Okay.

530
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:07,728
I'll step back.

531
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,208
Step back.

532
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,167
I've stepped back.

533
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:18,528
I'm a reporter. Where's Wang Yi?

534
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,008
Over there.

535
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:20,607
Wang Yi.

536
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,008
Wang Yi.

537
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:22,968
Don't be impulsive.

538
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,407
Come down. We can talk this out.

539
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:25,607
Why?

540
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:29,488
I've agreed to take
all the responsibility

541
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,407
and compensate Ms. Zheng.

542
00:25:34,248 --> 00:25:35,807
Why did you publish the report?

543
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:36,928
Something went wrong

544
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:37,928
with the report.

545
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:39,407
I didn't mean to publish it.

546
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:40,488
Can you please come down?

547
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:41,728
Something went wrong?

548
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,008
You wrote

549
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,407
that I stopped the caregiver
from rescuing Ms. Zheng

550
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,688
because I intended to kill her.

551
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:49,567
And you said that something went wrong.

552
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,407
I just didn't want
to take responsibility

553
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:53,448
for the fire.

554
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,847
I didn't intend to murder her.

555
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,887
You're shoving me to death.

556
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,448
Because of your report,

557
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,688
everyone thinks

558
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,087
that I'm a murderer.

559
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:06,968
No.

560
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,208
I know...

561
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:09,847
I know the fire

562
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:10,968
is an accident for you.

563
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:12,607
And I believe you didn't mean

564
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,688
to leave out Ms. Zheng.

565
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,127
Please believe in me.

566
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,407
I can rewrite the report

567
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,847
to clarify the situation to the public.

568
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:18,887
Wang Yi.

569
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,167
You still have a chance
to clear things up.

570
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,488
Please come down first.

571
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:23,488
Clear things up?

572
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:28,327
No, there's no chance anymore.

573
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:31,928
After my child is born,

574
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:34,647
everyone will think

575
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,688
that his father is a murderer.

576
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,448
How is my child going to carry on
with his life?

577
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,407
How are my wife and child

578
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:44,288
going to carry on with their lives?

579
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,528
Is this the truth

580
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
that you reporters want?

581
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:07,407
It's too late for everything now.

582
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,327
I made the mistake myself.

583
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:16,167
I'll atone for my sin.

584
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:28,887
Please don't die.

585
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:12,660
(Emergency)

586
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,448
(Xu Lai.)

587
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,887
(Because of Wang Yi's suicidal attempt)

588
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:16,968
(and his wife's pre-term labor,)

589
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,288
(the netizens are pointing fingers
at you now.)

590
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:21,127
(They accused the reporter
of publishing the article)

591
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:22,367
(to seek attention,)

592
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,928
(despite knowing that the director)

593
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,528
(was willing to take responsibility,)

594
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,127
(causing his family to fall apart.)

595
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,167
(The situation isn't favorable for you.)

596
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:31,688
(Take a few days off and rest.)

597
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,847
I'm sorry. I should've come earlier.

598
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:42,327
Liu Xu has told me everything.

599
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,248
Don't be afraid. I'm here with you.

600
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:56,607
How's Wang Yi now?

601
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:58,488
What about his wife and baby?

602
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,528
He fell from a height.

603
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,567
Although there was an air cushion
to cushion the impact,

604
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,448
the pressure has inflicted

605
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:07,647
on his body in different extent.

606
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,407
Luckily, he has been saved.

607
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:11,688
But he remains

608
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,688
in critical condition now.

609
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:13,688
We need further observation.

610
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:16,807
He might suffer the aftereffect.

611
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,087
As for his wife and baby,

612
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,048
I've asked about them.

613
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:22,208
The baby is saved.

614
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:24,448
But since it's just seven months old,

615
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:25,887
they keep it in an incubator

616
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:26,607
for further observation.

617
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:30,167
However, his wife has a terrible mental state.

618
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:55,127
Xu Lai.

619
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,087
I want some time alone.

620
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,310
(Outpatient Department)

621
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,327
Because of your report,

622
00:30:18,728 --> 00:30:19,928
Wang Yi wanted to commit suicide

623
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:21,367
and now no one takes care
of the nursing home.

624
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:24,087
What are we going to do now?

625
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:25,847
You shouldn't have meddled.

626
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,448
Old people like us have to suffer now

627
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,847
because of you.

628
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,167
Compensate our loss!

629
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:32,327
Compensate our loss!

630
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:34,928
Ms. Xu.

631
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,768
We don't blame you.

632
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:38,567
We all know

633
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,528
you sympathized with Ms. Zheng.

634
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:42,367
But we have no choice.

635
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,567
Now that the director had an accident,

636
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:45,728
and the nursing home

637
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:48,288
can't be rebuilt soon.

638
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,167
We can't just stay

639
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,208
in the temporary shelter for long.

640
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:55,607
Ms. Xu.

641
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,688
We're done.

642
00:30:59,127 --> 00:30:59,928
What should we do now?

643
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:03,327
Excuse me.

644
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:03,928
Make ways, please.

645
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:04,448
Make ways.

646
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,208
Please help us.

647
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,048
Don't go!

648
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:10,728
What should we do now?

649
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,180
(You've disgraced the profession.)

650
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,410
(Unconscionable reporter!
Get out of the TV station!)

651
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,530
(How can you be so cruel?!
Unconscionable reporter!)

652
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:39,968
It's okay.

653
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:41,367
Don't look at them.

654
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,607
I'm dirty.

655
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:11,928
I need a shower.

656
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,060
(Liar!)

657
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,887
Is this the truth

658
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:25,647
you reporters want?

659
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:26,327
(Unconscionable reporter.)

660
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:27,607
(Your report almost killed someone.)

661
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:28,127
(That's right.)

662
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:28,567
(No one knows)

663
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:29,528
(when the nursing home will be rebuilt.)

664
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,528
(What about the elderly?)

665
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:31,607
(You've disgraced the profession.)

666
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,327
(This reporter is seeking attention.)

667
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:33,807
(This is blatantly unconscionable.)

668
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:34,167
(She made baseless reports,)

669
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,127
(and caused the director
to jump off the building.)

670
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,288
(The baby is born prematurely too.)

671
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,528
Compensate our loss!

672
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:40,728
Give me back the nursing home!

673
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:06,288
Xu Lai.

674
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:07,367
Can you hear me?

675
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:12,048
Xu Lai.

676
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:13,888
Can you hear me?

677
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:58,928
You're awake.

678
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,928
You passed out

679
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,207
because you're running out of air.

680
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:09,808
Are you feeling unwell now?

681
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:12,207
Do you want to go to the hospital?

682
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:22,888
Don't be like that.

683
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:25,287
If possible,

684
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,207
I'd rather be the one suffering.

685
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,127
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,207
Don't say that.

687
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,448
Didn't we agree before?

688
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,368
No matter what difficulties we face,

689
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:47,368
we'll stand together

690
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:48,607
and solve them.

691
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,207
Let it out.

692
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:54,727
Don't keep it inside.

693
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,888
It'll feel better if you cry.

694
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,247
It's not the time to cry now.

695
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,368
I can't be brought down just like this.

696
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,687
I have many things to do.

697
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:16,567
Hug me again.

698
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:47,567
Hello.

699
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,247
Is there any new progress
on the reconstruction

700
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:51,008
of Nanxiang Nursing Home?

701
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:53,368
Thank you.

702
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:12,848
Compensate our loss!

703
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:14,687
Compensate our loss!

704
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,720
(Call for Action: Elderly People Have
Expectations for Welfare Institutions)

705
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,740
(Caring for the elderly
requires action.)

706
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:09,528
Coming.

707
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:18,207
What brings you here?

708
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:19,888
Why didn't you answer the call?

709
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:20,727
I was sleeping.

710
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:22,767
I have good news for you.

711
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:24,607
What's it about?

712
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,567
I went to the nursing home.

713
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,567
They told me the government

714
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,448
has initiated the reconstruction

715
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:30,928
of Nanxiang Nursing Home.

716
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:33,528
The elderly's care issue has been solved.

717
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,928
You can rest assured now.

718
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:35,848
Really?

719
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,567
Ms. Zheng has woken up too.

720
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,368
Let's go and visit her.

721
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,008
Let's go.

722
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,760
(Discipline)

723
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:52,528
Come on, Mighty.

724
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:53,968
Go.

725
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:55,928
Zhang Yang.

726
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:57,488
Here you are.

727
00:38:57,528 --> 00:38:58,368
I've been looking for you.

728
00:38:58,647 --> 00:38:59,048
Looking for me?

729
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:00,087
What do you want?

730
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,767
You were in the logistic before, right?

731
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,207
You were always watching

732
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:05,048
the cook there.

733
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:06,567
You must've learned a lot, right?

734
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:08,488
Yes, indeed.

735
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:09,448
What's the matter?

736
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,848
Can you teach me how to cook?

737
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:14,247
It doesn't have to be complicated.

738
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:15,928
Just a few simple home-cooked dishes.

739
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,207
Why do you suddenly
want to learn cooking?

740
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:23,167
Zang Qiu always skips meals

741
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:25,127
and she has a stomach problem.

742
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:26,848
As a responsible

743
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,567
and caring man,

744
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,287
I should learn to cook

745
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:31,408
and take good care of her.

746
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:33,968
You commit yourself to cooking

747
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,287
just because you want to impress her.

748
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,207
This is so futile.

749
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,448
All you think about is
that doctor every day.

750
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:40,647
You're a crude man.

751
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:41,528
You know nothing.

752
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:41,928
You...

753
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:42,488
Listen,

754
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,567
I'm being considerate,
attentive, and romantic.

755
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:47,167
Look at Mighty.

756
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:49,087
It's way better than you.

757
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,408
You better not end up being alone.

758
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:51,727
Not even the dogs like you.

759
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:53,767
Lu Fangqi.

760
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:54,727
Come here.

761
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:56,127
The two of you.

762
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,488
What else do I need?

763
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:04,488
Lu Fangqi.

764
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,008
I didn't expect this though.

765
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:07,448
I thought

766
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,287
we were doing this in the canteen.

767
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:11,087
I didn't expect you
to rent a restaurant.

768
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:12,408
This is the restaurant

769
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:13,727
where Zang Qiu and I first met.

770
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,247
We happened to save a customer before.

771
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,207
The owner was grateful to us.

772
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,247
The restaurant is closed today,

773
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:20,528
so I rented it.

774
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,287
How do I make
stir-fried pork with pepper?

775
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,488
Cut the green pepper.

Fang Huai.

784
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:07,008
(Martyr Fang Huai)
I'm here for you.

785
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:11,087
I never realized how fast time flies.

786
00:41:13,408 --> 00:41:14,848
The scene you gave me flowers

787
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,488
feels like it just happened yesterday.

788
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:19,488
I often think about

789
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,127
the days when we were together.

790
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,687
So, I always force myself

791
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:25,687
to get tied up with work.

792
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:29,247
So I won't think of you.

793
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:32,448
But recently,

794
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:39,008
I've realized

795
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,567
that I'm starting to forget
what you looked like.

796
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:46,928
I have to struggle

797
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,567
to recall many things

798
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:50,808
and to bring them back to me.

799
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:55,127
And that makes me realize

800
00:41:56,888 --> 00:41:58,567
that you've left for a long time.

801
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:05,408
Fang Huai.

802
00:42:06,968 --> 00:42:07,888
I'm really scared.

803
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:11,448
I'm scared that I'd forget you.

804
00:42:14,727 --> 00:42:15,448
If...

805
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:19,928
If that

806
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:21,087
really happens one day,
