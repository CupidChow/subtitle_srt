(The Safest Place Is With Captain Jin)

18
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,080
Hello.

19
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,799
(Ms. Jiang.)

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,399
(Do you still remember me?)

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,679
(Why do you know me?)

22
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,280
Do you think it's difficult

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
to find your identity?

24
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,319
Don't worry.

25
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,679
I'm not interested in you.

26
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,840
(I'm making this call today)

27
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,040
(to make a deal with you.)

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,799
What kind of deal can I make with you?

29
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,880
Think about it, Ms. Jiang.

30
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,160
What if I tell the TV station

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
that you are the one who told me

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,080
about Xu Lai's secret visit
to my factory?

33
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,920
I'm sure everyone
will be interested in it.

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,679
Are you threatening me?

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
How can you say that?

36
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,920
I'll give you the necessary materials

37
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
and you just have to report it.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,399
Isn't that simple?

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
I have a file on my table.

40
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,160
Turn it into a text file

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,959
and e-mail it to me.

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
You are going to move the whole office

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
into the hospital.

44
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,600
Am I disturbing you from resting?

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,559
No.

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,239
Actually, you don't have to stay with me every day.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't want your job to be affected because of me.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,399
Don't worry. Chief has agreed
to let me work at the hospital.

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,679
I am working on both my love life
and my career.

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,480
And I won't fail any of them.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you working on the issue of TC?

52
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,399
Yes.

53
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,119
I want to go public

54
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,160
with the truth as soon as possible.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,399
Aren't you afraid that they'll
seek revenge on you?

56
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,839
Of course I'm afraid.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
But I can't back out now.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,760
Otherwise, it'll be a humiliation
to my profession.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,920
What is it?

60
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,880
In the past, I had some misconceptions
about reporters.

61
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,760
But you've changed my mind about it.

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
I realize that there are people
in this world

63
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,760
who are willing to be the light

64
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,600
on the path of truth.

65
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,080
To light up the path for those
who are in the dark.

66
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,239
I'm not the light.

67
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm a torch.

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,160
And you are my spark.

69
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,399
Me?

70
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,239
Back then, you lighted up my world
with your presence.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
I want to be like you too

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,559
to bring light to others.

73
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,120
I never thought

74
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,399
that young girl
who was so timid in the past

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
would become so courageous now.

76
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,279
Of course.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Otherwise, how can I attract you

78
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:25,640
with my charm?

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,640
Why are you laughing?

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,880
Am I not charming?

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,440
Am I charming?

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,479
Yes.

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
Come here.

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,440
What else can I do for you?

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,000
You need to rest now and take a nap.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:45,919
Here.

87
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:54,159
Attention.

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,120
Lie down.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,080
Close your eyes.

90
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,039
Good boy.

91
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,940
(Kennel)

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,159
Have you noticed

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
that Peace's situation is getting worse?

94
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,159
He doesn't even eat now.

95
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,120
Peace has bonded with Captain Jin.

96
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm sure he misses Captain Jin.

97
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,159
Captain Jin has been
in the hospital for some time.

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,519
I miss him too.

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,640
I feel empty inside.

100
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:24,640
Have you ever thought

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
that Captain Jin may not be coming back?

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
That's impossible.

103
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,399
Captain Jin will not leave the team.

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,359
That's not a plausible hypothesis.

105
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,560
I heard that our superior
has always wanted

106
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,800
to transfer Captain Jin
to the main team.

107
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,519
I think after his sick leave is over,

108
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,120
our superior will give him
the transfer order.

109
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,240
Are you telling the truth?

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,880
(Kennel)
Why should I lie to you?

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
I personally heard it
from the commissioner.

112
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,959
Captain Jin is the backbone

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,479
of this emergency response unit.

114
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,200
If Captain Jin leaves,

115
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,680
what should we do?

116
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,880
I've been with Captain Jin the longest.

117
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,000
I know him.

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,359
He received a lot of offers
to be promoted in the past.

119
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,080
But he rejected them all.

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,200
Don't worry.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,839
He won't leave us behind.

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,719
I think it's good for him

123
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,919
to be promoted to the main team.

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
People from his batch

125
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,279
have been promoted faster than him

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,599
although they are not as good as him.

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,599
But he keeps staying here.

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
You are right.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,719
No matter what Captain Jin chooses,

130
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,760
we'll support him, right?

131
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,919
How about we pay him a visit

132
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,519
within the next two days?

133
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,479
- Sure.
- Sure.

134
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,240
Right?

135
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,200
Is it for Captain Jin

136
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,760
or for that female doctor?

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,320
I'm being sincere.

138
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,120
Captain Jin is all I think about, okay?

139
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,240
I think all you think about

140
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,719
is to pursue someone
who's out of your league.

141
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,800
What did you say?

142
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,120
Are you mad?

143
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,839
Go over there. I'll go here.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,479
She's out of your league!

145
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,519
She's out of your league!

146
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,900
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)

147
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,519
Do you need to talk to me?

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
During the surgery that day,

149
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,479
I found out that the trauma
to your left leg

150
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,159
might be more serious than you thought.

151
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:01,959
I need to run some tests on it.

152
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,560
Have you ever felt numb on your leg?

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,839
No.

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,039
Have you ever lost feeling in your leg?

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,560
No.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
My left leg was injured before this.

157
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,839
But it was a minor injury.

158
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,880
It's not painful anymore.

159
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,039
I think it has almost healed.
I'll be fine.

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Not being able to feel the pain
is not necessarily a good thing.

161
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,959
Why didn't you get yourself checked
at the hospital?

162
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,919
You were extremely irresponsible to yourself.

163
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,640
Do you know that?

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,719
Besides, people in your line of work

165
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,080
are prone to injuries.

166
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
You should take this more seriously.

167
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,479
I'll give the fire station
your medical certificate.

168
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,880
Do not go anywhere until I have

169
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,080
the test results.

170
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,680
Take good care of yourself

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,279
so that you can take care
of others, okay?

172
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,399
Thank you.

173
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,479
You don't have to thank me.

174
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,300
(Inpatient Department)

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,560
Why are you still here?

176
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,120
It's past visiting hours.

177
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,920
I can't bear to leave you.

178
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,599
What if the nurse saw you?

179
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,320
I sneaked in. No one saw me.

180
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,560
Are you sure you sneaked in?

181
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,959
Are you sure no one saw you?

182
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,599
Yes.

183
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,680
Impossible.

184
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,479
It's true.

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,839
Your leg.

186
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
That was so scary.

187
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:25,959
Stop laughing.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,759
The nurse is gone now.

189
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,440
Your heart is beating so fast.

190
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:34,959
I know.

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,800
Get down from the bed.

192
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,560
No.

193
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,320
When Zang Qiu comes here later

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,320
and sees you like this,

195
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,280
she won't scold you. She'll scold me.

196
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,520
I want to be with you.

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,440
Be good.

198
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,200
Get off the bed.

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,520
Xu Lai.

200
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,080
Xu Lai.

201
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:21,400
Hurry up.

202
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,119
It's going to fall.

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,280
What...

204
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,440
At first, I thought
that we brought too many things.

205
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,599
Looks like we didn't bring enough things.

206
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,959
Captain Jin is amazing.

207
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,719
He's so badly hurt.

208
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,160
What we need to do now

209
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,959
is not to disturb them.
We didn't see anything. Be careful.

210
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,479
Retreat.

211
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,479
Are you here, patient on bed No. 24?

212
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,239
Time to change your wound dressing.

213
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll get going now.

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,359
Come out. I have to go to work now.

215
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,400
Take care of him.

216
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:11,920
Captain Jin.

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,280
Get well soon.

218
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,119
Have a good rest.

219
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,999
We've brought you some fruits

220
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,440
and supplements.

221
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,040
We...

222
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,440
She was just here to visit me.

223
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,440
If you tell anyone about this,

224
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,160
I'll block you.

225
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,440
Roger that.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,759
We understand.
Call us if you need anything.

227
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,320
We'll get going now, Captain Jin.

228
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Let's go.

229
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,920
This news report is fantastic.

230
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,160
Once TC's illegal production chain is exposed,

231
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,759
people will start
paying attention to it.

232
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,040
Finally, your effort will not go to waste.

233
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:56,920
You are amazing.

234
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,119
I can only do this because of someone.

235
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,999
I have to thank him.

236
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,400
You are talking
about Captain Jin, right?

237
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:07,719
By the way,

238
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,560
does anyone else know about this

239
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,639
other than you?

240
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,479
Ms. Jiang Xin knows about it too.

241
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,800
Jiang Xin?

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
How does she know?

243
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,599
I told you to keep this

244
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,359
a secret from everyone, right?

245
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,080
She mentioned it first.

246
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,479
According to her, you told her about it.

247
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Impossible.

248
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,599
You put a lot of efforts into the TC case, right?

249
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,959
You are the one who has been investigating
the TC case, right?

250
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,359
What has it got to do with me?

251
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,440
How do you know that I'm investigating TC?

252
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,040
It's not that hard to find out.

253
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,239
I still have a report to write.

254
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Stop wasting my time here.

255
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
Zhou.

256
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,599
We need to be on our guard against Jiang Xin.

257
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,479
She must be the one who tipped off TC

258
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,479
about the investigation in advance.

259
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,599
I'll deal with her
after I'm done with this.

260
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Based on my investigation,

261
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,639
TC has an illegal production chain.

262
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,759
After they recycle a lot of old parts,

263
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,479
they do OEM processing on them

264
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,119
and turn them
into new mobile refrigerators.

265
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,119
Then, they are sold into the market
on a large scale.

266
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
All these years,

267
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,119
TC has been using

268
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,080
this way to cut down the production time and cost,

269
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,080
to monopolize our city's home appliance market
in a short time.

270
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,680
And they plan
to become a listed company this year.

271
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,759
In my opinion, this exposure not only

272
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,639
will give a warning to those who want

273
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,599
take the shortcut to success,

274
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,639
it can also reinstate the business ethics

275
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,719
and set up the right value
for all the enterprises.

276
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,599
Xu Lai.

277
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,440
This news report

278
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,879
is marvelous.

279
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
Hard evidence and strong arguments.

280
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,520
Well done.

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,680
Chief.

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,040
We don't have a main topic

283
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,320
for this current issue.

284
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,359
How about we use Xu Lai's report
as the main topic?

285
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
That's what I'm thinking too.

286
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,920
It's set then.

287
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,520
Xu Lai.

288
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,959
We'll use your report

289
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,879
as the main topic for this issue, okay?

290
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,680
Thank you, Chief.

291
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,040
Xu Lai.

292
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,040
I've read your news report.

293
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:35,800
It's great.

294
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:36,839
Congratulations.

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,839
(I need to thank you instead.)

296
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,119
If it wasn't for your help,

297
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,680
I wouldn't have been able

298
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,680
to get the result so quickly.

299
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,440
I happen to be in the vicinity
of the TV station.

300
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:45,959
How about we have a meal together?

301
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
You can thank me in person.

302
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,119
But I'm on my way
to take care of Jin Shichuan.

303
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,080
(And my ride is already here.)

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,639
(After Jin Shichuan is discharged,)

305
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
(I'll treat you to a fancy meal.)

306
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,400
(What do you think?)

307
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:58,520
Sure.

308
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,839
(Okay. Bye.)

309
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,740
(Inpatient Department)

310
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,680
(I'll be at the hospital soon.)

311
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,440
(Wait for me.)

312
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,520
Patient on bed No. 24.

313
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,920
Your drip time is up.

314
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,599
Your IV therapy has ended.

315
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,959
Now, you need to rest on the bed.

316
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,160
Don't go anywhere.

317
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,280
I feel like my leg

318
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,839
has almost recovered.

319
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,959
It doesn't feel painful anymore.

320
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,560
You still have to rest
even if it's not in pain.

321
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:52,999
The female reporter
who visits you at the hospital

322
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,800
every day is your girlfriend, right?

323
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,239
Yes.

324
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,839
She's quite pretty.

325
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,200
Xu Lai.

326
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,800
Doctor Zang.

327
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,400
You are here.

328
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,119
Now, I can tell you

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,719
that Zhao Li has received
the compensation.

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,719
I just finished transferring her
to another hospital.

331
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,119
She can go
to the provincial hospital now

332
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
to get better treatments.

333
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,119
That's great.

334
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,479
Thank you, Doctor Zang.

335
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,200
She asked me to thank you.

336
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,119
You've helped her a lot this time.

337
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,239
It's just my job.

338
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,479
I'm happy to help.

339
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,800
Jin Shichuan is fortunate to have you.

340
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,280
Are you okay?

341
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,999
I'll go up now.

342
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,119
Okay.

343
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,119
Why are you down here?

344
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:13,520
Is your leg okay?

345
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
I think you are right

346
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,960
about my leg.

347
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,439
Walk slowly.

348
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,599
Where did you go?

349
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,240
Why weren't you in your room?

350
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,679
I just came back from doing some tests.

351
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,080
And I ran into Zang Qiu.

352
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,240
Be careful.

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,760
What's the result of your medical test?

354
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,080
I'm making a good recovery.

355
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,320
They have just finished
dressing up my wound.

356
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,199
He's doing well.

357
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,399
Really?

358
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,679
Yes.

359
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,639
If you don't believe me,
I can show you.

360
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:04,679
Can you walk?

361
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:05,800
Of course I can.

362
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,839
Come back now.

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,439
Okay.

364
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:30,760
Even if you have recovered well,

365
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,399
you can't simply move around.

366
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,119
Rest well.

367
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,119
Don't worry.

368
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll take good care of him.

369
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:46,320
Be careful.

370
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:49,879
By the way,

371
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:50,960
have you watched the television?

372
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,439
My news report is now the main topic

373
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,639
of our special bulletin.

374
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,399
And TC's illegal production chain

375
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,919
is now a hot topic online.

376
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,800
Sun Lei will face
multiple charges as well.

377
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:05,919
Am I amazing?

378
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,040
Doctor Zang.

379
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,879
Jin Shichuan's medical test report is out.

380
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,599
It's late now.

381
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,480
You should go back and rest.

382
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,599
Do you want to rest now?

383
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,040
It's dark outside.

384
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,480
I'm worried that it'll be unsafe
for you outside.

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,879
Are you chasing me out?

386
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,599
For me, I'm the safest

387
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,919
when I'm with you.

388
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,480
With you here, you'll protect me.

389
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
I can't protect you forever.

390
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,919
What do you mean?

391
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,839
My leg is injured.

392
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,199
If something happens to you,

393
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,520
I can't protect you.

394
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,119
What will you do then?

395
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
You are Captain Jin.

396
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,159
Besides, many people are waiting for you.

397
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,199
Don't overthink this.

398
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,839
You have to get well soon.

399
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,040
You have to promise me one thing then.

400
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,159
Don't make me worry.

401
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,159
Go home now.

402
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,240
No.

403
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:01,919
I want to spend more time with you.

404
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,919
Okay now.

405
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,879
It's time.

406
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,399
What did you promise me?

407
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,240
I want to spend more time with you.

408
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,399
Be good.

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,560
Okay.

410
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,320
I'll get going now.

411
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,359
Put on your jacket. It's cold outside.

412
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:06,599
Okay.

413
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,359
Have a good rest.
I'll visit you tomorrow.

414
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,240
Bye.

415
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,599
You really can't simply
move around anymore.

416
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,119
The test result is out.

417
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,639
Your knee joint is suffering

418
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,639
from a blunt popliteal injury
due to external trauma.

419
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,679
It has turned into
a popliteal artery aneurysm.

420
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,679
You need to get under the knife
as soon as possible.

421
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,879
When can I undergo
the surgery the soonest?

422
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,599
It'll be a difficult surgery.

423
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,439
We are still discussing
the best operation plan for you.

424
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,520
I'll do my best to speed things up.

425
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,520
Don't tell Xu Lai about this.

426
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,439
Do you plan to keep it
a secret from her?

427
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,679
If the operation is successful,

428
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,879
I'll tell her about it.

429
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,399
I don't want her to worry.

430
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,399
If the operation is unsuccessful,

431
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,639
I won't be able to protect her.

432
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,359
I don't want to be a burden to her.

433
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,480
Okay.

434
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,480
I'll keep this a secret.

435
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,599
Thank you.

436
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,679
I'm only keeping it a secret

437
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,560
because I'm a doctor.

438
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,439
I have to respect

439
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
my patient's choice.

440
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:53,320
It doesn't mean

441
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,480
that I think you are
doing the right thing.

442
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,240
Have a good rest.

443
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
After the special bulletin
was broadcasted,

444
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:15,159
it has grabbed the attention

445
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,280
of the community.

446
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,119
Many applauded the excellence
of this news report.

447
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,080
Not only has it increased

448
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,119
our influence over society,

449
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:24,800
we have dutifully played our role

450
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,159
in shining a light on society.

451
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,800
TC is facing multiple charges now,

452
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,960
and the victims
will receive the compensation

453
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
they deserve.

454
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,480
All of you have worked hard.

455
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,639
This news report has finally come to an end.

456
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,720
Chief.

457
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,199
I don't think this is the end.

458
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,439
I received an anonymous e-mail.

459
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,159
There are many voice recordings
in the attachments

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,599
that are related to this news report.

461
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,599
(I'm a businessman.
I only care about profits and gains.)

462
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:59,919
(I'm asking you these questions)

463
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,800
(just in case.)

464
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,119
(So that I'll know what to do)

465
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,960
(if something happens in the future.)

466
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,480
(After all,)

467
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,040
(we are in the same boat.)

468
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,159
(We share the same gains.)

469
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,399
Mr. Huo.

470
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,240
This voice recording proves

471
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,119
that Huo Yanzong has always known

472
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,960
and was in acquiescence
about TC's illegal production.

473
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,439
Now that everything is exposed,

474
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,800
he's in a rush to pull out from TC

475
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,919
to save himself.

476
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:27,839
Ridiculous.

477
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
He didn't take part in TC's illegal production.

478
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,240
Chief.

479
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,720
That time, Huo Yanzong just wanted

480
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,720
to get the information for me.

481
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:34,760
How can you prove that?

482
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,199
What if Huo Yanzong

483
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
was just acting in front of you

484
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,119
to deny his relationship with TC.

485
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,800
Jiang Xin.

486
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,199
Why are you

487
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,839
playing this voice recording at this time?

488
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,520
Chief.

489
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,080
I hope that our station

490
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,639
will uphold our principle
of respecting the truth

491
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,839
and expose Huo Yanzong.

492
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:53,599
Chief.

493
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,639
Please believe in me.

494
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,919
I can vouch for Huo Yanzong.

495
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,720
He's not someone like that.

496
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:58,720
Xu Lai.

497
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,520
Everyone knows

498
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,280
your relationship with Huo Yanzong.

499
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,879
You know very well whether or not

500
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,240
you are just being selfish
for stopping us

501
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,399
from exposing this voice recording.

502
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,119
I heard that other media companies have received

503
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,080
this anonymous e-mail too.

504
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:13,159
If other media companies

505
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,960
expose this voice recording first,

506
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,359
the public will suspect us

507
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,439
for covering up the truth on purpose,

508
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,240
because we want to collaborate

509
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,359
with Yunkai Group.

510
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,960
And Sun Lei is just the scapegoat.

511
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,199
If it negatively impacts our station,

512
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,639
can you bear the responsibility for it?

513
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,159
That's right.

514
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,839
It won't be good for us.

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,839
Jiang Xin is right.

516
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,439
If other media companies

517
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,000
broadcast this voice recording

518
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,280
before us,

519
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,639
our station will be criticized.

520
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,919
We need to stay objective and just.

521
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,240
Jiang Xin.

522
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,280
You'll be in charge
of the next news report.

523
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,639
Okay. The meeting is adjourned.

524
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,000
Ms. Xu.

525
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
You have always been calm.

526
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,199
But you were too emotional just now.

527
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,839
I can't let my friend
suffer this injustice

528
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,119
because of me.

529
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,679
You got the voice recording
from Sun Lei, right?

530
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,679
I don't know what you are talking about.

531
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,199
You know clearly what I'm talking about.

532
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,359
Back then, you suggested using my report

533
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:18,879
in the special bulletin,

534
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
because you were waiting
for this day, right?

535
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,800
It has already come to this.

536
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:26,720
Even if I admit

537
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,960
that I'm working with Sun Lei,

538
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:29,960
you can't change anything.

539
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,520
No. Why are you doing this?

540
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,240
Xu Lai.

541
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,040
I already warned you

542
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,080
not to underestimate your opponent.

543
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,080
Otherwise, you'll pay for it

544
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
like today.

545
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,839
But you are not the one

546
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,280
paying for it.

547
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,879
Your friend, Huo Yanzong,
is the one who'll pay.

548
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,520
Right?

549
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,679
Mr. Huo is out.

550
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,320
He's out.

551
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,720
He's out.

552
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,679
Mr. Huo.

553
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,119
What do you have to say

554
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,679
about the voice recording?

555
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,080
Is it true?

556
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,119
Have you always known

557
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,199
about TC's illegal production chain?

558
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,159
Are you the one

559
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
behind TC's illegal production chain?

560
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,000
Mr. Huo.

561
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,560
I heard that you are close to Ms. Xu

562
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,040
who investigated TC.

563
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,800
Is that why you pulled out quickly

564
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,560
from TC to stay clear from them

565
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,679
after their illegal production chain

566
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,639
is exposed?

567
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,359
Ms. Xu and I are just friends.

568
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:36,760
She is a good reporter.

569
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,960
Without her perseverance,

570
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
TC's illegal production chain

571
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,879
wouldn't have been exposed
in such a short time.

572
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,359
I remember that you are

573
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,639
from the same TV station
as Ms. Xu.

574
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,320
You should learn from her

575
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,040
and work
on your professional proficiency

576
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,720
instead of

577
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
making groundless accusations.

578
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,359
Don't simply believe those rumors.

579
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,560
As for your questions,

580
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,839
our company will give you

581
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
a clear explanation.

582
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,000
Thank you.

583
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,240
- Mr. Huo.
- Mr. Huo.

584
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,399
Mr. Huo, say something.

585
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,960
- Mr. Huo.
- Mr. Huo.

586
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,599
You were too emotional just now.

587
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,080
You didn't have to answer that female reporter.

588
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,839
You've responded directly

589
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,560
to the question on Xu Lai.

590
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
It'll be used against you.

591
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,199
Xu Lai is dragged into this.

592
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:27,720
How can I stay calm?

593
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,599
What should we do next?

594
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,159
The current share price of Yunkai Group

595
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,919
has been severely affected.

596
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,040
The open price for today

597
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,119
has dropped drastically.

598
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,760
All of the shareholders

599
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,359
are unhappy with you.

600
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,040
The authority has contacted our legal department

601
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,599
to give them relevant information
about our company.

602
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,800
They say
that we are under investigation.

603
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,439
Should we hold a press conference
to clear things up?

604
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,960
No.

605
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,839
It'll only show

606
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,720
that we are trying to hide something.

607
00:29:59,399 --> 00:29:59,919
Turn back.

608
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:01,399
Where are we going?

609
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,359
To the clubhouse.

610
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,199
Send an invitation to Sun Lei.

611
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,280
(I remember that you are)

612
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:14,399
(from the same TV station
as Ms. Xu.)

613
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
(You should learn from her)

614
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,359
(and work
on your professional proficiency)

615
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:18,960
(instead of)

616
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,280
(making groundless accusations.)

617
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,159
Hello, Huo.

618
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,639
Sorry. I was busy just now.

619
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,119
I just saw your messages.

620
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,439
I'm the one who should apologize.

621
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,480
I've dragged you into this.

622
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:36,399
Are you free?

623
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,520
I want to talk to you in person.

624
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Now is not the time for us to meet.

625
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
I'll take care of the voice recording.

626
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,639
(Don't worry.)

627
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,980
(All Recordings)

628
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,740
(Send to Huo Yanzong)

629
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:06,879
Huo.

630
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,399
This is the voice recording
that I've gotten today.

631
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,599
I hope that can help you.

632
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,159
Mr. Huo, Mr. Sun is here.

633
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,159
Okay.

634
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Yesterday, you couldn't wait

635
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
to stay clear of me.

636
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,879
Why did you set up

637
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:32,800
this meeting with me today?

638
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,480
I've set up this meeting today

639
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,480
to make a deal with you.

640
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,359
Mr. Huo.

641
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,960
I thought

642
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,359
that I was just an abandoned pawn.

643
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,800
Tell me. What's the deal?

644
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,520
I want you to clarify in public

645
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,679
that Yunkai Group and I

646
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,919
know nothing about TC's illegal production.

647
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,439
In exchange,

648
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,359
we will not pull out from your company.

649
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,560
Before this, you kicked me away

650
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:06,720
right after you used me.

651
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,240
Now that you are in trouble,

652
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,280
you remember me again.

653
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,520
You and I both know

654
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,080
that you made
the voice recording go public

655
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,760
because you wanted to drag me down with you.

656
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,639
TC is in huge trouble now.

657
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,480
If it loses the investment from Yunkai Group,

658
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,839
we know what will happen to TC.

659
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,159
I'm sure I don't need to teach you

660
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,199
how to seize the opportunity, right?

661
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,439
Why should I believe you?

662
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,439
Business is business.

663
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,520
In the face of the interests,

664
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,159
there's no such thing
as eternal enemies.

665
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,560
Now, I need to eliminate

666
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,760
the negative impact on Yunkai Group.

667
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,879
And you

668
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,960
are in urgent need of our investment.

669
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,639
Our interests are aligned, right?

670
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:02,639
Okay.

671
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,119
I'll do that for you.

672
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:46,480
Look at what

673
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,240
I've brought for you.

674
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,560
You are here.

675
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
What are you thinking?

676
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,480
Let me take a look at you.

677
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,199
Why do you look more and more haggard

678
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,399
although you are resting every day?

679
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,679
Looks like you

680
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,119
need to get well soon

681
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,280
and go back to the station
to train your team.

682
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,440
You haven't taken your medicine yet?

683
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,360
Not yet.

684
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,520
By the way, about the news report on TC...

685
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you okay?

686
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,799
I'll get the burn relief cream for you.

687
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,159
Are you in pain?

688
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,719
It's okay.

690
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,719
Just now, you said

691
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,599
that you brought me
something good, right?

692
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,560
Meat bun.

693
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,759
Can you get it for me?

694
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:47,880
Okay?

695
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,880
This meat bun is delicious.

696
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,560
I had to queue
for a long time to get it.

697
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,920
How long did you queue for it?

698
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,159
Two hours.

699
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:05,040
Let me give it a taste.

700
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,319
I can feed myself.

701
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,520
Why are you here?

702
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,639
I think

703
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,960
I can't feel my leg anymore today.

704
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,880
What's the worst that can happen?

705
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:45,880
Disability.

706
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,360
Can it be treated?

707
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,840
If you want to ask something, go ahead.

708
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,719
No. I don't understand.

709
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,840
Why aren't you pulling out from TC?

710
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,080
Aren't you afraid that Sun Lei

711
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,880
will latch on to you?

712
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,920
I'm not afraid
that he'll latch on to me.

713
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:48,360
I just don't want to
let him off the hook.

714
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,599
What do you mean?

715
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,799
The reporter
who asked the question today

716
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,480
is called Jiang Xin.

717
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,480
She holds a grudge against Xu Lai.

718
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,000
Jiang Xin.

719
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,759
(You got the voice recording
from Sun Lei, right?)

720
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,639
(I don't know
what you are talking about.)

721
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,159
(You know clearly
what I'm talking about.)

722
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,159
(Back then,
you suggested using my report)

723
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:18,799
(in the special bulletin,)

724
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
(because you were waiting
for this day, right?)

725
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,319
(Even if I admit)

726
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,840
(that I'm working with Sun Lei,)

727
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,679
(you can't change anything.)

728
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,400
(No. Why are you doing this?)

729
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,279
(What did Sun Lei offer you?)

730
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,960
I got this from Xu Lai.

731
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,920
Jiang Xin got the voice recording

732
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,440
between me and Sun Lei from Sun Lei.

733
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:41,319
Their goal is to drag Xu Lai into this.

734
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,520
They want to seek revenge.

735
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,759
I warned Sun Lei about it.

736
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,279
But he still dragged Xu Lai into this.

737
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:53,080
So, he can't blame me
for what I'll do next.

738
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,080
No wonder.

739
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,840
So, you are doing this for Xu Lai again.

740
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,920
Let's go.

741
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,159
Let the three of us get together
at our usual place.

742
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,560
No.

743
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,920
Everyone is skeptical

744
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
about my relationship with her.

745
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,599
If I make contact with her now,

746
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,880
someone like Jiang Xin

747
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,319
will use it against us.

748
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,599
What are you afraid of?

749
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,199
We have a decoy.

750
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,040
What decoy?

751
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:30,759
Why aren't we in a private room?

752
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,400
Don't you know that our photos

753
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,560
will be taken
if we sit together in public?

754
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,360
That's what I want.

755
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,400
If we sit in a private room,

756
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,199
it'll defeat the purpose of this meal.

757
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:41,799
Did you ask me out

758
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
so that the paparazzi
can take photos of us?

759
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,239
We agreed to act
like a couple in public.

760
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,759
Please cooperate with me.

761
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,080
Okay.

762
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
I'll put on my best show today.

763
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,560
Baby.

764
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,159
Feed me.

765
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,239
What did you say?

766
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,639
I'm full now.

767
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,520
Please finish

768
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,279
the rest for me.

769
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,920
Don't waste any food.

770
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Wait.

771
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,480
You love spicy food.

772
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,480
Don't cross the line.

773
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,319
Baby.

774
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,040
Are you mad at me?

775
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:18,440
Baby.

776
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,679
Stay over at my place tonight.

777
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,920
I only agreed to put on an act for you.

778
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Don't try to take advantage of me.

779
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,319
Don't ever think about it.

780
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,719
We'll stay away from each other

781
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:32,520
after you get off the car.

782
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,279
Do we have to go that far?

783
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,840
If we don't,

784
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,000
it couldn't create the effect I want.

785
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
What effect do you want?

786
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,080
You don't have to know about that.

787
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,480
You just need to cooperate with me

788
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,799
and do your best to put on this show.

789
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,319
Stop the car.

790
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,199
I said, stop the car!

791
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,080
What's wrong?

792
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,279
Huo.

793
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,840
You are asking me for a favor now.

794
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,920
Are you going to tell me
the truth or not?

795
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:40,599
Fine.

796
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,239
Someone is trying to frame me and Xu Lai.

797
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:46,880
To protect her,

798
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:47,719
I can only use you

799
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,960
to divert the attention from her.

800
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,360
So, you are using me as a shield
for that reporter?

801
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,279
