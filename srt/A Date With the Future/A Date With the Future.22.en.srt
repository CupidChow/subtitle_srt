(Xu Lai Blocked Me)

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,030
I officially announce

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,920
that Xu Lai and I are dating.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,390
Starting today,

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,870
you can call her sister-in-law.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,510
Sister-in-law?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,950
Sister-in-law!

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,670
Sister-in-law!

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,920
We've got a sister-in-law.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,230
Sister-in-law!

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,670
Sister-in-law!

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,030
Attention!

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,510
Left turn!

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,990
Forward march!

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,480
Han Fang.

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,990
I'm talking to you.

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,830
Go on.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,990
I said Jin Shichuan and I reconciled.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,920
For how long this time?

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,710
Not everyone is like you.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,710
We've agreed that we're never going to

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,790
break up anymore.

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,320
Do you think Jin Shichuan is the one?

44
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,270
Of course.

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,990
Jin Shichuan is the one I must marry.

46
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,200
Furthermore,

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,990
he told me I'm his family.

48
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,320
Family.

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,950
Anyway,

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
this is also

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,110
my ultimate goal in finding a husband.

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,440
Hello.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,830
All right.

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,390
I'll be there.

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,390
I have some work.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,950
I'm leaving now.

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,360
Talk to you again.

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,990
You heard everything.

59
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,830
As your friend,

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,320
I asked you out to...

61
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,880
Han Fang.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
I don't feel like talking now.

63
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,590
Did you build all these?

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
This will be

65
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,710
our secret hideout in the future.

66
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,720
(Xu Lai's Hut)

67
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,350
Mr. Han.

68
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,080
Is Mr. Huo not in again?

69
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,240
Not yet.

70
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,880
I'll leave this to you.

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Hello, Xu Lai.

72
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,590
Huo doesn't seem right these few days.

73
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,760
(He didn't come to work)

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
(and his phone is off too.)

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
(I can't reach him.)

76
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,560
Got it.

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,240
(Hello.)

78
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,150
(The subscriber you dialed is power off.)

79
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,510
(The subscriber you dialed is power off.)

80
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,910
Huo!

81
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,760
Hello.

82
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,590
You're finally answering my call.

83
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,590
I was out on duty just now.

84
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,320
I couldn't check my phone.

85
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,710
Is there anything?

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm at Huo's place.

87
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,200
He did not answer any calls.

88
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,270
I'm worried.

89
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,000
(I was going to ask you to come too)

90
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,470
(but you didn't answer your phone.)

91
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,590
(So I came alone.)

92
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,680
Do you need me there?

93
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,640
It's okay.

94
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,760
You've been busy.

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,830
I'll just wait for a while.

96
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,680
If he's not back yet,

97
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,560
I'll just go back.

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,150
(Take care and be safe.)

99
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,440
(Let me know when you are back at home.)

100
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,030
I saw a very beautiful dress

101
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,760
when I was shopping today.

102
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,030
There were tassels on it,

103
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,390
you know?

104
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:49,910
Is it so?

105
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,150
What do you want today?

106
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,080
Anything.

107
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,080
The usual.

108
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,880
Is my ring pretty?

109
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,200
It is.

110
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,320
Shishi.

111
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Isn't that your boyfriend?

112
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,710
Why is he drinking alone?

113
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,240
Did you both get in a fight?

114
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,710
Let him be.

115
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,640
It has nothing to do with me.

116
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,280
(Han Fang)

117
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,560
What is it?

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,350
Have you seen Huo Yanzong?

119
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,880
(I can't reach him.)

120
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
(I'm still looking for him.)

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,950
Why are you calling me then?

122
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
I have nothing to do with him.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,870
All right.

124
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,400
Come on.

125
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,350
Why are you not drinking?

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,280
Mr. Huo.

127
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Mr. Huo, are you all right?

128
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Do you need someone

129
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,680
to send you back?

130
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,750
Mr. Huo.

131
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,110
Mr. Huo.

132
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,590
Are you all right?

133
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
It's fine. I got this.

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,470
Leave this to me.

135
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,200
You care so much about him

136
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,110
but you pretend you don't.

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,950
Why is it that

138
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,350
every time I see you, you're drunk?

139
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,710
Are you a drunkard?

140
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,520
Huo Yanzong. Wake up.

141
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,630
Get up.

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Huo Yanzong. Wake up.

143
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,320
Get up.

144
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,470
Why are you here?

145
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,470
I want to know

146
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,710
why am I here too.

147
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,040
By this time,

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,230
I should be drinking and having fun

149
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,440
with my friends.

150
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,870
I didn't expect to send a drunkard home.

151
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,440
Do you think I like it?

152
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,110
Leave me at the side of the road.

153
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,160
I'll get a taxi home.

154
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,470
Forget it.

155
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,470
You are my boyfriend now.

156
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,520
If you get into trouble,

157
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,710
I will lose face too.

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,590
Just be here quietly.

159
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,800
We'll be home soon.

160
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,440
Huo. Where are you?

161
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Everyone is worried about you.

162
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,560
Call me back.

163
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,990
What's wrong?

164
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,110
Did you get dumped again?

165
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,830
The CEO of Yunkai Group

166
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,990
is having a one-sided love.

167
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,920
What a joke.

168
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,320
Are you leaving just like that?

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,680
Not even a thank you?

170
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
Thanks for sending me home.

171
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,400
Is that all?

172
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,280
You're heartless.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,080
I shouldn't have wasted my time on you.

174
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,830
Why did you act cool

175
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,520
and get warm all of a sudden?

176
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,630
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,400
Sorry for what?

178
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,230
Go home.

179
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,990
Drive safe.

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,230
Why are you here?

181
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,830
Why are you dressed so differently today?

182
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,560
It's unlike you.

183
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,830
How was it over there?

184
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,110
Over there?

185
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,560
Huo Yanzong?

186
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,200
He's with Yu Shishi.

187
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,750
They look good together.

188
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,110
I think I was overthinking.

189
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,350
But now, I can relax.

190
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,800
That's great.

191
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,040
Are you jealous

192
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,920
because I went to find Huo Yanzong

193
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,200
late at night?

194
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,080
No.

195
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,950
Is that why you're waiting for me here?

196
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,440
No.

197
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:28,950
Yes, you are.

198
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,750
No.

199
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,470
You are.

200
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,870
Let's hug.

201
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,320
Are you tired?

202
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,630
I have been on duty the whole day,

203
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm exhausted.

204
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,830
I need you to recharge my energy.

205
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,590
In that case,

206
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll give you a full charge.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm done recharging,

208
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,280
I'll go home first.

209
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm leaving.

210
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,440
I am really leaving.

211
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,440
Go.

212
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,950
Be safe.

213
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
It's very cool.

214
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,750
(At this moment,)

215
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,160
(I feel bad and loved at the same time)

216
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,040
(watching Jin Shichuan's back.)

217
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,560
(I feel bad that he had a hard day.)

218
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,350
(I feel loved)

219
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,350
(because he still thought about me)

220
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,920
(and even came to see me.)

221
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,400
(Perhaps,)

222
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,110
(this is the gentleness
specific to him.)

223
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
(A strong man's gentle love)

224
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,680
(is especially moving.)

225
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,110
(As I watch his back)

226
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,630
(fade into the night,)

227
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,350
(my heart also melts with)

228
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
(this beautiful night.)

229
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,780
(Dear Customer.
Your monthly benefit is...)

230
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,750
What is wrong with him?

231
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,830
He just kissed me and left.

232
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,520
Could it be...

233
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,110
Is he feeling shy

234
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,870
and waiting for me to make a move?

235
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,630
You've made your move so many times.

236
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Another move?

237
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,560
We're celebrities.

238
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
Can you please

239
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,590
show your dignity as a celebrity?

240
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,080
What's wrong with being celebrities?

241
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,560
Aren't celebrities humans too?

242
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,390
A celebrity's happiness is in her hands.

243
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,080
Sure.

244
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,110
As long as you're happy.

245
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,150
Why are you here?

246
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,040
Is there something?

247
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,870
Yes.

248
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,800
I think you're missing me.

249
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
You're pressing on my documents.

250
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,000
Well...

251
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't you have anything to say

252
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,480
about what happened last time?

253
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,190
What happened last time?

254
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,720
Did you forget already?

255
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,280
That day...

256
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,670
At your house...

257
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,870
You kissed me.

258
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,560
That was a reason for that.

259
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,870
Don't overthink.

260
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,430
Mr. Huo.

261
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,150
Don't you think your behaviour

262
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,240
is beyond the limits of a friend?

263
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,630
Of course.

264
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
I can understand.

265
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,720
Not many men

266
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
can resist a woman like me.

267
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,520
Don't worry.

268
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm one of them.

269
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
I need an explanation!

270
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,520
Do you want to hear the truth?

271
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,560
Of course.

272
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,630
I used you.

273
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,630
You used me?

274
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,000
What do you mean?

275
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,630
You don't have to know.

276
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,630
I'll admit.

277
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,390
I overdid it.

278
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,910
Besides that,

279
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,480
don't have any expectations.

280
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,080
Huo Yanzong.

281
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,110
You're a jerk.

282
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,320
Shishi.

283
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,280
Huo Yanzong said he was using me.

284
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,830
What is he using me for?

285
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,760
You should ask Huo Yanzong.

286
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,630
Why are you asking me?

287
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,630
You're with him every day.

288
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm sure you know.

289
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,350
Are you telling me or not?

290
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm telling you.

291
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,810
I, Han Fang, am loyal to friends.

292
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,590
I won't do anything
to betray my brothers.

293
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,350
I'm not telling you
even if you beat me to death.

294
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,870
What is it?

295
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,720
Mr. Han.

296
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,760
You should know
that you're a player by name, right?

297
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,870
What do you think

298
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,117
people will say when they see this

299
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,080
after I called for help?

300
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,910
Moreover,

301
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,800
there are cameras all around.

302
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,350
Help...

303
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll tell you.

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Huo is using you

305
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,110
to keep Xu Lai from worrying,

306
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,800
so he could remain friends with her.

307
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,430
Are you telling the truth?

308
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,830
A missing person has been found.

309
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,320
I've been busy with work lately.

310
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,590
I want to take a break

311
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,910
so I turned my phone off.

312
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,800
I just saw your message.

313
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,520
You should really go on a vacation.

314
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,040
By the way,

315
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,630
don't you have something
to talk to me about?

316
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,430
What is it?

317
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,080
Nothing.

318
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,080
I just wanted to know
if you're all right.

319
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,630
You can still care about me now.

320
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
Do you have time tonight?

321
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,240
Let's have dinner.

322
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,960
Ask Jin Shichuan too.

323
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll ask Shishi.

324
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,760
Sure.

325
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,320
Let me know
once you've decided on a place.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,280
Okay.

327
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,800
Bye.

328
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,350
You've been quiet along the way.

329
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,150
What is it?

330
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,670
Did Huo Yanzong make you mad?

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,190
Don't mention that jerk.

332
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,024
Control your expressions.

333
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,150
All right. I won't mention him.

334
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,590
Let's not get mad because of a jerk.

335
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,150
You'd get wrinkles from getting mad.

336
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,630
I'm getting wrinkles.

337
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
It's not worth it

338
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,560
for the jerk.

339
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,110
But Shishi,

340
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,350
what happened that made you mad?

341
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,760
I, Yu Shishi,

342
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,080
have always been

343
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,960
the centre of attention
no matter where I go.

344
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,080
I've never been humiliated

345
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,960
like today.

346
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,630
Let me tell you this.

347
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm just a side character to him!

348
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,320
Dream on!

349
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,040
I will not meet him anymore.

350
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
I will never pick up

351
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,280
his phone calls anymore.

352
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,390
You will never pick up his calls?

353
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,520
(Huo Yanzong)
Huo Yanzong's calling. Will you answer?

354
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,760
Should I hang up for you instead?

355
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,760
Three.

356
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,350
Two.

357
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,390
One.

358
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,040
No.

359
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,480
I think

360
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,350
he's calling to apologize.

361
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,830
Hello.

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,350
Hello.

363
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,110
Hello. What is it?

364
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,670
Hello.

365
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,760
Let's have dinner tonight.

366
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,080
I've sent you the address.

367
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,320
I don't have an appetite.

368
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,560
Don't eat then.

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
Just sit next to me.

370
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,150
Huo Yanzong.

371
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,800
Is this the attitude when you apologize?

372
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,800
Who said I am apologizing?

373
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,480
(It's not only the two of us.)

374
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
(Jin Shichuan and Xu Lai are coming too.)

375
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,560
Then I won't be there. I'm busy.

376
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,520
No way.

377
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,870
You must go.

378
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,150
You cannot refuse.

379
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,350
Huo Yanzong.

380
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,720
Who am I to you?

381
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,350
Your assistant who is 24 hours on standby?

382
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,080
I said I'm not free.

383
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,000
Are you blind or deaf?

384
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,630
I'm already acting at work.

385
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Are you asking me to act off-work too?

386
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,590
Get someone else. I quit.

387
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,350
No way.

388
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,590
I have to go.

389
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,560
If I don't go,

390
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,320
how will I let Huo Yanzong know

391
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,830
that I'm the lead?

392
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,350
I'm already here.

393
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,280
Come straight in.

394
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,320
I sent you the room number.

395
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,390
All right.

396
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,190
Didn't you say you were busy?

397
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,800
As the female lead,

398
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,870
how can I be missing?

399
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,960
Moreover, a devoted actress like myself

400
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,560
will surely help you out

401
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,760
since I've made a promise.

402
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,110
Sorry for making you wait.

403
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,080
You're here.

404
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,280
Yanzong insists that I wear this dress.

405
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,430
He said I looked best in it

406
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,720
so we are a little late.

407
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,960
It's fine. Take a seat.

408
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
When did I buy you a dress?

409
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,350
It's part of the show.

410
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,320
This is a beautiful dress.

411
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,430
Huo has better taste now

412
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,350
after he's in a relationship.

413
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,630
Everyone is here.

414
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,630
Should we order?

415
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,960
What do you like...

416
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,630
Sweet and Sour Ribs.

417
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,910
Stir-Fried Green Beans.

418
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,110
Let's have fish.

419
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,000
I want it braised.

420
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,280
I remember Xu Lai loves them.

421
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,350
Yes.

422
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,430
What you ordered aren't my favourite.

423
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,870
Reorder.

424
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,760
Here.

425
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,110
Here, Shishi.

426
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,960
Yanzong doesn't know what I like to eat.

427
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,040
I don't quite know

428
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
what you like to eat too.

429
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,760
But, tell me.

430
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,080
I will remember them.

431
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,520
Really?

432
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,960
I also like Kung Pao Chicken.

433
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,910
Spicy or not spicy.

434
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,910
Spicy, of course.

435
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,800
The spicier, the better.

436
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,800
What else?

437
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,760
Sliced Beef in Chilli Oil.

438
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,560
You can make it more obvious

439
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,350
so we don't have to act anymore.

440
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,430
All right?

441
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:51,960
Vinegar cucumber.

442
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,110
Extra vinegar, please.

443
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,800
I like it sour.

444
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,320
Sure.

445
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,190
Xu Lai likes the fish cheeks.

446
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,190
Xu Lai, a toast to you.

447
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,830
Sure.

448
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,830
Gosh.

449
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,760
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,630
It's fine.

451
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,110
I'll take you to the toilet to fix this.

452
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,000
It's fine. I'll just wipe it.

453
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,080
No. Let's go.

454
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,320
Let me fix it for you.

455
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,110
I think I need to

456
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,720
make something clear.

457
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,110
I thought I was going to be disabled

458
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,040
so I let her go.

459
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,080
Now that I've recovered,

460
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,390
I will not let go anymore.

461
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,350
Xu Lai is very important to me.

462
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,870
I will not give up on her.

463
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,000
Sometimes I really don't know

464
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,080
if you're a fool
or just pretending to be one.

465
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,430
What do you mean?

466
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,630
No wonder.

467
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
You don't care about Huo Yanzong at all.

468
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
How would you notice

469
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,350
his feelings for you?

470
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,080
It's pathetic that he spent so much effort

471
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,240
getting me involved to put on a show.

472
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,040
A show?

473
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,630
What do you mean?

474
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,590
To tell you the truth,

475
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,910
the relationship between
Huo Yanzong and I is fake.

476
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,630
He doesn't want you to overthink

477
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,280
so he can stay by your side

478
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,638
without any suspicions.

479
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,150
Is it true?

480
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,830
If you don't believe me,

481
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,560
you can ask Huo Yanzong.

482
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,080
Now that you know about it,

483
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,630
Xu Lai,

484
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,520
please don't be friends

485
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,800
with him anymore.

486
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,720
You might not be tired of it

487
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,480
but I'm sick of acting.

488
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,350
You left in the middle of the meal.

489
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,320
Are you unhappy or

490
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,960
did something happen?

491
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,520
Shishi told me

492
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,720
her relationship with Huo is fake.

493
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,830
They have been acting.

494
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,000
You knew everything?

495
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,520
Did you know it all this while?

496
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,110
Huo Yanzong came to the hospital
to see me.

497
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,910
He told me.

498
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,150
Why didn't you tell me about it?

499
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,830
When was it?

500
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,630
What else did he say?

501
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,240
That was when we were having our fight.

502
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,760
He came to see me and told me about

503
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,150
his fake relationship with Shishi.

504
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,000
I could tell that

505
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,960
he had a strong feeling for you.

506
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,190
At that time,

507
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,560
I thought my leg wasn't going to heal.

508
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,760
I might not be able to protect you.

509
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Perhaps, he...

510
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,760
Perhaps...

511
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,830
Perhaps, what?

512
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,390
Perhaps, he can take care of you in my place.

513
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,910
Are you out of your mind?

514
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,910
Did you also asked him
to come on the day

515
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
we broke up at the hospital?

516
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,870
You were also lying to me.

517
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,040
Both of you.

518
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,630
One of you
is the person I care about most.

519
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,110
The other one is the friend I trust most

520
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,240
but all of you treat me like a fool.

521
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
I didn't want to hide this from you.

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,760
Listen to me. It's because...

523
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,430
Jin Shichuan.

524
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,960
You are so full of yourself.

525
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,280
You knew clearly

526
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,430
about the feelings I had for you,

527
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,520
and yet you tried to push me to another man.

528
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,080
Have you respected me?

529
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I have always been respectful.

530
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,040
Let me explain.

531
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,870
Did you know

532
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,720
how sad I was

533
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,760
when you tried to push me away

534
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,670
to hide your injury?

535
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,960
Because I liked you so much,

536
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,280
I went to make up with you

537
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,150
because I could understand

538
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,240
that you were trying to protect me.

539
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,398
But pushing me to Huo Yanzong

540
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,150
and lying to me with him...

541
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,390
is something
I cannot understand or accept.

542
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,520
I really like you

543
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,350
but that doesn't mean

544
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,430
my love is inferior.

545
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,280
I won't let you belittle it.

546
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,240
Xu Lai.

547
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,670
Let go.

548
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,800
Let go!

549
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,040
Yu Shishi.

550
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,320
What did you say to Xu Lai?

551
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,960
Why did she leave after you both

552
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,350
went to the washroom?

553
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,150
Yu Shishi!

554
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,390
I like how you are

555
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,000
chasing after me right now.

556
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,350
I'm asking you.

557
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,870
What did you tell Xu Lai?

558
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
I told her everything.

559
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,520
What?

560
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,590
I told her our relationship is fake.

561
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,190
You did all of these for her.

562
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,590
Why did you do that?

563
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,630
Because I don't want to see

564
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,430
you acting like a fool,

565
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,560
sacrificing so much for her

566
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
but she'll never see you the same way.

567
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,390
Moreover,

568
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,830
I don't want to pretend anymore

569
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480

You better give up.

576

I'm helping you.

577
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,760
I don't need your help.

578
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,390
You just need to play your part.

00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,150
Okay.

580
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,080
From now on,

581
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,670
I will not act anymore

582
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
because I'll be showing you
my true feelings.

If you ask me,

663
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,230
you should give her a big surprise.
