for her previous mistake.

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,440

don't be such a party pooper.

Xu Lai

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
spent a lot of effort on this.

103
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,159
She reported about you winning

105
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,399
back then.

106
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,599
There was also

107
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,080
the time when you first participated

108
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,560
in the earthquake rescue.

109
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:15,520

It's all here.

111
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,599
Here.

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,440
Cool, right?

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,359
She even reported this.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,359
Cool, right?

115
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,159
(How did she know about)

116
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,000
(my rescue from ten years ago?)

117
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,080

118
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,599
Yes.

119
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,159
Something important.

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,640
I am Xu Lai.

121
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,560
Since you forgot about me,

122
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,599
let's know each other

123
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:57,486
once again.

124
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,760
Were there any memorable people

125
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,359
among the ones you rescued?

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,599
Are you busy, Captain Jin?

127
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,000
Commissioner Wen wants to see you.

128
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:06,159
Sure.

129
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,159
A blind date?

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,880
Yes.

131
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,880
A blind date.

132
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,039
Thanks for your kindness.

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,479
I have no intention to date someone now.

134
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,760
Do you know I'm being kind?

135
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,239
You are not young anymore

136
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,320
but you are still single.

137
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Shichuan. Look.

138
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,080
Your grandfather was my superior.

139
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:32,839
Since he put you in my care,

140
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,279
we are a family.

141
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,520
Right?

142
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
Since we are a family,

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,919
I can't see you

144
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,680
being single for so long.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,640
That is why

146
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,440
I asked my old teammate

147
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,399
to introduce a girl to you.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,880
I saw it.

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,080
She's not bad.

150
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
This is the girl's information.

151
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,599
Take a look.

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,000
Commissioner.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
Forget it. This won't do.

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,919
All right.

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,920
Looking at it from another angle,

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,799
am I your superior?

157
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,640
If your superior asks you to go

158
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:14,440
and you refuse,

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,839
are you trying to embarrass me?

160
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,320
Well,

161
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
I will

162
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,719
give you an order today.

163
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,560
You must complete this mission.

164
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:29,318
(Commissioner)

165
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,000
(Firefighters are so cool.)

166
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,359
(They give a sense of security.)

167
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,839
(I think the captain)

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
(looks like my next boyfriend.)

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,000
(The captain is mine!)

170
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
(I'll go to the brigade tomorrow.)

171
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,359
Who do you think you are

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
trying to snatch my man?

173
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,200
(Captain Jin Shichuan)

174
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
(is already taken.)

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,520
(He has been reserved)

176
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,960
(by the cutest, prettiest,)

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,000
(and most charming girl)

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,640
(in the galaxy.)

179
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,799
(A warm reminder.)

180
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,080
(Don't disturb them
when they are working.)

181
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,440
(Captain Jin.)

182
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
(Have you seen)

183
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
(the special report I wrote?)

184
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,239
Hello.

185
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,200
Is Captain Jin around?

186
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,359
(You are Xu Lai, right?)

187
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,320
(He went on a blind date.)

188
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,239
A blind date?

189
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,040
Hello.

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,759
I'm here to send a message
on behalf of the captain.

191
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:09,999
Hello.

192
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,479
I'm here to send a message
on behalf of the captain.

193
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,359
He said he's not interested

194
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:13,999
in dating,

195
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,479
so he is not thinking
of getting married.

196
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,400
Let's not

197
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280
waste each other's time.

198
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Who is so unlucky to go

199
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,999
on a blind date with the captain?

200
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,119
This is her information.

201
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,400
Look at the picture

202
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,879
so you can recognize her.

203
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,599
Are you sure you won't open it?

204
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,960
No. I'm not interested.

205
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
Remember what I said.

206
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,759
I promise.

207
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,280
She's quite pretty.

208
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:54,519
What a pity.

209
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:55,839
It's you, right?

210
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,440
Here for the blind date?

211
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,239
Didn't you read the information?

212
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,839
No. I'm not interested.

213
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,759
Never mind.

214
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm here to send a message...

215
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
I don't have time to talk to you.

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,920
This blind date

217
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,879
is arranged by my superior.

218
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,359
I'm just here to show my face.

219
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:10,800
No...

220
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm not interested

221
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,759
and have no intention

222
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,759
of dating or marrying.

223
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,960
Let's not

224
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,040
waste each other's time.

225
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,719
I still have an operation
so I'll be leaving.

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,160
Aren't those my lines?

227
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,519
- Zhou?
- Get the water.

228
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,239
Give him a drink.

229
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:21,960
Are you all right?

230
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,239
Zhou!

231
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,680
Move!

232
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,200
Pour him some water.

233
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,719
Don't pat his back.

234
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,999
Move. Give him some space.

235
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:25,599
What's wrong?

236
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Are you choking?

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,999
Cough.

238
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:28,680
Cough hard.

239
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:29,160
Harder.

240
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
You can't cough it out, right?

241
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:31,680
Get up.

242
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,080
You'll be fine.

243
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,320
Relax.

244
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,320
Spread your legs. Lean forward.

245
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,280
Hold him.

246
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,400
Slowly.

247
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,200
Thank you.

248
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,359
Relax.

249
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:44,800
Hello.

250
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm at Gaoyang Road's Dream Restaurant.

251
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,759
Someone passed out here.

252
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,440
Don't hold your throat.

253
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,239
Relax.

254
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,160
I'll get the doctor to talk to you.

255
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
The patient has breathing difficulties.

256
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,839
My initial diagnosis

257
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,759
is airway obstruction.

258
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,280
When will help be arriving?

259
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,359
Hurry up.

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,560
Give me the alcohol.

261
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,759
Lift his head.

262
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,599
Lift his neck too.

263
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,680
Breathe slowly.

264
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,560
Breathe slowly now.

265
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:28,839
Hurry up.

266
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,200
Over there.

267
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,280
It's airway obstruction.

268
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,839
I already did

269
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:33,999
an emergency airway puncture.

270
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,639
All right.

271
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,839
I heard there's a famous host

272
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,239
giving a speech in the hall downstairs.

273
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,999
Is it Ms. Bai who just got

274
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,680
the News Award?

275
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,719
Yes. It's her.

276
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,719
Let's go.

277
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,519
Hurry! Let's go.

278
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
Hurry!

279
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,479
(Doing everything to maximize profits.)
(It still exists in the current market.)

280
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,855
(I'm not saying
Tengda's detergent company...)

281
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,200
Lu Fangqi.

282
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,359
You scared me.

283
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:51,639
Why are you here?

284
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,519
You are shocked.

285
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,639
What was on your mind?

286
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,400
It's all Captain Jin's fault

287
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,519
for asking me to go on his blind date.

288
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,560
I just saw the cruel scene

289
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,119
and haven't snapped out of it yet.

290
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,359
You went on the blind date in his place?

291
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,119
Yes.

292
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:05,999
No.

293
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
To be exact, I went to help him reject

294
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,040
his date.

295
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm telling you.

296
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,440
That person

297
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,359
was so weird.

298
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:15,479
Without blinking,

299
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,119
she...

300
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,519
He didn't go on the blind date

301
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,080
and even rejected the person.

302
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:22,680
No.

303
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,280
Are you listening?

304
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,160
Why are you laughing?

305
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:25,999
I'm busy.

306
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,719
Let's talk later.

307
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,119
Before entering the scene of a fire,

308
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,320
you need to check

309
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,879
your distress signal unit's condition.

310
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,040
Make sure it is switched on.

311
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,359
If you are stationary

312
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,200
at the scene of the fire

313
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,839
for 30 seconds,

314
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,719
the alarm of the unit

315
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,239
will go off

316
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,639
and tell your teammates
that you are in danger.

317
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,200
This thing

318
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,440
can definitely save your life.

319
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm sure

320
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,440
I don't need to say more
about its importance.

321
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:18,518
Dismissed.

322
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

323
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:37,759
Didn't I tell you

324
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,479
not to come here again
after the interview?

325
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,599
The interview isn't over yet.

326
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,920
I still have a question.

327
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,639
I won't answer any questions of yours.

328
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,239
Do you want to date me?

329
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:14,960
Are you nervous?

330
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,080
It seems like

331
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,040
you are still a normal man.

332
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,239
Jin Shichuan!

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,119
Do you want to date me?

334
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,879
No!

335
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,160
Can you tell me the reason?

336
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,080
Regardless,

337
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,119
I still won't give up.

338
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:35,479
I will work hard

339
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,160
until I can pursue you.

340
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,599
It's no use no matter how hard you work.

341
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:41,719
I will never consider

342
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,639
about love.

343
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,999
Not in the past

344
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,320
and not in the future.

345
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,040
I will ignore

346
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,999
what you said just now.

347
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,479
What are you all doing?

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,639
Go to training.

349
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,879
- Yes!
- Yes!

350
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,519
I can't believe it.

351
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,119
Xu Lai's target

352
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,320
has always been our captain.

353
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,680
I think

354
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,160
Ms. Xu is a nice person.

355
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,639
She's a match with Captain Jin.

356
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,920
Forget it.

357
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,200
Captain Jin said

358
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,320
he won't date or marry.

359
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,440
That's not necessary.

360
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,920
Let me tell you.

361
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,239
I'm an expert

362
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,320
in love.

363
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,839
Love is all about

364
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
taming someone.

365
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,879
It depends on who can tame whom.

366
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Just like the cats.

367
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
When we first came here,

368
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,800
they were wild.

369
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,280
Look at them now.

370
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,160
Right?

371
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,759
So, Captain Jin

372
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,359
is just like a cat.

373
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:44,879
Xu Lai

374
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,440
is the person who tames him.

375
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,800
Since Captain Jin

376
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
already said that,

377
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,320
I don't think Xu Lai will succeed.

378
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:51,960
Yes.

379
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,040
Captain Jin

380
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:53,879
rejected her

381
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,519
in front of everyone.

382
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,767
She must be so ashamed.

383
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,999
Perhaps she's crying somewhere.

384
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,800
Right?

385
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,960
Xu Lai is so pitiful.

386
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,279
Han Fang.

387
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,279
Hello.

388
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
We must celebrate today.

389
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,039
Excuse me.

390
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,039
A set of bombs!

391
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,680
Didn't you say you got rejected

392
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,799
on the phone?

393
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,519
Why are you so happy?

394
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,680
Isn't that normal?

395
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,920
However, I gained something unexpected

396
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:20,920
after my confession.

397
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,440
What is it?

398
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,151
He said he won't consider
dating or marrying someone.

399
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,960
How is that a gain?

400
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,239
Doesn't that stop you

401
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,079
from making progress?

402
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,319
Are you stupid?

403
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,279
If he won't consider
dating or marrying someone,

404
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,160
it means I don't have a chance

405
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,960
and it's also the same

406
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,840
for other women.

407
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,840
In other words,

408
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,479
this is

409
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,880
a battlefield without rivals.

410
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,120
Thank you.

411
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,400
My only rival

412
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,920
is Jin Shichuan.

413
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,079
I'm impressed.

414
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,799
Your logic

415
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,479
is indeed different from other women.

416
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,799
It's so late.

417
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:58,757
(Qin Ye)

418
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,200
Hello, Chief.

419
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,279
Xu Lai!

420
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,840
What's wrong with you?

421
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,039
Why did you use
our official Weibo account

422
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,319
to like the exposure post of Tengda?

423
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,999
They are coming to our station

424
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,360
to hold us responsible.

425
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,239
What Tengda exposure post?

426
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,319
I didn't like any posts.

427
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,640
(Come back immediately.)

428
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,200
I'll come back soon.

429
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm going back to the station.

430
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:20,440
What's going on?

431
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,239
Do you need any help?

432
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,519
No. I can handle it.

433
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:25,642
(Contract Termination Notice)

434
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,279
This is the lawyer's letter from Tengda.

435
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,840
We don't know whether the company

436
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,279
under Tengda is involved

437
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:31,920
in illegal manufacturing.

438
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,239
However,

439
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,279
your accidental doing

440
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,960
made Tengda think we affected

441
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:37,719
their reputation,

442
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,400
so they want us to compensate
them for their loss.

443
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,200
I didn't...

444
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,400
Chief.

445
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,200
I really...

446
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,840
Ms. Lv, why don't I

447
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,079
ask Xu Lai

448
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,360
to apologize to Tengda

449
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,279
and get them to forgive us,

450
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,200
all right?

451
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,519
It's not about

452
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,840
Tengda holding us accountable.

453
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,400
Before something is verified,

454
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,719
the TV station

455
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,880
must be neutral.

456
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,519
At this time,

457
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,680
any reckless actions

458
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,279
will be misread

459
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,759
by the outside world,

460
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,519
let alone having objective judgement.

461
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,360
This mess right now

462
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,719
will affect the station's

463
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,759
credibility and image.

464
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,759
Ms. Lv,

465
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,479
it really wasn't me.

466
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Before this,

467
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,840
I didn't even know
there is something wrong with Tengda.

468
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,279
Since you are handling the account,

469
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,799
who else did it if you didn't?

470
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:26,880
But I...

471
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,799
Enough!

472
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Ms. Lv,

473
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,680
can I take a picture?

474
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,239
That's...

475
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,719
I'm sure Xu Lai

476
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,600
has her own reason for doing that.

477
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,759
All right. Go out.

478
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,360
Yes.

479
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,600
Chief,

480
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,120
you must believe me.

481
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,079
I really didn't like the post.

482
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,239
I believe you

483
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
but now is not the time to explain.

484
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,559
The most important thing
is to think of a way

485
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,079
to reduce the negative impacts

486
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,479
and cut the station's loss.

487
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,039
It's late.

488
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,200
Go back to rest.

489
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,112
I will think about

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,479
how to handle this incident.

491
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,440
Go back.

492
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:43,960
Why have

493
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,319
Tengda's stocks dropped so much

494
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,279
over the last few days?

495
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,479
Recently, Tengda was exposed

496
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,920
for illegal manufacturing.

497
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,160
They did PR

498
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:51,960
to suppress the news.

499
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,079
But recently

500
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
the official Weibo of Huaigang TV

501
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,559
liked an exposure post

502
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:56,840
which attracted

503
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,440
public attention

504
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,440
and ruined the company's image.

505
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,559
Sales

506
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,719
have also dropped significantly.

507
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:02,840
That is why

508
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,719
Tengda's stocks have been plummeting
over the last few days.

509
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,759
Inform the director of every department

510
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,999
to have a meeting

511
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,999
at the meeting room 10 minutes later.

512
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,559
Sure. I'll arrange it immediately.

513
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,600
Sit down.

514
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:17,640
The outside world

515
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,759
is looking at Tengda badly.

516
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,719
Many investors are asking to pull out
of their investments.

517
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,120
There are even calls
to boycott Tengda's products

518
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,799
on the internet.

519
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,759
I think

520
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,119
it's time to reconsider

521
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
our partnership with Tengda.

522
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,799
I don't think that's necessary.

523
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,759
This is only temporary.

524
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,440
Memory on the internet is short.

525
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,039
When the hype is over,

526
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,360
people will forget about the scandal

527
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,960
and keep buying Tengda's products.

528
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,319
Yes.

529
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
Tengda is our old client.

530
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,319
Terminating the contract

531
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,360
will cause losses.

532
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,519
The loss you speak about

533
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:45,392
is only for now.

534
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,200
I'm considering our future.

535
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,039
A company's image

536
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,120
is used to judge

537
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,640
an enterprise's future development.

538
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,960
Once it is damaged,

539
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,479
it will be hard to build it again
within a short time.

540
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,200
Yunkai,

541
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
as a large group,

542
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,880
is involved in many industries.

543
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,440
We need to look at the big picture

544
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,799
when we choose our partners.

545
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,799
Being near-sighted doesn't help.

546
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:06,759
Legal department,

547
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,880
prepare the
contract termination materials.

548
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,400
Get ready to sue Tengda

549
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,719
and end our partnership.

550
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:12,880
Yes, Mr. Huo.

551
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,559
Good.

552
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,440
That's all for today's meeting.

553
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,360
Huo.

554
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:23,200
What's wrong?

555
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,719
I want to talk to you about

556
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
the TV station that liked the post.

557
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,079
Is it related to you?

558
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,360
It's not related to me.

559
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,920
But do you know

560
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,440
who did that?

561
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,799
Who was it?

562
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,200
Xu Lai.

563
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,960
I will

564
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,319
deal with this matter strictly.

565
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Liking the post is
our employee's personal action.

566
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,279
However,

567
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,640
we will pay attention to

568
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,519
the post's content.

569
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,319
If necessary,
we will investigate it further.

570
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,479
Yes. I understand.

571
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:56,759
Come in.

572
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,239
It's been a long time, Ms. Lv.

573
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,319
Mr. Huo.

574
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,360
Hello.

575
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,160
Sorry.

576
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,799
I came here to disturb you

577
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,719
without informing you.

578
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,079
That's too polite.

579
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,160
You are our esteemed guest.

580
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,160
Please take a seat.

581
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,559
Why are you so free to come here?

582
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,239
I came here

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,039
to ask you for a favor.

584
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,999
What is it? Tell me.

585
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,719
I have a friend

586
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,640
working in the news department.

587
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,519
Her name is Xu Lai.

588
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,799
Xu Lai?

589
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,360
I heard she made a mistake

590
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,039
on her job

591
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,559
and might be punished.

592
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,440
I'm worried, Ms. Lv.

593
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,279
Do you think

594
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,360
you can forgive her

595
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:39,640
regarding this

596
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,640
for my sake?

597
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,559
Mr. Huo, this does

598
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,239
trouble me.

599
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,960
That's because

600
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
the Tengda incident happened

601
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,279
because Xu Lai didn't investigate it

602
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,759
and liked the post
on behalf of the TV station

603
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,920
without approval,

604
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,519
and affected the station's

605
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,999
media credibility.

606
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,440
The truth is more important.

607
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,279
We must

608
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,960
reduce the negative impacts
as much as possible.

609
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,640
I heard

610
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,279
the TV station will soon have
a bid to find investors.

611
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,840
I like

612
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,440
the way you do news.

613
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,840
Yunkai also has plans

614
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,999
to have a business partnership
with the TV station.

615
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:23,759
Yunkai

616
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:24,960
will join the bid

617
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,999
to become a primetime sponsor.

618
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,120
That's too polite of you

619
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,039
to come here specifically for this.

Mr. Huo.

622
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,519
You joined the sponsor bid

623
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,799
to help Xu Lai, right?

624
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,880
I don't know

625
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
your relationship with Xu Lai

626
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,239
but she is my subordinate.

627
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,120
I am in charge of her
when it comes to work.

628
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,680
It's hard for me
to explain to other colleagues

629
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,920
if you do that.

630
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,559
To the people

631
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,200
who did not make mistakes,

632
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,079
it is unfair.

633
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,559
It's funny

634
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,840
when the word fairness

635
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,239
came out of your mouth.

636
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,519
You come and question me

637
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,519
impatiently,

638
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,880
and are anxious that the issue
doesn't become a big deal.

639
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,039
Why is that?

640
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,160
I can't bear to see it.

641
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,880
I think you are
reluctant to admit defeat.

642
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,400
Let me give you a reminder.

643
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,479
Don't offend Xu Lai.

644
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,680
You can't afford to offend her.

645

Why are you here?

658
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,120
I passed by

659
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,079
so I came to see you.

No.

Tengda's issue has been dealt with

768
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,400
and Xu Lai doesn't
need to bear any responsibilities.

769
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:46,999
Really?

770
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,120
How do you know?

771
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,600
Jiang Xin heard about it from Ms. Lv.

772
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
How can it be fake?

773
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Do you know why?

774
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,559
Why?

775
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,319
Because Yunkai Group is going to join

776
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,920
the bid to become
the station's primetime sponsor.

777
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,440
Yunkai Group?

778
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,200
What does it have to do with Xu Lai?

779
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,840
Yes.

780
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,319
Of course, it does.

781
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,920
The boss of Yunkai Group, Huo Yanzong,

782
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,600
is Xu Lai's support.

783
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,880
Two days ago,

784
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,039
Huo Yanzong even came

785
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,440
to look for Ms. Lv because of this.

786
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,360
I envy her.

787
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,239
She made

788
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,239
such a huge blunder

789
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,519
and still has someone to help her.

790
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Are you all free?

791
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,039
It's all your fault.

792
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,960
Xu Lai, why are you here?

793
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,680
Come. Sit here.

794
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,160
Do you want a drink?

795
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,039
No.

796
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,559
Huo.

797
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,559
Is Yunkai

798
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,759
discussing a partnership
with the station

799
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
so I don't need to
take responsibility for Tengda?

800
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,719
Who told you that?

801
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,279
Just answer me.

802
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,640
Don't misunderstand.

803
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,120
I went to Ms. Lv

804
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,799
because I wanted

805
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,079
to discuss
the group's development this year.

806
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,559
I didn't do it

807
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,360
because of you.

808
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,120
Why did it

809
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
happen at this time coincidentally?

810
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,960
Huo, you know me.

811
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:07,999
I don't want

812
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:08,880
any interests

813
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,319
to be involved in a friendship.

814
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,239
Even if we are buddies,

815
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,759
I don't want to owe you anything.

816
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,039
I don't want to accept

817
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
this kind of help.

818
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,640
I only think

819
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,039
this is hitting two birds
with one stone.

820
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:23,999
You know I'm a businessman.

821
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,120
A businessman doesn't
make a losing proposition.

822
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,999
Why won't you believe me?

823
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,600
It's not that I don't believe you.

824
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,519
I just want

825
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,840
to deal with this on my own.

826
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:34,759
I already

827
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,759
know how to solve it.

828
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,759
How?

829
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,440
I've already studied

830
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,279
the article

831
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,200
on Tengda's manufacturing problem.

832
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,440
Although I don't have proof,

833
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,479
I think

834
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
the article wasn't made up.

835
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,440
If Tengda does have

836
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,319
manufacturing issues,

837
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,920
the TV station is not at fault.

838
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,440
I want to use this opportunity

839
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,840
to investigate it.

840
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,880
You must be careful.

841
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,920
If you need any help,

842
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,200
come find me anytime.

843
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,120
Don't worry.

844
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,319
I will deal with it well.

845
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,479
All right.

846
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,400
I respect your decision.

847
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:06,960
That's great.

848
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,920
I'll be leaving then.

849
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,360
Let me send you off.

850
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,519
No need.

851
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:21,098
(Tengda Chemicals)

852
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,039
What is this?

853
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,920
It's so pungent.

854
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,159
You must be new.

855
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,519
It might be pungent now.

856
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,639
When it is sent to the production line

857
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,039
and fragrance is added,

858
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,440
it won't smell bad at all.

859
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,760
If you mix it like this,

860
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,159
won't there be any problems?

861
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,079
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

862
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
We always do it this way.

863
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,079
But the worker who came in with me

864
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,159
had allergies after using it.

865
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,079
The internet also says

866
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,760
there's a problem.

867
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,479
Didn't Tengda acquire

868
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,320
our company?

869
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,639
Don't they care about this?

870
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
With the support of a big company

871
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,280
like Tengda,

872
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,039
what's there to be afraid of?

873
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,400
Besides, our products

874
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,559
are packaged with

875
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,360
Tengda's brand.

876
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:24,639
You are right.

877
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,119
Why do you have so many questions?

878
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,320
Which workshop are you from?

879
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:30,391
(Workshop 1)

880
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,159
I'm from Workshop 2.

881
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm getting to my shift.

882
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,039
Go on.

883
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,840
If you are late,

884
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,679
the supervisor will deduct your salary.

885
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,880
Why are there so many

886
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,360
dangerous chemicals
illegally stored in the factory?

887
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:52,280
They are even charging batteries here.

888
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,360
Hello? 12345?

889
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,199
I want to make a report.

890
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,559
I found a lot of

891
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,479
illegally stored dangerous chemicals

892
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:04,039
at a workshop

893
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,840
of a detergent company
that is a subsidiary

894
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,479
of Tengda.

895
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,199
It's her!

896
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,999
I'm sure she recorded something!

897
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,999
What are you doing?

898
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,119
Who are you calling?

899
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:09,679
After her!

900
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,639
(We received a public report)

901
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,720
(that Tengda chemical factory's workshop)

902
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,400
(has a lot of illegally stored
dangerous chemicals)

903
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,760
(that block off
emergency escape routes)

904
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,159
(and cause a serious safety hazard.)

905
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,639
(Emergency Response Unit Brigade 1,)

906
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,880
(please verify the situation.)

907
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,280
(Yes.)

908
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
(Fire Engine 1 is heading
to the factory.)

909
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
(The other vehicles,
return to the brigade.)

910
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,639
(- Yes!
- Yes!)

911
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,280
Stop!

912
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,960
- Stop!
- Quick!

913
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,360
Don't run!

914
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,079
Stop!

915
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,440
Stop!

916
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,760
Don't run!

917
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,320
Over there!

918
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,519
- Don't run!
- Over there!

919
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
(Tengda Chemicals)

920
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,360
Turn on your headlamps.

921
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:24,720
Isn't that Xu Lai?

922
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,039
Why is she here?

923
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll go take a look

924
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,320
while all of you verify the area.

925
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:35,599
Don't run!

926
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,039
Xu Lai, don't be reckless!

927
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,360
I dare you to run!

928
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,720
I'm the captain

929
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,800
of Huaigang's Fire Department
Emergency Response Unit Brigade 1,

930
00:37:59,079 --> 00:37:59,599
Jin Shichuan.

931
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,039
We received a public report

932
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,400
that this factory

933
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,479
has the safety hazard.

934
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,840
Please

935
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,599
allow us to examine
the safety of this place.

936
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,639
A fake female worker

937
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,159
and a fake firefighter.

938
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,599
This act

939
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,800
is so real.

940
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,440
Please accept the safety examination.

941
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,159
I don't believe it!

942
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,320
Both of you are working together.

943
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,440
Liars like you

944
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,400
use every method you can.

945
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,599
If you don't hand over

946
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,199
the video today,

947
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,280
don't even think of leaving!

948
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,039
Jin Shichuan!

949
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,119
It hurts!

950
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,960
Go!

951
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:45,920
Are you all right?

952
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,720
It hurts!

953
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,039
Here you go.

954
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,240
Thank you.

955
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:32,639
Go!

956
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:33,999
Hurry!

957
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,880
Are you hurt?

958
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,119
Get on.

959
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:45,079
Am I dreaming?

960
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,280
Don't move.

961
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,079
Let me wipe for you.

962
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,880
I wish this staircase

963
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,920
is longer.

964
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:38,599
Captain Jin.

965
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:40,679
Make way.

966
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,639
This progress

967
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,240
is too fast.

968
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:54,432
(Fire Department)

969
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,400
When did you see

970
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,159
Captain Jin act this way?

971
00:40:58,999 --> 00:40:59,599
Captain Jin

972
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,559
has been unknowingly

973
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,199
consumed by our enemy.

974
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,199
This is dangerous if it continues.

975
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,079
Captain Jin.

976
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,199
We have counted

977
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,159
all the illegal items.

978
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,760
Sir,

979
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,320
I guarantee to place everything

980
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,039
correctly from now on.

981
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:47,960
Illegal stacking

982
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,880
and the lack of standardized storage.

983
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,079
Yes.

984
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,039
All of these

985
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,639
are safety hazards.

986
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,240
Yes.

987
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,559
The Fire Prevention Department

988
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:56,479
will be here later

989
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,920
to deal with the remaining procedures.

990
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,159
Return to the brigade.

991
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,559
Yes.

992
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,280
Why did you come out

993
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,039
and not stay inside?

994
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm here to thank you.

995
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,240
Thank you for saving me again.

996
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,519
You are the person

997
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,079
with the most incidents I've seen.

998
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:21,720
In the future,

999
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,440
can you think about

1000
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,679
your own safety before doing things?

1001
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:26,679
You run around every time.

1002
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:27,639
Is that how

1003
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,920
reporters do things?

1004
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,039
You care about me?

1005
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,479
No.

1006
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,159
I just don't want

1007
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,400
to risk my life to save you every time.

1008
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,079
Also, why didn't you text me

1009
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,360
when you are in danger?

1010
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Who am I to you?

1011
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,199
Why would I dare text you?

1012
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,199
You didn't even

1013
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,039
read my previous texts.

1014
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,320
Who said that?

1015
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:46,599
You've read them?

1016
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,639
Why didn't you

1017
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,720
reply to my texts if you've read them?
