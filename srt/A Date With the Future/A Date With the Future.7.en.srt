(Taming a Man by Playing Hard to Get)

18
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,640
I think it's better for you

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,439
to address me as Ms. Xu,

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,640
Captain Jin.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,920
After all, I'm an instructor now.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,480
We are colleagues here.

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,079
I don't think you should just
call me by my name.

24
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,680
What do you think?

25
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,360
Ms. Xu.

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,039
Captain Jin.

27
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,639
Why is Xu Lai

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,439
treating you so coldly?

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Are the two of you having a fight?

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,879
Do you have nothing better to do?

31
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,599
But that contrastive attitude of her

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
is too obvious.

33
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,919
Even Liu Xu noticed it.

34
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,719
If you are so free,

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,840
go out there

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,479
and run 10km with weights.

37
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,599
Captain Jin, I am wrong.

38
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,759
I won't ask you anything anymore.

39
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,080
But Xu Lai looks quite cool

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
as an instructor.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,199
When she stands there,

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,639
it's a beautiful view for us.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,560
Those new recruits

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,639
are all gawking at her.

45
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,599
I'm done.

46
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,439
I'll get going now.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,759
Bye.

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,159
Ready, front!

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Be cool.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,439
Turn right!

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,319
Turn right!

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,879
Turn left!

53
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,719
- Ms. Xu!
- Ms. Xu!

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,879
Ten more laps!

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,199
About-face!

56
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,759
About-face!

57
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,639
Bye.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,639
Captain Jin, you are here.

59
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,759
About that day.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
What is it?

61
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Nothing.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It doesn't matter
if you've forgotten about it.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,399
I remember now.

64
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,920
Are you referring to

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the kiss between us?

66
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,120
I drank too much that day.

67
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,040
I acted recklessly.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
We are both adults.

69
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,000
It was not your fault.

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,439
Just forget about it.

71
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,720
Forget about it?

72
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,240
Be quiet.

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
What are you doing so late at night?

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,639
I can't sleep.

75
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,399
I have a question for you.

76
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,639
What?

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,879
What do you need to ask
in the middle of the night?

78
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,279
Well.

79
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,120
Do you have

80
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,759
any experience in kissing?

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,439
Wait.

82
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,920
Are you burning up

83
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,959
because you've been single

84
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,360
for too long?

85
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Put out the fire.

86
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,000
He's like this every night.

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,600
I've gotten used to it.

88
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,680
What do you want to ask me?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,959
Just be frank with me.

90
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,959
If...

91
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm just talking about a hypothesis.

92
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,160
After a man

93
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,959
kisses a woman,

94
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,680
the woman

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,680
suddenly treats the man very coldly.

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,920
In your opinion,

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,959
what is that woman

98
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:52,959
thinking?

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
You kissed Xu Lai?

100
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,199
No.

101
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,160
Hypothesis.

102
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,399
It's just a hypothesis.

103
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,920
A hypothesis.

104
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,160
I don't think I should say it.

105
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,720
Are you going to say it or not?

106
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,319
It's obvious

107
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:09,839
that she didn't feel

108
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,399
anything from the kiss.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,439
It's either that or...

110
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,600
Or...

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,720
Well.

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,000
Or the man was really skillful.

113
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,600
Have you watched
those idol dramas before?

114
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,759
No.

115
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,000
Girls

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
love

117
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,279
the dominant CEO type.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,560
Idol dramas?

119
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Idol dramas.

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
You should watch more of them.

121
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
Not interested. Go back to sleep now.

122
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,240
Sleep.

123
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,879
Watch more idol dramas.

124
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,800
Don't tell anyone about it.

125
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,079
(You can love only me.)

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,399
(You can't fall in love
with another man!)

127
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,720
(Well.)

128
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,319
(Or the man was really unskillful.)

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
Sit.

130
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,639
Captain Jin.

131
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,960
Didn't you sleep well last night?

132
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,080
Your dark circles are so deep.

133
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,639
I slept quite well.

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
(Keep denying it then.)

135
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,279
Captain Jin.

136
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,080
Captain Jin.

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,600
Captain Jin.

138
00:08:59,519 --> 00:08:59,799
Sit.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,320
Come.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,120
Sit.

141
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,320
Congratulations

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
on having your own dog now.

143
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,679
Now, give your dog

144
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
a name

145
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,879
and introduce them to each other.

146
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,759
Lu Fangqi, we'll start with you.

147
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,039
I was bitten by a dog when I was young.

148
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,639
So, I'm a little bit afraid of dogs.

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,200
This is a Labrador.

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,559
It's the most docile dog here.

151
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,559
So, I'll call it Coal.

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,159
My turn.

153
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
Their dogs

154
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,120
are either black,

155
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,159
yellow

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
or yellow-black in color.

157
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,000
But mine is multi-colored.

158
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,879
It has great coloring.

159
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,799
I'll call it.

160
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,279
Mighty.

161
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,480
Mighty. Nice.

162
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:35,919
Yes.

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,519
Labrador, Bean.

164
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Golden Retriever, Rocky.

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,519
German Shepherd, Red Guard.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,559
Labrador, Sunny.

167
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,799
Belgian Shepherd.

168
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,879
Since we already have Mighty,

169
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,240
I'll call it Champ.

170
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,759
My dog

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,000
has to be a champion.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll call mine Western.

173
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,639
German Shepherd, Shell.

174
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:55,799
Good.

175
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,399
When you train your dog,

176
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,600
the most important thing is to master

177
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,799
how you interact with your dog

178
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,279
as well as each of their habits.

179
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
You need to build a trusting
and compatible relationship

180
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,039
with them.

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,919
Next,

182
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,639
I'll show you

183
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,559
how I interact with my dog.

184
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,320
Remember.

185
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,960
Your commands need to be short and
precise with clear hand gestures.

186
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,159
Peace, lie down.

187
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,159
Good.

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,279
Peace, sit.

189
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Good.

190
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,879
Peace, salute.

191
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,399
Good.

192
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,519
Stand up.

193
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,639
Good.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,440
Remember.

195
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,679
Do not train your dog
for more than 15 minutes

196
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,840
in one session.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,559
Let it take a rest after 15 minutes.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
If it follows your command correctly,

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
you need to reward it accordingly.

200
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,080
Okay.

201
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Go and train

202
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,039
with your dogs now.

203
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Let's go.

205
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,879
Coal.

206
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,559
Let's go.

207
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,759
Ms. Xu.

208
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Coming.

209
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,159
Coal.

210
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,080
Stop running.

211
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,559
Bean.

212
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,240
Come back now.

213
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,080
Coal, come.

214
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,840
Come here.

215
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,759
Coal.

216
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,639
Coal.

217
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,440
Coal.

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Come here.

219
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,120
Coal.

220
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,159
Stop running.

221
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,000
Come back now.

222
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,050
(Go Beyond)

223
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,759
Coal.

224
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,320
Come here.

225
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,879
Coal.

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,759
Come.

227
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,679
Come.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,799
Coal. You...

229
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Stay away.

230
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Coal.

231
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
Don't chase after me.

232
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,080
Come.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,759
Come, Mighty.

234
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:38,600
Lie down.

235
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,240
Sit.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Good dog.

237
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:42,759
Salute.

238
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,120
Good dog.

239
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,679
Go.

240
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,639
Lie down.

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,679
Bark.

242
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,679
Bark.

243
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,120
Bark.

244
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,320
Good.

245
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,320
Come here.

246
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,960
Good.

247
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,039
That's right. Here.

248
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,960
Bean. Sit.

249
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:00,559
Don't move.

250
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,039
Good.

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,559
Sit.

252
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,440
Come.

253
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,720
Sit.

254
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,559
Champ.

255
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,279
Look at me.

256
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:07,840
Me.

257
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,559
I'm here.

258
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,879
Lie down.

259
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:13,919
Lie down.

260
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,320
Look at me.

261
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,559
Sit.

262
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,320
My friend.

263
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,159
Can we talk?

264
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,279
Champ!

265
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,039
Bean!

266
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Turn.

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Good dog.

268
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:40,960
Whose dog is this?

269
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,759
Take it away.

270
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,080
Hurry up.

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,360
Champ.

272
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,559
Don't be dejected.

273
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,080
This is normal
for your first interaction

274
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,000
with the dogs.

275
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,519
But these dogs

276
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,559
are all

277
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,200
carefully selected.

278
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,200
They are very smart.

279
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,200
So,

280
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,000
with enough patience

281
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,000
and training,

282
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,039
I'm sure it'll get better.

283
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:11,720
Okay.

284
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
That's it for today's lesson.

285
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,200
Take them back to their kennels.

286
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,440
Then, you can go back and rest.

287
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,039
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

288
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,559
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

289
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,320
Come with me.

290
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:20,759
Give that to me.

291
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,799
I fed it just now.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,759
Let's go, Peace.

293
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,519
Ms. Xu.

294
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,440
What is it?

295
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,759
I want to discuss with you

296
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,679
the arrangement for our schedule.

297
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,799
Do you have time for that?

298
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,600
See you in the meeting room at nine.

299
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,759
Okay.

300
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:32,480
You are here.

301
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,519
You are early.

302
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,559
Have you waited for a long time?

303
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,039
I just got here.

304
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,360
Let's start then.

305
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
We have two main missions

306
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,919
to achieve in this training camp.

307
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
The first mission is

308
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,600
to train new firefighters

309
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,159
and put together
an earthquake rescue team.

310
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,279
The second mission

311
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
is to train some search and rescue dogs

312
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,879
for any future rescue work.

313
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,679
We have little time to complete
these important missions.

314
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,679
So,

315
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,720
I want to talk to you

316
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,399
about how to arrange
our schedule in the future.

317
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,080
So far, the firefighter training

318
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,679
and the dog training are separated.

319
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,080
In my opinion,

320
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,639
after the first phase
of the dog training is complete,

321
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,919
the dogs should train together
with their masters.

322
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,759
That way,

323
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,799
we can quickly improve

324
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
the compatibility between the men
and their dogs.

325
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,200
And we can save time by doing so.

326
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,000
It's more efficient.

327
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,519
We better keep their training separated.

328
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,120
I don't work with a dog.

329
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Is it because of Windchase?

330
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,919
I know that after it died,

331
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,080
you are...

332
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,440
I don't want to talk about Windchase.

333
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,679
Jin Shichuan.

334
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,879
Are you okay?

335
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,159
I'm fine.

336
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,960
Ten years ago,

337
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,120
after the earthquake,

338
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,679
I'm afraid

339
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,080
to be in a dark space

340
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
whenever it's raining and thundering.

341
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,320
You don't have to be afraid.

342
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm here.

343
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,159
How about we continue

344
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,080
with arranging our search and rescue
dog training schedule?

345
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay?

346
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,900
(Brave the Wind and Waves
and Forge Ahead)

347
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,759
The rain has stopped.

348
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I'll go and check out the kennels.

349
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,759
I'll go and check out

350
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,079
the equipment for tomorrow's training.

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,720
Why are you here?

352
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,079
I'm worried that you'll be afraid.

353
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,839
On the count of three,

354
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,920
let's run.

355
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,480

388
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,759
When you train your dogs,

389
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,480
make sure to protect yourself.

390
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When you train your dogs,

391
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,039
we need to be

392
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,519
patient as their trainers.

393
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,160
Slowly build

394
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,400
a loving relationship with them.

395
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,599
And let them know
that you are the master.

396
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,640
Remember.

397
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
If your dog bites you,

398
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,279
don't panic.

399
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,480
Just call out to me

400
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,480
and relax.

401
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,519
Okay.

402
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,799
You can start

403
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,039
training your own dog now.

404
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:34,960
Spread out.

405
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,880
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

406
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,119
Rocky, come.

407
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:37,680
Come.

408
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,039
Come, Rocky.

409
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,319
Come, Coal.

410
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,200
Come.

411
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:50,720
That dog.

412
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,960
Where does that dog come from?

413
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,039
No.

414
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,319
Stop chasing after me.

415
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,279
Stop it.

416
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,799
Help.

417
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,039
Coal.

418
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,519
Thank you.

419
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:43,640
Lu Fangqi.

420
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,640
Take him to the hospital.

421
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,240
Are you okay?

422
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:02,799
This wound

423
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,079
is inflicted

424
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,920
by a 3cm-long glass.

425
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,640
We have done a debridement
and suture surgery on it.

426
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,640
In this situation,

427
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,839
you need to pay attention to the wound

428
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,279
to prevent
any secondary wound infection.

429
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Little boy.

430
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,240
Are you still in pain?

431
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,519
I'm a man.
I'm not afraid of a little bit of pain.

432
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,519
Good boy.

433
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,279
Miss.

434
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Please be gentle with me.

435
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,480
You are an adult.
Why are you afraid of a shot?

436
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Here.

437
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,000
No. I'm not afraid.

438
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,359
I just feel dizzy when I look at it.

439
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Okay. Just bear with it.

440
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,400
Come.

441
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,440
Hurry up.

442
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,440
Wait!

443
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,960
- Why is it you again?
- Why is it you again?

444
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,039
Mister.

445
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Getting a shot is not painful.
Don't be afraid.

446
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,640
Just do it.

447
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,319
Let's go.

448
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,119
Let go of me!

449
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:55,960
Come home with me.

450
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,920
Help!

451
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,400
You are my wife.

452
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll hit...

453
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,880
Stop it!

454
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:01,880
What are you doing?

455
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,880
Who are you?

456
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,119
We are at the hospital.

457
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:05,680
Since she is admitted,

458
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,920
she's my patient now.

459
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,599
You should stay out of this.

460
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,240
Otherwise,

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,200
I'll hit you as well.

462
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,400
Please leave at once.

463
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,640
If you don't leave,

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,519
I'll call the police now.

465
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,240
Come home with me.

466
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,240
Are you going to come or not?

467
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,200
I hate it when a man

468
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,400
hits a woman.

469
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,319
If you attack her again,

470
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,720
I can't promise you what I'll do.

471
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:42,920
He's the culprit.

472
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,240
All of you can leave now.

473
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,359
You are fine now.

474
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,599
Let me take a look at you.

475
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,759
Does he hit you every time

476
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,240
he's drunk?

477
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,440
You are fine now.

478
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,880
I'll reach out to the police and
the ACWF for you.

479
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,200
He won't hurt you again.

480
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,400
Doctor.

481
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,440
Thank you.

482
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,240
Let me treat your wounds for you.

483
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,160
Mister, you are amazing.

484
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,240
Come out.

485
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:52,960
Doctor Zang.

486
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,319
It's you.

487
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,400
You...

488
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,839
Why are you eating here?

489
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,480
I always eat here.

490
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,319
What has it got to do with you?

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,599
I thought you had changed.

492
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,759
Doctor Zang.

493
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,440
Does the commotion

494
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,680
like today often happen

495
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,759
in the hospital?

496
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,240
You're not strong enough to handle it.

497
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,519
Why did you go head-to-head with him?

498
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,640
She is my patient.

499
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,240
I have to protect my patient.

500
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,759
Actually,

501
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,559
when I first saw you,

502
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,400
I was traumatized.

503
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,240
I had never seen a lady

504
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,839
flashing a knife in front of me.

505
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,039
So, every time when I see you,

506
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,240
I feel

507
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,880
a little bit...

508
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,759
But

509
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,039
I think that...

510
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,079
I think that you look quite pretty

511
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,920
when you smile.

512
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
You should smile more.

513
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:18,640
I still have to work.

514
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,359
I'll get going now.

515
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,359
Dress right.

516
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,680
Ready, front!

517
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,680
At ease.

518
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Attention!

519
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,119
Captain Jin.

520
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,960
Everyone is here.
We await your commands.

521
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,759
Go back to the rank.

522
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,440
Yes, Captain.

523
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,000
It's in the middle of the night.

524
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,039
He doesn't have anything for us to do.

525
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,279
He's just playing with us

526
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,319
because he has nothing better to do.

527
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,400
Why were you late?

528
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:08,720
I...

529
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,400
I was in the toilet.

530
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,599
So, I was late.

531
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
As firefighters,

532
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,039
time is the most
fundamental aspect for us.

533
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,039
Firefighters are always in a race
with the God of Death

534
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,279
and various calamities.

535
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,200
We can't be late even for a second.

536
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,960
If you are late

537
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,839
in a fire,

538
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,079
a life will be lost.

539
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
You are making a fuss over nothing.

540
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,680
How dare you talk back to him
when you've made a mistake?

541
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,519
Do you need a beating?

542
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,160
Go back.

543
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,559
Everyone, stand at attention.

544
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:44,920
Do not move.

545
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,319
Zhang Yang, step forward.

546
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,319
Do 100 push-ups right here.

547
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
All of you can only go back

548
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,759
after he's done.

549
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,359
Turn around!

550
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,119
Do not look behind you.

551
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,960
You can only go back
after he finishes his push-ups.

552
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
Why are you wearing so little?

553
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,240
We have to gather here, right?

554
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,039
Put this on.

555
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,400
Do you care about me that much?

556
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,880
As the captain,

557
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,799
I care

558
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,079
about every member

559
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,319
to ensure that they are healthy.

560
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,839
You think too much.

561
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,519
I'm just saying

562
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,319
what I feel.

563
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,920
You are the one

564
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
who's hiding something.

565
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,519
I'm not hiding anything.

566
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,759
If you are jealous,

567
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,880
just admit it.

568
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,960
We have an important training tomorrow.

569
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,079
You should go back.

570
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,559
You can have your jacket back.

571
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,640
No. You...

572
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Goodnight, Captain Jin.

573
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,400
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)
(Out-Patient Department)

574
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm sorry.

575
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
I hurt you when I gave you
the shot just now.

576
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,559
It's okay.

577
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:32,920
I have thick skin.

578
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:33,839
Looks like I need

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
to practice more.

580
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,960
Actually, I'm afraid of needles too.

581
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,519
Don't worry.

582
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,519
It's just a minor wound.

583
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,279
You don't need a suture.

584
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,799
You just need a tetanus shot.

585
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
I heard that you are afraid of needles.

586
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,359
No. I'm not afraid.

587
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,759
No. Actually, I'm the one who's afraid.

588
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,519
Today is my first day at work.

589
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,000
Please bear with me.

590
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,839
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

591
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,559
Just give me the shot.

592
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,200
Go ahead.

593
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,200
Relax.

594
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,599
Relax.

595
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,079
Doctor Zang, you are here.

596
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm just here to inform you

597
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,279
that your stitches
can be removed in three days.

598
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,519
If

599
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:42,799
there's nothing else, I have to go now.

600
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,359
Go now.

601
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,720
See you next time.

602
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,279
The nurse will be removing
your stitches, not me.

604
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,319
Coal.

605
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,359
Come.

606
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,039
Do you miss me?

607
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,240
Have you recovered?

608
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,319
I feel much better now.

609
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,119
Enough.

610
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
You look well.

611
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
Did something good happen
at the hospital?

612
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,119
No.

613
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,000
I just realize

614
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,279
that Doctor Zang is different

615
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:22,880
from my expectation.

616
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,319
Doctor Zang?

617
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,240
Are the two of you
getting along better now?

618
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,720
I think

619
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,160
that she's just cold on the outside.

620
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
But she actually has a kind heart.

621
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,839
Lu Fangqi.

622
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,079
Are you going to betray me?

623
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,880
Nonsense.

624
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,240
I will never betray you.

625
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,880
You are the only

626
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,440
sister-in-law that I'll accept.

627
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,960
After all, you and Captain Jin

628
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,279
are a match made in heaven.

629
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,359
The two of you

630
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,000
are destined to be together.

631
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,839
It's good that you know.

632
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:53,440
Yes.

633
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,759
Rest well.

634
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,319
Okay.

645
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,679
Yes, Captain.

646

Yes, Captain.

647
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,159
Don't look so pleased.

648
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
You are not as fast as Captain Jin.

649
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,280
How fast is he?

650
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,239
How fast is he?

651
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,079
Haven't you seen the news report?

652
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,360
Captain Jin

653
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,000
is China's Spiderman.

654
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,599
Just accept it.

655
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,679
Get ready.

656
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,360
One. Two.

657
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,960
- Wait.
- Three.

658
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,920
Captain Jin.

659
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,000
I have a request.

660
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:33,960
Tell me.

661
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:36,960
I want to compete with you.

662
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,039
Forget it.

663
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,400
How dare you challenge Captain Jin?

664
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,679
I'm not afraid.

665
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,599
Are you afraid, Captain Jin?

666
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,719
Okay.

667
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,880
You can use your legs.

668
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,679
I'll put my legs down

669
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,960
and just climb with my hands.

670
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:50,480
Captain Jin.

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,880
Don't rise to his taunt.

672
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,639
You'll be the judge.

673
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,559

- Great!

- Amazing!

Great, Captain.

- Great!

682

Amazing!

You are fantastic.

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,199
Captain Jin climbed
without using his legs.

686
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,360
Just his upper-body strength.

687
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,159
That was even more difficult.

688
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:11,519
Yes.

689
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,559
Zhang Yang, let me tell you.

690
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,679
Captain Jin went easy on you.

691
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,519
Otherwise, you would have

692
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,679
to look at his butt.

693
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Just to look at his butt.

694
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,280
It wouldn't be too bad too.

695
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,800
You would have to look at his butt.

696
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,199
Yes.

697
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,079
Not bad.

698
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,159

Do you admit defeat now?

706
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,960
You were so arrogant just now, right?

and I'll be faster than him.

712
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,239
Let me tell you.

713
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,360
Captain Jin went easy on you.

Even after 10 years,

715
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,360
you can't defeat him,
let alone two years.

716
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,679
You have no right

717
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,159
to say that as a loser.

718
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,840
Say that again.

719
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,920
Do you think I don't dare?

720
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,079
Loser.

721
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:15,960
Today, I'll teach you

722
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,719
a lesson.

723
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,719
I'll show you what respect means.

724
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,519
This is for you
to replenish your energy.

725
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,840
Thank you.

726
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
You were too excited

727
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,599
just now.

728
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,639
I was just being real.

729
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,679
And it showed.

730
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,079
But you were

731
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,320
not the type

732
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,559
to rise

733
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,760
to someone's taunt.

734
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,039
What happened today?

735
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
I did it on purpose.

736
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,000
The new firefighters

737
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,920
are young and energetic.

738
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
They are too proud of themselves.

739
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,559
I need to tone it down.

740
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,079
Zhang Yang

741
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,039
was enlisted during his university time.

742
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,719
He had good grades

743
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,800
and he is physically fit.

744
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,480
Now that he has been discharged,

745
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,840
he has the potential
to be a great firefighter.

746
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,519
Just now, I climbed with only my hands

747
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,440
to tone down his arrogance

748
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,119
and temper.

749
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,599
Why are you laughing?

750
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm laughing because I have great taste.

751
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,760
You are a good leader

752
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,840
and you are magnanimous.

753

I'm right to be in love
with you for a decade.

00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,079
(Train Hard)
Go!

771
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,559
Zhang Yang, keep it up!

772
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,320
Come down!

773
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,679
Come down!

774
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,360
Lu Fangqi.

775
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:50,880
Here.

776
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,519
Step out.

777
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,320
Yes, Captain.

778
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,360
As the vice-captain,

779
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,800
you didn't stop them in time.

780
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,679
You'll be punished.

781
00:39:59,159 --> 00:39:59,519
Yes, Captain.

782
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,639
Liu Xu.

783
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,239
Here!

784
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,719
Step out.

785
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:03,440
Yes, Captain.

786
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,079
As the squad leader,

787
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,039
you had a dispute
with the new firefighter.

788
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,840
You'll be punished.

789
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,760
Yes, Captain.

790
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,000
Do push-ups

791
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,599
until your shirt
is totally dripping wet.

792
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,360
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

793
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
As for the onlookers,

794
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,519
do 300 push-ups right now.

795
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,400
Start!

796
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,400
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

797
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,360
You, stand up.

798
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,239
We are firefighters.

799
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,280
Our lives

800
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,280
are used to save someone.

801
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,119
We are the main force of rescue.

802
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,320
We are a disciplined service.

803
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,360
We have to follow orders.

804
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,239
We move as a unit.

805
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,400
We can't ruin our pride

806
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,400
as a team

807
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,719
just because of one person's pride.

808
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,280
In a fire,

809
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,079
if someone makes a mistake,

810
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,559
all of your teammates

811
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,159
may die.

812
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,360
Stand here

813
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,280
until they are done with their push-ups.

814
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,440
Mighty is gone.

815
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,039
Champ is gone too.

816
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,920
Coming.

817
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,719
It's so late now. What is it?

818
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,599
Ms. Xu.

819
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:21,639
Well.

820
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,760
Champ and Mighty are gone.

821
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:25,880
We searched the whole training camp.

822
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,400
But we still couldn't find them.

823
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,840
I...

824
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I suspect that they had run off
to the back of the mountain.

825
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:28,760
Well.

826
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,800
What happened?

827
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,119
Did you get into a fight again?

828
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,199
No.

829
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,119
No. I...

830
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:33,639
Do you know

831
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,000
that dogs are very sensitive?

832
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:36,440
Your emotion

833
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,920
will directly affect your dog.

834
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,079
What were you doing?

835
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,159
I'll go and find them now.

836
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,280
Wait.

837
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,400
It's going to rain soon.

838
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,719
The rain will wash away the scents.

839
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:46,800
It'll be harder for them

840
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,519
to find their way back.

841
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,800
