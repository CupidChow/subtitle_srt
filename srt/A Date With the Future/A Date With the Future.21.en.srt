What brings you here?

24
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,716
Why didn't you tell me
you were there that day?

25
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:11,755
And you got injured so badly.

26
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:12,915
Does it hurt?

27
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,075
I'm good now.

28
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:17,556
They're just superficial.

29
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:19,596
I didn't want to worry you.

30
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,475
If Jin Shichuan didn't tell me,

31
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:28,436
I wouldn't have known about this.

32
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:30,836
Don't hide things from me again.

33
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,116
Jin Shichuan did?

34
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:35,955
He asked me to visit you.

35
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:41,195
You're bruised everywhere,

36
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:42,635
yet you said you were fine.

37
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,316
Is Jin Shichuan all right?

38
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:49,355
Have you made up with him?

39
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:53,675
Not yet.

40
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:57,116
His leg hasn't fully recovered yet.

41
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:58,795
Maybe he still has some concerns.

42
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,036
You know what,

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,795
he broke up with me

44
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,276
because his leg was seriously injured.

45
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,635
He could even end up disabled.

46
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,475
He didn't want to be my burden.

47
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,755
That's why he broke up with me.

48
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,515
Though I was moved after knowing the truth,

49
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,116
still, I don't think he should keep
such a serious thing from me.

50
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,515
You know me very well.

51
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:23,156
I've hated dishonesty since I was young.

52
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:53,475
Jin Shichuan,

53
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:55,915
let me take you to a place.

(Ai'er Kindergarten)

55
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,995
I didn't expect to see this piano here

56
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:20,675
after so many years.

57
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,836
I came here recently
and I ran into the Director.

58
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,276
She still remembers me.

59
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,756
I know this piano means a lot to you.

60
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,036
It's getting late.

61
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:14,355
I'll head back.

62
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,516
Jin Shichuan.

63
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,716
When are you going to stop avoiding me?

64
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:24,956
I'm not avoiding you.

65
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,235
Can you please face me and our relationship?

66
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,036
I need some time.

67
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:31,516
Until my leg...

68
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:32,756
You don't need time.

69
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,036
Right now.

70
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,435
Let's make up.

71
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,196
What if my leg can't recover?

72
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,836
I'll look after you for the rest of your life.

00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:40,116
It's the celebrity Yu Shishi.

188
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:40,675
She's so gorgeous.

189
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,356
You have a girlfriend?

190
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:47,356
Yes.

191
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:53,435
That's a pity.

192
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,795
You know, I always thought

193
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,996
that you like Xu Lai.

194
00:14:59,315 --> 00:14:59,955
Mom.

195
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:02,356
Eat.

196
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,555
I do like her.

197
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,675
But she didn't take an interest in me.

198
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,876
What's your problem?

199
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:19,356
Huo is so nice.

200
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,075
Young and capable.

201
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:22,315
He treats you well.

202
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,315
Plus, you've been friends
since you were young.

203
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,876
Gosh, you indeed have your nose in the air.

204
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,516
Listen, Xu Lai.

205
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:30,396
You can't find a better man

206
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,555
if you miss out on Huo.

207
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,396
We all agreed to just be friends.

208
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:34,835
So, don't bother.

209
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:35,555
Let's eat.

210
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,036
Yeah.

211
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:38,595
Xu Lai and I have agreed on that.

212
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:40,675
Friendship lasts longer
than love, anyway.

213
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,715
No one can know
what will happen in the future.

214
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,276
Developing from friends to lovers
is possible too.

215
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,116
Well,

216
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:59,036
let's not meddle in their matter.

217
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:00,795
She rarely comes back home.

218
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:03,555
Yet you're nagging at her again.

219
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:04,756
Just give her a break.

220
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,315
Are you blaming me
for Xu Lai not coming back?

221
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:09,036
You're her father.

222
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,396
Do you ever care about her?

223
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,156
When have I

224
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,636
stopped caring for my daughter?

225
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,876
I'm trying to say
that we have Huo here today,

226
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,075
so watch your words.

227
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,715
Why am I not watching my words?

228
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:22,116
Let me ask you this, Xu Chengyun.

229
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,075
Where were you
when I gave birth to Xu Lai?

230
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,675
Have you ever cared about her
all these years?

231
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,036
There's a modern saying about this.

232
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,835
It's widowhood marriage.

233
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:33,236
Why said so?

234
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,276
I'm not dead yet.

235
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,516
I'm not talking about you.

236
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:36,516
We've already divorced long ago.

237
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:37,555
You are not my husband anymore.

238
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:38,795
Lin Quan.

239
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,996
Can we not bring the past up today?

240
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,315
Do you want to start this?

241
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,476
What's wrong with bringing this up?

242
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:47,236
Is that a problem?

243
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,156
It's not the right time.

244
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:48,595
Why not?

245
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,516
Didn't you start all this?

246
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:50,756
I...

247
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:51,435
You even slammed the table.

248
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:52,715
We have a guest here.

249
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:57,595
Huo.

250
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:58,516
I'm done.

251
00:16:59,156 --> 00:16:59,555
I'll get going.

252
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:00,835
Lai.

253
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:02,555
Xu Lai.

254
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,315
It's hard to get a cab at this hour.

255
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,196
I think I should give Xu Lai a ride.

256
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:11,595
Huo.

257
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:18,276
Xu Lai.

258
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:20,315
Don't be angry.

259
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:21,355
Your mom didn't mean that.

260
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:23,555
I'm used to it.

261
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:24,756
But you're here today.

262
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:25,875
That was unbecoming.

263
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:28,795
Actually, it's fine like this.

264
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,436
Sparring with each other
all these years.

265
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,956
Because they have affection
for each other.

266
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,036
In that case,

267
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:35,835
they wouldn't have divorced.

268
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:37,916
I'm sorry about tonight.

269
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,315
We ruin your dinner.

270
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,476
Please don't say that.

271
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:43,835
By the way,

272
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,756
why didn't you tell her

273
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:47,315
you are seeing Jin Shichuan?

274
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,595
If I were to tell them about that,

275
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,315
they would want to meet him immediately.

276
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,835
His leg hasn't completely healed yet.

277
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,676
So, I'll wait until he's discharged
from the hospital.

278
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,236
Besides, I know my mom too well.

279
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,395
She always wants me
to find a man who works nine-to-five

280
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:04,196
with two days every weekend.

281
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:05,155
And more, he must be a family man.

282
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,555
If she learns about Jin Shichuan's injury,

283
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:09,595
she'll have more reasons to object.

284
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,795
If she really does,

285
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:14,716
what are you going to do?

286
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:16,155
I will play with my wit.

287
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:18,996
As long as we're determined enough,

288
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,075
no one can tear us apart.

289
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:26,756
It's getting late.

290
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:27,395
I'll send you home.

291
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:28,196
No need.

292
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,956
I'm going to the hospital
for Jin Shichuan.

293
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,075
You should be careful.

294
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:31,956
You just recovered.

295
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:33,115
Get home and rest early.

296
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:43,395
- Oh, right.
- Xu Lai...

297
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,676
If my mom calls you again,

298
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,795
just hang up.

299
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,115
I don't want to trouble you again.

300
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,756
It was a wonderful dinner,

301
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,236
yet you ruined it.

302
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,075
Why don't you think
it was you who ruined it?

303
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:11,956
Why me?

304
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:12,795
Did I ruin that?

305
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:13,835
Listen up, Xu Chengyun.

306
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:14,956
Just looking at you annoys me.

307
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:17,236
Go pack up and move out.

308
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,315
Why should I move?

309
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,595
I've paid the rent.

310
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:26,036
I'm entitled to stay here.

311
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:29,436
Is that a problem?

312
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,795
You're too thick-skinned.

313
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:32,555
We've been divorced for so long,

314
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,196
and you're still hanging around here.

315
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:35,956
What do you mean by that?

316
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,196
I paid the rent.

317
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,196
Of course, I have the right
to stay here.

318
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:41,756
I'm not leaving this house,

319
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:42,996
even if we've divorced.

320
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:45,835
Not only that, I'll eat here too.

321
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,036
I haven't finished eating yet.

322
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:49,716
I'm not done yet.

323
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:50,916
Get off.

324
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,676
I made this for the children, not you.

325
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,210
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)

326
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,075
I thought you weren't coming today.

327
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:26,236
I went home for dinner.

328
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:27,676
The dinner had barely begun,

329
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,036
and my parent started a fight already.

330
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:36,875
As far back as I can remember,

331
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:38,436
they've been fighting all the time

332
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,516
and it never stops.

333
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:48,476
When I was fifteen,

334
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:50,956
they got divorced.

335
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,635
Later, when my dad returned
from the frontier,

336
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,395
he insisted on moving back home.

337
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,276
Up till now, he pays the rent
for my mom every month.

338
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,516
Still, they fight every day.

339
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,315
Sometimes, I feel sorry
about your upbringing.

340
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,635
But sometimes, I envy you.

341
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:17,875
Envy me?

342
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,795
I envy that your family never breaks apart

343
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:21,635
despite the non-stop arguing.

344
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,315
At the age of ten, I was bereaved.

345
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:30,036
So I try so badly to recall my parents' faces

346
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,716
because I'm afraid
that I might forget them one day.

347
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,115
Well, let's not get into this.

348
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:39,996
Let's talk about us.

349
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,436
Us?

350
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:44,916
We're not going to fight.

351
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:47,436
If there's one day you ticked me off,

352
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:48,716
I'll...

353
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,196
What will you do?

354
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:05,075
Are you sure you want
to punish me like this?

355
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:46,236
Good morning.

356
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,155
Am I hurting you?

357
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:10,395
No.

358
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:14,555
You still keep this hair tie with you.

359
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,716
This is my lucky charm.

360
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:18,875
Give it back to me later.

361
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:43,436
Don't run.

362
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:46,276
Well...

363
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,075
Captain Jin.

364
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:06,756
I didn't see anything.

365
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:07,476
No need to feel shy.

366
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:09,996
Are you so free?

367
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:10,795
You come to the hospital so often.

368
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,315
I sent the wounded here.

369
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:13,795
So I stop by to visit you.

370
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:14,835
Because I care for you.

371
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,595
You're not here for Captain Jin,

372
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,196
but for Zang Qiu, right?

373
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:23,875
Go ahead and pursue her.

374
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:24,516
I'll go to bat for you.

375
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,676
Even an iceberg will melt eventually.

376
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,516
I also hope to see Zang Qiu happy.

377
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,236
But I must remind you

378
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,756
that Zang Qiu won't open her heart so easily.

379
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,155
You need to think it through.

380
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:35,996
I've thought it through.

381
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,676
I have a will and I'm determined.

382
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:39,916
Left face.

383
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:41,395
Destination,

384
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:43,115
Zang Qiu's office.

385
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,115
Move.

386
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,155
One, two, one.

387
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:49,875
Enough. We're in the hospital.

388
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,640
(Outsiders aren't allowed to enter
the operating room. Keep quiet.)

389
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:17,436
Dr. Zang.

390
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:18,956
Someone called you just now.

391
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:19,835
Who was it?

392
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:20,595
No idea.

393
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:22,436
It's a former patient of yours.

394
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:23,635
He has something to give you.

395
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,835
He said to meet you tomorrow at 2 p.m.

396
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,236
in the backyard.

397
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:30,756
Got it.

398
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,276
I'm leaving.

399
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:14,595
Why are you all sweaty?

400
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:17,436
It's fine.

401
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:21,196
This is for you.

402
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,436
Why give my daisies?

403
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,516
Because I believe you'll like it.

404
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:40,196
Do you know

405
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,835
it reminds me of Fang Huai?

406
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:47,196
I just wish you to be happy.

407
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,795
I saw the picture of you and Fang Huai,

408
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,075
you held daisies and smiled happily.

409
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,635
So, I bought them...

410
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:56,916
Don't you like me?

411
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:58,716
But why are you doing this?

412
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,476
It makes me remember him even more.

413
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:07,516
Don't forget him if you can't.

414
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,155
Don't force yourself.

415
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,395
You were happy in the past.

416
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:20,555
Zang Qiu.

417
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:23,355
I like you.

418
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:26,436
So I want to make you happy.

419
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:30,595
Not just the present you,

420
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,075
I also like you from the past.

421
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:36,236
As long as...

422
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:38,555
As long as

423
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:39,236
I can make you happy,

424
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,115
I'm willing to do anything.

425
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:43,196
Even if...

426
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:49,236
Even if for the past
that belongs to you and him.

427
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:58,835
This is for you.

428
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:04,996
Lu Fangqi.

429
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:08,996
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

430
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,196
But I'm sorry.

431
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,595
I can't accept this.

432
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:31,676
Lu Fangqi.

433
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:33,395
Lu Fangqi.

434
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,476
You're awake.

435
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:04,956
Dr. Zang.

436
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,355
Are you not aware
that you're allergic to pollen?

437
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,276
I...I know.

438
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:16,196
I've had this allergy
since I was little.

439
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:18,516
I can't handle flowers.

440
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:19,996
Why did you give me flowers then?

441
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:21,436
Because I want to see you smile.

442
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:22,875
When you held the daisies,

443
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,155
your smile looked gorgeous.

444
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:30,196
This allergic incident is worth it,
anyway.

445
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:32,996
Scratch that.

446
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:34,196
Don't do this again.

447
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,315
You're so careless.

448
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,036
Why did you touch flowers

449
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:46,196
when you're allergic to them?

450
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,835
Luckily, Dr. Zang gave you immediate assistance.

451
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,395
Otherwise, it could get worse.

452
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:53,476
It wasn't a dream.

453
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,916
Nurse, I have a question.

454
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,476
During the immediate assistance,

455
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:00,756
did she and me...

456
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,555
Do you mean artificial respiration?

457
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,315
Of course.

458
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,276
Without any equipment onsite,

459
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:08,916
it's necessary to do artificial respiration.

460
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:10,875
Thank you.

461
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,315
Thank you.

462
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:20,756
What's wrong with you?

463
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:21,276
Dr. Zang.

464
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:22,276
Let me ask you this.

465
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,236
When you gave me artificial
respiration just now,

466
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:25,956
did we kiss?

467
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,595
What? Kiss?

468
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:29,155
Wait.

469
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:31,676
How can you see that as a kiss?

470
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:33,716
I'm a doctor and that came spontaneously.

471
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:34,635
Don't overthink.

472
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:35,276
Why deny it?

473
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:36,196
We did kiss.

474
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:36,635
You...

475
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:37,756
Keep your voice down.

476
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,996
People will hear us.

477
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:43,916
What are you doing?

478
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:44,916
Put me down.

479
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:46,236
I don't care.

480
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:47,916
You did kiss me.

481
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:48,716
You kissed me.

482
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:49,756
From now on, I'm yours.

483
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:51,036
Put me down.

484
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:52,635
Put me down.

485
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:58,115
Lu Fangqi, I'm warning you not to cross the line.

486
00:30:58,716 --> 00:30:59,635
Otherwise, I'll punch you.

487
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:08,835
Dr. Zang.

488
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:10,476
Lu Fangqi suddenly ran out.

489
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:11,436
Did you see him?

490
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:13,996
No.

491
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,580
(Inpatient Department)

492
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:24,276
Don't be nervous.

493
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,075
Your crutch is here.

494
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,075
No matter what, you have me.

495
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:29,756
I'm not nervous.

496
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:32,236
You look more nervous than me.

497
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:32,756
Look.

498
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:34,196
Your hand is shaking.

499
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,276
The two of you, come with me.

500
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:55,756
Does it look bad?

501
00:31:59,236 --> 00:31:59,875
It'll be fine.

502
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,795
Look how nervous you are.

503
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:10,716
Congratulations, Jin Shichuan.

504
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:11,916
Full recovery.

505
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:12,795
You're good to go.

506
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,956
But do come back for regular checkups.

507
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,476
Thank you.

508
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:49,716
I need to talk to Zang Qiu.

509
00:32:59,196 --> 00:32:59,756
Thank you.

510
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:01,996
Thank you for curing my leg.

511
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,196
Regarding Fang Huai...

512
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:06,236
Stop it.

513
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:11,875
You should move on.

514
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:15,476
It has been years.

515
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:22,835
Back then, I stopped you

516
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,476
because he didn't want you to see his face.

517
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,516
At that time,

518
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:36,355
he had burns over 80 percent of his body.

519
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,676
He said it'd be too cruel for you

520
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:43,996
if you saw him in that way.

521
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:52,595
He wanted to leave the most beautiful memory

522
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,716
for you,

523
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,436
not that wounded face.

524
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:12,195
So, please believe

525
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,755
that he truly loved you.

526
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,275
Also, I hope you can understand.

527
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,836
This is his final request to me.

528
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:32,956
If it were Xu Lai,

529
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:36,115
I would do the same too.

530
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:45,755
You should move on.

Good dog.

Peace.

Good boy.

545
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:46,595
Captain Jin.

546
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:47,635
Captain Jin is back.

547
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:48,316
Captain Jin.

548
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:48,876
Captain Jin.

549
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:49,836
Captain Jin is back.

550
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,516
- Captain Jin.
- Captain Jin.

551
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:57,436
- Captain Jin.
- Captain Jin.

552
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:58,635
Why didn't you inform us
that you're out?

553
00:35:58,755 --> 00:35:59,635
Captain Jin, I've missed you so much.

554
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:00,595
You're finally back.

555
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:01,796
Captain Jin, have you recovered?

556
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:02,235
Do you know

557
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:03,316
how worried we were about you?

558
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:03,675
Captain Jin.

559
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,836
We were counting the days until you're back.

560
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:07,036
I want you back so badly.

561
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:07,996
Smooth-tongued.

562
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:08,916
Enough.

563
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:10,836
Anyway, I'm back.

564
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:12,075
And I've fully recovered.

565
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:13,155
From today on,

566
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:13,956
I'm back on the team.

567
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,996
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

568
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:25,916
Sir.

569
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:26,796
Come in.

570
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:31,876
Commissioner.

571
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,235
How's your body now?

572
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:40,675
I'm almost recovered.

573
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:42,755
So, I came to report to you
as soon as I'm discharged.

574
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:49,755
Shichuan.

575
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:51,436
Because of our profession,

576
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:52,675
we encounter dangers very often.

577
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,436
So, it's equally important to protect others

578
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:57,235
and ourselves too.

579
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:58,836
I'll be careful.

580
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:04,115
When you were in the hospital,

581
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,595
I heard that Xu Lai
was looking after you.

582
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:11,356
Shichuan.

583
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:14,755
Xu Lai is all heart

584
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:16,075
and she didn't abandon you.

585
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,715
You must cherish her.

586
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,075
Failing that, I'll give you a good spanking.

587
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,036
Understood, Commissioner.

588
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:28,635
By the way, since you're on the mend,

589
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:29,956
take some days off.

590
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,036
No need to return to duty now.

591
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:33,836
I want to take one day off.

592
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,595
I want to take Peace out.

593
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,115
Go ahead.

594
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
(Jin Shichuan)

595
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:54,996
Yes?

596
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:55,755
Hello.

597
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,195
Will you work late today?

598
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:58,595
No.

599
00:37:58,916 --> 00:37:59,316
What's the matter?

600
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:00,836
Let's make a date.

601
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:05,675
Sure.

602
00:38:19,356 --> 00:38:20,396
The air at the seaside is fresh.

603
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:21,476
Take a deep breath.

604
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:23,436
How do you feel now?

605
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:29,996
I've been living in my own world for years.

606
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,396
All that occupies my mind

607
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:36,436
is how to be a good firefighter

608
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,195
and save people.

609
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:44,635
I've never thought of saving myself.

610
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:49,275
But you showed up.

611
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,956
I have a greedy idea.

612
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:00,836
I want to serve my duty

613
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:03,635
and I want to protect you too.

614
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,755
Do you know how hard it is

615
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:13,876
to be a firefighter's spouse?

616
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:16,836
They have to endure the hardships

617
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:18,996
that they don't deserve.

618
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:24,876
But I promise you that I'll try my very best

619
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:29,316
to protect you from hardships.

620
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,595
Likewise, I'll try my very best

621
00:39:33,396 --> 00:39:34,476
to protect myself

622
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:37,436
and not let you worry.

623
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:45,916
Will you...

624
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,195
Yes, I will.

625
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:01,275
What?

626
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:02,715
I said I will.

627
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:06,916
I haven't asked you yet.

628
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:08,195
I will.

629
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:39,755
Madam.

630
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:41,155
A quick update.

631
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:42,595
I've returned to the dorm.

632
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,195
Madam?

633
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:45,876
Why do you call me that?

634
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,356
You're my family,

635
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:48,595
so you're my leader too.

636
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:49,916
When I face my leader,

637
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:52,396
I must obey orders and report at any time.

638
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,036
Well done.

639
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:00,436
Glad to hear that.

640
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:02,715
May I go to bed now?

641
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,715
Request approved.

642
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:05,036
We were outside the whole day.

643
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:05,876
Get rest early.

644
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:06,876
Madam.

645
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:08,916
When I'm with you,

646
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:10,155
I never feel tired,

647
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:11,516
not even a second.

648
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:13,075
Don't worry about me, Madam.

649
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,796
I summon you to go to bed right now.

650
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,956
Yes, Madam.

651
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:21,996
You should sleep early too.

652
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:22,916
Good night.

653
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:34,635
Come in!

654
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:38,916
Captain Jin asked us to go in.

655
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:39,916
You go first.

656
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:41,555
Come on.

657
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:51,316
Attention.

658
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,436
When did you all stand there?

659
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:19,796
Captain Jin.

660
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,075
To be precise,

661
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:24,075
we've been there

662
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:25,595
since you made reports to your leader.

663
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:28,075
Madam.

664
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:29,956
I want to go to bed now.

665
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:30,755
Night-night.

666
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:32,516
- Go ahead.
- Good night.

667
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:33,555
Miss you.

668
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:46,275
I officially announce

669
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:49,155
that Xu Lai and I are dating.

670
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:50,635
Starting today,

671
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,115
