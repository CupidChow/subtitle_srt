You said you don't care about me.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
I thought you wouldn't come.

32
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,640
Where's your wound?

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Aren't you injured?

34
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:10,360
Here.

35
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,360
I cut my finger

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,200
while I was cutting vegetables.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,320
Look.

38
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,920
I made all these for you.

39

I haven't served the soup.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm afraid it might get cold

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,760
so I am simmering it.

42
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:21,519
This dish.

43
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,239
These few dishes are spicy cuisine.

If you like,

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,920
I will always make them for you.

There's no need.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
It won't happen again.

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Do you know how much

51
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,200
I hate people joking about their lives,

52
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,799
especially on a day like today?

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Today is...

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,119
Sorry.

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,320
I will never joke about

56
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,279
something like this anymore.

57
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,999
I just wanted to find a reason

58
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,239
to see whether you care about me.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Care about you?

60
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,119
That is why I said you are childish.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,119
Stop following me.

63

Zang...

64
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,519
I didn't expect her to be so heartless.

65
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,040
Since she left,

66
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:23,360

You did so much

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,640
and she didn't feel touched.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,519
It means both of you are
not destined to be together.

72
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,200
Don't you like doctors?

73
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,040
I have a cousin
who is studying in the medical school.

74
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,080
She is nice and pretty.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,239
Let me introduce her to you.

76
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,239
I don't like doctors.

77
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,480
I only like Zang Qiu.

78
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:09,640
Fangqi.

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,399
We must eat, right?

80
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,160
I even brought the dishes back.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm not eating.

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,399
I can't eat.

83
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,640
This is tomorrow's work plan.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,599
What's wrong with him?

85
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:23,279
He lost his soul.

86
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,440
Whose dishes are these?

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,080
Let me have some.

88
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,839
I'm so hungry.

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240

Lu Fangqi.

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,560
I just want to take a few bites.

92
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:36,560
Is that necessary?

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
Why are you protecting them?

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,959
These are not ordinary dishes.

95
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,240
They are my heart.

96
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,200
Do you want to eat my heart?

97
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,959
I'm heartbroken.

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
Lu Fangqi,

99
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,279
do you want to be in a relationship so badly?

100
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:49,200
Visit the doctor if you are crazy.

101
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,440
What's wrong with him?

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,959
Lu Fangqi learned how to cook
for Zang Qiu.

103
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,719
He wanted to surprise her.

104
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,760
So he lied to her saying he was injured.

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,039
When she came,

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,159
she was not touched

107
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,680
and even scolded him.

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
When did it happen?

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,599
Today.

110
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,240
At night.

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,919
No wonder Zang Qiu would feel sad.

112
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:14,359
Why?

113
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,039
Today is the day Fang Huai passed away.

115
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:22,959

127
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,279
I can't sleep.

No.

133
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,599
I always chatted with you

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,039
when you needed me.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,919
Now I'm heartbroken
and need someone to comfort me.

136
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,279
Just chat for a while with me.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,919
You can also let me stay in the room.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,719

Zang Qiu will really ignore me?

142
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,399
I don't know.

143

150
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,479
Put in some good words.

I don't know

152
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,279
if Zang Qiu will forgive you.

153

But if she is very important to you,

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,959

Although she won't say it,

158
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,640
it doesn't mean she doesn't need it.

you can go to work now

You didn't expect it, right?

192
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,280
A little temptation is enough to make someone

193
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,479
totally betray you.

194
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,040
Zhou.

195
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:57,639
Ms. Xu.

196
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,879
Why did you do that?

197
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,280
I don't know what you are talking about.

198
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,359
I knew you sent the script.

199
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:13,759
Ms. Xu.

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,879
I've been working with you for so long.

201
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,720
I've always been working hard

202
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,560
but I'm not even on the list

203
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,920
to become an official employee.

204
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,479
I've finally reached this point.

205
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,400
I can't lose.

206
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I have to stay.

207
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,119
Zhou.

208
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:29,879
Do you know you almost

209
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,119
killed someone for doing that?

210
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,999
Don't you feel guilty at all?

211
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,800
Wang Yi deserved it.

212
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,160
He did illegal expansion

213
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,359
and framed Ms. Zheng, right?

214
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,400
Besides,

215
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
you insisted on investigating the truth.

216
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,200
Everyone was supposed to be dealt with normally.

217
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Wang Yi wouldn't have committed suicide

218
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,400
and his wife wouldn't have
gone through premature birth.

219
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,959
Ms. Zheng wouldn't have been abandoned by his son.

220
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:56,792
Even without the report,

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
are you sure everything wouldn't happen?

222
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,400
Is this the result

223
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
you want by seeking the truth?

224
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,879
Once your report was published,

225
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,359
my son had nowhere to go out there.

226
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,520
He blamed me and cut ties

227
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
with me completely.

228
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,119
(Where are you?)

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,479
(I'll go look for you.)

230

(Resignation)

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm here to resign.

232
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:10,599
Resign?

233
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Have you thought it through?

234
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
There isn't a big difference

235
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,400
between your report

236
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,800
and the truth

237
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,280
verified by relevant departments.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,999
Our station doesn't want to punish you.

239
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,359
All this while,

240
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,200
I've always thought

241
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,040
reporters should seek for the truth.

242
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,359
However, my report this time

243
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,839
has hurt everyone.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,479
I started to doubt

245
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,920
what a reporter should do.

246
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:53,072
Without faith,

247
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,599
I don't know

248
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,599
how I should do my work.

249
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
I'll keep

250
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,719
your tag and resignation letter for now,

251
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,680

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,199
Sorry.

379
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,119
I escaped.

380
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,760
I don't want to see anyone right now.

381
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,639
This is not your fault.

382
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,520
Stop punishing yourself, all right?

383
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,480
The result is due to my fault.

384
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,119
Because of my report,

385
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,560
I have hurt people.

386
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,839
No matter if I'm right or wrong,

387
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,119
other people got hurt because of me.

388
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,359
That's a fact.

389
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,199
I don't know

390
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,320
what I'm seeking now.

391
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:19,639
Don't think about it.

392
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,599
If you don't know now,

393
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,720
don't think about it.

394
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
You will find it one day.

395
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,760
I will always be here.

396
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,439
I applied for leave to travel with you.

397
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,080
Look.

398
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,320
Is this place different from ten years ago?

399
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
Ten years ago.

400
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,760
That was my toughest moment.

401
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,639
It was also my warmest moment.

402
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,199
You and Windchase

403
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,720
accompanied me through that moment.

404
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,199
But what if

405
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,599
I can't recover from it

406
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,320
this time?

407
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,399
I will always be by your side then.

408
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:09,399
Look.

409
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,439
Look.

410
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,800
This place was a ruin

411
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:14,839
but it is filled with hope.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Even a city can be rebuilt.

413
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,159
Why can't you, right?

414
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
I will be with you

415
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,040
and rebuild your world.

416
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,639
Take it slow. There's no rush.

417
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:29,560
Don't be afraid.

418
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,040
Run!

419
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,320
This way!

420
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,199
Hurry!

421
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,800
Hurry!

422
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,800
Run to a spacious area!

423
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,560
Careful!

424
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,520
Run outside! Hurry!

425
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,760
Hurry!

426
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,919
Be careful of falling debris!

427
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,839
Go over there!

428
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,839
Stop moving!

429
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,320
Be careful.

430
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,199
Run!

431
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,240
Hurry!

432
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,040
Run outside!

433
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:52,480
Move!

434
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:53,760
Hurry!

435
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,159
Leave this place!

436
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,399
Go over there!

437
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,800
Hurry!

438
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,399
Move!

439
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,639
Leave your luggage! Move!!

440
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:18,919
Hurry!

441
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:41,520
Yes.

442
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm in Huining.

443
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:45,639
I contacted the local fire brigade.

444
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,879
I will join the rescue.

445
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,520
All right.

446
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,760
I'll meet them at the command centre.

447
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:52,960
Understood.

448
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,080
There was an earthquake ten years ago.

449
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,280
Many buildings have been fortified,

450
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,199
so there won't be too much damage.

451
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:13,000
Don't worry.

452
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
However, the other regions

453
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,119
are not looking as good.

454
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,679
I received an order

455
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,839
to work with the local fire brigade

456
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,720
in rescue operations.

457
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,280
Lu Fangqi is on his way with the team.

458
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,599
I'll find someone to come here

459
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,119
and bring you back to Huaigang.

460
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,399
I'm not going back.

461
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:31,919
I want to be with you.

462
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
You can't risk your life with me.

463
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,320
I'm a reporter.

464
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,639
I know you are a reporter.

465
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,280
You are an excellent reporter.

466
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,280
However, we still need to

467
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,800
follow our superior's orders, right?

468
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,439
You also want me to rescue more people

469
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,520
without other worries, right?

470
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't worry.

471
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
I'll come to find you soon.

472
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,359
All right?

473
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,399
Be good.

474
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:05,280
I'm leaving.

475
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,159
You must be safe.

476
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,599
For you,

477
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,960
I will protect myself and not let you worry.

478
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,119
Be good. Don't run around.

479
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,119
I'll get someone to pick you up,
all right?

480
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,359
Be good.

481
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:29,240
Here.

482
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:51,960
Attention!

483
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
Dress right!

484
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,800
Eyes front!

485
00:25:58,568 --> 00:25:59,048
At ease!

486
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:00,439
Attention!

487
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,560
Reporting, Commander!

488
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,839
The team has gathered!

489
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,800
Your orders, please!

490
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:11,520
Fall in!

491
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Yes!

492
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:20,919
Comrades,

493
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,119
a magnitude 7.8 earthquake

494
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,439
just occurred in Huining.

495
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,040
The rescue cannot be delayed.

496
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,679
The branch orders

497
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,480
to gather the heavy-duty
earthquake rescue team

498
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,960
to gather and head to the disaster area.

499
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,439
Jin Shichuan is waiting for all of you

500
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,119
in the disaster area.

501
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,439
This mission is very important.

502
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:37,800
You must do your best.

503
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,240
Is everyone confident?

504
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,280
- Yes!
- Yes!

505
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,040
Good.

506
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
Pack your bags and bring your rescue dogs.

507
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,560
Prepare to depart at any time.

508
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,439
- Yes!
- Yes!

510
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:01,320
What are you doing?

511
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:02,359
Why are you looking like this?

512
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,639
The earthquake rescue team

513
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,040
will go to Huining to assist in the rescue.

514
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,879
I'm here to take medical supplies

515
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,639
and to tell you about it.

516
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,639
Just give me a call.

517
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,879
Why did you come here?

518
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,040
I know

519
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,399
you hate people leaving
without telling you.

520
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't want you to worry so

521
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm reporting to you.

522
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,560
Who is worrying about you?

523
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,800
I'll be late.

524
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
I need to gather at the brigade.

525
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,520
I guarantee

526
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,000
to come back safely for your sake.

Eyes front!

569
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:33,839
At ease!

570
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,080
Attention!

571
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,560
Reporting, Commander!

572
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,599
The team for Huining's earthquake relief
from Emergency Response Unit,

573
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:47,560
six members,

574
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,561
six present!

575
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,439
This is the unit leader, Lu Fangqi!

576
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,480
Your orders, please!

577
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,760
At ease!

578
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,439
Yes!

579
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,599
At ease!

580
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,230
(Nipping the fire in the bud,
Be disciplined and obey the rules)

581
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,119
Comrades.

582
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
This is a tough mission.

583
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,159
Remember the policy guidelines

584
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,560
and complete your mission.

585
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,080
- Loyalty to the party!
- Loyalty to the party!

586
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,240
- Be disciplined!
- Be disciplined!

587
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:22,679
- Through the fire and the flames!
- Through the fire and the flames!

588
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,199
- Dedicated to the people!
- Dedicated to the people!

589
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,040
Good.

590
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,520
I'll be waiting for you
to return safely.

591
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:30,606
- Yes!
- Yes!

592
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:31,760
Attention!

593
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,040
Left turn!

594
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,879
Gather and move out!

595
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
Salute!

596
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:46,960
Up!

597
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,599
Up!

598
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,199
Tell me honestly.

599
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,720
Did you go to see Dr. Zang just now?

600
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,232
You are reluctant to leave

601
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,960
after meeting her, right?

602
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,240
That won't do.

603
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,439
I must go.

604
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,720
I want to become a man she is proud of.

605
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,639
We will come back safely.

606
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,439
Our mission is very tough this time.

607
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,159
But I believe

608
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,080
the earthquake rescue team

609
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,040
is an elite firefighting team.

610
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,359
We must complete our mission.

611
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,480
Let's stay fully focused

612
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,040
to ensure the safety of the people.

613
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,439
Check your lighting equipment,

614
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,359
personal protection equipment,

615
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,800
and rescue equipment.

616
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,520
Make sure
you have sufficient supplies.

617
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,520
- Yes!
- Yes!

618
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,439
Move out!

619
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,630
(Communication Station)

620
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,199
Over here.

621
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,800
Sure.

622
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,560
Welcome.

623
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,199
Thank you.

624
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:47,000
Put it here.

625
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:47,800
Let me do it.

626
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,370
Hello.

627
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:49,480
I want to apply as a volunteer.

628
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:51,399
Miss.

629
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,960
We are currently

630
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,720
transporting and receiving supplies.

631
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
You can't move them.

632
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:57,480
We don't need your help at the moment.

633
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,760
The Earthquake Detection Bureau

634
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,599
has detected several aftershocks coming soon.

635
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,240
It is dangerous.

636
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,240
You should go back.

637
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,800
I...

638
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:05,359
Sorry.

639
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,799
Hello.

640
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,080
(I already met up)

641
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,719
(with Lu Fangqi.)

642
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,520
(Have you returned to Huaigang safely?)

643
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,279
I'm still in Huining.

644
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,000
What about you?

645
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:16,560
What happened?

646
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,040
Is everything all right?

647
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,679
A reporter got hurt

648
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,080
while reporting.

649
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,400
How is she?

650
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,279
I'm hanging up.

651
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,000
She's safe

652
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,400
but her leg is seriously injured.

653
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,719
We can't do any reports anymore.

654
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,199
What should we do?

655
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,679
I can do it.

656
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:33,799
You?

657
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,840
The live broadcast will begin soon.

658
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,440
It's too late to get someone here.

659
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,080
What should we do?

660
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,199
Hello.

661
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm a reporter from Huaigang TV.

662
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:45,799
I can help if you need it.

663
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,080
You?

664
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,319
Do you have a Press Card?

665
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,720
(Press Card, Huaigang TV Station)

666
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,199
All right.

667
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,080
Call our station

668
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,599
and explain the situation.

669
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,279
We'll let her try.

670
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,719
Everyone,

671
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,599
I am the frontline reporter, Xu Lai.

672
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,880
I'll be reporting live

673
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,159
for everyone.

674
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,799
Behind me right now

675
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
is the disaster area
of the Huining earthquake.

676
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,870
(Huaigang TV Station)

677
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,199
Our station has decided

678
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,159
to send a suitable reporter

679
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,599
to do a frontline report at Huining.

680
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,960
Chief.

681
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,319
Let me go.

682
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm experienced.

683
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,119
I'm sure I can

684
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,239
report some breaking news

685
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,040
and perform well.

686
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,799
Frontline reporting is a tough task.

687
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,719
I will consider the candidate well.

688
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:37,880
Besides me,

689
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,560
is there anyone else more suitable in the team?

690
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:41,440
Yes.

691
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,239
I already have a suitable candidate.

692
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,080
Qin Ye is obviously against me.

693
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:51,679
Ms. Xin.

694
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,960
It is obvious that Chief

695
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,239
doesn't trust you.

696
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,319
So what?

697
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,159
He will leave soon.

698
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,679
Xu Lai is not here.

699
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,799
The position of chief

700
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,880
will soon be mine.

701
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,279
Don't you know where Xu Lai is?

702
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,480
I can't contact her.

703
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:09,599
Chief, look.

704
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,599
Isn't this Xu Lai?

705
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,599
She is in Huining.

706
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,080

(I'll be reporting live)

715

(for everyone.)

716
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,159
What urgent matter do you have

717
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,199
for coming to Huining?

(The disaster area
of the Huining earthquake.)

719
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,239
You can't even reach Mofang Town

720
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,880
if I didn't fetch you
with my supply truck.

721

(Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.)

722

I'm going there

723

to do something important.

724
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,279
Thank you.

725
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:51,799
Hello, Xu Lai.

726
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,319
I saw your news.

727
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,239
I'm on my way to Mofang Town right now.

728
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
I will bring you

729
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,119
back to Huaigang safely.

730
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:00,360
(Huo.)

731
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,239
(This is a disaster area.)

732
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,040
(The roads are blocked.)

733
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,239
(You don't need to come here.)

734
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:05,199
(I can't go back now.)

735
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,239
This time,

736
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
I won't let you stay in Huining alone.

737
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,759
Wait for me.

738
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
You didn't have time to prepare

739
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,319
and got appointed suddenly,

740
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
yet you can still report calmly

741
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,799
in a professional manner.

742
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,080
You are amazing.

743
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,799

But I am no longer a reporter now.

747

What did you say?

748
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,440
It's nothing.

749
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Just give me the form. Thank you.

750
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,360
Here you go.

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,700
(Earthquake Disaster Relief
Volunteer Application Form, Job)

752
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,759
Hello, Chief.

753
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,880
I saw your news report.

754
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,480
I know you are in Huining.

755
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,960
(Why did you go to Huining suddenly?)

756
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,480
I wanted to travel

757
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,119
but I encountered an earthquake.

758
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:32,279
This might be the destiny.

759
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:34,599
(I have been trying)

760
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,920
(to contact you recently.)

761
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,560
(The first thing is to tell you)

762
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,679
(that the TV station won't hold you
responsible for Wang Yi's incident.)

763
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,239
The second thing is that the TV station

764
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,719
is looking for a frontline reporter to report

765
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,119
the Huining earthquake.

766
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:50,639
I think you...

767
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:53,520
You are quite suitable.

768
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,480
(So, I want to)

769
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,319
(restore your work.)

770
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,080
(What do you think?)

771
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,719
Sorry.

772
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,520
I haven't thought about

773
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,480
going back to become a reporter.

774
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,360
I was worried about your condition

775
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,080
until I saw your live report.

776
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,000
(You might not feel it)

777
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,159
(but I could see)

778
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,239
(that you are still passionate)

779
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,360
(about being a reporter.)

780
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,000
(Your heart is still filled)

781
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,840
(with a sense of mission for this job.)

782
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,840
Xu Lai.

783
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,719
Come back to be a reporter.

784
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,279
You are born to do this.

785
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
I'll consider it and give you a reply.

786
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:43,799
Sure.

787
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,560
Consider it well.

788
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,560
Give me an answer soon.

791
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,880
Good.

792
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,799
Let me give you some.

793
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,239
Captain Jin.

794
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,040
Captain Jin!

795
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,440
This area has been cleared.

796
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,599
All victims have been sent to the medical points.

797
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,920
Take a break here and eat something.

798
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,960
Yes!

799
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,920
Yes!

(Earthquake Disaster Relief

801
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,360
(Jin Shichuan)

802
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,119
Hello.

803
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:51,960
How is it over there?

804
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,319
The rescue operation just ended here.

805
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,880
I called because you might be worried.

806
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,920
(How is it over there?)

807
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,480
This area is fine too.

808
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,239
It's just that...

809
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:04,639
What's wrong?

810
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,599
What happened?

811
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,799
Chief called me.

812
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,384
He wanted me to report

813
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
Huining's situation

814
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,719
as a frontline reporter.

815
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,400
I have yet to give him an answer.

816
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,679
(What do you think?)

817
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,239
You shouldn't ask me this question.

818
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,400
You should ask yourself

819
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,159
if you want to return to the frontline

820
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,239
as a reporter.

821
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,679
Of course I do.

822
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,840
I just haven't prepared myself yet.

823
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:31,920
Xu Lai.

824
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:34,759
There are many things

825
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,639
that we can't prepare ourselves for.

826
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,000
It's like encountering this earthquake.

827
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,719
It was so sudden.

828
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,799
There was also the night

829
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,840
when we rushed our goodbyes.

830
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,279
We can't predict these things.

831
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,440
What we can do

832
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,520
is to follow our hearts

833
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,759
and listen to our voices.

834
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,840
The voice we hear at that moment

835
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,159
is the answer we have chosen.

836
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:01,960
I understand.

837
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,759
Thank you.

838
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,319
Do your best.

839
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,759
Have you finished eating?

840
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

841
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:15,159
Let's get back to work.

842
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,480
Hello.

843
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,480
How is it?

844
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,520
I've made my decision.

845
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:38,759
Here.

846
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:55,250
(Job, Reporter)

847
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,599
Hello, Chief.

848
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:10,639
I made my decision.

849
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,239
I'm willing to accept

850
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,400
the task of reporting on the frontline.

851
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,880
That's great!

852
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,239
I knew you would come back.

853
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,639
Don't worry.

854
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,279
Do your best.

855
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:24,759
I have two pieces of good news.

856
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,199
Ms. Zheng's son already went to the hospital

857
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,159
to pick her up.

858
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,520
Wang Yi's condition has improved

859
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,239
and he is recovering.

860
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:32,360
I know you are still worried about these things.

861
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,679
You can start all over again, Xu Lai.

862
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,679
Thank you, Chief.

863
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,960
I believe in you.

864
00:43:38,279 --> 00:43:39,759
You are the best.
