00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:39,803
as there are frequent aftershocks.

195
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,164
Do consider carefully

196
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:42,364
your personal
and family situations.

197
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:43,364
If you intend to go,

198
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,764
get the application form from me.

199
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:47,563
I'll go.

200
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:48,923
Dr. Zang.

201
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,004
Are you sure?

202
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:52,603
Yes, I'm.

203
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,083
(Lu Fangqi.)

204
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:57,723
(I won't wait for you.)

205
00:08:58,644 --> 00:08:59,963
(I want to stand by your side.)

206
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,803
You're alone in the disaster area.

207
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:08,723
Be careful.

208
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:09,404
Okay.

209
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:14,884
Why are you here?

210
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:16,963
I'm here for Huo Yanzong.

211
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:17,923
A media wants to

212
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,603
do a special interview
about my love relationship.

213
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:20,364
As my boyfriend

214
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,244
by name,

215
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,404
he should cooperate.

216
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:23,843
But he has been ignoring my calls.

217
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:24,683
So I come here

218
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:25,404
to look for him.

219
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:26,803
You have a wasted journey.

220
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:27,843
He's not here.

221
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,164
Where did he go?

222
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,004
He went to Huining to find Xu Lai.

223
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,124
Isn't Huining experiencing
an earthquake now?

224
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:33,963
He's actually giving up his life

225
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,723
for Xu Lai?

226
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,443
Yes.

227
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:38,803
He can sacrifice everything

228
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,004
for the sake of Xu Lai.

229
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,723
Why are you back so soon?

230
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,004
Where's Huo Yanzong?

231
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:00,083
You couldn't meet him?

232
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:03,004
I'll contact the media

233
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,164
to change the interview content.

234
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:08,563
If I reject

235
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,364
the upcoming work,

236
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:11,683
will it be a big problem?

237
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,323
What again?

238
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,683
I've had no shooting tasks lately.

239
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:19,563
And I want to take this opportunity

240
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:20,884
to go on a relaxing trip.

241
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:23,963
Drive.

242
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,200
(Search-And-Rescue Dogs Kennel)

243
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,083
What's wrong with Lu Fangqi?

244
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:41,603
I went to see him just now.

245
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:42,843
He hasn't woken up yet.

246
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:46,244
But the doctor said
it's nothing serious.

247
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:53,963
The constant search and rescue effort

248
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,244
has exhausted the dogs too.

249
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,603
That's my concern too.

250
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,484
But the areas that need to be searched

251
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:03,644
are too many.

252
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,404
All the search and rescue dogs

253
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:06,803
need to stand by at all times.

254
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,203
I've failed my responsibility

255
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:12,923
to take care of them.

256
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:14,524
You've done your best.

257
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:15,884
No one wants things

258
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,004
to turn out this way
in the face of disaster.

259
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:20,803
Still, concerning
their current condition,

260
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,644
someone has to stand by them.

261
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:24,244
I've informed

262
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,164
all the members

263
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:26,603

264
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,004
of their own dogs.

265
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:31,524
They're already exhausted

266
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,524
from daily work.

267
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:35,764
How about this?

268
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:37,364
I'm a dog trainer.

269
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:38,963
I'll take care

270
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:39,843

272

I'm afraid you can't afford...

274
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:46,484
Didn't you say

275
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:48,364
that the disaster rescue

276
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:49,723
prevails personal needs

277
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:50,644
and emotions?

278

279
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:53,723

00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,563
or these dogs,

to take care of myself.

You promised...

You promised that you wouldn't
make me worry.

295

Look at you now.

296

00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:11,083
Just minor injuries.

384
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,204
I'm fine.

385
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:20,563
Fireflies.

386
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:42,580
(Disaster Relief Supplies)

387
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:45,684
Sir.

388
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,803
What's the holdup there?

389
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,484
It looks like the road is blocked.

390
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:50,284
I'll check it out.

391
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:11,764
Sir.

392
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:13,563
What's happening up ahead?

393
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:14,643
The road is blocked.

394
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:15,883
I can only take you this far.

395
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,524
Thank you.

396
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:24,403
You're welcome.

397
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,083
(Yu Shishi?)

398
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,044
(It's impossible.)

399
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:43,964
(Why is she here?)

400
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:53,964
Why are you here?

401
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:55,044
I came to find you.

402
00:20:58,764 --> 00:20:59,924
I'm kidding.

403
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:03,843
I don't have time to talk to you.

404
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,004
Give me a hand.

405
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:20,764
Here.

406
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:21,244
Thank you.

407
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:21,724
Have some water.

408
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:42,284
Your hand...

409
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:45,764
They seem rough,

410
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,323
unlike the hands of an actress.

411
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:50,883
You're not the same one I remember.

412
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:52,764
I thought...

413
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:55,843
You thought I couldn't endure hardships

414
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:57,924
and I was a preppy

415
00:21:58,123 --> 00:21:59,444
and pampered woman.

416
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,603
I did all the action scenes myself,

417
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,484
like fighting, being in the water,

418
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:05,244
and jumping off buildings

419
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,764
during the filming.

420
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:08,123
Those scenes

421
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,444
of few seconds you've seen

422
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,163
took me the whole day

423
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,163
and dozens of retakes

424
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,563
to achieve the desired effect.

425
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:15,764
Do you really think I'm a wallflower?

426
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:19,964
I just realized

427
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:21,803
that I didn't really

428
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,123
know you.

429
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:38,803
You've never

430
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:40,163
taken a good look at me.

431
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:43,163
All you can see is...

432
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:43,964
I have something to attend to.

433
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:44,764
Got to go now.

434
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,524
Are you going to find Xu Lai?

435
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:49,083
Don't go.

436
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,524
That's the epicenter.

437
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,323
The roads are collapsed. It's dangerous.

438
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,083
This is my own business.

439
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:54,803
Don't meddle.

440
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,603
Huo Yanzong. I've told you.

441
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:58,563
I'm taking care of your matters.

442
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:01,323
I couldn't reach you.

443
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:02,803
So, I had to follow the volunteer team

444
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:04,684
and search for you along the way.

445
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:06,603
I've been through a lot

446
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:08,484
in order to find you

447
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:09,643
and I got bruised all over.

448
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:10,924
Every time I saw a victim,

449
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,044
I worried

450
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,883
that it might be you.

451
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,524
Now I've found you

452
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,044
and you're leaving.

453
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,204
Even if you meet Xu Lai,

454
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:23,323
are you sure

455
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,643
she'll go back with you?

456
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:29,244
Shishi.

457
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:31,684
Whether or not she goes back

458
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,524
with me,

459
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:34,403
I must take her back

460
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:36,123
for her safety.

461
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,484
You're truly hopeless.

462
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:39,883
Yes.

463
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,004
I'm hopeless.

464
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,244
There is something I must do.

465
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:46,924
There is someone

466
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:47,964
I want to protect.

467
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:52,163
You should go back.

468
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:02,603
There is someone I want to protect too.

469
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:03,964
I've made up my mind.

470
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,563
If you insist

471
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,563
on continuing such silly things,

472
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:07,484
I'll accompany you

473
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,883
and do them with you.

474
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,244
At least you have a partner.

475
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,284
I can take care of you

476
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,323
if anything happens.

477
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:14,044
As long as you can be safe
while looking for her.

478
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:58,204
Watch out.

479
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:19,004
Are you all right?

480
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:05,964
Shishi.

481
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:07,403
How do you feel now?

482
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:08,484
Can you hear me?

483
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:09,883
Shishi.

484
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,244
Yu Shishi.

485
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:14,883
Yu Shishi, you're silly.

486
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:16,924
You shouldn't have come

487
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:17,524
to Huining.

488
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,204
You shouldn't have followed me.

489
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:20,284
You're right.

490
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:21,603
I'm a scoundrel, and I owe you a lot.

491
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:22,363
Please wake up.

492
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:23,204
How can you claim it back from me

493
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:23,924
if you don't wake up?

494
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:24,643
Yu Shishi.

495
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:25,843
Wake up.

496
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:27,444
Shishi.

497
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:32,083
Huo Yanzong.

498
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,563
Stop shaking me.

499
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:35,803
You're awake.

500
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:37,163
How do you feel now?

501
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:39,603
I'll take you to the hospital now.

502
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:42,764
Huo Yanzong.

503
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,764
Once you meet with Xu Lai,

504
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,724
you must return to Huaigang with me

505
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:50,924
whether or not
she's willing to go with you.

506
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:52,363
All right?

507
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,643
Okay, I promise you.

508
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:54,643
Also,

509
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,123
don't ever disappear without a word.

510
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,403
Don't leave me again.

511
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,444
All right. You shouldn't talk much now.

512
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:01,724
I'll take you to the hospital.

513
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:03,764
Don't fall asleep.

514
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:05,044
Please don't fall asleep.

515
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:18,684
Shishi.

516
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:20,964
Hold out.

517
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:24,004
Hold out.

518
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,403
Hold out.

(Huaigang Fire Rescue)

520
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:05,244
Hurry.

521
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:08,444
Come.

522
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:09,484
Hurry, Tao.

523
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,524
Coming. Careful.

524
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:11,764
Come.

525
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:13,643
Be careful.

526
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:14,284
Let's go.

527
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:14,883
Are you all right?

(Fire Rescue)

530
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:28,083
Come on.

531
00:28:28,284 --> 00:28:28,643
Give me a hand.

532
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:29,044
Here.

533
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:29,724
Hurry up.

534
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:32,323
Is it okay?

535
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:34,403
Slowly.

536
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:41,883
We've brought
the injured here. Let's go.

537
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:42,964
Hold on.

538
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:44,964
Can you please take me
to Mofang Town with you?

539
00:28:45,803 --> 00:28:46,484
I want to follow you.

540
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:47,924
You want to follow us?

541
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:49,724
I know you.

542
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:51,444
You're the team members

543
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,684
of Captain Jin Shichuan, right?

544
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:54,764
I'm looking for Xu Lai.

545
00:28:58,843 --> 00:28:59,363
Let's go.

546
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:00,044
Thank you.

547
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:24,803
Nurse.

548
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:25,964
You're awake.

549
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:26,843
Where's the guy

550
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,524
who came with me?

551
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:29,524
Who's it?

552
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:31,843
Do you mean the rescue team?

553
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:32,603
They've left.

554
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:36,563
Wait.

555
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:38,363
You can't get up now.

556
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,924
Only the rescue team was here?

557
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,284
It shouldn't be.

558
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,964
Did something happen to him?

559
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,244
I remember now.

560
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:50,204
There was one guy.

561
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,643
But he didn't enter the kiosk

562
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:52,444
and left.

563
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,123
He just left?

564
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:08,643
Wait. Don't cry.

565
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:10,044
He was fine.

566
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:14,524
Yes, I don't have to cry.

567
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,843
Thank you. Please don't let me keep you.

568
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,044
Also,

569
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,444
don't ever disappear without a word.

570
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,524
Don't leave me again.

571
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:45,123
All right. You shouldn't talk much now.

572
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:46,083
I'll take you to the hospital.

573
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:57,323

574
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,764
You promised not to abandon me.

(Huaigang Fire Rescue)

576
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
(Han Fang)

577
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:16,724
Hello.

578
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:17,843
(Hello.)

579
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:19,603
(The disaster relief supplies)

580
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,083
(that you instructed)

581
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,563
(have all been dispatched)

582
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:23,403
(under the name of Yunkai.)

583
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,444
(They'll arrive at the disaster area
the day after tomorrow.)

584
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:27,204
Okay.

585
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:28,924
(By the way,)

586
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:30,044
(when are you coming back?)

587
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:35,204
I can't return at the moment.

588
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,083
I still can't find Xu Lai.

589
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:38,524
(Well, then.)

590
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:39,843
(I won't persuade you.)

591
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:41,524
(Take care of yourself.)

592
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:43,603
Okay, that's it then.

593
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:52,484
(Don't ever disappear without a word.)

594
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,643
(Don't leave me again.)

595
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:19,484
Finally, you answered my call.

596
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:20,244
I couldn't reach you

597
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:20,883
all these days.

598
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:21,843
I thought something happened to you.

599
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,323
Do you know how deeply
I've been worried about you?

600
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:24,883
I'm fine.

601
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:27,044
What a relief.

602
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,803
By the way, you said you were leaving
for a relaxing trip.

603
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,123
Have you reached your destination?

604
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:33,803
Yes.

605
00:32:35,843 --> 00:32:36,924
I've arrived at the finish point too.

606
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,764
I have found my closure.

607
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,764
(The trip is completely over.)

608
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,323
(Time to go back.)

609
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,004
(Hello, doctor.)

610
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:05,643
(Hello.)

611
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:06,764
(I'd like to ask)

612
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:07,524
(if there's a patient)

613
00:33:07,524 --> 00:33:08,363
(named Yu Shishi.)

614
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:09,524
Yes, there is.

615
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:10,603
(How's her situation now?)

616
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,163
She has regained consciousness,

617
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:13,444
but she still needs rest.

618
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,524
(Do you have any messages)

619
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:18,643
(I can convey to her?)

620
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:21,524
No.

621
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:23,123
Please take care of her.

622
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:23,964
Thank you.

623
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:31,080
(Let's Overcome Hardships Together)

624
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,643
I just received instructions
from the command center.

625
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:35,004
We,

626
00:33:35,004 --> 00:33:36,403
the Huaigang Earthquake Relief Team,

627
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,323
have been assigned to rescue
Lianhua Village.

628
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,724
There was a secondary collapse

629
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:42,964
after the earthquake in Lianhua village.

630
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:44,924
The internal building structures

631
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:46,444
are extremely fragile now.

632
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,284
There might be a risk

633
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:49,924
of structural displacement.

634
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,204
If we're not careful,

635
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,004
we could be trapped inside too.

636
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:53,964
So,

637
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:55,123
you ought to be highly cautious

638
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,163
when you perform the rescue task.

639
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:56,883
- Yes.
- Yes.

640
00:33:58,563 --> 00:33:59,603
(All rescue units, attention.)

641
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:00,603
(Someone is spotted stealing drugs)

642
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:01,363
(from the first-aid kiosk.)

643
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:03,323
(According to
the on-site medical staff,)

644
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:04,563
(it's suspected to be a drug user.)

645
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:05,563
(If you find this person,)

646
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:06,603
(please report it immediately.)

647
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:09,683
Team No. 27, copy that.

648
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:10,723
How is it possible

649
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:11,723
that someone would use drugs here?

650
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:13,404
I remember that now.

651
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:14,844
I heard

652
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:16,004
that a resident's son

653
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,723
was just released from the rehab center.

654
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:19,484
Probably he's from Lianhua Village.

655
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,364
Stay alert, everyone.

656
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:23,243
Let's go.

657
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:24,044
- Yes.
- Yes.

658
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:30,924
Please be very careful.

659
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:34,324
Don't worry.

660
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,924
I have the lucky charm with me.

661
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,083
It will protect me.

662
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:41,444
I will be safe.

663
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:43,243
I'll wait for you.

664
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:45,444
Yes, madam.

665
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:05,760
(Huaigang Fire Rescue,
Search and Rescue)

666
00:35:05,763 --> 00:35:06,203
Get off.

667
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:12,044
Captain Jin.

668
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,643
The on-site assessment is done.

669
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:14,683
Put on protection kits

670
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:15,484
and be careful.

671
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:16,283
Thank you.

672
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:46,763
Zhang Yang.

673
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:48,444
Come over.

674
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:58,044
Bring the detector here.

675
00:35:58,203 --> 00:35:58,723
Hurry.

676
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:09,924
Stretch it forward.

677
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:11,083
In that direction.

678
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:12,203
Okay.

679
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:19,763
Deeper.

680
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:25,683
Can you see it?

681
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:26,524
Here.

682
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:27,763
I saw it.

683
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:32,844
Call him.

684
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:34,924
Someone below there,

685
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:36,844
can you hear me?

686
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:45,163
Can you hear me?

687
00:36:45,643 --> 00:36:47,324
If you hear me, move your body.

688
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:53,763
No response.

689
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:57,643
Captain Jin.

690
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:58,723
We have a situation here.

691
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:00,404
There's a person below,

692
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:02,243
and the detector shows signs of life.

693
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:03,163
But there's no response from the person.

694
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:05,964
He seems to have lost
consciousness completely.

695
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,860
(Building Sketch)

696
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:17,203
This rescue entrance is likely

697
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,723
to have a displacement.

698
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,044
If we go from below,

699
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:21,324
there'll be a collapse.

700
00:37:22,683 --> 00:37:23,283
Liu Xu.

701
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:24,404
Open up a rescue entry

702
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:25,603
from the side.

703
00:37:26,924 --> 00:37:28,123
Zhang Yang, Dapeng.

704
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,683
Get the small air blower
to supply air inside.

705
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:33,283
You stay here and monitor.

706
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:34,804
- Yes.
- Yes.

707
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:04,163
Captain Jin.

708
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:05,364
Something's wrong.

709
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,603
Is this the junkie

710
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:14,404
we talked about just now?

711
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:15,723
Save him first.

712
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:18,964
What's the situation below?

713
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:20,444
The structure isn't stable.

714
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:22,044
It's risky if we go in like this.

715
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:23,563
We should wait for the excavator

716
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:24,804
and make support at the entrance.

717
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:25,723
It's safer.

718
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,324
We're running out of time.

719
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,964
There'll be a collapse at any time.

720
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,683
Organize the rescue immediately.

721
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,484
Captain Jin.

722
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:32,924
The structure inside is complex.

723
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:33,844
Captain Jin.

724
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,243
I think we should wait.

725
00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:37,083
We must seize

726
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,163
the golden rescue period.

727
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:39,683
I'll go in from the side.

728
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:40,524
Zhang Yang.

729
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:41,203
Come with me.

730
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:41,763
Yes.

731
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:42,683
You stay here.

732
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:43,924
- Yes.
- Yes.

733
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:44,844
Be careful.

734
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:55,844
Slowly. Captain Jin.

735
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,404
Zhang Yang.

736
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:04,723
You keep watch here.

737
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,324
After I see him,

738
00:39:06,484 --> 00:39:07,123
I'll give you signals.

739
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:08,283
Captain Jin.

740
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:10,884
Be careful.

741
00:40:02,603 --> 00:40:03,324
Are you all right?

742
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:05,004
Don't fall asleep.

743
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:06,243
Stay awake.

744
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,484
Don't catch me.

745
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:11,763
Don't catch me.

746
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:12,924
I'm a firefighter.

747
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,203
Is there anyone with you

748
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:14,844
here?

749
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:16,364
Or are you alone here?

750
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,004
I won't go with you.

751
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:20,044
I'm not going.

752
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:25,243
Come on.

753
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:38,884
I'm not going with you.

754
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:41,203
No.

755
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:44,563
No.

756
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:00,404
Go now.

757
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:02,123
Help me.

758
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:03,924
Help me.

759
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:05,283
Help me.

760
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:08,243
Help me.

761
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:30,203
Captain Jin.

762
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:30,924
Captain Jin!

763
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:31,643
Faster.

764
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:35,643
