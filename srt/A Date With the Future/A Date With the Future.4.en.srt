(You're the Girl From 10 Years Ago?)

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,519
Who am I to you?

19
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,758
Why would I dare text you?

20
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:50,758
You didn't even

21
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,519
read my previous texts.

22
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:52,719
Who said that?

23
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,118
You've read them?

24
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,198
Why didn't you

25
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,278
reply to my texts if you've read them?

26
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:02,599
There's nothing to reply.

27
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,599
You're just like an ice-cream.

28
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,878
Cold but sweet. Never say what you mean.

29
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,639
Why are you such a good boy?

30
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:27,759
You know what, Peace?

31
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:28,878
Today, Jin Shichuan

32
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,838
saved me again today.

33
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:30,998
When he held me

34
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:32,319
and fought with those workers,

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,278
he looked so cool.

36
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,118
He also said

37
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,799
he read my text messages.

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,878
Does this mean he cares about me?

39
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,118
Doesn't it?

40
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,919
Doesn't it?

41
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:46,319
You think so too,

42
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:46,959
right?

43
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:47,799
You also think

44
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,118
I should go for the win, right?

45
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,158
Okay, I will.

46
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,878
(Hi, Captain Jin.)

47
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,558
(I am home safe.)

48
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,079
(Wanted to let you know)

49
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:00,759
(so you need not worry.)

50
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,558
(Got it.)

51
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:08,239
He replied!

52
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,799
This is the first time he replied.

53
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,158
I'm going to save a screenshot.

54
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:23,319
Tengda is indeed

55
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,799
involved in fraudulent proportioning,
illegal production

56
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,239
and deceiving consumers.

57
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,919
I'd like to take this chance

58
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:29,878
to dig deeper

59
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,759
into their operation.

60
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:35,239
Looks like you've done your homework.

61
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,438
But are you prepared

62
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,998
for the consequence?

63
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,878
As a media personnel, I think

64
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:46,199
it is our duty to tell the public

65
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:47,239
the truth.

66
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,158
If everyone is too afraid
to do anything,

67
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,199
and avoids confrontation,

68
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,319
then what's the point of

69
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:51,919
having newspeople?

70
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,639
I understand what you're saying.

71
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:57,519
But,

72
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,598
have you really thought about

73
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,718
the pros and cons of this matter?

74
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,039
I've read

75
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,678
their letter of default.

76
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,598
If Tengda is indeed at fault,

77
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:07,678
the indemnity clause

78
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:08,678
holds no ground.

79
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,799
What's done is done
and setting things right

80
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:11,959
is the best solution

81
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:12,998
in my opinion.

82
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,718
I think it's much more effective

83
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:18,358
than a letter of apology.

84
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,959
Besides, I'm confident

85
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,559
that once the report is published,

86
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,679
we'll have

87
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,238
the upper hand over Tengda.

88
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,838
Plus,

89
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,439
we'll be the first media with the guts

90
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,598
to stand up in the public's eye.

91
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:32,358
You're really testing me.

92
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:33,959
Fine.

93
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,598
Since you're so confident,

94
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,319
I'll take a gamble with you.

95
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,158
You've all seen it, right?

96
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:50,838
Since we exposed

97
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,199
the nitty-gritty of Tengda's

98
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,079
chemical factory,

99
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,439
public opinion

100
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:57,278
is full of praises for us.

101
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,959
They say

102
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,238
we displayed the integrity
of newspeople.

103
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,639
We spoke up for the people,

104
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:02,999
and upheld

105
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,319
the professionalism of news media.

106
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,158
Many brands and sponsors

107
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,158
have sent us invitations
to work together.

108
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,238
They're hoping to elevate

109
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,038
their brand image through our platform.

110
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:15,959
This is truly a blessing in disguise.

111
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,119
Xu Lai.

112
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,079
You did well this time.

113
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:21,398
But you still

114
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:22,439
have to manage
the official account well.

115
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,838
Got it, Ms. Lv.

116
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,838
It's thanks to Chief's

117
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,598
understanding and support

118
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:27,679
that I was able to turn things around.

119
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:32,838
Xin.

120
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,119
You were the one who liked

121
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:39,199
the exposure post on Tengda, right?

122
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,238
Can you prove it?

123
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,559
I've checked with security.

124
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:45,879
The person is smart.

125
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,319
She erased all the footage

126
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,038
of the workspace on that day.

127
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,759
But she overlooked one thing.

128
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,079
The camera in the corridor.

129
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:58,679
I checked the camera footage

130
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,598
from the corridor

131
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,639
around the time

132
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,038
the post was liked.

133
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,598
I found that

134
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:04,959
you were the only one in the office.

135
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,238
So if it wasn't you,

136
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,598
who else could it be?

137
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,759
A ghost?

138
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,718
Don't simply make accusations.

139
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:14,759
It is

140
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,959
merely your assumption.

141
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,838
That's not evidence.

142
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,398
Guess there is a ghost.

143
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,838
A ghost called guilt.

144
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:24,199
So what if it was me?

145
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:26,038
Even if you expose

146
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,918
this matter,

147
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:28,798
I'm not bothered.

148
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,478
True.

149
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,959
It's thanks to your like

150
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:31,918
that I could do the story.

151
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,238
But that doesn't mean I'm fine

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,238
with your methods.

153
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,038
I'm going to learn from you.

154
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,038
I'll edit the video and post it online

155
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,559
to recreate what happened with the like.

156
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:43,199
Such a plot about a senior

157
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:44,999
bullying a junior in the workplace

158
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,119
is a favorite among viewers.

159
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,038
Have a taste

160
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,278
of your own medicine.

161
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,559
What do you think?

162
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,199
I dare you.

163
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:51,478
You think I wouldn't dare?

164
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:54,959
I'm here to tell you,

165
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:56,319
that I'm not a pushover.

166
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,679
I won't fuss about this matter

167
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:58,838
but it doesn't mean
I'll let it slide again.

168
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,278
Don't mess with me.
You're not prepared for it.

169
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:13,918
Xu Lai.

170
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,439
Come to my office.

171
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:17,879
Okay.

172
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:22,199
Any instruction?

173
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,199
You seem to be in a good mood.

174
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,199
Of course.

175
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,478
I just scored a victory.

176
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,519
Of course I'm happy.

177
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:30,439
Have you won?

178
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:33,478
Walking on a tightrope is fine

179
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,718
if it's a one-off.

180
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,918
But if you continue on it,

181
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,559
you're going to fall flat on your face.

182
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,718
Showing off

183
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,038
will often earn you animosity.

184
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,119
You need to know that.

185
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,679
Being young and audacious
in the workplace

186
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,598
is not entirely a good thing.

187
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:53,798
I understand.

188
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,038
Thanks for the reminder, Chief.

189
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:58,119
I'll get back to work.

190
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,199
Go on.

191
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:01,879
By the way,

192
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,879
today is the fire station's open day.

193
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,639
I'd like to get some info.

194
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,879
Alright. Go ahead.

195
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:08,999
Thanks.

196
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:11,959
Attention!

197
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,718
Hey.

198
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,518
That girl.

199
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,518
She's the one

200
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:04,478
Captain Jin saved
from committing suicide.

201
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,878
Another fan of his?

202
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:06,758
Most likely.

203
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:07,799
That's no good.

204
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:08,878
The girl

205
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:09,518
tried to take her life over love.

206
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:10,399
She's worse than Xu Lai.

207
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:14,279
Aren't you the mole

208
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,399
Xu Lai placed with Captain Jin?

209
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,758
Call her. Tip her off.

210
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,199
Quickly.

211
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:20,838
Okay.

212
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,598
Go.

213
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:26,758
(Hello?)

214
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:27,758
Hey, Xu Lai. Where are you?

215
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:28,959
(I'm at the entrance.)

216
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,079
Get over here quick.

217
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:31,598
Captain Jin and a suicidal girl...

218
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,799
It's an emergency.

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,640
(Huaigang Emergency Response)

220
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:00,279
Captain Jin.

221
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,039
Can I apply

222
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,518
to be a firefighter's family member?

223
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:03,919
Hold on.

224
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:07,959
No, you can't.

225
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,439
Looks like Captain Jin is cornered.

226
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:15,838
Xu Lai doesn't hold back.

227
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:18,998
If you're his family,

228
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:19,758
what about me?

229
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:21,159
Who are you?

230
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:22,679
I...

231
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,518
I'm Captain Jin's

232
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,439
designated family.

233
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:28,518
Is what she said true?

234
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:29,559
Of course it is.

235
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,079
I don't believe you.

236
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:32,959
Captain Jin, remember

237
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,238
how you risked your life to save me?

238
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,598
Babe, I'll see her off for you.

239
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,518
Captain... Captain Jin!

240
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:38,799
Hey, what...

241
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:39,878
Jin...

242
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:44,878
Come on. Let's continue.

243
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,159
Let go.

244
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:56,399
Still not giving up?

245
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,638
What's it to you?

246
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,358
It has everything to do with me.

247
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:00,758
You're interested in my man.

248
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:02,758
I've reserved that man.

249
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,718
You'd better give it up.

250
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,919
I'll only give up if he tells me to.

251
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:07,838
Not you.

252
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:09,439
If he says no,

253
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:10,399
I'll kill myself.

254
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,679
Up to him?

255
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:12,838
Do you

256
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:13,998
not have your own thoughts?

257
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:15,319
I...

258
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,238
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief)
Captain Jin saved you

259
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,878
because that's his duty
as a firefighter.

260
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,159
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief)
As for you,

261
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,358
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief)
your affection comes and goes so easily.

262
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,638
Listen.

263
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:27,159
Your life is worth more

264
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,118
than affection.

265
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:28,959
Don't use your life

266
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,238
as blackmail for love.

267
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:31,399
It's childish.

268
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,679
There are many things

269
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,159
worth accomplishing in life.

270
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,559
A woman who only lives for a man

271
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,399
is not at all attractive.

272
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,679
You need to first love yourself

273
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,079
before you love others.

274
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:55,718
Pretty good acting.

275
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,279
You have no shortage of made-up lines.

276
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:00,638
When did you

277
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:01,878
become my designated family?

278
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:02,959
I was ready

279
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,079
ten years ago.

280
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,238
The promise ten years ago.
Did you forget?

281
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:13,039
I guess my acting was pretty good.

282
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,758
Those things I said just now.

283
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,598
Which one did you think is true?

284
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:18,598
Lame.

285
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,959
Let me give you a protective charm.

286
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,238
If girls

287
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,199
pester you again,

288
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,319
just show this.

289
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:46,439
I assure you

290
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,478
they will stay away.

291
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:50,279
Childish.

292
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:55,838
Don't you dare throw it away.

293
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,718
I've lassoed you now.

294
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,380
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief
Brigade One)

295
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:11,638
Thanks.

296
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,199
I wouldn't have gotten here in time

297
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:13,959
if not for you.

298
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,998
Don't worry. Even if you weren't here,

299
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,199
Captain Jin would've ignored her.

300
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:18,439
After all,

301
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:19,919
he never chats with women.

302
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:21,199
He has no interest.

303
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,199
You're the only one
that can deal with him

304
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,919
because you're bold.

305
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:24,718
You've got this.

306
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,039
Really?

307
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:27,878
You think I stand a chance too?

308
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,758
Definitely.

309
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,799
Say what now?

310
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,518
I think

311
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,638
you should save your effort.

312
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:33,758
I've worked with Captain Jin
for a long time.

313
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,638
He's completely

314
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,919
dissociated from relationships.

315
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,439
He will never change his principles

316
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:38,838
for anyone else.

317
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:39,998
Whatever you do

318
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:40,838
will be for naught.

319
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:41,559
For naught.

320
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,159
Do you guys know why

321
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,358
he's so against relationships?

322
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,838
Has he been hurt before?

323
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,439
No point asking me.

324
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,478
I'm not like him.

325
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:52,279
I will never betray Captain Jin.

326
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:52,718
I...

327
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:55,399
I was just asking.

328
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,559
Why so serious?

329
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:57,758
When dealing

330
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,478
with a scourge dead-set on him,

331
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:00,399
we must always be vigilant

332
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,358
to avoid sneak attacks.

333
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,718
Here's a sneak attack.

334
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:06,998
It's good.

335
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:14,878
There's a chance.

(Safety First, Abide the Law)

337
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,559
Shichuan, it's the wrong end!

339
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:03,718
Fang Huai!

340
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,718
Get back in line!

341
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:08,998
Is that all you've got?

342
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,439
Why did you kick me?

343
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,878
You're too slow.

344
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:58,279
Why are you so slow?

345
00:16:59,079 --> 00:16:59,478
Next time,

346
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,679
you have to run like the wind.

347
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:01,199
Got it?

348
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:02,959
Let's call it Windchase.

349
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,038
Okay.

350
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,199
Windchase.

351
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:07,839
You hear me?

Captain Jin.

356
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:53,758
Captain Jin.

357
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,359
Is something on your mind?

358
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:58,959
I called you so many times

359
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,639
but you didn't respond.

Hello, Pan.

Okay.

Ten?

Pan, we're done with training.

Okay. Go and rest.

369

Don't overdo it.

Okay.

Don't feed them too much during lunch.

372
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,399
Got it.

373
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,318
Long time no see.

374
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:32,278
Good boy.

375
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,038
What's up?

376
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:34,599
Come here.

377
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:36,478
Look.

378
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,318
Doesn't it look like Windchase?

Salute.

380
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:39,839
Good.

00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:41,399
Salute.

384
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:47,758
a professional dog trainer abroad.

385
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:49,359
After returning,

386
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,879
she often comes here to train Peace.

387
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,679
Salute.

388
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,359
She may be young.

389
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,478
But she's won awards in international

390
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,679
dog training competitions.

391
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:58,439
One. Two. Three. Jump.

392
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:00,199
Jump!

393
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:01,879
Good.

394
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:03,798
Jump!

395
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,199
Good.

396
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:06,599
What do you think?

397
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:13,919
Up!

398
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,199
That's right, Windchase.

399
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:16,998
Come.

400
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:18,439
This way.

401
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,238
That's a good boy.

402
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:21,278
Come.

403
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:22,998
Come here.

404
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,078
Get it!

405
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:36,639
Good.

406
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,238
Yes, good boy. Sit down.

407
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:39,839
The dog's pretty good.

408
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,318
Okay.

409
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:40,998
Peace.

410
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,238
The human, not so much.

411
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,639
Okay.

412
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,599
Peace, quick.

413
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,758
You didn't know I train dogs, right?

414
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,399
There's a lot more you don't know.

415
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,439
Would you like to find it out?

416
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,439
Not interested.

417
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,839
Fine. I won't say more.

418
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,199
Let me get this call.

419
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,199
Look after Peace for me.

420
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:21,679
Peace.

421
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:23,159
Bite it.

422
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,399
Peace.

423
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:28,318
Come here, Peace.

424
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,100
(Pan)

425
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,119
Come over here.

426
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:35,959
Come.

427
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:39,839
Come, Peace.

428
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,959
Windchase, good boy.

429
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:05,439

I found it.

461
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:11,718
You're the girl

462
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,839
at the earthquake ten years ago.

463
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:18,399
You finally remember me.

464
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,278
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

465
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:24,998
I've already waited

466
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,959
ten years.

467
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:26,998
A little longer is fine.

468
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,679
Do you remember the promise
ten years ago?

469
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:31,318
I came back so I could...

470
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,518
A misunderstanding.

471
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:36,959
It was a misunderstanding.

472
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:42,558
At the time, you were

473
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:44,238
just recovering.

474
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,159
I wanted you to get better and be happy.

475
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:47,679
So,

476
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,879
I simply agreed.

477
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:50,959
I didn't think you'd take it to heart,

478
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:52,159
nor expect you to come back for me.

479
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,599
Of course I remember it.

480
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,919
Because I like you.

481
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,518
To be precise,

482
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:00,718
I love you.

483
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,679
I don't think that's love.

484
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:15,798
It's reliance.

485
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:18,359
At your most vulnerable moment,

486
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,599
you found someone to rely on.

487
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:20,199
Get it?

488
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,639
You're mistaken.

489
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,278
You're the one who's mistaken.

490
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:27,679
I just want to know one thing.

491
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:29,439
Is there no chance

492
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,439
of you liking me?

493
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,758
No chance.

494
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:36,919
Jin Shichuan.

495
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:38,318
Listen carefully.

496
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,679
Be it ten years ago or right now,

497
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,439
I'm never giving up.

498
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:06,919
Captain Jin.

499
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:08,679
Captain Jin.

500
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:16,159
Don't pull on my shirt again.

501
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,119
Don't pull on my shirt.

502
00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:58,238
Xu Lai.

503
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,078
I'm giving you a stern warning.

504
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,199
If you won't put down your phone

505
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,199
right now,

506
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:07,078
you're going to lose a good friend.

507
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,718
It's fine to lose him.

508
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,959
Not a big deal anyway.

509
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:16,998
Fine.

510
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,718
My heart

511
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:19,998
is completely smashed now.

512
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,278
Typical example of love-over-friendship.

513
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:26,359
You didn't finish your story.

514
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,959
You met the guy previously.

515
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,078
So how did he react?

516
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,038
What do you think?

517
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,798
A poker face as usual.

518
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,518
He rejected me exactly
like I thought he would.

519
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:39,078
So it's clearly

520
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:40,639
a one-sided infatuation.

521
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:42,758
Liu Bei only went
to the thatched hut three times.

522
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,199
How many times have you attempted?

523
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:45,959
Ten years.

524
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,078
He finally remembers you.

525
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,159
In the end,

526
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,478
he just disregarded you.

527
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,159
Who disregarded whom?

528
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,199
Nobody.

529
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,199
You're so late.

530
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:56,718
Right.

531
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:57,758
Mr. Huo.

532
00:27:58,278 --> 00:27:59,639
The traffic was kind of bad.

533
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:01,359
You're punished to two drinks.

534
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:03,599
I can't drink.

535
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,238
Huo Yanzong.

536
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:06,919
You always come but never drink.

537
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:07,959
So why are you here?

538
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:09,078
This place is for drinking.

539
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:10,919
Excuse me.

540
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:12,278
Can I get soda water?

541
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,439
Huo

542
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:15,959
is here to drive you home.

543
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,718
I have to go. Got work to do.

544
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,599
Wait up! I'll drive you.

545
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:31,238
Hey.

546
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:34,839
Wait a minute.

547
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:37,879
Please settle the bill.

548
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:54,718
What's the situation?

549
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:56,478
Captain Jin.

550
00:28:57,518 --> 00:28:58,359
There's a traffic jam.

551
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,078
We have no time to spare.

552
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,399
Find the nearest route.

553
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:03,558
Got it.

554
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:24,758
I'll go down and check.

555
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,180
(Hanging is strictly prohibited)

556
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:48,439
Another private car

557
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,478
blocking the emergency route.

558
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:50,879
These people are so selfish.

559
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:51,879
Now what?

560
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,038
If we wait for the owner

561
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,998
to move the car,

562
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,558
it will set the rescue mission back.

563
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:58,318
Knock the car aside.

564
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,718
I don't think that's a good idea.

565
00:30:01,078 --> 00:30:01,919
Saving lives is more important.
Knock it.

566
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:02,919
Yes, sir.

567
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:04,839
Let's go.

568
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,278
(Alert)
Everyone, move back!

569
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:27,518
Move back. Move back!

570
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:49,359
Everyone, alight.

571
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:51,839
All right. Move back.

572
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,399
Make way, please.

573
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,839
Everyone, make way.

574
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,780
(Huaigang Fire Rescue Unit)

575
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,038
You're finally here.

576
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:09,399
The fire is getting out of hand.

577
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:12,318
It's out of control.

578
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,238
Who are you?

579
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,558
I'm the building manager.

580
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,679
Do you know where the fire started from?

581
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,078
Anyone trapped?

582
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:19,718
It started from the third floor.

583
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,758
We've evacuated

584
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,839
some of the residents.

585
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:23,439
But I'm not sure how many

586
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,478
are trapped exactly.

587
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,558
We need to double-check.

588
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,359
Can you do that

589
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:27,879
over there?

590
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:28,199
Okay.

591
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,558
Keep away from here. It's too dangerous.

592
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:29,919
Got it.

593
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,119
Let's go.

594
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:35,399
Squad 1.

595
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,119
Go inside and conduct search and rescue.

596
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,558
Squad 2, put out the fire.

597
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,038
Squad 3, standby.

598
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,998
Clear the perimeter.

599
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:45,439
Lu Fangqi.

600
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:45,919
Here.

601
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,599
Contact the command center.

602
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,318
Check where the paramedics are.

603
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:50,718
Call the traffic department

604
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:51,959
to ensure clear passage.

605
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:53,839
Make sure the paramedics arrive quickly.

606
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,518
Yes, sir.

607
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,439
Listen up, men! Prepare for battle.

608
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,798
- Yes, sir.
- Affirmative.

609
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:00,199
Sorry.

610
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,038
There's a fire.

611
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:01,639
You can't go in.

612
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:06,599
Thanks, Huo.

613
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,159
Stay safe.

614
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:07,679
I will.

615
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:10,758
Let's go.

616
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,679
Miss, you can't go in.

617
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:13,998
I'm a reporter from Huaigang TV.

618
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:14,879
He's my colleague.

619
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:15,919
Okay, you may go.

620
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:24,998
Quickly!

621
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:25,679
Quick!

622
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:27,318
Quick!

623
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:56,879
Quick. Two over there.

624
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,399
Move it!

625
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:04,959
Turn it on.

626
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:06,478
Got it.

627
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:29,518
(Safety Supervisor)
Stay safe.

628
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,038
Stay alert.

629
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:52,038
All good.

630
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:53,919
Captain Jin.

631
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:44,759
Hurry.

632
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:48,799
I'm Xu Lai, reporting for

633
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:49,279
Huaigang TV.

634
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,239
I'm reporting live

635
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,478
from Huize Garden.

636
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:52,598
Around 6 p.m...

637
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:02,799
Around 6 p.m.

638
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:03,598
a fire broke out

639
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,558
at Block 5 of the residential area.

640
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:05,598
Firefighting efforts

641
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:06,439
are being conducted.

642
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,279
Here is

643
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:07,839
footage of the scene.

644
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:21,799
Use the hose.

645
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:22,279
The victim.

646
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:24,839
Get her.

647
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:22,759
Jin Shichuan!

648
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:24,799
Get back!

649
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:25,998
Get back!

650
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:27,399
Get back!

651
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,078
Lu Fangqi, put out the fire!

652
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,879
Quick, clear those out.

653
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:08,839
All three of your family are out, right?

654
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:09,239
Yes.

655
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:09,678
Okay.

656
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,158
Two in your family. Are they out?

657
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:11,638
Okay.

658
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,478
Are they all out?

659
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:12,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

660
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:13,279
Okay.

661
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,678
Captain.

662
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:20,078
Captain!

663
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,399
I've counted.

664
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:22,319
Everyone

665
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,319
should be out.

666
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:24,839
What do you mean "should be"?

667
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,038
Don't you know the exact number?

668
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,879
We could only compare the numbers

669
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:28,879
with the entry

670
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:29,558
and exit records.

671
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,078
As for the exact number of residents,

672
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,239
I'll have to ask
the neighborhood committee.

673
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:34,439
Then go

674
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:35,319
and ask the committee.

675
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:35,598
Do it now.

676
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:35,998
Hu!

677
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:36,839
Hu!

678
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,919
Get out of the way.

679
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:39,279
My son is upstairs.

680
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,719
I have to save my son.

681
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,799
I have to save my son!

682
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:45,478
Since when did you have a son?

683
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:46,439
I've worked here for three years.

684
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,078
Only you

685
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:49,239
come and go from your house.

686
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,319
Her dementia must be acting up again.

687
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:52,279
I don't have dementia.

688
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,279
My son... My son is called Hu.

689
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:55,518
He's upstairs.

690
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,638
Save him.

691
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:58,359
You don't have a son.

692
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:04,998
Granny.

693
00:38:04,998 --> 00:38:05,799
Please, I beg you.

694
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:06,558
Do you live on the fourth floor?

695
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:07,678
Yes.

696
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,359
Is it the unit

697
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,279
on the left-most side?

698
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:10,439
There are a lot of comics.

699
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,799
Yes, that's right.

700
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,719
Please, you have to save him.

701
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,518
It's okay, ma'am.

702
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:17,118
Get ready to infiltrate!

703
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:18,799
Someone needs help!

704
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:19,518
Quickly!

705
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:19,998
Yes, sir.

706
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,279
Slowly.

707
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:09,478
Granny.

708
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,598
The other residents said

709
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,839
they didn't know you have a son.

710
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:14,638
Did he just come back from outstation?

711
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:15,638
No.

712
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:17,719
This son of mine

713
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:19,678
has been at home for a long time.

714
00:39:20,118 --> 00:39:21,799
He's a recluse.

715
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,239
Anyone here?

716
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:26,998
(He holes up at home)

717
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:27,799
(and just reads comics,)

718
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,319
Anyone here?

719
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,998
(or plays games all the time.)

720
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:31,279
Did he not come down

721
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,118
because he's scared

722
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:33,198
of the unfamiliar surrounding?

723
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,518
He never goes outside.

724
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:36,598
He's grown

725
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:38,319
to more than 200 jin now.

726
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,919
He can't really move.

727
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:57,678
Liu Xu, the guy's here.

728
00:39:57,678 --> 00:39:58,078
Okay.

729
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:00,279
Over here.

730
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:00,919
Come.

731
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:05,558
One. Two. Three.

732
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:06,319
Go.

733
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,359
Go, quickly.

734
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:25,558
Go!

735
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:54,518
Erhu! Erhu is still in there!

736
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,399
There's someone else inside?

737
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:58,919
Take the injured out.

738
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,279
What about you?

739
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,158
I need to double-check.

740
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:03,239
Take him out.

741
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:04,998
No, it's dangerous inside.

742
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:05,959
You can't do it alone.

743
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:07,478
Just go.

744
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:08,799
Go!

745
00:41:11,478 --> 00:41:12,359
There's no time.

746
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:13,558
Listen to Captain Jin.

747
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,759
Get him out first
and then we'll come back.

748
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:16,799
Erhu.

749
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:17,759
It's dangerous inside.

750
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:18,959
You have to come with us.

751
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:19,959
Breathe in.

752
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:32,478
They're coming out.

753
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,158
He's safe.

754
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,198
Make way.

755
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,239
Make way.

756
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,839
Hu.

757
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:43,879
Hu.

758
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:48,279
Clear the way.

759
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,719
- Clear the way.
- Quickly.

760
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:13,439
Anybody here?

761
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:15,839
Anyone?

762
00:42:24,038 --> 00:42:25,518
Hu.

763
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:26,558
Lu Fangqi.

764
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,558
Where is Jin Shichuan?

765
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,719
Captain Jin is still in there.

766
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:41,839
