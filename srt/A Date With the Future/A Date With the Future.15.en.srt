(I Think It's Missing A Female Owner)

18
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,822
I can't keep an open mind
for something like this.

19
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,703
I can't let go of the obsession in my heart.

20
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,863
I'm sure both Jin Shichuan

21
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,143
and Fang Huai were intended
to protect you.

22
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:11,583
But they ended up hurting you instead.

23
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,742
I don't know how to comfort you.

24
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,342
But I totally understand

25
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,502
the obsession you have for a loved one.

26
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,622
I myself waited ten years

27
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:29,942
for Jin Shichuan
because of an obsession.

28
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:35,143
I blamed Fang Huai.

29
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,502
I blamed him for being so cruel.

30
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,423
He decided on his own
to leave without saying goodbye.

31
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:43,222
But he's dead.

32
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,462
I'm the one being tortured by regrets.

33
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,143
This is the pain the living one
has to go through.

34
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,703
I know Jin Shichuan is a good person.

35
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:05,182
But I hope you've thought it through.

36
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:07,543
You need to know

37
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,662
the consequences of marrying a fireman.

38
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,782
I don't want you to grow through what I did.

Alright, Mr. and Mrs. Fang.

41

No need to see me off.

43

Don't forget the promise you made.

44
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,303
Zang Qiu is still young.

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,023
She is a filial girl.

46
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:52,742
Help us persuade her.

47
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,462
We all hope she can set up a new family.

48
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:58,462
A woman

49
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:01,502
should be with someone who loves her.

50
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,622
Fang Huai has been gone for so long.

51
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,502
It's time she moved on from the tragedy.

52
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:14,342
Well.

53
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:16,982
Why did you suddenly cry?

54
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:18,583
You said we wouldn't cry, right?

55
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,383
Shichuan, you can go.

56
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,542
We understand the nature of your job.

57

We are currently living comfortably.

59
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,862
We attend several classes every day.

60

English, and music.

62
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:41,063
We keep ourselves busy.

63
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,982
You don't have to visit us

64
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:44,143
if you're busy.

65
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,542
I will visit again.

66
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,342
Okay, be safe on the way back.

67
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:55,662

78
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,302
I've always been here.

79
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,102
Just turn around.

80
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:32,542
Then you'll see me.

81
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:39,183
Where did you go?

82
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,383
I went to see Fang Huai's parents.

83
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:45,782
Zang Qiu told me

84
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,102
about what happened with Fang Huai.

85
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,143
Are you not going to explain?

86
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:53,542
There's nothing to explain.

119
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:19,743
you won't look for me again?

124
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:28,942

125
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:33,983
So?

126
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,782
Are you thinking you now have a chance

127
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:40,023
because Fang Huai is gone?

128
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,983
No, I never thought that.

129
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:44,302
I never even considered myself.

130
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,103
I just

131
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,582
feel bad seeing you this way.

132
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:51,223
I finally understand

133
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,062
why you reject kindness from others,

134
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,863
not letting people get close to you.

135
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,343

00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,422

But I came here today

I will always be with you.

145

To protect you.

146
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,503
I don't need you to protect me.

148
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:17,383
I'll tell you one last time.

149
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:18,782
I don't want to see you again.

150
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:40,182
It's late.

153
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,702
I went to see Zang Qiu.

154
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:49,263
She rejected me again.

155
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:51,503
She said

156
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,422
not to show up

157
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:54,662
in front of her again.

158
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,143
Don't give up.

159
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,383
I won't.

160
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:01,503
I've thought it through.

161
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:04,223
I will do my best to make her happy.

162
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,463
I wish to see her smile.

163
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:09,743
She's so beautiful when she smiles.

164
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,103
When she smiles,

165
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:16,983
it feels like

166
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,143
my whole world is shining.

167
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:23,143
I'm like the cockroach that won't die.

168
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,023
Captain Jin.

169
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,223
You have to work hard too.

170
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,343
Go after your own happiness.

171
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:28,223
Okay.

172
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:35,743
Captain Jin.

173
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:37,062
Be happy!

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,343
Goodnight.

175

Hello?

177
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:04,223
You called me at this late hour.

178
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,422
(Is something up?)

179
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:06,743
Nothing much.

180
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,503
Just suddenly thought of calling you.

181
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,302
Are you missing me?

182
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:17,822
(What are you up to?)

183
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:20,782
I just turned on the computer

184
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,422
to finalize the work

185
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:23,263
I did today.

186
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:26,143
I won't disturb you then.

187
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:27,463
(You go ahead.)

00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,983
won't interfere with work.

190
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,343
We can talk for a while longer.

191
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:33,662
Okay.

192
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:38,743
Why aren't you talking?

193
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:40,383
Actually I don't know

194
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:41,223
what to talk about.

195
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:44,182
I just wanted to hear your voice.

196
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:48,743
How about this?

197
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,422
Listen to my draft.

198
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:51,782
This way,

199
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:53,863
both love relationship and career
are unaffected.

200
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:54,822
(Okay?)

201
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:55,822
Okay.

202
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:58,343
I'll enable hands-free.

203
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:04,822
Last June,

204
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,023
law enforcers of Huaigang

205
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:07,822
Market Supervision Bureau

206
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:10,062
found illegal smuggled refined oil

207
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,422
in a refitted truck owned by a Mr. Li.

208
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:13,542
The Supervision Bureau said

209
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,062
that every department will perform its duties

210
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,182
and strengthen law enforcement

211
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,422
to improve supervision.

212
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,463
As of the end of last year,

213
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:21,383
local authorities have found...

214
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,540
(Xu Lai, 554:16)

215
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,700
(Jin Shichuan)

216
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:58,863
Hello, are you still there?

217
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:01,942
I'm here.

218
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,223
Did you stay awake the whole night?

219
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:06,422
No.

220
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,023
When you stopped talking last night,

221
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:08,902
I guessed you fell asleep.

222
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:09,782
Did you just wake up?

223
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,902
Does that mean
we kept the call going

224
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:15,822
the whole night?

225
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:16,863
Why are you laughing?

226
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,223
I feel so lucky.

227
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:20,223
(The person I like)

228
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:21,782
(not only supports my career,)

229
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:22,863
(he also stayed up to keep me company.)

230
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:24,542
Silly girl.

231
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,623
Go and wash up. Get ready to work.

232
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:27,863
I have to go for morning drills.

233
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:29,463
Good morning.

234
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:30,942
Bye-bye.

235
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,263
Yes, who is it?

236
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,223
(Are you Xu Lai?)

237
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:59,103
(I'm TC's president,)

238
00:16:59,103 --> 00:16:59,942
(Mr. Sun's secretary.)

239
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,422
(Do you have time today?)

240
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:01,902
(Mr. Sun)

241
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:02,902
(would like to meet with you.)

242
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:12,743
Mr. Sun.

243
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:14,183
Ms. Xu is here.

244
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:17,503
Come in, Ms. Xu.

245
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:18,743
Take a seat.

246
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,142
Ms. Xu.

247
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:24,582
If there's anything,

248
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:26,302
let's sit down and talk about it.

249
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:33,503
Zhang.

250
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:34,822
Get Ms. Xu some tea.

251
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:35,622
It's okay.

252
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,062
Just get down to business.

253
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,183
I heard that you have been paying

254
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:46,183
a lot of attention to our company.

255
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:47,423
That's right.

256
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:48,862
I'm currently investigating

257
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:49,822
a traffic accident.

258
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,663
It involves a product from TC,

259
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:53,582
the mobile refrigerator.

260
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,983
You suspect that the mobile refrigerator

261
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,542
caused the accident?

262
00:17:58,663 --> 00:17:59,463
Not just a suspicion.

263
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,903
It's true that the mobile refrigerator has

264
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:02,463
major safety issues.

265
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:03,463
I'm sorry, Ms. Xu.

266
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,782
I have to stop you right there.

267
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,463
Every product our company produces,

268
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:09,023
including this model
of mobile refrigerator,

269
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:10,782
has undergone strict reviews

270
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:11,862
before they can be sold.

271
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:15,142
But according to the victim,

272
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,223
at that time,

273
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,102
the mobile refrigerator had exploded,

274
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:18,862
starting the fire,

275
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,102
which caused the two vehicles
to rear-end.

276
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,062
The couple in the RV,

277
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,223
one died, and the other injured.

278
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:24,943
That still doesn't prove
that the mobile refrigerator

279
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,463
had safety issues.

280
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:28,782
What if it was due to improper use?

281
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:29,822
From what I know,

282
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,223
the use environment

283
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,622
needs to meet certain requirements

284
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:34,782
to maintain voltage stability

285
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:35,743
while using the X-2.

286
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:40,263
Mr. Sun.

287
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:43,463
I only mentioned about a mobile refrigerator.

288
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,582
I didn't specify that it was

289
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,703
the X-2 model that had a problem.

290
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:51,862
From what you just said,

291
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,743
you clearly had prior information

292
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,423
regarding the issues of this mobile refrigerator.

293
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:57,943
Ms. Xu.

294
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,263
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear

295
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:01,342
so you misunderstood.

296
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:05,142
We feel bad that such an incident happened.

297
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,302
I give you my word

298
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,223
that I'd get the people responsible

299
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,263
to look into it.

300
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,822
If the problem did stem from TC,

301
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,263
the victim's medical fees

302
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:13,903
will be fully borne by TC.

303
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:17,503
I will also prepare a fee for your hard work.

304
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,183
That sounds like you're trying
to shut me up with money.

305
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:25,703
I don't need any payment.

306
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:26,903
Reporting the truth

307
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,183
is the duty of us newspeople.

308
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:33,782
Yes, you have your principles.

309
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,622
I too, have my difficulties.

310
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:37,463
Look.

311
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,263
TC is a big company.

312
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:40,023
We have many employees

313
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,342
working to put food in their mouths.

314
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:42,382
It's not easy.

315
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:43,382
Could you maybe...

316
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:44,542
Speaking of not easy,

317
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,263
Wang Dayong had more right to say that.

318
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,622
His wife suffered severe burns

319
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,142
and is currently bedridden
in the hospital.

320
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,023
A family is destroyed.

321
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,663
A life was lost.

322
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:58,342
Do you think you can make up for it with money?

323
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:04,503
Then, what do you propose?

324
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,663
I think TC

325
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:12,223
should bear all the medical fees of the victims,

326
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:13,782
and offer them a public apology.

327
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,463
Also, recall
the particular mobile refrigerators

328
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,903
from the market and halt all sales.

329
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,542
That's impossible.

330
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:20,423
I've told you clearly

331
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,263
that it's not possible.

332
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,943
This product is a bestseller.

333
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,903
It's being produced at a large scale to be sold.

334
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:26,903
Do you know

335
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,782
how much loss this will cause us at TC?

336
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:32,703
Besides, the product's supply chain

337
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,142
doesn't involve TC alone.

338
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,862
A public apology and product recall

339
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,223
will affect the survival of many businesses.

340
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,223
It's not something
a reporter like you can bear.

341
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:44,542
Then I guess I'll just have to report the truth.

342
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,943
I'll let the public know what really happened.

343
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:48,983
Ms. Xu.

344
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:56,062
I hope you can take a step back

345
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,142
and think about the consequences.

346
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,943
TC has a dedicated team of lawyers

347
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:02,463
to deal with such disputes.

348
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,142
If you report anything false,

349
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:06,142
we can sue you for defamation.

350
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,862
Are you sure you want to challenge us?

351
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:12,062
Mr. Sun.

352
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,503
Are you threatening me?

353
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:14,822
No.

354
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,302
I'm just stating a fact.

355
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,782
Ever since young,

356
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,223
I've hated being threatened.

357
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,622
Rest assured.

358
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,542
I will get to the bottom of this

359
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:28,062
and let the truth be known.

360
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:29,703
Hopefully,

361
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,142
you'll still be able to sit leisurely

362
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,622
like this when it happens.

363
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,743
That reporter doesn't know
what she's dealing with.

364
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,142
So she wants to do things the hard way.

365
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,062
If she reports it to the public,

366
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,382
will it affect Yunkai's
subsequent funding for us?

367
00:21:58,782 --> 00:21:59,342
What do you think?

368
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:04,503
This won't do.

369
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:07,423
I have to go to Yunkai.

370
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:10,663
I need to know what Huo Yanzong's thinking.

371
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,622
Saves me from overthinking.

372
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,023
Anyway.

373
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:20,102
I want that reporter to be dealt with.

374
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,463
Also, find a way

375
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,503
to keep the one in the hospital quiet.

376
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:25,582
Understood.

377
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:35,903
Sun Lei is here.

378
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:37,142
He's waiting at the meeting room.

379
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:38,703
Why is he here?

380
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:41,903
I guess it's about the additional investment.

381
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,582
Should I send him away?

382
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:45,342
No need.

383
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:47,582
I happen to want to talk to him.

384
00:22:57,263 --> 00:22:57,703
Mr. Huo.

385
00:22:58,862 --> 00:22:59,142
Sit.

386
00:22:59,263 --> 00:22:59,782
Alright.

387
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,023
Mr. Sun, you came all the way.

388
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:08,263
Is something that matters?

389
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:09,703
Mr. Huo.

390
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:11,062
It's about the additional investment.

391
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,382
Have you thought about it?

392
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:14,822
I've told you.

393
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:16,302
There's no rush. Be patient.

394
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,582
Is there something else on your mind?

395
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:22,743
I heard a mobile refrigerator you're selling

396
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:23,743
caused an accident.

397
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:24,983
And there's casualty?

398
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:26,302
It's all made up

399
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:27,862
by that female reporter.

400
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:28,263
Mr. Huo.

401
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:29,743
Please don't take it seriously.

402
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,822
I don't know about the female reporter.

403
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:34,822
All I know is once such a scandal gets verified,

404
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:36,622
Yunkai will have to re-evaluate

405
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,703
our investment in TC.

406
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:40,542
You can forget about increasing capital.

407
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:42,382
Mr. Huo, I assure you.

408
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,903
The other opponent
won't be able to make a case

409
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:45,943
without enough evidence.

410
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:48,382
What if she finds more evidence in the future?

411
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:56,382
Don't worry.

412
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:58,062
I'm a businessman.

413
00:23:58,263 --> 00:23:59,062
I only look at the profit.

414
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:02,382
The reason I'm asking you this is to take precaution.

415
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:03,503
If anything does happen,

416
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:05,983
at least I'd know how to deal with it.

417
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:06,582
Right?

418
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:08,542
After all,

419
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,463
we are in the same boat.

420
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:12,023
Profits are shared.

421
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:18,382
Yes, Mr. Huo.

422
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:20,862
I'll be honest with you.

423
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:25,542
To lower the production costs and maximize profits,

424
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:27,743
I did recall a batch of old parts

425
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:30,302
and used them in the production of X-2.

426
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:32,102
But rest assured.

427
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,263
On this matter,

428
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:34,663
we made sure to be discreet.

429
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:36,382
Even the professional bodies

430
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:37,983
were unable to find evidence.

431
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,423
What more to say the female reporter?

432
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:46,542
Excuse me. How are you related to Zhao Li?

433
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,622
I am Zhao Li's mother.

434
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:50,183
Hello.

435
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:52,183
I'm TC's executive secretary.

436
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:53,542
This is my business card.

437
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,423
Because of you, my son-in-law is dead.

438
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:01,183
And my daughter is in this state.

439
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:03,703
How dare you show up here?

440
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:05,342
Please don't be upset.

441
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:08,023
I came to help you resolve the problem.

442
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,503
Resolve the problem?

443
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,062
How do you plan to resolve this problem?

444
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,622
Our boss, Mr. Sun,

445
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:16,183
would like to compensate you.

446
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:17,822
To alleviate your burden.

447
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,423
You people are supposed to take responsibility.

448
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:23,223
It was your mobile refrigerator
that caused this.

449
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:25,503
My family is ruined because of you!

450
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,263
Don't jump to conclusions.

451
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:30,223
All our products have passed evaluations.

452
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,542
We're only offering you compensation

453
00:25:33,463 --> 00:25:34,862
out of compassion.

454
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:38,663
The prerequisite being we're on the same page.

455
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,302
You must not damage the company's

456
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:41,862
image and reputation.

457
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:44,223
There's no point denying it.

458
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:47,423
A TV reporter has already interviewed us.

459
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:49,342
We have proof.

460
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:50,663
Proof?

461
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:55,023
Are you sure she has the right proof?

462
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,023
Are you sure she's going to help you?

463
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,102
I'll be frank with you.

464
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,102
That reporter went to visit us too.

465
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,062
She had a nice little chat with Mr. Sun.

466
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,183
You are nobody of significance.

467
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:18,423
There's no need for her

468
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,223
to invite the wrath of TC, right?

469
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:21,822
There's one more thing

470
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:22,782
I'd like to remind you.

471
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:27,542
Our company has an established legal team

472
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:29,382
whose task is to deal with such cases.

473
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:30,983
We've never lost.

474
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,582
Moreover, going to court
and hiring lawyers

475
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:36,023
require a huge sum of money.

476
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:38,663
Can you afford it?

477
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,023
Maybe you can.

478
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:42,062
But what about your daughter?

479
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:44,503
She needs all the money
to treat herself.

480
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:45,102
Get...

481
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:48,782
Get out!

482
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:03,703
My business card.

483
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:07,743
Call me whenever you're ready.

484
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,223
This is the internal data on TC.

485
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,983
And their recent accident reports.

486
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:29,943
Sun Lei admitted it himself.

487
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:32,302
Their company did recall old parts

488
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,223
and refit them.

489
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:36,023
They used them in the production
of X-2 mobile refrigerators.

490
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:36,862
This mean,

491
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:38,463
he lied from the beginning.

492
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,503
He knew that the product
had safety issues,

493
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,062
but he went ahead
with production and sales.

494
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:45,142
(Confidentiality Agreement)
He puts lives at risk just for profits.

495
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:46,423
Inhuman.

496
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:48,463
I also found the secret factory

497
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:50,263
where TC conducted recycling of old parts.

498
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:50,943
Okay.

499
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,663
Now we have concrete evidence of TC's crime.

500
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:56,542
Thank you. You've been a big help.

501
00:27:57,983 --> 00:27:58,983
No need to be so courteous with me.

502
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:01,983
I have to remind you though.

503
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,263
Sun Lei is unscrupulous.

504
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,062
If you push him to the edge,

505
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:07,703
he might do something drastic.

506
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,263
So please be careful.

507
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:11,223
Don't worry. I will take care.

508
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:14,062
What? Change hospitals?

509
00:28:14,463 --> 00:28:15,102
Yes.

510
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,423
We'd like to go to another hospital.

511
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:18,503
Why?

512
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,342
Isn't she recovering well?

513
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:23,542
Is it because of money?

514
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,142
Ma'am, I've explained to you.

515
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:26,463
I can pay for it in advance.

516
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,463
It's not about money.

517
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,263
Doctor Zang.

518
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:30,903
I know you're a good person.

519
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:32,542
Since we've already decided,

520
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,382
please ask no more.

521
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:36,703
But you're...

522
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:38,903
Ma'am.

523
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,822
We're here to help you pack and move.

524
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:42,263
Who are you?

525
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:43,703
What's your connection with Zhao Li?

526
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,463
We are her friends.

527
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:47,903
Right, ma'am?

528
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:52,822
You cannot enter.

529
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:55,542
Before I confirm the patient's decision,

530
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:57,142
I will not let you in.

531
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:01,423
The patient's decision
is to switch hospitals.

532
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,743
So better mind your own business, okay?

533
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:09,782
I said you can't enter.

534
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:13,382
Doctor Zang.

535
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,142
Don't harm Doctor Zang.

536
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:16,663
I'll just go with you.

537
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:19,183
Don't hurt Doctor Zang.

538
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:19,782
I'll go with you.

539
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:21,382
I said I'll go with you, okay?

540
00:29:21,582 --> 00:29:22,142
Doctor Zang.

541
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:28,503
What are you people doing?

542
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:31,223
Who are you?

543
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:33,062
This doesn't concern you.

544
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:34,223
Get lost.

545
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:35,463
I'm from the city fire service.

546
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:37,622
This is the victim of the accident.

547
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,062
I have the right to ask.

548
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:42,423
We are Ms. Zhao's friends.

549
00:29:42,743 --> 00:29:43,503
Here to help her move.

550
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,183
Friends? How come I've not heard

551
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:47,943
of friends like you?

552
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,943
I'll have all of you show your identification.

553
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,542
Including the one at the door.

554
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:58,183
We'll let it go today.

555
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:01,743
I'll come back tomorrow.

556
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:11,023
Doctor Zang, I'm sorry.

557
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,983
I didn't know they'd be like this.

558
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:13,903
Ma'am.

559
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,223
Can you tell me the truth now?

560
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:17,782
Who are they really?

561
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,302
Why did you want to change hospitals?

562
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:25,463
Okay.

563
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:30,342
When are you inviting Yu Shishi

564
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,223
for a meal together?

565
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:32,382
You've been dating for some time

566
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:33,302
but I haven't seen her.

567
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,183
She's quite busy.

568
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:37,302
We'll find time.

569
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:39,622
Okay.

570
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:40,862
Next time you're free,

571
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:41,582
we'll eat together.

572
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:44,903
Excuse me.

573
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:45,943
Hello?

574
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:48,582
She wants to switch hospitals?

575
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:50,302
Okay, I'll be right there.

576
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:52,743
I need to go to the hospital.
It's urgent.

577
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:54,463
Do you need help?

578
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:55,903
I can drive you there.

579
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:56,503
It's okay.

580
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:58,023
It's related to TC.

581
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:58,983
You're not at liberty to help.

582
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:04,822
Lu Fangqi.

583
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:05,622
Captain Jin.

584
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,663
What's happened?

585
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,023
That's what happened.

586
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:12,102
Why are you here?

587
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:13,503
I called Captain Jin.

588
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:15,263
When I went to check on Zhao Li,

589
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:16,663
I was told they wish
to change hospitals.

590
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:18,703
A group of men came trying to take her away.

591
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:20,223
Men from TC?

592
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:21,382
Her mother said

593
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:23,183
people from TC had approached her.

594
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:26,102
Looks like Sun Lei's
trying to shut them up.

595
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:27,582
They also said

596
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:28,542
they'd be back tomorrow.

597
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,903
Her mother already

598
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:31,782
seems to be wavering.

599
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,263
So I quickly contacted you.

600
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:36,743
Can I go talk to them?

601
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:37,582
Go ahead.

602
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:42,023
I'll go too.

603
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:49,663
Come in.

604
00:31:59,302 --> 00:31:59,903
Ma'am.

605
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,183
I heard someone from TC

606
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:03,062
came to find you.

607
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:05,223
Are you not going to sue TC anymore?

608
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:07,062
Yes.

609
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:08,903
We won't take them to court.

610
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:09,983
Don't you want justice

611
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,062
for your loss?

612
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:14,542
Justice is only for those

613
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:15,463
who can afford it.

614
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:16,703
People like us,

615
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:18,463
with no money,

616
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,062
we're lucky to just be alive.

617
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,503
What do we have to fight

618
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:24,503
with a big corporation like TC?

619
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:25,822
I can help you.

620
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:27,622
I've found the evidence.

621
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,142
We can take TC down.

622
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,062
What if one day

623
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:32,822
you decide not to help us?

624
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,463
You're not related to us in any way.

625
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:37,423
Why should I believe you?

626
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,023
Why would you help us anyway?

627
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:40,503
I...

628
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:41,183
Ma'am.

629
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:43,743
Please believe in Xu Lai.

630
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:46,903
She is a reporter with a sense

631
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:48,423
of duty and justice.

632
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:50,703
In order to find evidence,

633
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:52,822
she's gone to the fire station
many times

634
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:54,743
to find out more
about the problematic refrigerators.

635
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,503
She stayed up late to collate data.

636
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:00,183
All because she wants to let the truth be known.

637
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,943
She sincerely wants to help you.

638
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:04,102
And you are?

639
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:05,582
I am the captain of Huaigang

640
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:07,223
Fire and Disaster Relief First Brigade,
Jin Shichuan.

641
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,023
When the accident happened,

642
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,582
I was on site carrying out
rescue efforts.

643
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:13,622
Thank you.

644
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:14,782
Thank you.

645
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:16,102
No need to thank me.

646
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:17,862
Thank you for saving my daughter.

647
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:18,743
No need.

648
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,622
This is our duty.

649
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,183
You saved my daughter's life.

650
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:25,062
Ma'am.

651
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,423
You have my word.

652
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:30,023
Xu Lai will not abandon you.

653
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:33,782
I hope you can be like her and persevere.

654
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:35,622
Don't give up so easily.

655
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:40,263
It's not that I want to give up.

656
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:43,822
But if we do go to court,

657
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:45,142
it will take a lot out of my daughter

658
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,263
in her current state.

659
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:46,943
Ma'am.

660
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,142
Physical wounds can heal.

661
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,503
But what about mental trauma?

662
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:52,463
If you guys give up,

663
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:54,542
then who's going to seek justice

664
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:55,382
for the late Wang Dayong?

665
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:05,342
Can I really trust you?

666
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:06,423
Of course.

667
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:08,222
I won't back down.

668
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,303
We will stand firmly with you.

669
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:14,062
Me too, and my teammates.

670
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,863
We will testify for Ms. Zhao.

671
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,423
We'll do our best to help you.

672
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,542
Dear, what do you say?

673
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:44,102
How did it go?

674
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,262
They finally agreed
not to change hospitals.

675
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:47,903
That's good.

676
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:51,303
Their doubts were dispelled

677
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,622
thanks to Jin Shichuan's help.

678
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:56,503
Next time,

679
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,142
if troublemakers come to the hospital,

680
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,503
get in touch with me. I'll sort it out.

681
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:02,503
I will too.

682
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:05,622
I'll be off.

683
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:08,943
Hey.

684
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:09,863
Doctor Zang.

685
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:11,662
Doctor Zang.

686
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:14,423
Stop following me.

687
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,702
Mental trauma needs time to heal.

688
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:32,222
Don't worry.

689
00:35:41,983 --> 00:35:42,503
We're here.

690
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:44,983
After getting you home,

691
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:46,262
I have to go back to the station.

692
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:48,303
You take care.

693
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:49,943
See you.

694
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:57,383
Give me a hug.

695
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,062
Go back. It's windy.

696
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:05,702
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

697
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:28,112
(Shut up)

698
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:42,383
I went to check the surveillance

699
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:43,423
at the building management.

700
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,702
I found that all the cameras
on this block

701
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:45,742
were tampered with.

702
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:48,182
Looks like they planned this beforehand.

703
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:49,423
Anyway,

704
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:51,062
did you lose anything?

705
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:53,863
I checked.

706
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:55,182
I think a hard drive is missing.

707
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,582
What's in the hard drive?

708
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,303
Something important?

709
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,943
It's just materials from work.

710
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,542
This doesn't seem like a normal break-in.

711
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:06,262
Did you guys piss anyone off recently?

712
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:08,702
I don't think so.

713
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:12,182
Sun Lei.

714
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:14,222
It must be Sun Lei.

715
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:16,303
Sun Lei.

716
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:18,303
Listen.

717
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:21,303
It's better not to stay here tonight.

718
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,062
We have to obtain more evidence.

719
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:24,582
Find a time in the next few days

720
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:25,783
to come to the police station

721
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:26,702
for a detailed testimony.

722
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:27,582
That's all for now.

723
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:28,102
Okay?

724
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,102
Okay, thanks.

725
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:31,542
Let's step outside.

726
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:43,783
Don't be scared. I'm here.

727
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:47,622
I'll go pack some stuff

728
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:49,023
and find lodging elsewhere.

729
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:51,463
Don't stay outside today.

730
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:54,662
I'm worried about you.

731
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:57,062
Stay at my place tonight.

732
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:58,222
Your place?

733
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:15,823
How long haven't you been back?

734
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:17,783
I'm usually staying at the station.

735
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:21,102
So the house is vacant most of the time.

736
00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:25,783
What a waste of good space.

737
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,943
I worry that if I stay at the station during breaks,

738
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:34,142
the others would feel self-conscious.

739
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,423
So I prefer to stay by myself.

740
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:43,662
I think your house feels quite deserted.

741
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:44,662
It's missing one thing.

742
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:48,142
Missing what?

743
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,262
Missing a female owner like me.

744
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,423
Do you know what just happened?

745
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:56,182
Now's not the time to joke.

746
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:57,383
Just trying to alleviate the atmosphere.

747
00:38:58,343 --> 00:38:59,662
I couldn't possibly say I'm nervous.

748
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:02,383
Alright.

749
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,262
I've informed the building management.

750
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:06,702
They will send patrol to check often.

751
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,303
It's safe here. Don't worry.

752
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:11,903
These are my slippers.

753
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,662
I hope you don't mind.

754
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:15,983
I'm going back to the team.

755
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:16,943
See you tomorrow.

756
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:23,142
Hey.

757
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,142
Can you stay and keep me company?

758
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:37,863
I'll feel more assured with you here.

759
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:00,182
Well.

760
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,463
There's only one bed.

761
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,142
You can sleep in the bedroom.

762
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,503
I'll sleep in the living room.

763
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,423
Is that really okay?

764
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:18,863
I'm the guest. You shouldn't have
to sleep on the floor.

765
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:20,943
It's okay.

766
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:24,823
When the rescue team
is dispatched to disaster zones,

767
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:25,823
we often sleep on the floor.

768
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,622
We don't even have blankets sometimes.

769
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:30,503
I'm used to it.

770
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:33,903
But...

771
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:36,463
Do you know where the bedroom is?

772
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:37,622
I'll show you.

773
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:40,582
Here.

774
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:42,343
The room on the left.

775
00:40:44,383 --> 00:40:44,783
Well.

776
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:45,742
Goodnight.

777
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:46,222
Goodnight.

778
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:48,262
Sleep early.

779
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:04,949
(Firefighter, Serve the People)

780
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,060
(Squad Leader)

781
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:36,102
Jin Shichuan.

782
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,423
Are you asleep?

783
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:07,383
Jin Shichuan.

784
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:09,542
Are you asleep?

785
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,463
Not yet.

786
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:15,542
What's the matter?

787
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:23,582
I was actually quite scared just now.

788
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:26,102
I was still reeling from the shock.

789
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:28,542
And then the lights in the corridor
suddenly went out.

790
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:35,503
A person tends to imagine all sorts

791
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:37,303
of scary things
when they're enveloped in darkness.

792
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:41,783
