(Xu Lai, This Is My Counter Attack)

18
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:52,381
Are you alright?

19
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,062
Is something wrong?

20
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:55,702
It's nothing.

21
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,381
Gastric pain. I'm used to it.

22
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,702
Did you skip your meals again?

23
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,301
The surgery schedule is too packed
for me to eat.

24
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:04,982
You'll fall sick

25
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:05,622
if you don't eat.

26
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,062
Let's get you some food.

What's it got to do with you

28
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,342
whether I eat or not?

29
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,622
Get out.

30
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,582
Don't bother me.

31
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,821
No matter what,
you have to eat something.

32
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:15,022
Doctor Zang...

33
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,022
Something's missing.

34
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:42,941
Mister, your delivery.

35
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:43,742
Thanks.

36
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:11,701
Why do you look

37
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:12,541
just like Doctor Zang?

38
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:14,862
Covered in thorns everywhere.

39
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,341
But the more I look at you,
the more I like you.

00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,901
(I left a cactus on your desk.)

42
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,821
(It absorbs radiation)

43
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,662
(and adds vitality to the space.)

44
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,461
(Don't just think
about work all the time.)

45
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,021
(Your well-being is important too.)

46
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:53,982
(Remember to eat on time.)

47
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,622
(I sincerely hope)

48
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:56,821

Why are you still here?

52
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:30,701
I went to get medicine for you.

53
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:31,742
For your gastric pain.

54
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,341
Remember to take it.

55
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,461
I'll be going now.

56
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:41,941
Rest early.

57
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:45,102
I'm off.

58
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:47,501
Remember to take the medicine.

59
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:48,581
After meal.

60
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,021
Yes?

61
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:54,622
Have you eaten?

62
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:56,261
Not yet.

63
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:57,622
Let's go eat together.

64
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,102
Sure!

65
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:04,341
Sir.

66
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,261
Hello.

67
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:05,901
Long time no see.

68
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:06,581
Yes, long time no see.

69
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:07,622
Any giblets?

70
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:08,542
Yes, sure.

71
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:09,461
One of that then.

72
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,021
Okay.

73
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:11,701
And this, this,

74
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:12,622
this, this,

75
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:13,542
and corn.

76
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,302
Ten of each.

77
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:14,901
Okay.

78
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:15,461
Make it spicy.

79
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:15,941
Okay.

80
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:16,622
Less spicy.

81
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,222
Her stomach is not good.

82
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:20,782
Less spicy.

83
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:21,662
Okay.

84
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:25,141
Madam.

85
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,501
Doctor Zang, it's been a while.

86
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,782
Yes, I've been busy.

87
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,501
Right.

88
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:30,422
What would you like today?

89
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,062
Get me some pickled radish

90
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:34,542
and green beans.

91
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:34,941
Sure.

92
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,461
And ice coke.

93
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,341
Sure, no problem.

94
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,021
No ice.

95
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:37,862
Got it.

96
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,222
Are you the doctor or am I?

97
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,182
Mind your own business.

98
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:44,381
Here's the menu. Order what you want.

99
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,581
I thought you ordered for two.

100
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,102
What?

101
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,222
Those are all for me.

102
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,742
Here you go, pickled radish.

103
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,542
Thanks, madam.

104
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,141
You're welcome.

105
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,542
I'll clear these, Doctor Zang.

106
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:16,422
Thanks.

107
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,182
No worries.

108
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,381
You're a big eater.

109
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,341
What's so funny?

110
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,821
You always look so stern.

111
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,581
Wearing a don't-come-near-me expression.

112
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,222
Today is my first time seeing you

113
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:36,742
behave like a normal person.

114
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,901
Is that how I am in your eyes?

115
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,062
No.

116
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,542
Because fairies are otherworldly.

117
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,302
I'm done. Let's go.

118
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:57,461
Thanks, sir.

119
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:58,501
Okay. Bye-bye.

120
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,742
What are you doing?

121
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:19,542
What?

122
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:20,222
Be still.

123
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,141
You're like a kid.

124
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,662
You've got food on your face.

125
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:40,821
Stop following me.

126
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,502
Doctor Zang.

127
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,502
Are you angry again?

128
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:46,221
Wait for me!

129
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,221
What is it?

130
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:47,542
You're awake.

131
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:52,662
Good boy.

132
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:55,461
Good boy.

133
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:01,581
Feeling better?

134
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,542
Let me look at you.

135
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:14,142
Good boy.

136
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,861
Good boy.

137
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:23,542
- Up!
- Lie down.

138
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,142
Walk. This way.

139
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:25,821
Turn.

140
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,022
Walk. Good.

141
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:27,662
Salute!

142
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:28,302
Okay.

143
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:29,981
Heel.

144
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:30,902
Captain Jin!

145
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,821
- Captain Jin.
- Captain Jin.

146
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:35,941
How is Peace?

147
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:36,981
What did the doctor say?

148
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,941
He's okay. It's nothing serious.

149
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:40,142
The assessment is coming up.

150
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,502
It must be a lot of pressure for Peace.

151
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:43,382
Yeah.

152
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:44,821
That's what I'm worried about too.

153
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:46,782
He still has to regain his strength.

154
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,182
From today on,

155
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:51,941
I will be Peace's trainer.

156
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:55,262
Really?

157
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,941
I'm sure he'll pass the assessment.

158
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:00,902
Whatever problems he faces,

159
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,302
we'll resolve them together.

160
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:04,981
That's great.

161
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,502
There's hope for Peace now.

162
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:10,621
Captain Jin.

163
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,142
You're finally
going to train dogs again.

164
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,422
Let's do physical training together,

165
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:16,062
okay?

166
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:17,662
Good boy.

167
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:30,981
Captain Jin

168
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,941
has agreed to train Peace?

169
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:34,861
Yes.

170
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:37,741
Got to hand it to Xu Lai.

171
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,142
This was a big scar Captain Jin carried.

172
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,341
Yet Xu Lai easily patched it up.

173
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:49,142
Peace has always been fond of Captain Jin.

174
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:50,821
He must be happy

175
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,341
that Captain is training him.

176
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:54,741
I'm jealous.

177
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:58,782
Why?

178
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:00,382
Missing your Champ?

179
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,941
Champ is recovering well.

180
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:05,941
Don't worry.

181
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,821
He's waiting for your return.

182
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:11,581
Xu.

183
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:15,382
Don't come visit me again.

184
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:18,302
Focus on training.

185
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,302
You better not end up

186
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,382
failing the exam.

187
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,741
Then you'll have to part with your dog.

188
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:27,741
Like me.

189
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,782
There's still a week
till the assessment.

190
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:31,902
Who knows

191
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:32,782
if Captain Jin would call you back

192
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:33,782
before then?

193
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:36,182
Don't worry.

194
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:37,861
Impossible.

195
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,022
He will never reassign me so soon.

196
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:43,861
Who said it's impossible?

197
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:45,581
Captain Jin.

198
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:46,182
Captain Jin.

199
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:49,981
What's cooking today?

200
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,461
Stir fry potato strips with vinegar.

201
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:52,741
And celery buns.

202
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:55,782
You look to be in good spirits.

203
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:56,662
Captain Jin..

204
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,022
I've realized

205
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:58,821
what I did was wrong.

206
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,502
I won't let you down again.

207
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:02,182
Good to know.

208
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,461
Means you've grown.

209
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:07,022
You can come back to the team.

210
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,142
You're allowing me to go back?

211
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:10,422
You don't want to?

212
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,422
No, of course I do.

213
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:16,262
Search and rescue team member,
Zhang Yang.

214
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:18,422
You are officially reinstated today.

00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,182
Yes, sir!

216
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:22,422
Team member, Zhang Yang,
received the order.

217
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,621
Fill him in.

218
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:29,221
Will do.

219
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,262
Wash the vegetables properly.

220
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:31,782
Okay.

221
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:39,941
Peace.

222
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:41,941
Come here.

223
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,621
Peace, don't be scared.

224
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:19,941
Go.

225
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,461
Here, Peace.

226
00:14:58,741 --> 00:14:59,542
Good boy.

227
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:03,542
Okay.

228
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:05,422
Good boy.

229
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:06,502
Come here.

230
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:08,782
Ready.

231
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:11,861
Peace.

232
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:14,861
Good boy.

233
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:35,182
Salute!

234
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:39,941
Down.

235
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,302
You've all worked hard.

236
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,062
Today is our last session.

237
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,062
Hurdle race.

238
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,621
In the previous object search

239
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:48,821
and target pursuit assessments,

240
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,701
everyone had performed well.

241
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,060

Now you will come and choose

242

your own test assignment.

00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,101
Me and two other examiners

244
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,422
will score you.

245
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,262
Do your best.

246
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,782
Show us the result of your hard work.

247
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,741

Jump.

252
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:33,861
Okay.

Jump!

272
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:18,341

Congratulations.

All of you have passed.

295
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:40,861
I hereby announce

296
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,222
the Earthquake

297
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:45,742
Rescue Team is now official.

298
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,942
I volunteer to join
the Earthquake Rescue Team.

299
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,982
I will be loyal to the country,
uphold strict discipline,

300
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,661
and go through fire and water
to serve the people.

301
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,062
I am duty-bound.

302
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,782
I will obey orders,
follow instructions,

303
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:01,462
dedicate myself to the task
and train hard.

304
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,542
I will not fear danger or sacrifice,

305
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,341
all to protect the well-being of the people
and property.

306
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:09,581
I will contribute everything I have

307
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,901
to preserve societal stability.

308
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,421
I will be loyal to the country,
uphold strict discipline,

309
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:18,381
and go through fire and water
to serve the people.

322
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:03,181
I came here because

323
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:04,101
one, to train the dogs,

324
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:05,901
and two, to gather information.

325
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:07,861
Something like a business leave.

369
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,141
I came from a village of farmers.

370
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:45,621
When

371
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:47,101
everyone learned

372
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,542
that I was going to be a fireman,

373
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:51,302
I tell you.

374
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,982
They lined a 10-kilometer road
to see me off.

375
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,381
A hero's send-off.

376
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:58,542
The whole village

377
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:02,222
was so proud of me.

378
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:03,982
Honestly, my family background

379
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:05,581
is nothing to shout about.

380
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,661
When my wife agreed to marry me,

381
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:10,542
honestly speaking,

382
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:12,821
it was a disservice to her.

383
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:14,621
Last year,

384
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:16,661
she got pregnant.

385
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:19,581
I wasn't there with her.

386
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,821
My daughter is already

387
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:23,661
six months old.

388
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,062
Actually,

389
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,942
my dream was to become a singer.

390
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,022
But my dad was against it.

391
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,942
He said I was not being serious.

392
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,502
Till my third year of high school,

393
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,421
I was involved in a very bad car accident.

394
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:42,621
It was a fireman who saved my life.

395
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:45,222
Since then,

396
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,062
becoming a fireman became my ambition.

397
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,901
I want to become a person

398
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:53,262
who gives strength and hope to others.

399
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:55,542
That's great.

400
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:56,421
Awesome.

401
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,782
(See you at the usual place. Xu Lai.)

402
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:07,062
You're here.

403
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:09,022
Why did you want to see me?

404
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:09,621
Sit.

405
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,341
It's late and no one's around.

406
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,861
Of course I'm hoping to do

407
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,502
something taboo with you.

408
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:23,901
Taboo?

409
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:29,621
I brought this

410
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:30,861
to the training camp secretly

411
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:31,661
when I came.

412
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:33,381
Do you want to drink it together?

413
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:40,861
What?

414
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:42,742
Are you drunk even before drinking?

415
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,462
I don't drink. It's a principle.

416
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,942
Time flies.

417
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,022
Tomorrow is the last day.

418
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:13,942
There's something

419
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,542
I've been wanting to tell you.

420
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:23,381
You and Peace

421
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:26,581
healed me.

422
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:29,742
If not for you two,

423
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:31,782
I would still

424
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,982
be living in the pain
from losing Windchase.

425
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:37,181
Thank you, Xu Lai.

426
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,502
Just a "thank you"?

427
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:43,901
So stingy.

428
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:45,742
I thought

429
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,742
you'd ask to marry me.

430
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:54,062
Just kidding.

431
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,262
Are you sure you don't want some?

432
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:04,982
Is it because

433
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:06,381
you don't like sharing a bottle with me?

434
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:10,702
We already kissed.
What's the problem here?

435
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:13,702
Didn't you forget?

436
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:14,901
Forget what?

437
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,661
About that kiss.

438
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,062
You're seriously naive.

439
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,222
That was my first kiss.

440
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,502
How could I forget it?

441
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,742
Stop drinking. It's too much.

442
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,861
I'm happy. I want to celebrate.

443
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,181
Celebrate what?

444
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,381
Celebrate the fact that

445
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:41,942
we're able to sit together like this.

446
00:26:42,262 --> 00:26:44,181
Celebrate the fact
that you didn't push me away.

447
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,702
It's considered a step up.

448
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:08,022
You have such a handsome face.

449
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:09,661
So why do you

450
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,821
always show a black face?

451
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:12,381
So stern.

452
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,581
Dud Jin. Stupid Jin. Stubborn Jin.

453
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,141
Don't you know

454
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,821
how much I like you?

455
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:25,462
Because I like you,
I'm always thinking of ways

456
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,341
to improve the chances

457
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,262
of you liking me back.

458
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,421
But don't think I'm frivolous

459
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:37,141
because of that.

460
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:39,062
Because I only do it for you.

461
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,101
And the reason

462
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:46,782
why I'm sad to leave this place

463
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:49,222
is because I'll miss you.

464
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:53,661
If one day,

465
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,782
I am no longer by your side,

466
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,821
will you miss me right here?

467
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,982
Jin Shichuan.

468
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:52,821
Listen up.

469
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,621
Turn left!

470
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,502
Be still.

471
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:58,262
I'm going to drop you if you move.

472
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:02,022
I can't keep still.

473
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,861
Because my heart

474
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:06,101
is beating so hard right now.

475
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:10,742
Jin Shichuan.

476
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:13,782
Can you not leave me?

477
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,381
I don't want to part with you.

478
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,621
Okay, I won't leave you.

479
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,181
You're the best.

480
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:21,181
I like you the best.

481
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:25,062
Will you miss me too?

482
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:26,581
Yes, I will.

483
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:54,502
My head.

484
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:00,621
How did I get back last night?

485
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:14,861
Why did I do that again?

486
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,861
What will he think of me?

487
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:34,381
(I remember)

488
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,661
(today's your last day of training.)

489
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:36,901
(I'll pick you up.)

490
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:38,542
(Okay.)

491
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:46,861
Since I already did it,
why didn't I go all the way?

492
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,262
I should've kissed him.

493
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:09,661
Where are you going?

494
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:11,462
To pick Xu Lai up.

495
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,661
There are only four things in your life.

496
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:15,581
Eat, work, sleep, and Xu Lai.

497
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:17,421
I set up a dinner date

498
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,502
with Yu Shishi and her manager.

499
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,302
Come along.

500
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:21,421
Who is Yu Shishi?

501
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,942
The actress who's trending right now.

502
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:25,702
She was in several popular shows.

503
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,982
Their company is very interested
in working with Yunkai.

504
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,062
They've been wanting to meet you.

505
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:31,502
You know I don't like

506
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,141
such meetings.

507
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:33,861
You figure it out yourself.

508
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,302
Wait.

509
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:38,421
Their boss will be going.

510
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:39,782
It will be rude not to show up.

511
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,381
So,

512
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:46,341
I'll leave Peace to you.

513
00:31:46,942 --> 00:31:47,581
Don't worry.

514
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:48,861
I'll take good care of him.

515
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:52,462
Listen to Captain Jin

516
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,581
when I'm not around.

517
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:58,381
If you miss him,

518
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:00,542
you can always drop by the fire station.

519
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:03,661
What if I miss you?

520
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:06,821
You...

521
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:09,141
You can always drop by to see me too.

522
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:17,062
I think I forgot

523
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,381
something very important.

524
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:19,901
What is it?

525
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,861
Something I didn't finish last night.

526
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,661
You're always the one sneaking up on me.

527
00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:00,782
Xu Lai.

528
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:03,421
This is my counter-attack.

529
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,901
I have to train. See you.

530
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,502
Counter-attack.

531
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:46,381
Huo.

532
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,181
Just now, Jin Shichuan...

533
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:48,861
Stop.

534
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,101
What's wrong?

535
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:56,982
What's the matter?

536
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:01,502
Nothing.

537
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:04,421
I just thought of something at work.

538
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:05,502
It's a little upsetting.

539
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,341
Did something happen at the company?

540
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:10,502
Nothing serious.

541
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:11,701
Don't worry about it.

542
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:16,942
Huo.

543
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,661
If anything is wrong,

544
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:21,422
make sure you tell Han Fang and me.

545
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:22,862
I might not be able to help,

546
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,502
but we can lend you our ears.

547
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,621
We can help relieve the pressure.

548
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:30,382
Don't worry. I'm fine.

549
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,280
(Huaigang TV Station)

550
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:05,942
Here.

551
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:06,701
See you.

552
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:07,261
Go on.

553
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:13,141
Oh, Huo.

554
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:14,502
Chin up.

555
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,342
Han Fang and I will always support you.

556
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:18,181
You can do it.

557
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:19,701
Go on.

558
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:21,181
Stay safe.

559
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:22,701
You too.

560
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:30,862
Ms. Xu.

561
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:32,621
You're back.

562
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:34,502
I missed you so much

563
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:35,502
while you were away.

564
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:37,342
I was so worried that
Captain Jin kidnapped you.

565
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:38,862
Wait a minute, Zhou.

566
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:39,661
Just one month away

567
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:40,661
and you've learned to tease me.

568
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:43,022
Xu Lai is back.

569
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,422
Long time no see.

570
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:46,902
You've lost weight.

571
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,261
Must have been tough.

572
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,221
Not at all. I had a lot of fun.

573
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,462
But I must say you look rosy.

574
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:57,502
I'm guessing love did some magic.

575
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,862
Please don't jest with me, Xin.

576
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:02,301
As if I wasn't being serious at work.

577
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:04,141
I went there to work.

578
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:04,701
Later,

579
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:05,701
I have to report to Chief.

580
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:07,701
Sure, go ahead.

581
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:08,581
Talk to you later.

582
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:17,181
Ms. Xu.

583
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:20,261
When did you and Jiang Xin
become so chummy?

584
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:22,422
You think I'm stupid?

585
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:24,062
I was just testing her

586
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:25,301
to see what she's planning.

587
00:36:26,862 --> 00:36:27,462
Get working.

588
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:33,342
Chief.

589
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,221
This is the report on the setting up

590
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,141
of the Earthquake Rescue Team.

591
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:36,902
It's finished.

592
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:37,701
A special feature.

593
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:42,822
Pretty good.

594
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,141
It's comprehensive.

595
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,141
And the angle is quite novel.

596
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:50,141
Looks like

597
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,301
the one month's work paid off.

598
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:52,301
Of course.

599
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,781
I went there with a mission.

600
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:54,982
While training dogs,

601
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,581
I didn't forget about my primary job.

602
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:01,022
You're still quite new,

603
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:03,382
but you've been doing very well.

604
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,661
I think the time is right

605
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:07,902
for you to climb the ranks.

606
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:09,502
Here, take a look.

607
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
(Huaigang Interview Proposal)

608
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:14,382
A talk show?

609
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,661
Our station recently green-lit

610
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:18,741
a new talk show.

611
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:20,382
The invited guests

612
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,221
are mostly prominent youths

613
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,822
and "Man of the Hour" of the city.

614
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,942
Now, it happens that the host

615
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,342
can't make it due to an emergency.

616
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,661
They need a stand-in host.

617
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,621
I recommended you.

618
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:36,982
Thank you for thinking of me.

619
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,822
But right now, I want to focus

620
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:39,741
on my reporting work.

621
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:41,502
I think

622
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:42,982
you should pick another candidate.

623
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:45,101
Hold on.

624
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,101
It's just one episode.

625
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:50,062
Moreover, the invited guests

626
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,301
are people you know.

627
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,942
(Huo Yanzong, Jin Shichuan, Yu Shishi)
The reason I recommended you

628
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:00,022
is because

629
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:02,022
you're good at what you do,

630
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:02,741
and quick on your feet.

631
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,382
You have what it takes
to take on the job.

632
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,221
Secondly, it's because

633
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:09,701
the content and topic discussion
are very fitting.

634
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,342
It will benefit

635
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:13,942
your future work, right?

636
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:15,942
You're working

637
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,301
on a piece about rescue team, right?

638
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,862
You could combine the two,

639
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,382
and expand on the interview content.

640
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,141
I don't think there's anyone

641
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:24,942
more suitable than you.

642
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:30,261
Alright.

643
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:32,741
I'll listen to your idea

644
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:33,781
and give it a go.

645
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:35,301
Good.

646
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:37,621
I'll get back to work then.

647
00:38:59,422 --> 00:38:59,982
Huo.

648
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:03,301
Mr. Wang and Yu Shishi have arrived.

649
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:30,621
My lady.

650
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,462
You're finally here.

651
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:32,701
The boss is getting upset.

652
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:33,661
Mr. Huo arrived long ago

653
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,621
and is waiting inside.

654
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:36,862
Let him wait.

655
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,822
Such meetings are the worst.

656
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:39,982
If not for you,

657
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,101
I would never have come.

658
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:42,062
Yes, got it.

659
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:43,342
I know.

660
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,382
Eating with a bunch of greasy,

661
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:46,462
just ruins my appetite.

662
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:48,701
Mr. Huo of Yunkai looks quite young though.

663
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,701
The boss of an established enterprise?

664
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:51,701
Even if you say they're young,

665
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,261
how young can they possibly be?

666
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,062
Plus they're not handsome.
Not appetizing.

667
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:57,942
Okay, never mind.

668
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:58,462
Hurry.

669
00:39:59,822 --> 00:40:01,022
Congrats, Mr. Wang.

670
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:03,221
The drama Shishi is in is doing quite well.

671
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,741
Who's that handsome guy
seated over there?

672
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:08,621
He's Yunkai's boss,

673
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:09,542
Huo Yanzong.

674
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,181
We are so sorry.

675
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:14,022
Shishi is late

676
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:15,181
because the traffic was bad.

677
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:16,542
Shishi is here.

678
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:17,581
Come sit next to me.

679
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:28,741
Take a seat.

680
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:29,422
I'm good.

681
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,141
You must be Mr. Huo.

682
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:35,181
Hello, I am Yu Shishi.

683
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,342
Since I'm late,
I'll drink this as punishment.

684
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,062
Sorry to keep Mr. Huo waiting.

685
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:47,661
There's no need.

686
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:49,342
I don't care.

687
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:50,661
I don't drink either.

688
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:54,741
Mr. Huo, Mr. Wang, Amy.

689
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:55,502
Let's all have a drink.

690
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:55,942
Yes.

691
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:56,701
Shishi, come.

692
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:57,382
It's rare for everyone to get together.

693
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:58,022
Come.

694
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:00,062
Mr. Huo too.

695
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:56,862
Do you find

696
00:41:56,902 --> 00:41:58,261
such dinners lame too?

697
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:05,502
Why don't we escape?

698
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:07,862
Huo.

699
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:09,502
What about we escape one more time?

700
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:13,581
I don't want to be here.

701
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:15,261

00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:37,822
