1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,440
Captain Jin.

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,120
We meet again.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,960
It's you again?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,760
Do you remember me?

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,640
Yes.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,359
Do you remember everything?

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,719
The reporter of that nonsense report.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,159
It seems like Captain Jin
has a bad impression

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,799
of me.

10
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,840
How dare you still come here.

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,439
Do you know how badly
the people on the internet

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,320
are scolding Captain Jin

13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,159
because of your report?

14
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:49,126
We didn't even go find you.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,079
How dare you come here?

16
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,520
Give it to me.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,799
Regarding the news report

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,759
of Highway 307's incident,

19
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,880
I sincerely apologize

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,840
to you and all of you.

21
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,039
I'm here

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,000
to make up for my mistake.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,600
I want to write

24
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,920
a special report about firefighters.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
- No!
- No!

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,560
Let's play.

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,680
This is not your decision to make.

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,040
All of you are here?

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,640
Fall in!

30
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,560
Let me introduce you.

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,599
She is a reporter from Huaigang TV,

32
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,319
Xu Lai.

33
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,079
She's here

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
to do a special report.

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,280
From today onwards,

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
she will be following you.

37
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,280
I hope you can work with her.

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,959
Commissioner.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,799
Our workload is heavy recently.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
We don't have time and energy

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,519
to cooperate with the interview.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
This is an order
from the Emergency Response Unit.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,239
You can only execute it
and not reject it.

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,439
Yes.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,000
Continue!

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,120
All right. Let's go.

47
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,599
What is it?

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,759
Since you forgot about me,

49
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,039
let's know each other

50
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,000
once again.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,719
I am Xu Lai.

52
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,159
Don't forget me again.

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,800
You said it just now.

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,159

72
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:23,960
Commissioner Wen.

73
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,400
Thank you for supporting

74
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:25,960
my work.

75
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,720
The news report regarding the

76
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,520
Highway 307 incident

77
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,879
was unintentional.

78
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:30,879
I'm really sorry for that.

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,679
I've been in the firefighting department
for so many years.

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,999
I've seen many

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
news reports

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,919
and information online.

83
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,080
Misunderstanding
and biased content are unavoidable.

84
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,600
However, this is still my first time

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,559
seeing a reporter coming out

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,999
to clear up the issue.

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
I can see your sincerity.

88
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:50,840
I believe in you.

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
You are the only person
who believes in me now.

90
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,359
The whole brigade

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,479
hates me so much.

92
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,439
Since you know that,

93
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,439
why do you still come here?

94
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,239
I heard Captain Jin
is a difficult man to please.

95
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,960
I came here to suffer some setbacks.

96
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Taking him down

97
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,359
is my objective in coming here.

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,760
You want to take down Jin Shichuan?

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,520
You need to be prepared

100
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,840
to go through some trouble then.

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,799
I'm telling you.

102
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,088
This kid is so stubborn

103
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,239
that he is persistent in everything.

104
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,119
His team members

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,119
are also loyal to him.

106
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,960
They won't work with you easily.

107
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:31,960
Don't worry.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,119
See how I take down Jin Shichuan

109
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,239
and his team members.

110
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:36,679
Sure.

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
She wants us to work with her?

112
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,200
She must be crazy.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,600
If she dares

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
stay here tomorrow,

115
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
I won't forgive her.

116
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:46,679
Squad Leader.

117
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,032
In my opinion,

118
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,040
this female reporter

119
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,439
is too shameless.

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
We didn't go after her

121
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,799
but she came to us instead.

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,999
I think Xu Lai

123
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,160
is not easy to deal with.

124
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,879
Look at her just now.

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
I've never

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,799
seen

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,720
such an arrogant woman.

128
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,439
Didn't she apologize?

129
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,479
Yes.

130
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,840
She is even doing a special interview

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,640
for us.

132
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,040
I think

133
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,760
she is sincere.

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Besides, isn't it good

135
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,080
for our brigade

136
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:12,999
to have a woman?

137
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,040
What kind of logic is that?

138
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,280
Yes.

139
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,520
Forget about it.

140
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,919
A woman?

141
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
She's an ingrate.

142
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm telling you all.

143
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Listen well.

144
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,239
Ignore her in the future.

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,359
Why?

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,319
To teach her a lesson.

147
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:28,999
Are you all too free?

148
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,479
Captain Jin.

149
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,119
Captain Jin.

150
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,160
What do you want us to do with Xu Lai?

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:35,919
All of us will help you

152
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,879
if you give your order.

153
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

154
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,400
Give her the cold shoulder.

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,359
She will leave after a while.

156
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
See?

157
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,720
Captain Jin sees the situation clearly.

158
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,119
The girl

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,679
has to follow us.

160
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,400
The workload here is huge.

161
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,439
They are dirty and exhausting work.

162
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,999
When she can't take it,

163
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,479
she will leave on her own.

164
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,600
You are right.

165
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,040
Let's ignore her.

166
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,280
No matter how shameless she is,
she won't be able to stay here.

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,679
Spend less time caring about others.

168
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,520
Move.

169
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,200
Eyes front!

170
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,479
Right turn!

171
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
Left turn!

172
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,559
Captain Jin.

173
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,200
Hello.

174
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,479
I want to ask

175
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,400
how long a brigade takes

176
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
for a dispatch.

177
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,120
I...

178
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,400
Why are you sighing?

179
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:56,839
Ms. Xu.

180
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,559
We are obviously

181
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,280
transparent to them.

182
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,559
No one is willing to talk to us,

183
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
let alone work with us
for the interview.

184
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,719
I can't even get a portrait shot.

185
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,799
Isn't that good?

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,679
What's so good about that?

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,839
It proves that they are united

188
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,959
and have strong cohesion.

189
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,079
Jin Shichuan is good
at leading the unit.

190
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,240
They are united

191
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,040
but our special report is gone.

192
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,199
Who said that?

193
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
We must hit them where they hurt most.

194
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,559
When we take down the leader,

195
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,520
the rest will be easy.

196
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,839
Let's go.

197
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,799
Ms. Xu,

198
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,280
why don't I order delivery for us?

199
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,799
No.

200
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,719
If we want to join them,

201
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,719
we cannot have privilege.

202
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,439
There's one bun left. Eat that.

203
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,919
What will you be eating then?

204
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,679
I have an idea.

205
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,040
If I faint from hunger,

206
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,959
you need to take care of me.

207
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm sure you don't want the trouble,

208
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:19,839
right?

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,599
Captain Jin.

210
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,120
If you won't accept my interview,

211
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,520
I will follow you every day.

212
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,719
I'm sure you don't want me

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,799
to walk in front of you every day.

214
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,079
Or are you hoping
that we can share a meal

215
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,199
from the same plate every day

216
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,760
just like today?

217
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:57,480
Fire away.

218
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
When did you

219
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,160
become a firefighter?

220
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,160
2010.

221
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,679
Were there any memorable people

222
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
among the ones you rescued?

223
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:08,959
No.

224
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,319
Not even one?

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Not even one.

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
I saved too many people
and don't purposely memorize them.

227
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,559
Do you have many days off?

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,480
No.

229
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you think Captain Jin has conceded?

230
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,719
The opponent is too powerful.

231
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,719
What do you like to do

232
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,559
on your days off?

233
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,041
Squats, deadlifts and pull-ups.

234
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,599
Don't you need to
accompany your girlfriend?

235
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,199
No. I'm single.

236
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,040
What is your requirement

237
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:42,559
for your future partner?

238
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,640
No requirements.

239
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,959
No requirements?

240
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,760
Are you saying that anyone will do?

241
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,120
What kind of reporter are you?

242
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,310
Why do you feel like a showbiz reporter

243
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,000
who asks nonsense questions instead?

244
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:54,880
Why are you laughing?

245
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm laughing because
this is the sentence with the most words

246
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,640
you've said to me

247
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,240
since I came here.

248
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm happy

249
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,760
that our relationship
has a new development.

250
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,439
(Wasp situation)

251
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,079
(at 13, Gujieli.)

252
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,199
(Many residents have been stung.)

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,160
(Emergency Response Unit Brigade 1,)

254
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,640
(dispatch immediately.)

255
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,360
Zhou, get the equipment.

256
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:13,011
(Social Assistance)

257
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:21,520
Stay in the brigade

258
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,640
and contact us at any time.

259
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:23,400
Understood.

260
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,679
Zhou, quick.

261
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,160
All right.

262
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Is a wasp situation

263
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,640
the firefighter's responsibility too?

264
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,319
Do you think our job

265
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,400
is just to fight fire?

266
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
Removing wasp nests

267
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,760
is something we do
more than 100 times a year.

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,240
This doesn't include
other trivial cases yet.

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,360
Is that so?

270
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
What do they include?

271
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,559
Opening locks,

272
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,599
saving cats and dogs,

273
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,599
kids being trapped by fences,

274
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,559
fingers stuck in rings,

275
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
and drunkards stuck in pipes.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,360
There are also those who commit suicide,

277
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,559
or drown in rivers.

278
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,559
Every major or minor case.

279
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,240
As long as the people are in trouble,

280
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,679
the fire brigade will be there.

281
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,400
Let's go!

282
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,040
- Yes!
- Yes!

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
You talk so much.

284
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Thank you. That's good material.

285
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,360
Zhou, let's go.

286
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,079
How are you feeling?

287
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,679
It hurts.

288
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:14,880
Get down.

289
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,079
Does it hurt?

290
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,240
Who reported the incident?

291
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,001
It's me.

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,439
The wasp nest is over there.

293
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,160
There. The wasps are scary.

294
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,000
Look. I got stung so badly.

295
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Did the kid

296
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:31,360
get stung?

297
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,280
Yes.

298
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,799
Did you apply any medicine?

299
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,160
I removed the stinger
and applied some iodine.

300
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,839
There are rashes.

301
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,719
Dapeng.

302
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,160
Yes.

303
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,559
Take the child and the other injured

304
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,040
to the hospital.

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,520
Yes.

306
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,040
Let me carry your child

307
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,520
for you.

308
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,439
Sure. Thank you.

309
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,760
Let's go to the hospital.

310
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,240
Captain Jin.

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,719
The wasp nest is over there.

312
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,240
It's so big.

313
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,719
I see it. Let's go take a look.

314
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:57,199
Yes.

315
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,839
Hurry.

316
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,439
Cui Jianan. Set up the ladder.

317
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:08,839
Yes.

318
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:09,880
Tao.

319
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,439
Get the bag and pesticide.

320
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,719
Begin external extermination.

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,319
Yes!

322
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,079
Liu Xu.

323
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Prepare to remove the nest.

324
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,120
Understood!

325
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,599
Ms. Xu,

326
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:23,679
let's do this part here.

327
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,120
It's dangerous to approach them.

328
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,319
No. We won't get a clear shot.

329
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,679
We must get this footage

330
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,679
even if it's dangerous.

331
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,000
But...

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,679
I'll do it.

333
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,280
Ms. Xu.

334
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,520
You can't enter.

335
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,360
It's dangerous.

336
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,520
No one can enter
apart from firefighters.

337
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,520
This is my job.

338
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,319
Please support me.

339
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,880
Hey.

340
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Don't blame me if you get stung.

341
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,599
Captain Jin.

342
00:15:58,839 --> 00:15:59,679
The hospital said

343
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,799
the boy is safe

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,040
because he was sent
to the hospital in time.

345
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,079
The boy's mother

346
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,240
wanted me to thank you.

347
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,360
It's good that he's fine.

348
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,079
Ms. Xu.

349
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,319
Did you get the footage?

350
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,520
Yes.

351
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,079
Ms. Xu, there's a huge bump

352
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,599
on your head.

353
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,199
This is the consequence
of being stubborn.

354
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,160
Thank you for saving me, Captain Jin.

355
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
You seem indifferent
but you actually care.

356
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:29,079
I know.

357
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,120
Give me some space.

358
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,240
It's crammed.

(Huaigang Fire Department Branch

360
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,839

361
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,199
Shi Lei, goodbye.

362
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,400

Lu Fangqi, I'm going back.

365
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,040
It's all right.

369
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:21,599
Captain Jin.

370
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,159
Are you concerned about me?

371
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,920
Thank you, Captain Jin!

372
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,200
I think you have a lump in your brain.

373
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,319
Look how happy you are.

374
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:43,599
You know nothing.

375
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
This is a mark of love.

376
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:47,559
A mark of love?

377
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,280
He doesn't even recognize you

378
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,240
but you are still

379
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,040
hoping for your one-sided love.

380
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,440
What's wrong with that?

381
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,879
I don't mind.

382
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
I don't get it.

383
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,200
Why do you use this method

384
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,000
to approach him?

385
00:17:59,319 --> 00:17:59,879
Can't you just

386
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,559
tell him directly?

387
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,359
Pursuing a guy requires strategy,

388
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:02,799
all right?

389
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,799
Just like how news is reported.

390
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
The order is important.

391
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,879
If I start off

392
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
by showing my trump card,

393
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
he will know

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,920
everything about me.

395
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
There won't be any mystery left.

396
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,720
How can I

397
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:14,760
get him interested in me?

398
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,599
You are going through
a lot of trouble for this.

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,280
Why does it

400
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
have to be Jin Shichuan?

401
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,760
If someone else

402
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,680
rescued you back then,

403
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,680
will you still

404
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
go for that person?

405
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,159
It's different.

406
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,079
Not only did Jin Shichuan rescue me,

407
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,520
he also brought light to me.

408
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,839
I will save you now.

409
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:52,960
Come.

410
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,760
Don't be afraid!

411
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,000
Believe me!

412
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
I will protect you!

413
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,119
It's all over for you.

414
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:35,319
I think you are

415
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,040
head over heels for him.

416
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,200
You are hopeless.

417
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,079
Who told you I'm hopeless?

418
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Jin Shichuan is my hope.

419
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,559
He might be your hope

420
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,079
but you mean nothing to him.

421
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm ignoring you.

422
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
Here's another hopeless person.

423
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,280
Who is it?

424
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,839
It's none of your business.

425
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,920
Just mind your own business

426
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,839
for now.

427
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,399
As your buddy,

428
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,799
let me advise you.

429
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,680
Confess if you like someone.

430
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,799
Don't drag it out.

431
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,319
When the other person gets used

432
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,079
to your existence,

433
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,000
he will neglect your feelings

434
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
and you will end up with nothing.

435
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,559
Why do I feel like

436
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
you are speaking from experience?

437
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,200
Did a playboy like you

438
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,879
experience a one-sided love before?

439
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,480
It's not me.

440
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,799
I feel deeply about it

441
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,879
from a friend's experience.

442
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:32,720
Who is it?

443
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Who is it? Tell me.

444
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:36,639
Just eat.

445
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,480
Eat.

446
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,960
What you said was right.

447
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,359
Of course.
I was speaking from experience.

448
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,799
I told you it was a friend of mine.

449
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,839
Huo.

450
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,799
Why are you here?

451
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:48,799
I was passing by.

452
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,799
You were passing by?

453
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,599
I am busy.

454
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm leaving first.

455
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,640
You guy could stay.

456
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,280
Let me send you back, Xu Lai.

457
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,639
Sure. Where are you going?

458
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,119
I'm going...

459
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,359
Pursuing girls again, right?

460
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,720
As your friend,

461
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
let me advise you too.

462
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,240
Don't play with other people's feelings.

463
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,280
There will be karma.

464
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,720
Sure.

465
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm leaving, guys.

466
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,000
Go home early.

467
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,079
Let's go.

468
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:19,839
We're here already?

469
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,680
Are you awake?

470
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,720
How long was I asleep?

471
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,319
Why didn't you wake me up?

472
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,680
You looked tired

473
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,599
and were sleeping soundly.

474
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,200
I would feel bad waking you up.

475
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,079
I'm leaving. See you again.

476
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:32,559
Xu Lai.

477
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
Actually, I...

478
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I want to tell you...

479
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,639
It's nothing.

480
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,879
Go back and rest.

481
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm leaving.

482
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,319
Goodnight.

483
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,200
Goodnight.

484
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,599
Drive safe.

485
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,359
Sure.

486
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,200
Mark time!

487
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,119
Attention!

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,839
Left turn!

489
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,159
Right dress!

490
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,440
Eyes front!

491
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:37,839
At ease.

492
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:38,960
Dismissed.

493
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,720
- Yes!
- Yes!

494
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,280
Both of you.

495
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,960
Come here.

496
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,119
Isn't Xu Lai here

497
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,399
early in the morning usually?

498
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,799
Why isn't she here today?

499
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,920
What's wrong with her sleeping in?

500
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I think she will stop coming

501
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,480
because she can't take it anymore.

502
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,319
I don't think so.

503
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,760
She was quite brave

504
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:55,839
during the wasp nest incident.

505
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,079
Forget it.

506
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,159
You are helping the outsider again.

507
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:58,960
Traitor.

508
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,680
Let's place a bet

509
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,680
on whether she's coming or not then.

510
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,200
Sure.

511
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,159
What's the wager?

512
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
The loser will clean the trucks once
tomorrow.

513
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,359
Sure.

514
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,119
I say Xu Lai won't come.

515
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,359
Captain Jin already said that.

516
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,680
She will be very shameless
if she still comes here.

517
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,159
The sun is so bright.

518
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:29,062
(Social Assistance)

519
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,760
Good morning, everyone.

520
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
Good morning, Captain Jin.

521
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,359
Yes.

522
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,119
Captain Jin.

523
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,359
Do you miss me?

524
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:00,879
Didn't I ask you to stop following us?

525
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,399
We are ready.

526
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:04,920
Let's go.

527
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,705
(Discipline and Focus)

528
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:17,091
(Police)

529
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,982
(Fire Department)

530
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,000
Mister!

531
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,119
Save my grandfather!

532
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,680
My grandfather is stuck!

533
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,960
Save him!

534
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:37,639
Where is he?

535
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:38,480
He is over there.

536
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,200
Dapeng. Shi Lei.

537
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,559
Get the stretcher.

538
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,240
Liu Xu. Lu Fangqi.

539
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,399
Hydraulic cutter.

540
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,040
Follow me to examine the situation.

541
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:46,200
Can you bring me there?

542
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,839
Okay.

543
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,960
Let's go.

544
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
He's over here.

545
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,920
Over here.

546
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,760
Close up on the wounded.

547
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,639
Less movement.
Try to fix the angle as much as possible.

548
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,520
Help me.

549
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:07,760
Sir,

550
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,760
why are you stuck here?

551
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm trying to catch a hen.

552
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,920
You got stuck because you wanted

553
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,599
to catch a hen?

554
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,799
These hens

555
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,799
are all my treasures.

556
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,960
They are money.

557
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,040
Leave me alone.

558
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,879
Help me catch the hens first.

559
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,079
What are you trying to do?

560
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,200
We need to cut the frame

561
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,280
to save you.

562
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,159
This is too close!

563
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:37,599
Don't move your hands.

564
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm scared!

565
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:38,639
Sir.

566
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,440
Don't move your hands.

567
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,280
It's too close! I'm scared!

568
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,799
Don't be afraid, Sir!

569
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Sir, don't move your hands!

570
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,839
Don't be afraid!

571
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
You'll be fine.

572
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,119
It's dangerous!

573
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,040
Sir!

574
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,480
Sir, it's done.

575
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,399
It's done?

576
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,040
You can come out now.

577
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,520
It fell off.

578
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Are you all right?

579
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:17,280
Get him on the stretcher.

580
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,680
Fix his neck position

581
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,960
and check for external injuries.

582
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,799
Yes.

583
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,480
Slow down!

584
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,240
Stop.

585
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:25,920
I...

586
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,720
I want to get down.

587
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,680
Sir,

588
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,399
what do you want?

589
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,680
I want to catch

590
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,760
all my hens.

591
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,760
Sir,

592
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,119
your neck is injured.

593
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
Don't think about your hens.

594
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,359
You should go to the hospital.

595
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,200
They are all money.

596
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,440
Sir.

597
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:40,799
We will

598
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,839
help you catch your hens.

599
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,359
Just go to the hospital, all right?

600
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:46,159
Can you keep your promise?

601
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,319
Yes.

602
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,119
Let's go, Sir!

603
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:48,952
All right.

604
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,359
Move!

605
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:49,760
Slow down.

606
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,000
- All right.
- Move.

607
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,839
Captain Jin.

608
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,839
We...

609
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,680
Why are you spacing out?

610
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,680
Catch all the hens.

611
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,000
Move.

612
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,559
You should help catch the hens too.

613
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,359
Okay.

614
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,839
Follow me.

615
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm afraid of hens.

616
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,799
Let's go.

617
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,559
Ms. Xu,

618
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:09,680
catching hens is so trivial.

619
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,680
It's not a rescue highlight.

620
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,079
Can we skip this part?

621
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,399
No.

622
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:15,680
You need to film this part well.

623
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,559
Go.

624
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,000
What are you doing?

625
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,559
Your helmet is falling.

626
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:09,040
Captain Jin!

627
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,319
We caught all the hens.

628
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,799
Pack up!

629
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:13,920
Yes!

630
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,639
Mister.

631
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
There's one more hen.

632
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,159
It's stuck in the crevice.

633
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,000
Where is it?

634
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,639
Over there.

635
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,240
Take me to it.

636
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
It's here.

637
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,639
It's too narrow.

638
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,599
Using tools will hurt it.

639
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:38,720
Why don't I

640
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,599
give it a try? My arms are thin.

641
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,319
Are you sure you'll be fine?

642
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,159
I'll be fine with you here.

643
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,559
Got it.

644
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,440
Kid.

645
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,280
Here.

646
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,240
Hold it tightly.

647
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
You must keep an eye on it.

648
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,159
Thank you.

649
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,040
I will keep an eye on it.

650
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,159
Good boy.

651
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:18,639
Let's go.

652
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,520
- Yes!
- Yes!

653
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,399
Why are they all Captain Jin?

654
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,520
Of course.

655
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:41,559
He's the most handsome person.

656
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,799
I'm quite handsome too.

657
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,280
Give me a few shots

658
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,960
in your special report.

659
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,760
No problem.

660
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,520
It's what I should do.

661
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,159
Thank you for just now.

662
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,920
You're welcome.

663
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,599
Since you want to thank me,

664
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
just do me a favor.

665
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:04,440
Say it.

666
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,960
I think my phone broke.

667
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,079
Can I borrow your phone

668
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:07,799
to make a call?

669
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,920
I'll take this
as a gift for your appreciation.

670
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,094
I will always

671
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,559
text you to annoy you after this.

672
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,879
I won't reply to them.

673
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,680
It's all right.

674
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,599
You will reply to them one day.

675
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,559
Gosh.

676
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,159
Chasing hens the whole morning

677
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,559
makes me hungry.

678
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,920
Let's eat!

679
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,319
Let's go change and eat.

680
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:08,319
I'm starving.

681
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:22,480
Hello, Chief.

682
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,319
Sure. I'll go back immediately.

683
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,559
Let's go.

684
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:28,520
Back to the station for a meeting.

685
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:29,799
Right now?

686
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
Yes. What's wrong?

687
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:32,760
Ms. Xu.

688
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,281
Are you sure you want to
go back looking like this?

689
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,399
You are right.

690
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,720
I need to wash up.

691
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,079
It's too late
if I find a place to do that.

692
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,040
I have an idea.

693
00:32:58,879 --> 00:32:59,280
Is anyone inside?

694
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,200
No.

695
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:01,159
Ms. Xu.

696
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,799
Are you really going inside?

697
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:03,799
It's fine.

698
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,639
All of them are eating.

699
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,480
No one will come here.

700
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,240
Thankfully, I have a hygiene kit.

701
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,319
Help me keep watch

702
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
and call me if someone is coming.

703
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,280
I'll get it done soon.

704
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:31,359
Ms. Xu!

705
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,079
Ms. Xu!

706
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,480
I have a stomachache!

707
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,879
I'm going to the toilet!

708
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,400
Who is it?

709
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,320
I realize

710
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,000
catching hens is harder
than rescuing people.

711
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm covered in feathers too.

712
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,759
Seriously.

713
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,960
Look at Tao.

714
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,360
He smells like hen poop.

715
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,400
Let's take a bath.

716
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,079
Let's go.

717
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,440
I smell bad.

718
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,719
Whose bag is that?

719
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,759
Wipe my back for me later.

720
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,000
Whose bag is this?

721
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm sure

722
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Xu Lai likes Captain Jin.

723
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:30,960
Exactly.

724
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,199
Her eyes

725
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,320
never left Captain Jin when we were

726
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,880
catching hens.

727
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,880
I think I saw

728
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,239
both of them looking at each other.

729
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,679
The little sparks

730
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,599
were flying.

731
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,800
I wonder if Captain Jin

732
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,199
could stand that.

733
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,520
Xu Lai

734
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,239
is aggressive.

735
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,320
Stop talking.

736
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,199
Hurry up.

737
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,079
We might have

738
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:49,840
another mission later.

739
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,840
Sure.

740
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm telling you.

741
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,880
The way we were
catching hens was really...

742
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,520
I was thinking...

743
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,920
Isn't he the photographer
from the TV station?

744
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:13,840
Ms. Xu...

745
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,239
Yes. Why is he here?

746
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:16,719
I don't know.

747
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
I... Ms. Xu. I...

748
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,800
Well...

749
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
Put this on. It's clean.

750
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,800
Thank you.

751
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,639
Ms. Xu.

752
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,559
I had a stomachache

753
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,559
and went to the toilet.

754
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Your stomachache

755
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,159
happened right on time.

756
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:16,800
Your taste has changed

757
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,599
after going to the fire brigade.

758
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,239
However, it matches

759
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,040
your temperament.

760
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,000
Right?

761
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,920
I think so too.

762
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
This is a unique outfit.

763
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,520
You can't even buy it elsewhere.

764
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,199
It's called news

765
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,520
because it's something new.

766
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,000
A piece of breaking news

767
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,800
only lives on for seven days
in the eyes of the public.

768
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,719
Are you trying to muddle on
by giving me viral news

769
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,400
from a few weeks ago?

770
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,159
Where's the innovation?

771
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,400
Where's the highlight?

772
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,719
How dare you call yourselves reporters?

773
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,239
Seriously.

774
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,559
Among these topics,

775
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,679
only Jiang Xin's has topical highlights

776
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,440
and is relevant.

777
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,480
Her quality is basically up to standard.

778
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Learn from her.

779
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Chief.

780
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,040
I also have a topic.

781
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Are you interested?

782
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,960
Tell me about it.

783
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:05,960
Sure.

784
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:08,960
(What are you trying to do?)

785
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:10,079
(Sir!)

786
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,360
(How can we save you
if we don't cut the frame?)

787
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,759
(It's too close!)

788
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,199
(Don't move!)

789
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,159
(I'm afraid!)

790
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:20,040
The image firefighters

791
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,119
give to the public

792
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,639
has always been a real-life hero.

793
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,320
News reports

794
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,639
will focus on

795
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,440
reporting

796
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,199
their courage, fearlessness

797
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,040
and sacrificial spirit.

798
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,480
However, I think

799
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,679
the definition of a hero

800
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,360
is not determined
by the dangers they faced.

801
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,320
What you see now

802
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:38,320
is also

803
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,079
a part of their daily job.

804
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,759
Helping residents remove a wasp's nest

805
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,199
and helping a farmer catch hens.

806
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,079
No one knows about these things

807
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,079
and no one praises them.

808
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,400
However, they are still

809
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,719
doing these things repeatedly

810
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,040
for many years.

811
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,800
So, I think

812
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,320
those who are persistent in doing this

813
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,360
are the real heroes.

814
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,239
Embarrassing footage

815
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:02,447
like this

816
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,639
proves that

817
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,520
they are

818
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,719
just a group of normal young men

819
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,880
when their heroic image

820
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,920
is removed.

821
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,199
So,

822
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:10,960
I want to tell everyone

823
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,520
with these hen feathers

824
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,480
that firefighters
are also normal people.

825
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,856
They are also a group of ordinary heroes
who always stand on the frontline

826
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,599
regardless of

827
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,520
the weight of the job.

828
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Xu Lai.

829
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,400
You are just giving me

830
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,199
your topic now?

831
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
This is a fresh angle.

832
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,320
We will be using your topic this time.

833
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,520
I think

834
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,320
Chief Qin

835
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,719
thinks more and more of Xu Lai.

836
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,679
Xin was supposed
to be promoted to Chief

837
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,360
initially.

838
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,400
Do you think

839
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,119
Xu Lai will replace her?

840
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,199
Don't think you've won

841
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,040
after getting one topic approved.

842
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,079
You are still inexperienced.

843
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,520
If this topic doesn't get people talking

844
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,480
and has no traffic,

845
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,480
don't say that I did not warn you

846
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,480
as your senior.

847
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,040
Xin.

848
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:22,599
Are you afraid that my topic

849
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,279
will go well?

850
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,719
Why should I be afraid?

851
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,599
Murphy's Laws states that

852
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,520
the more you fear something,
the more likely it will happen.

853
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:31,520
Oh.

854
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,880
Do you know

855
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,279
why my topic is chosen?

856
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,550
(China Fire and Rescue Force)
It's because of my lucky shirt

857
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:39,920
that stops every villain
from causing trouble.

858
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,719
It counters people like you.

859
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,440
(Hello, Captain Jin.)

860
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
(I am Xu Lai.)

861
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
(Thank you for what happened today.)

862
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,159
(I will wash the shirt)

863
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:10,840
(and return to you.)

864
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:20,880
How is your waist?

865
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,480
I asked you to get it checked again.

866
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,960
Did you go?

867
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,520
Captain Jin.

868
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,800
If you do care about me,

869
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,119
just get me to run two laps fewer.

870
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:28,840
Asking you to run more

871
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,800
is for your own good.

872
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:31,480
You won't make mistakes

873
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,800
if you have good stamina.

874
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,719
Sure.

875
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,159
Captain Jin.

876
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,199
I think

877
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,040
you care about Ms. Xu.

878
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,400
Who said I care about her?

879
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,840
Speaking about Ms. Xu,

880
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:45,599
I think

881
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,639
she's quite capable.

882
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,960
I thought

883
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:48,960
she is just a pretty face.

884
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,719
Coming to interview us

885
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,920
is just for show.

886
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,000
I didn't expect

887
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,000
she is quite capable.

888
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,759
She has been following us

889
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,520
without any complaints.

890
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,480
Forget about it.

891
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,559
Did you forget how she treated

892
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Captain Jin?

893
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,679
I think you are
trying to become a traitor.

894
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,279
That's impossible.

895
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:07,920
My heart always belongs to

896
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,599
Brigade 1

897
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,239
and the buddies.

898
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,440
It belongs to

899
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,199
Captain Jin whom I love.

900
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,880
(Oh.)

901
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,199
(Let me tell you some good news.)

902
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,199
(During the group meeting today,)

903
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,119
(the firefighter's report is approved.)

904
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,400
(I need to thank you.)

905
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,079
(Let me)

906
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,400
(treat you to a meal next time.)

907
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,320
Captain Jin.

908
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,840
Won't you read

909
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,199
all these texts?

910
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,719
Ignore it.

911
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:39,599
They are spam texts.

912
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,279
