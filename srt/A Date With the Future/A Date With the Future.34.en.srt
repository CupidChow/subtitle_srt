00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,180
(Are you all right?)

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,640
How is it?

25
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,239
I went to the ER brigade.

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,440
Lu Fangqi isn't doing very well.

27
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:14,559
It's alright.

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,320
He trusts you more than anyone.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,480
We can figure out a way to help him.

30
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,839
I went to the unit.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,399
Everyone missed you.

32
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,760
I showed them Liu Xu's video.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,839
Everyone is getting it together.

34
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,480
But Lu Fangqi is not doing very well.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,839
But don't you worry.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,160
Zang Qiu will keep him company.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,880
I know you must be

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,160
worried about your comrades.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,119
Everyone is waiting for you.

40
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,799
I'm waiting for you too.

41
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:21,600
Starting tomorrow,

42
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,999
I'll be working at the TV station again.

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,239
I can't visit you in the daytime.

44
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,719
But don't worry.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,279
I'll come here as soon as I get off work.

46
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,279
Just be here and wait for me.

47
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,320
I have such a handsome boyfriend.

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,359

Search and rescue.

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,640
Great work.

58
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,240
Don't mention it.

64
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,399

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
I need water!

73
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,240
Quick, a mask!

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,039
There's someone upstairs.

75
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,039
Let's go.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
- Go!
- Zhang Yang!

77
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,800
Quick!

78
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Zhang Yang!

79
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,560
There's someone on the third floor!

80
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,240
Quick! Hurry up!

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,159

82
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,359
Help!

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
Help!

84
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,560
There's someone upstairs!

85
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Help!

86
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,000
There's someone left.

87
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,080
Someone's trapped!

88
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,359
Help!

89
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,760
Help!

90
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,399
Help!

91
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:28,839
Help...

92
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,399
I found them!

93
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,359
Over here!

94
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,400
Get her out of here!

95
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,599
Quick!

96
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,479
Leave this place.

97
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,479
Lu Fangqi!

98
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Lu Fangqi!

99
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,239
Wake up!

100
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,759
Lu Fangqi!

101
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Lu Fangqi!

102
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,440
Did you get them out?

103
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,959
Is any teammate hurt?

104
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Don't worry.

105
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
We got them out.

106
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,599
The team made it out.

107
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,200
How do you feel?

108
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,320
Feeling any discomfort?

109
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm alright.

110
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
What happened?

111
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,200
Why did you pass out?

112
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,719
Maybe I was too exhausted.

113
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,239
I got mild hypoxia.

114
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,959
But according to Zhang Yang,

115
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,320
you were unwell before you set out.

116
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,560
Be honest with me.

117
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,400
Was it because of the other incident?

118
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,999
Is that why you're traumatized by the fire?

119
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:48,719
I don't have any trauma.

120
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:50,719
I'm fine.

121
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,520
Captain Jin wanted me to lead the team.

122
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,719
I must head back.

123
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Lu Fangqi, what are you doing?

124
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,040
Stop right there.

125
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,800
When will you stop running away?

126
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,719
You two should talk it out.

127
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,359
I'll be waiting downstairs.

128
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,400
You're not doing well lately.

129
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,520
You're sick.

130
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,280
Your heart is ill.

131
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,959
Your superior told me

132
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,200
you've been refusing treatments.

133
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
This isn't something

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,879
you can overcome by running away.

135
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:38,999
We'll go see a doctor.

136
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,879
We can face this together.

137
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,200
Please leave me alone.

138
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,359
I want some peace.

139
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,119
How can I leave you alone?

140
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
Lu Fangqi, don't you get it?

141
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,359
What if you passed out

142
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
somewhere people couldn't find you,

143
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,520
I'd never see you again.

144
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,879
I know.

145
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,239
Liu Xu's death affected you deeply.

146
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:57,920
But you can't...

147
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,599
Stop it!

148
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,800
You don't know anything!

149
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,400
Yes.

150
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,520
I understand.

151
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,280
I know.

152
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,239
I know you are hurting.

153
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,400
But I'll always be there for you.

154
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:11,359
If you want it,

155
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,959
we can face this problem together.

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,080
Okay?

157
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,999
Let's go see a doctor. It will be okay.

158
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:17,800
Okay?

159
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,280
Lu Fangqi!

160
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,400
Staying alive is the best consolation

161
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:26,999
for the ones we lost.

162
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
After that incident,

163
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,800
I haven't been doing well.

164
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,200
I often think about Xu.

165
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,160
I even tried running away from it

166
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,959
and thought about quitting.

167
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,560
I think you are doing worse

168
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,400
than I did back then.

169
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
You've never really shown it,

170
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:39,560
but the feelings...

171
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,040
Zhang Yang.

172
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:41,999
Stop it.

173
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,239
No, I must say it.

174
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,200
We were both there when Xu died.

175
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,400
No one knows how you feel

176
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,400
better than me.

177
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,639
I believe

178
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,239
he wouldn't want to see what you've become.

179
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,239
Zhang Yang, stop it!

180
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,200
I must say it, Lu Fangqi!

181
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:53,920
Stop it!

182
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,639
Driver, stop the car.

183
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,560
Lu Fangqi!

184
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,632
(Put Safety First
Give Others Courtesy)

185
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,680
Lu Fangqi!

186
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,920
Lu Fangqi!

187
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,320
Stay there! Watch out for cars!

188
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
(I know it's hard to let it go.)

189
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,800
(I know)

190
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
(I might never surpass him.)

191
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,719
(But one thing separates him from me.)

192
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,119

more heartbreaking)

That's why I agreed.

259

What brings you here now?

260
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,119
A sudden change of mind.

261
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,199
I bet you planned this.

262
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,560
How sweet!

263
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,320
Yeah!

264
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,240
Huo Yanzong did it on purpose.

265
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,800
He pretended to be close to me

266
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,320
in front of all those reporters.

267
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,359
What got into him?

268
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,080
Keep your voice down.

269
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
Maybe he wasn't pretending

270
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,119
but showing his feelings for you.

271
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,480
You know very well how good

272
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:27,480
of an actor he is.

273
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,240
I am never trusting him again.

274
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,839
If he is really putting up an act,

275
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,199
the reception of his acting is pretty good.

276
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,439

282
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,399

today is the fifth anniversary of your debut.

292

293
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,599
Peers in showbiz are invited.

What peers do you mean?

296
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,960
When my reputation was smeared,

297
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,199
I didn't see any of those peers supporting me.

298
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:17,919
I don't want any dealings with them.

299
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,760
This party is for you.

300
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,679
You have to go.

301
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Should we invite Mr. Huo as well?

302
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,720
What for?

303
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
He is still a major client.

304
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,560
Maintaining a good relationship

305
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,520
will benefit you.

306
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,119
He's a busy man.

307
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,839
I doubt he'd have time for that.

308
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,919
He will make time if you invite him.

309
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,599
Consider doing me a favor, okay?

310
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Please?

311
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:49,839
Please?

312
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,159
Fine, I'll ask him.

313
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,760
But, I'm doing this for you.

314
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
I don't want to see him at all!

315
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,879
Are you and Yu Shishi

316
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,760
getting back together?

317
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,240
We were never enemies.

318
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,679
Was that stunt on stage intentional?

319
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,439
What do you mean?

320
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,839
Give me a break.

321
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,560
You can fool everyone, but you can't fool me.

322
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,280
You've never attended these events

323
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:37,080
over the years.

324
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,240
But you decided to go there yourself.

325
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,800
Are you trying to boost Yu Shishi's popularity?

326
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,879
I owed her too much.

327
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,439
I only want to make amends.

328
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,359
Make amends?

329
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,240
Is that all?

330
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,320
What else could it be?

331
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,199
Are you still thinking about Xu Lai?

332
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,639
But Xu Lai has gone through a lot lately.

333
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,439
Jin Shichuan is still unconscious.

334
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
I visited Xu Lai not long ago.

335
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,320
She looked very strained.

336
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,359
She must be heartbroken.

337
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,960
If you're worried,

338
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,399
you should pay her a visit.

352

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,040
Shishi,

380
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,960
you're the star of the show tonight.

381
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,199
Don't put on a long face.

382
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,359
You should be happy.

383
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,560
I told you I didn't want to be here.

384
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,919
You forced me to come here.

385
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,000
Shishi, happy fifth anniversary.

386
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Time to blow out the candles.

387
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,320
Come on, Shishi.

388
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,879
Come on.

389
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:10,679
It's not my birthday.

390
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,919
This is over the top.

391
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,879
An anniversary must be ceremonial.

392
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,879
Go on, make a wish.

393
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,040
Coming!

394
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:19,679
Come on.

395
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,280
We're coming.

396
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:20,919
Coming.

397
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,879
Over here.

398
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,800
(Happy Fifth Anniversary of Yu Shishi's Debut)
Everyone is waiting.

399
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,599
Quick.

400
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,560
Make a wish.

401
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:35,800
What did you wish for?

402
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,359
Could you tell us about it?

403
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,080
Tell us.

404
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
First, to stay beautiful forever.

405
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,560
Secondly, to become rich.

406
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,439
Not bad!

407
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,199
That's a nice one.

408
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,639
Is there a third wish?

409
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
The third wish...

410
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,439
It already came true.

411
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,839
Let's drink up!

412
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:00,240
Come on!

413
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Drink heartily!

414
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,439
We finally got together.

415
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,399
Come on.

416
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:04,639
Raise your glass!

417
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,399
Why are you here?

418
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,599
I didn't invite you.

419
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,119
But you want me to come here.

420
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,159
No way!

421
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,439
Sorry.

422
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,720
I was late.

423
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,000
Based on the initial psychological evaluation,

424
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,159
he is suffering from

425
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,520
post-traumatic stress disorder,

426
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,520
also known as PTSD.

427
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,240
He suffered intense mental stimulation

428
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,879
in an accident in the past.

429
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,320
From there on,

430
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,240
certain people or matters in life

431
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,800
could trigger his aggression.

432
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:16,359
Therefore,

433
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
I advise the patient

434
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,240
to get psychological treatment

435
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
as soon as possible.

436
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,399
Don't be afraid.

437
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm here with you.

438
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,240
Okay.

439
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,159
Relax.

440
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,439
Breathe slowly.

441
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,760
Listen to my voice.

442
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,000
Clear your mind.

443
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,679
Let it stay cleared.

444
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,520
Alright.

445
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,399
What happened that day?

446
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,599
Could you tell me?

447
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,560
Liu Xu!

448
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,199
Help!

449
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:38,679
Professor Yu.

450
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:39,599
How is it?

451
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,760
He wasn't doing well.

452
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,359
I played some light music for him.

453
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,040
I think he will wake up after five minutes.

454
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,399
However, judging by the current situation,

455
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,240
it's hard for me to conduct

456
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,280
psychological intervention

457
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
as long as he keeps resisting it.

458
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,280
Is there another solution?

459
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,040
Maybe I can do
the psychological intervention

460
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,280
when he is relaxed.

461
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
That could be viable.

462
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,560
Right now,

463
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,839
he trusts you the most.

464
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
He will open up to you.

465
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,919
You could try conducting

466
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,720
some supportive psychotherapy.

467
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,080
Supportive psychotherapy?

468
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,520
Yes.

469
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,919
Keep him company more often.

470
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,720
Observe his emotions closely.

471
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,919
Give him encouragement.

472
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,080
If you could lift his mental burden,

473
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:26,000
it will help with his condition greatly.

474
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,320
I want to recover from this sickness.

475
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,960
But I can't control myself

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,240
when I think about that day.

477
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:54,879
Be patient.

478
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:55,839
Take it slowly.

479
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,720
Psychotherapy has always been difficult.

480
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,399
You need time to get used to it.

481
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,919
I don't want to come here again.

482
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,720
I don't want to recall that day.

483
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,399
Am I a worthless fool?

484
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,520
Not at all.

485
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,240
Alright.

486
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,000
It's alright.

487
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,919
I'm here for you.

488
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,879
I'll be with you.

489
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,879
Stop blaming yourself, okay?

490
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,040
It's going to be alright.

491
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:29,879
Come.

492
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:32,599
Look at me.

493
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:34,760
Look at me.

494
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,399
You know what?

495
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,240
Everyone has a past they can't let go.

496
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,320
Everyone feels vulnerable sometimes.

497
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,240
Just as I was.

498
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,399
I couldn't move on.

499
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,199
But thankfully, you were there.

500
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
You were always there for me

501
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,240
and healed me.

502
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,599
Now that you are ill,

503
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,480
let me take care of you.

504
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,639
Together, we'll overcome this.

505
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,919
Everything will get better.

506
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,159
Okay?

507
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,199
Forward.

508
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,000
Turn left.

509
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,159
Turn left.

510
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,240
Forward.

511
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,119
Okay.

512
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,520
Open your eyes.

513
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,159
You always cooked for me.

514
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:27,960
Could you teach me a recipe

515
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
so I can cook for you for once?

516
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,080
What's on your mind?

517
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:52,520
Well?

518
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,400
Delicious.

519
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,239
Do you want one?

520
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,440
It's been a while

521
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,599
since you last had a good appetite.

522
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,319
Of course.

523
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,480
This is my girlfriend's cooking.

524
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,239
Of course I love it.

525
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,080
And you were with me.

526
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,319
I didn't feel as stressed.

527
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,199
But honestly,

528
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,360
I first saw you on that blind date.

529
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,199
I didn't think

530
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
I'd become your girlfriend.

531
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,319
I'm just as surprised.

532
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,199
Do you remember

533
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,759
you even saved someone's life?

534
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,279
The way you saved the person

535
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,599
really scared me.

536
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,360
Are you willing to let me save yours

537
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,000
with my method?

538
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,319
That patient had shock asphyxia.

539
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,239
Right now, you are being drowned

540
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,719
by all of these negative emotions.

541
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,880
I want to get you out of it.

542
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,520
I get it.

543
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,360
You want me to stop running

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,080
and get the doctor's treatment.

545
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,239
You put a candle here

546
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,119
because you want me to know

547
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,239
that many things

548
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,639
are not as scary as I imagined.

549
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,040
Whenever I see fire,

550
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,480
I recall...

551
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,159
A lot of bad memories.

552
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,199
But you are here tonight.

553
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,440
I only think

554
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,159
about the happy moments
we've had together.

555
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,239
That's good to know.

556
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,159
It means

557
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,560
our treatment tonight

558
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,480
is very effective.

559
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:15,880
I promise you

560
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,119
I'll get interventional therapy tomorrow.

561
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,679
But only if you go there with me.

562
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,119
You're the only one

563
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,440
who can heal me.

564
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,440
Don't worry.

565
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
I'll always be there for you.

566
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,480
Mrs. Zhang had a relative

567
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,440
who was in the same condition as Jin.

568
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,080
A retired doctor prescribed him a folk remedy.

569
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,119
With daily external application,

570
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,520
he woke up after six months.

571
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,560
Should we let Jin try it?

572
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,960
Mom.

573
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,679
Folk remedies don't work.

574
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Don't worry about it.

575
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:56,639
Okay.

576
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,440
But what if it works?

577
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,679
We can't keep waiting and do nothing.

578
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,799
You've been going to the hospital

579
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,400
every day for a long time.

580
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,599
That can't go on forever.

581
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,639
You've lost so much weight.

582
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,840
Your dad and I are worried.

583
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes.

584
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,360
Look at you.

585
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,279
We finally got the chance to visit our daughter,

586
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,159
but you wouldn't stop ranting.

587
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,279
Could you please
let her finish her food?

588
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,040
Okay?

589
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,960
I feel bad for her.

590
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,759
After all this time,

591
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,400
he hasn't gotten any better.

592
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,080
What if he never wakes up?

593
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,119
Listen to yourself!

594
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,239
What is that supposed to mean?

595
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,000
Could you please stop it?

596
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,159
Mom and Dad, I'm full.

597
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,159
I'll be at the hospital.

598
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,159
Carry on.

599
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,679
You barely ate anything.

600
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:54,920
See?

601
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,400
She's in so much pain.

602
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:11,808
(Inpatient Department)

603
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,400
Dr. Zang.

604
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,199
It's late.

605
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,319
Are you visiting Jin Shichuan?

606
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,199
It puts my mind to ease.

607
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,360
By the way, I didn't get to ask.

608
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,520
How is Lu Fangqi?

609
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
He's suffering from PTSD

610
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,400
because of the accident.

611
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,319
I've been with him

612
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,520
as he receives his therapy.

613
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,880
He's finally getting better.

614
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,159
Don't worry.

615
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,319
He will get well.

616
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:37,920
See?

617
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,759
At least you get to see him get well.

618
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,520
At least you see hope.

619
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,159
I don't.

620
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,119
Don't worry.

621
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:53,480
He might be awake

622
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,360
tomorrow morning.

623
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,080
Right?

624
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,119
I hope so.

625
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,679
It's been a while since we grabbed a drink.

626
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:07,679
After Jin Shichuan wakes up,

627
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,119
we should celebrate it with a drink.

628
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,920
Sure.

629
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,159
Go on.

630
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:20,920
Grandpa.

631
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,040
Hi.

632
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,440
You may go home now.

633
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,639
It's been a long day.

634
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,799
I can take it from here.

635
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,000
You're the one who needs rest.

636
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,480
Look at you.

637
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,040
You've lost so much weight.

638
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,920
It'd pain Shichuan

639
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,920
to see you like this.

640
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,960
I'm alright. Don't worry.

641
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,560
Xu Lai.

642
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,440
Heed my advice.

643
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,560
Stop waiting.

644
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,679
We have no idea

645
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,319
when he will ever wake up.

646
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,440
If this goes on,

647
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,279
it'll take up too much of your time.

648
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:12,199
I will never give up.

649
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,440
I will keep waiting

650
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,880
until he wakes up.

651
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,799
I believe he will wake up someday.

652
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,599
How lucky of you, young man.

653
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,880
I'll be going now.

654
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,119
Stay safe on the way.

655
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,599
Jin Shichuan.

656
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,719
Please wake up.

657
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm not as strong as you think.

658
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,400
I live in fear every day.

659
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,599
I fear you might never wake up.

660
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,920
Please open your eyes.

661
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,400
I really need you.

662
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,880
I can't take this anymore.

663
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:32,639
Please wake up.
