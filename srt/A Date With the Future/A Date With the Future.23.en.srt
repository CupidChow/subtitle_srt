(I'll Get You Back If You Run Again)

22
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,044
Captain Jin.

23
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,124
Look, Lu Fangqi came up with this terrible idea.

24
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,365
Yet he didn't show up here.

25
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,445
You're saying the idea is terrible?

26
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:02,365
Why?

27
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:03,445
Terrible ideas are ideas too.

28
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:04,805
Do you prefer to do
a weight-bearing run for 10 km?

29
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:05,964
Captain Jin.

30
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:07,244
What do we do now?

31
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:16,285
Run.

32
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:17,165
Get back to the station.

33
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,685
Captain...Captain Jin.

34
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:20,725
For 10 km?

35
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,324
Right face!

36
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,125
Move.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,570
(To University City)

38
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,484
(Xu Lai.)

39
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:58,524
(I'm sorry.)

40
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:00,324
(Because of my selfish reasons,)

41
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,005
(I used the wrong way and hurt you.)

42
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:03,604
(I'm truly sorry.)

43
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,644
(I beg for your forgiveness.)

44
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,565
I envy you, Peace.

45
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,644
You're well-fed,

46
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:19,044
sleep well,

47
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,324
and have someone taking care of you,

48
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:24,845
living a carefree life,

49
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:27,204
unlike me.

50
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,445
Concerning Xu Lai's personality,

51
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,685
what do you think I should do
to get her forgiveness?

52
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:42,125
Forget it.

53
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,924
You're kind enough to accompany me here.

54
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:47,885
You're my angel.

55
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:54,524
Angel?

56
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,565
It's all sorted out.

57
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:05,324
Ms. Xu.

58
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,764
This workload would take
a quarter to accomplish.

59
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,324
I have a lot of time, anyway.

60
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,405
What's this about?

61
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:13,764
The weekly report.

62
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:15,885
I'll handle this for you.

63
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,045
Ms. Xu, what's wrong with you?

64
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,005
Why are you so eager to help out?

65
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,524
Wouldn't the work affect the date
with your boyfriend?

66
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:26,204
Boyfriend?

67
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,685
Career is more reliable.

68
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:29,644
It doesn't lie.

69
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:37,045
Peace.

70
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,404
Cute doggy.

71
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,045
Cute doggy.

72
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:44,524
Peace.

73
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:48,605
He has a letter in his mouth.

74
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:50,084
Peace.

75
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:50,925
There's a letter here.

76
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,045
So adorable.

77
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,445
Sit.

78
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,164
Good.

79
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,524
(Respectful leader and my family,)

80
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:02,685
(comrade Xu Lai,)

81
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,284
(due to my subjective consideration,)

82
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,045
(I've made many serious mistakes)

83
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:08,844
(and failed to put them right in time.)

84
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,445
(Now I deeply realize my problems)

85
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:13,925
(and I've made reflections as follows.)

86
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:14,764
(Firstly,)

87
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,125
(I shouldn't have concealed
my sickness from you.)

88
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,245
(I've underestimated your determination)

89
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,764
(to share hardships and face the future
together with me.)

90
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:22,125
(Secondly,)

91
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,284
(I shouldn't have concealed the truth)

92
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,644
(about Huo Yanzong and Yu Shishi.)

93
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,164
(I've failed your trust.)

94
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:28,964
(Thirdly,)

95
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:30,805
(I shouldn't have pushed you away,)

96
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:32,764
(which has stepped across the line)

97
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,844
(and brought harm to our relationship.)

98
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,125
(I assure you)

99
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:38,365
(that I'll never ever keep anything
from you,)

100
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:39,204
(lie to you,)

101
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:40,284
(hurt you,)

102
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,605
(and give you to another man.)

103
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:45,805
(I'll protect you lifelong.)

104
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,284
(I've reflected on myself)

105
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:48,805
(and repented my mistakes.)

106
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,005
(I hope)

107
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:52,365
(you can give me a chance
to start anew.)

108
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,005
(I'm sorry)
(Written by Jin Shichuan.)

109
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,764
(If you're willing to forgive me,)

110
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:57,644
(please come downstairs.)

111
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:58,844
(I'm waiting downstairs.)

112
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:00,764
(I want to apologize to you personally.)

113
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:02,524
Peace.

114
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,125
Good boy.

115
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,524
Let me read the letter.

116
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:08,764
No.

117
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,005
(It's fine if you want to apologize.)

118
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,204
(But why did you copy my idea?)

119
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,964
(Not only that,)

120
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,084
(you even summoned my dog.)

121
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:36,764
(Bring Peace back)

122
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:37,685
(immediately)

123
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,885
(and feed him good food.)

124
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,685
(Don't trouble Peace again.)

125
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,685
(And don't bother me)

126
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,445
(with this kind of thing again.)

127
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,284
(Yes, Madam.)

128
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,125
Peace.

129
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:53,404
Good boy.

130
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,605
Peace.

131
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:03,125
Fine.

132
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,524
It's been days.

133
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,125
I wonder how Captain Jin
deals with that?

134
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:06,925
Captain Jin is there.

135
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,524
Captain Jin.

136
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:11,204
- Captain Jin.
- Captain Jin.

137
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,125
Have you met with Xu Lai?

138
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:15,724
Fine.

139
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:17,605
Again, it's a wasted effort.

140
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:19,125
But I did make some progress.

141
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:20,365
What's it?

142
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,605
She added me back on WeChat.

143
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:23,964
That's good.

144
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,844
That's considered a small success.

145
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:26,404
Right?

146
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:26,964
Right.

147
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,204
I have a long way to go.

148
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,524
I still need to keep this up.

149
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,245
Well done, Peace.

150
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,005
Peace.

151
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:33,605
You're an angel.

152
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:33,964
Angel.

153
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,125
Let me read the letter.

154
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:36,045
Don't touch him.

155
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,245
He's my angel.

156
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,365
- No, Xu Lai is your angel.
- No, Xu Lai is your angel.

157
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:41,724
Great job, Peace.

158
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:46,805
Squad leader.

159
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,150
(Instructor: Zang Qiu)
(Training: CPR)

160
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:06,324
Isn't it just a pamphlet

161
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,605
about first-aid training?

162
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,485
What's with that goofy smile?

163
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:15,764
This isn't an ordinary pamphlet.

164
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:23,204
Instructor.

165
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:24,805
Zang...

166
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,485
Is that doctor coming here tomorrow?

167
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,284
Oh, right.

168
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,205
I must iron my uniform.

169
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:38,164
I'm meeting her tomorrow.

170
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:49,885
Captain Jin is experiencing
romantic frustration.

171
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,085
But you seem otherwise.

172
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,310
(Loyal and Discipline)

173
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,485
Look at him.

174
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,044
What's wrong with him today?

175
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:16,164
He seems so happy.

176
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:17,284
Of course, he does.

177
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:19,764
He's meeting the woman of his dream soon.

178
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:24,444
The two of you,

179
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,605
don't speak nonsense before Zang Qiu.

180
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,205
Don't scare her away.

181
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:29,644
Look how nervous you are.

182
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:30,644
Show some backbone, please.

183
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:38,804
So obsessed.

184
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,684
He's done.

185
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:40,444
Hopeless.

186
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,605
You're here, Zang Qiu.

187
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,684
I'm your instructor now.

188
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:47,644
Call me Dr. Zang.

189
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:48,965
Dr. Zang.

190
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,044
I prepared the buns for you this morning.

191
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:52,764
Have some.

192
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,764
No, I've eaten already.

193
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:55,924
Just eat some.

194
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,085
I haven't eaten anything yet.

195
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:02,444
Nice.

196
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,444
Let's go in.

197
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:06,605
Sure.

198
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:12,325
As firefighters,

199
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,325
you're usually the first ones
to arrive at the scene.

200
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:15,924
When you have to deal
with critical patients

201
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,325
before the ambulance comes,

202
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,325
you should acquire more first-aid knowledge

203
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,164
to earn more chances of survival for them.

204
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,125
The most commonly used techniques

205
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,205
are cardiopulmonary resuscitation
and artificial respiration.

206
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:27,965
I guess you're familiar with them.

207
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,845
They are the most common techniques
of intermediate assistance

208
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,205
and you must master them.

209
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,125
Now, I'll demonstrate it to you.

210
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:37,605
First off,

211
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,845
open the airway by lifting the head

212
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:40,764
and lowering the jaw.

213
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,605
Check the pulse.

214
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,764
No pulse, nor breathing.

215
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:47,965
Start chest compressions.

216
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,164
Thirty times.

217
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,365
Next is artificial respiration.

218
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:58,845
When you're doing this,

219
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,485
exhale for at least one second

220
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:02,564
to ensure ample air enters the chest.

221
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,325
Now, let's have practical training.

222
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,524
Does anyone want to play as the victim?

223
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,085
Me.

224
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:26,444
Come forward.

225
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,085
Zang Qiu.

226
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:08,284
Wait.

227
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,684
I'll go get the car.

228
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,044
Why are you icing me out all of a sudden?

229
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,924
Didn't we kiss before?

230
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,924
You kissed Liu Xu just now.

231
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,085
Why didn't you go to him instead?

232
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:25,245
It's different.

233
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:26,005
I don't like him.

234
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:26,725
I like you.

235
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:27,725
Lu Fangqi.

236
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,444
You always say that you like me.

237
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:32,524
Do you really know me?

238
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,605
We just barely met and you keep confessing.

239
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,164
Besides, have you ever thought

240
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,764
that the one you like

241
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,325
might not be the real me?

242
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:44,564
How do you know I won't like the real you?

243
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,325
You jump to conclusions
before I learn more about you.

244
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:53,524
Do you really want to know about me?

245
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,044
Qiu, you're here.

246
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,005
What would you like for today?

247
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,444
As usual. A set of B52.

248
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:13,524
Give him a glass of orange juice.

249
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:14,644
Okay, just a moment.

250
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,325
Are you familiar with them?

251
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,284
Do you come here often?

252
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,764
I'm not as naive as you imagine.

253
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,085
I'm dangerous.

254
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,845
I don't like naive women.

255
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,644
I like dangerous ones.

256
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:34,404
Qiu, here's your shots.

257
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:35,005
Thank you.

258
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:37,325
They are on fire.

259
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:38,284
Don't drink it.

260
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:39,764
Are you scared?

261
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:41,444
I...

262
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,044
I'm not.

263
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:44,725
I deal with fire every day.
Why would I scare of it?

264
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:46,684
Listen.

265
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:47,965
Fire is nothing to be afraid of.

266
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,804
But alcohol can be dangerous.

267
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,924
Women who drink alcohol
are even more dangerous.

268
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,885
Hey, let me buy you a shot.

269
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:24,845
What are you doing?

270
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,164
I'm protecting you.

271
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:29,644
Those who invite you for drinks
have bad intentions.

272
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:30,764
They're up to no good.

273
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,325
Instead, you're up to no good.

274
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,005
I didn't ask you to protect me.

275
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,564
I offer to protect you.

00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:37,644
Self-employed.

277
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:40,764
Pretty.

278
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:41,564
What's wrong with you?

279
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:42,845
You like to lean on someone's shoulder.

280
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,044
Lean on mine.

281
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:46,564
What's your deal?

282
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,764
You look cute when you get jealous.

283
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,005

Are you feeling shy after kissing me?

300
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,485
I didn't kiss you.

301
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,005
I was

302
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,005
paying the protection fee.

303
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,005
Protection fee?

304
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:34,644
That will do too.

305
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,205
I'll be on duty more often

306
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,804
and be your love bodyguard for good.

307
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:42,885
That's tacky.

308
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,365
Love bodyguard?

309
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:45,804
As expected.

310

A cub is a cub.

311
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:48,245
You take things too seriously.

312
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,485
Why can't we take this seriously
when we've kissed?

313
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:00,005
I just thought that you were cute.

314
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:01,924
I kissed you like a kitty or a puppy.

315
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:02,924
It meant nothing.

316
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:04,724

317
00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:05,805
I'm not interested in cubs

318
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,285
and immature men.

319
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:08,444
So the two of us

320
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:10,605

who texted you

Well,

333
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:51,845
you put in so much effort

334
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,845
to learn about women but to no avail.

335
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:55,484
I feel tired for you.

and remember the pain

372
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:08,404
so that he won't repeat it next time.

Aren't you afraid he can't put up with this

375
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,045
and breaks up with you?

376
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,125
Of course, I'm.

377
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:18,885
But if he can't even

378
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,085
handle such minor tests,

379
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,644
it proves that I'm not important to him.

380
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:25,404
In that case,

381
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,244
I'll let go of this relationship.

382
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:28,684
Losing it is nothing...

383
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,404
It's a pity.

384
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:35,164
You haven't watched till the end.

385
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,404
Jin Shichuan is destined to fall in your hands.

386
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,244
He simply deserves the frustration

387
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,244
after lying to you.

388
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:48,605
He's so cute.

389
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,684
Huo hasn't been doing well lately.

390
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,684
Do you really want to ignore him?

391
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:04,605
We need some time

392
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,125
to cool down things between us.

393
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:08,605
Keeping our distance from each other
is the best option for now.

394
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:11,365
True.

395
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:13,444
It's better to keep some distance
from each other.

396
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:17,004
I'm off.

397
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,120
(Yunkai Group, Center of Huaigang)

398
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:51,484
It's Mr. Huo.

399
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,004
Mr. Huo is here.

400
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:52,605
Thank you so much.

401
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:53,765
- Mr. Huo.
- Congratulations.

402
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:54,525
Mr. Huo.

403
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:54,765
Mr. Han.

404
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:55,285
Welcome.

405
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:55,724
Congratulations.

406
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:56,525
Many eyes are on you.

407
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,045
So get a grip.

408
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:01,885
Yu Shishi's here.

409
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:02,684
Yu Shishi's here.

410
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,325
I didn't inform her.
What's she doing here?

411
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:22,885
No idea.

412
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:27,004
Dear.

413
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:28,285
Do you miss me?

414
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:35,085
Distinguished guests and media,

415
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:38,085
to celebrate the launch of Yunkai's
new property today,

416
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,924
we invited a famous French pastry chef

417
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,285
to prepare desserts for you.

418
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:44,684
Please come and have a taste.

419
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:46,765
Come with me.

420
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,325
Can you be gentle?

421
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,404
You're hurting me.

422
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:55,765
Yu Shishi.

423
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:56,924
What are you up to?

424
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:57,885
Why are you here?

425
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:00,525
As the mistress of Yunkai

426
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:01,605
and spokesperson,

427
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,964
is there any problem
for me to attend such occasions?

428
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:04,964
Mistress?

429
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:05,964
Did you lose your memory?

430
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:07,924
We're over.

431
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,125
And you brought this up first.

432
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:10,805
Did I?

433
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,605
I've regretted it.

434
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,724
Just words.

435
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:14,684
You have no proof.

436
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,204
I said we were over.

437
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:20,525
I don't have the mood

438
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,164
to continue this showmanship with you.

439
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:21,605
Understood?

440
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,684
Why should I listen to you...

441
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:26,204
What do you want?

442
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:32,045
I want you to continue
being my boyfriend

443
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:33,525
like what we did before.

444
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:35,244
I summon you however I want.

445
00:23:35,404 --> 00:23:36,805
And you must fulfill

446
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:38,325
whatever I say.

447
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:42,045
If you don't cooperate with me,

448
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,924
I'm going to have a good chat

449
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:46,244
with the reporters about our fake relationship.

450
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:48,805
If they were to know about those foolish things

451
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,164
you did for Xu Lai,

452
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,244
would they be curious about Xu Lai?

453
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:54,325
Are you threatening me?

454
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,765
Yes, I am.

455
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,885
Because I realized that I couldn't be polite

456
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,004
to heartless men like you.

457
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:02,684
Now I'm not begging you
to cooperate with me,

458
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:05,484
but you need me to keep the secret for you.

459
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:09,845
If you don't cooperate with me later,

460
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:12,444
I might tell those reporters something.

461
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:22,805
Yunkai Group spent five years

462
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:24,244
to accomplish this project.

463
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,244
The world-renowned designers...

464
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:29,004
Please.

465
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:32,805
Hello, I'm Yu Shishi.

466
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:33,805
Hello.

467
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:35,004
Shishi.

468
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,244
Take a photo of them.

469
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:50,565
They're so lovely.

470
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:51,004
Exactly.

471
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:51,765
Wear it for me.

472
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:53,085
Do it yourself.

473
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,805
Are you sure?

474
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:00,204
In fact, I want to tell you that we...

475
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:04,444
Snap it.

476
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:05,285
Shishi.

477
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,565
Could you please share with us

478
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,244
the romance between you and Mr. Huo?

479
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,845
When I first met him,

480
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:17,684
I found that he was arrogant and boring.

481
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:20,004
After spending some time with him,

482
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:23,085
I realized that he would be sad, upset,

483
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,325
and even get drunk.

484
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,805
And he asked me to look after him.

485
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,724
Afterward,

486
00:25:30,285 --> 00:25:34,565
I think he's honest and genuine.

487
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,885
And that makes me worry more about him

488
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,085
and want to give him the warmth.

489
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,325
If you're tired,

490
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,285
you can lean on my shoulders,

491
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:50,765
even though they're not broad.

492
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:54,724
What a lovely couple.

493
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:58,285
That's enough.

494
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:07,244
Great.

495
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:18,404
That was a good show.

496
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,605
I'll spare you today.

497
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:20,365
I'm off.

498
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:21,404
Wait.

499
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,004
Is there anything you want, Mr. Huo?

500
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:29,325
Did you really mean that
for what you said earlier?

501
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,724
I've been serious from the get-go.

502
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,204
I like you.

503
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:40,605
This is not a joke.

504
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,085
I rather hope it.

505
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:46,964
Yu Shishi.

506
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:49,484
I have no feelings for you.

507
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:52,684
You'll only get hurt if you come near me.

508
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:54,724
Give up.

509
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:56,924
Does Xu Lai have feelings for you?

510
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:58,444
Why don't you give up on her?

511
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:03,125
Huo Yanzong.

512
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:04,365
Listen up.

513
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:07,684
I like you, but that's my business, not yours.

514
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:10,285
When you plan to give up on Xu Lai,

515
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,125
I'll consider giving up on you.

516
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:13,845
Before that,

517
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,924
endure it even though you don't like it.

518
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:17,484
Because you messed with me first.

519
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:21,964
You made use of me before.

520
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,085
This is what you owe me.

521
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:03,125
Captain Jin.

522
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,365
Don't tell me Xu Lai
hasn't made up with you...

523
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:07,484
Just eat your food.

524
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,365
In my opinion,

525
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:16,924
instead of sitting idly here,

526
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,525
why don't you talk to her face-to-face,

527
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,004
tell her what you think,

528
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:22,565
and show your sincerity?

529
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:32,484
Makes sense.

530
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:34,964
Right?

531
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:36,724
Right?

532
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,045
Captain Jin approves of me.

533
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:40,204
Did you hear that?

534
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:41,845
Not bad.

535
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:43,244
Very well done.

536
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:45,484
What are you laughing about?

537
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:05,765
(Are you busy?)

538
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:08,164
(After you finish work later,)

539
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:09,244
(let's meet at the restaurant)

540
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:10,125
(where we first met.)

541
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,365
(I have something
to tell you face-to-face.)

542
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:16,805
(What will it be?)

543
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:19,484
(What surprise is he
going to do this time?)

544
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,605
(We interrupt with breaking news.)

545
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:52,325
(An unfinished building
in the southern part of the city)

546
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,525
(that houses scavengers and workers)

547
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,404
(is caught in a fire)

548
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:57,045
(due to the improper use of the gas stove.)

549
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,885
(Two fire stations are dispatched)

550
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,164
(and the fire is under control now.)

551
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:01,924
(The number of injured
is currently unknown.)

552
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:02,765
(We'll continue)

553
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,684
(to update you on the news.)

554
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,045
(Sorry, the number you dial)

555
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:20,684
(is not available at the moment.)

556
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:25,605
Please make a u-turn.

557
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:37,724
I heard that some firefighters

558
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:38,365
were injured.

559
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,404
The cause of the fire

560
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:41,885
is the improper use of the gas stove.

561
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:43,204
The fire has been put down.

562
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:45,805
Our team members are tying the loose ends.

563
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:49,004
Watch out.

564
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:52,765
Jin Shichuan.

565
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,045
Jin Shichuan.

566
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:55,085
Yes?

567
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:55,964
Excuse me.

568
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:58,164
May I know if the First Brigade is here?

569
00:30:58,404 --> 00:30:58,765
Yes.

570
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,125
They came here with us.

571
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:01,684
I think they haven't left yet.

572
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,484
Did you see their captain?

573
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:05,444
I'm not sure.

574
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,365
But someone got injured

575
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,404
and just left in an ambulance.

576
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:17,964
Jin Shichuan!

577
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:30,204
Jin Shichuan!

578
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:26,204
I'm tired.

Otherwise, Captain Jin is going

598
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:17,245
to torture us more.

599
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,044
Captain Jin finally got her.

600
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:24,285
I must say

601
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:26,964
that Captain Jin reminds me
of my demeanor in the past.

602
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:29,524
What are you talking about?

603
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,524
I think this is written in this star.

604
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,845
Captain Jin is given a chance

605
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:35,885

Are you still mad at Captain Jin?

00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,044
Have you forgiven him?

611
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:52,365
I'm not mad at you.

612
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,444
Will you still run away from me?

613
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:58,444
I didn't mean to run away.

614
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:00,685
Even if you do,

615
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:03,484

621
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:37,964
Why?

622
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:40,165
You have that doctor, don't you?

623
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:42,524
But our situations are different.

624
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,205
Their love is mutual,

625
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:45,885
but there's only one-sided love

626
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:47,325
between Zang Qiu and me.

627
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,285
Your situations may be different,

628
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:51,524
but the underline principle is the same.

629
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:54,205
Didn't you learn something

630
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:55,604
from Captain Jin this time?

631
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,004
What?

632
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:58,604
Captain Jin has a dashing face.

633
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:01,165
You're not bright.

634
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:02,765
Even I've learned it.

635
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:06,524
You should pursue the woman you like.

636
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,205
Not just wait for her.

637
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:11,365
You're right.

638
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:13,924
I should pursue her, not just wait.

639
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:14,604
Exactly.

640
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:17,245
Got to go, Liu.

641
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:17,924
Where are you going?

642
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:19,805
I'm off tonight.
I want to pursue my girl.

643
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:20,964
Good luck.

644
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:25,325
I'm such a love expert.

645
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,120
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)

646
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:34,245
Finally, we're off from work.

647
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:35,964
Dr. Zang.

648
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:37,404
You've worked so hard today.

649
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:38,964
The surgeries are big ones,

650
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:40,484
and there are arranged back-to-back.

651
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:42,004
Not really. I'm used to it.

652
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,805
If there's someone...

653
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:46,845
I'm leaving.

654
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:53,205
Dr. Zang, we're leaving.

655
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:53,964
We're off.

656
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:54,604
Good job.

657
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:56,885
Isn't he the firefighter

658
00:36:57,044 --> 00:36:58,725
who often comes here for Dr. Zang?

659
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:00,205
It's him.

660
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:01,885
But he has a different style today.

661
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,645
He looks cool today.

662
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:08,124
Why do you dress like this?

663
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:10,484
Don't you like this?

664
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,564
No.

665
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,444
I don't like this.

666
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:17,205
Anyway, I can have any looks you like.

667
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:18,924
Let's go.

668
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,205
Where are we going?

669
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:20,924
Follow me.

670
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:21,725
Wait.

671
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:27,124
When did you learn to mix drinks?

672
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:29,165
You like drinking.

673
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:30,444
So I learned from the bartender

674
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:31,885
during my off day.

675
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,924
I'm willing to learn about what you like.

676
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,404
You said we were from two different worlds.

677
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:39,205
If so, I'll walk into your world.

678
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:40,885
Taste it.

679
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:44,404
Handsome.

680
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:45,404
Are you new here?

681
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:46,645
Get me one too

682
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,524
and give me your WeChat.

683
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:49,325
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,044
I only make this for the person I like.

685
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:54,044
It turns out you like old women.

686
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:56,245
What do you mean, older woman?

687
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,044
She's a goddess.

688
00:37:58,165 --> 00:37:59,245
Who are you calling an "older woman"?

689
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:00,444
She's prettier than you. Get lost.

690
00:38:02,924 --> 00:38:03,604
Moron.

691
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:04,245
Drink this.

692
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:14,245
Nice?

693
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:17,765
The taste is not bad.

694
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,205
I didn't know you're quite a catch.

695
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:22,245
Not at all.

696
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:25,124
It's just that I dress differently today.

697
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,004
I like your usual look more.

698
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,124
It's safer.

699
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,365
What did you say?

700
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:30,604
You like me?

701
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:31,645
Nonsense.

702
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:33,604
Just now, you said you like me.

703
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:34,885
When did I say that?

704
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:42,964
Dr. Zang.

705
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:44,245
Dr. Zang.

706
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:45,885
Dr. Zang.

707
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:46,404
Wait.

708
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:47,404
Hear me out.

709
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:48,524
- Let go.
- I'm sorry.

710
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:49,685
Let go.

711
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:51,044
Did you get carried away

712
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:53,004
because I didn't scold you lately?

713
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:53,444
No.

714
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:54,245
I just couldn't help it just now.

715
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:54,805
Stop talking.

716
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:56,245
I don't want to listen to you.

717
00:38:56,645 --> 00:38:57,524
Right now.

718
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:58,524
Disappear from my sight.

719
00:38:59,285 --> 00:38:59,885
I don't want to see you again.

720
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,245
Dr. Zang.

721
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:13,805
He just left like that?

722
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:15,924
I got you.

723
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:17,484
What's your deal?

724
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:20,044
You said you didn't want to see me.

725
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,285
If so, why are you worried that I'm leaving?

726
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:25,924
It's not that.

727
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:28,604
Dr. Zang.

728
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:29,725
Admit it.

729
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:31,165
You like me.

730
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:34,845
Says who.

731
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:36,484
Don't flatter yourself.

732
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:39,725
Dr. Zang.

733
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,004
I'll definitely make you fall for me.

734
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:51,124
He's hot.

735
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:54,084
Gorgeous.

736
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:56,404
(I have to switch off my phone
during the presentation later.)

737
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:58,404
(In case you get worried
when you can't reach me,)

738
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,604
(I report this to you in advance.)

739
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,564
(Why do you have to report
such a trivial matter?)

740
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:06,845
(I approve of your behavior, anyway.)

741
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:10,645
(Do you have any orders, Madam?)

742
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:13,685
(Look back.)

743
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:26,484
Why are you here?

744
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:28,404
I'm sent to cover the safety conference

745
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:30,205
by the TV station.

746
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:33,004
Why?

747
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,165
Are you afraid

748
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,444
that I'll affect your market
among female students?

749
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:40,885
I have you now.

750
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:42,845
Why do I need that?

751
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:46,845
I'll keep a close eye on you.

(Fire Safety Seminar)

753
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,050
(United effort in fire prevention
benefits every household)

754
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:04,564
Hello, everyone.

755
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:05,924
I'm with Huaigang

756
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:07,444
Fire and Disaster Relief,

757
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,924
the captain of the First Brigade,

758
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:10,924
Jin Shichuan.

759
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,845
Fire safety knowledge

760
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:21,004
is closely related to our lives and property.

761
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:23,325
The more attention we give,

762
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:25,004
the safer we will be.

763
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:27,685
Next,

764
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,564
I'm going to share some cases with you.

765
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:37,845
This fire incident is caused by a girl

766
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:39,404
who lay in bed playing with her phone.

767
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,564
She fell asleep

768
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,964
and didn't unplug the charger,

769
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:45,645
leading the charger to overheat

770
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:46,845
and causing a fire.

771
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:47,885
Firefighters are so reliable.

772
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,205
I wonder who can be his girlfriend?

773
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,484
That's like a dream.

774
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:53,205
The corridor is narrow

775
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,285
and the neighborhood...

776
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,564
(He's taken.)

777
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:56,845
(His girlfriend is sitting right here.)

778
00:41:57,365 --> 00:41:58,084
Students,

779
00:41:58,205 --> 00:41:59,004
feel free to raise your hands

780
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:00,484
if you want to know more.

781
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,205
- Me!
- Me!

782
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,645
Here, me!

783
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:06,365
Captain Jin.

784
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,404
I want to ask if you have a girlfriend.

785
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,685
No, I don't.

786
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:16,484
We have a chance.

787
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:22,604
But I have a family member.

788
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,564
And she's here.

789
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:28,165
She's here? Who's it?

790
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:30,165
- Who's it?
- Who's it?

791
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:31,645
Ask her to come up.

792
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:32,404
That's right.

793
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:34,484
Ask her to come up.

794
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:37,285
Where's she?

795
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:39,725
