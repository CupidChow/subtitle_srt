that I had fallen for her

30
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,880

I asked my colleagues at
the fire investigation department.

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,039
If we want to find out
where the fire started,

100
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,560
we just need to follow

101
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,599
the spread of the fire and where it ended.

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
We also need to analyze the smoke traces

103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,440
and the situation of the broken items

104
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,839
to determine the origin.

105
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:22,760
Look.

106
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,240
The soot here was burned off.

107
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,039
This should be where the fire started.

108
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,160
The car driver heard a bang

109
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,560

110
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,239
before hearing the brakes.

111
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520

112
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:46,879
Oh.

113
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,080
This picture is the interior of Zhao Li's RV.

114
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,440
According to this picture,

115
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,839
we can guess what was the thing

116
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,560
that was initially here.

117
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:06,800
A mobile refrigerator?

118
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,168
If we can determine the cause
of the mobile refrigerator's explosion,

119
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,879
we'll be able to know the truth.

120
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
If the mobile refrigerator did explode,

121
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,520
there will be arc beads after it was burned.

122
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,320
This is just our initial analysis.

123
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,479
We need to wait for the relevant department's

124
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,920
official fire investigation report
to know the details.

125
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,999
Our preliminary suspicion
for the cause of the fire

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,280
is that the mobile refrigerator

127
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,359
the owner of the RV bought exploded.

128
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,119
I will follow up with the investigation

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
to see if the cause is improper use

130
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,080
or a problem with the mobile refrigerator.

131
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,119
Which company produced
the mobile refrigerator?

132
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,959
TC.

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,800

134
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,959

135
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,639

136
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,959
They are influential in our city.

137
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,520
Remember.

138
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,119
A company like this

139
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,200
has a powerful legal team behind it.

140
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,359
They also have the support of capital.

141
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,280
While investigating to find evidence,

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,719
you must be very very careful.

143
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:10,680
I will be careful.

144
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,800

145
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,599

147
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,400
They look intimate in this photo.

148
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm sure they are more than friends.

149
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:26,879
They were hugging and kissing.

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,359

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,040
Wasn't Huo Yanzong pursuing Xu Lai?

152
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Xu Lai was obviously being dumped.

153
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,959

163
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm busy, so I'll get to work.

164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,560
What will you do?

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,520
I'll find the media.

166
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
Make a statement to clarify.

167
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,560
I do need to make a statement,

168
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,479
but not to clarify.

169
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,040

Mr. Huo.

182
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,359
I'm sure you are joking with me.

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,359
I don't like to make jokes.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,639

185
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,239
I admit that I'm a little interested in you.

186
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,040
But the progress might be too quick.

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Besides, I have many suitors.

188

a bit of sincerity?

189
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,599
Our endorsement contract was a year.

190
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:19,959
It will be extended to five years.

191
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,879
How's that for sincerity?

192
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,280
Who do you think

193
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,040
I, Yu Shishi, am?

194
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,080
There are many people
that want to work with me.

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't need your endorsement.

196
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,800
I know that.

197
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,280
Your agency prioritizes this endorsement.

198
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,560
After all, it helps to increase

199
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
your commercial value.

200
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,560
Meanwhile, Yunkai Group chooses
to work with you

201
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,560
due to the consideration
of various market factors.

202
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,119
I don't want to use it
to make this request.

203
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,040
Getting you to admit to the rumors is personal.

204
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I hope you can consider it.

205
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,680
Mr. Huo, are you saying

206
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,920
that you are asking me for help
due to personal reason?

207
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,119
You are right.

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
Sign this non-disclosure agreement.

209
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,359
We are a couple in public.

210
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,800
In private,

211
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,440
we have nothing to do with each other.

212
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:19,599
Why do you want to do that?

213
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,160
That's none of your business.

214
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,160
You just need to use your skill

215
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,800
and put up a good act.

216
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,040
It's done?

217
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,560
She agreed to it.

218
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,639
Set up an interview and send the statement.

219
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,639
I want as many people as possible
to know about the rumor.

220
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,800
Are you spending so much effort to do this

221
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,359
because of Xu Lai?

222
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,119
Yes.

223
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,520
That is the only way

224
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,879
she can return to me.

225
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,239
(Yes.)

226
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,359
(We are)

227
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,719
(seriously dating.)

228
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,599
(Thank you for your concern
and blessing.)

229
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,400
(News: Yunkai Group is investing in TC)

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,759
Are you happy?

231
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,639
Yes. So happy.

232
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,639
Let's talk in the car.

233
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,359
Sure.

234
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,839
They are coming out.

235
00:14:58,839 --> 00:14:59,839
Take pictures. Hurry.

236
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:02,560
Your key.

237
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,959
Zoom in.

238
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,920
Where are we going?

239
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,479
Sending you home.

240
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,239
Mr. Huo's act is better than mine.

241
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,440
Your face changes too quickly.

242
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
It's rare for us to come out.

243
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,999
Why don't you take me on a drive?

244
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,080
I've been busy with work recently

245
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,719
and haven't taken a break
for a long time.

246
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,239
The more I get along with you,

247
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,599
the more I think you are my type.

248
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Why don't we

249
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,160
make the act real?

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm joking.

251
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,999
I don't like jokes.

252
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,839
Hello.

253
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,160
Hello, Huo.

254
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,400
Are you free?

255
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,520
(I have something to tell you.)

256
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,920
Yes. I'm free.

257
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,959
(See you at Qiancao.)

258
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Sure. See you later.

259
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,520
Sure.

260
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Sorry.

261
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
I'm meeting someone

262
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,879
and can't send you home.

263
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,639
Do you want me to get off here?

264
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,480
Do you want me to walk home alone?

265
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:10,679
Don't worry.

266
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,879
There's a car to send you home.

267
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,679
What car?

268
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,399
I hired the reporters at the back.

269
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,399
They will send you home.

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
You want an actress

271
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,439
to sit in a paparazzi's car?

272
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,159
Huo Yanzong, are you joking?

273
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,520
I told you

274
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
I don't like jokes.

275
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,800
Huo Yanzong, you brat!

276
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:56,800
Sorry.

277
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,480
He has something very urgent

278
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,520
so...

279
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:08,439
We understand.

280
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,879
It must be something very urgent.

281
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:10,480
We get it.

282
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,560
We get it.

283
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,280
Brat!

284
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,399
You must have waited for a long time.

285
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,320
No.

286
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,560
What happened to your hand?

287
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,359
I got an accidental scratch.

288
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,839
You need to be careful.

289
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,159
Why are you looking for me urgently?

290
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,839
Recently, I'm investigating a company.

291
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm suspecting this company's
mobile refrigerator

292
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,399
possesses a serious safety hazard.

293
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,399
More importantly,

294
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,879
when I'm investigating

295
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,000
the company's information,

296
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,720
I realize it is related to Yunkai.

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,720
Are you talking about TC?

298
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,599
How do you know?

299
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,439
Yunkai has been investing
in various industries

300
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,159
over the last few years.

301
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,720
TC is the only company that makes

302
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,480
mobile refrigerators.

303
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,280
However, I don't have a good impression

304
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,919
of their owner, Sun Lei.

305
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,839
I have been feeling that he is

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,639
seeking short-term benefits.

307
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,040
There will be issues soon.

308
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,199
Are you telling me this beforehand

309
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,879
because you're scared
that I'll be affected?

310
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,359
Don't worry.

311
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,599
I'm an investor.

312
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,119
I'm not involved in the operation.

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,520
Even if there's a problem with TC,

314
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:49,679
it won't involve me.

315
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,320
Don't worry. Just go investigate it.

316
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,159
If you need any help,

317
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,399
come to me anytime.

318
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,679
I'm relieved.

319
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,359
Oh.

320
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,280
I saw news of you and Yu Shishi on the Internet.

321
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,359
What a surprise.

322
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,520
To be honest,
it's a surprise for me too.

323
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,439
Do you feel relieved as well?

324
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,679
Indeed.

325
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,520
I also hope you can find your own happiness.

326
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,000
I feel happy for you.

327
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,280
Don't worry.

328
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:26,639
I already let go.

329
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,839
Are we still friends?

330
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,919
Of course.

331
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,839
We must be friends.

332
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,000
We will forever be friends.

333
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,679
Oh, how are you recently?

334
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,280
I...

335
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,679
I'm dating Jin Shichuan.

336
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,080
Is that so?

337
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
That's great.

338
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,800
Congratulations.

339
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,000

You need to change.

362
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,800
You are someone

363
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,639
with a girlfriend now.

364
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,879
You need to keep a distance
from other women

365
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,199
even your friends.

366
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,879
Besides, I have a boyfriend now.

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,399
I need to have the consciousness

368
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,119
to avoid unwanted suspicion.

369
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,439
Why are you here?

370
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,439
I'm here to pick you up.

371
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,839
We meet again, Captain Jin.

372
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,919
Just call me Jin Shichuan in the future.

373
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,040
You are Xu Lai's friend.

374
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,199
I'm her boyfriend.

375
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,639
You're one of us.

376
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,080
Just call me Huo in the future just like Xu Lai.

377
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,839
It makes us closer.

378
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,159
All right. We'll talk next time.

379
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:35,879
It's late.

380
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,599
I'll send you back first.

381
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,119
Sure.

382
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Oh, drive safe.

383
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,040
Why are you pouting?

384
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,280
Are you angry?

385
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,800
Why didn't you

386
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
tell me beforehand

387
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,560
that you were meeting Huo Yanzong alone?

388
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:58,000
Are you jealous?

389
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Yes.

390
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,480
I am jealous.

391
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,560
You went out to meet a guy alone
in the middle of the night

392
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,439
and that guy has ulterior motives.

393
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:09,599
I'm not satisfied.

394
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I'm very unhappy.

395
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,560
I'm very jealous.

396
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,040
Do you care so much about me?

397
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,439
You are my girlfriend.

398
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,080
Who do I care about if not you?

399
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,879
All right.

400
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,839
Huo Yanzong is someone with a girlfriend now.

401
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,960
We said everything clearly.

402
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
The most important thing

403
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,919
is that I only have you in my heart

404
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,720
and no one else.

405
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:32,599
Are you relieved now?

406
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,399
No.

407
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,040
What are you doing?

408
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Do you know that you are wrong?

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,639
Put me down.

410
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,159
I'll put you down

411
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,040
if you know you're wrong.

412
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,480
I know I'm wrong. Put me down.

413
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,480
Are you afraid?

414
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,560
Put me down. I'm wrong.

415
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,919
Will you report to me in the future?

416
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,320
Yes. Put me down.

417
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
(Disciplined)

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,320
Let me imitate Tao.

419
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:09,639
Let's go.

420
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:19,800
Captain Jin.

421
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:21,919
What's wrong with him?

422
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,119
Something's wrong.

423
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,679
Him? He fell out of love.

424
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,119
He will be feeling down

425
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,119
for some time recently.

426
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,040
Fell out of love?

427
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
I think it's a one-sided love.

428
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,399
He...

429
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,199
He...

430
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,001
(Xu Lai)

431
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,839
Hello.

432
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay. I'll come pick you up.

433
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,760
What's wrong, Captain Jin?

434
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm fine.

435
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,040
Why didn't you tell me

436
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:03,839
when you're here?

437
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,280
This is the mobile refrigerator

438
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,199
manufactured by TC.

439
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,240
It's the same model as the one
on the RV.

440
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,439
I brought it here so you can examine it.

441
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,240
Let me find someone to check on it

442
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,359
at the fire investigation department.

443
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,720
This incident is caused by the fire.

444
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,839
The traffic department

445
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,800
already handed the case to us

446
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:22,560
to investigate the cause.

447
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,879
If we want to know

448
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:24,599
whether it's improper use

449
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:25,599
or the product's reliability,

450
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:26,679
we must first restore

451
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,839
the physical environment
of the incident.

452
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,720
This is the physical environment

453
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
we created by simulating the RV back then.

454
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,040
Aren't we testing

455
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,399
the refrigerator today?

456
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,800
Why are there so many other appliances?

457
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:36,679
Well.

458
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,199
After an appliance catches fire,

459
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,720
there will be many arc beads.

460
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,000
These are the arc beads

461
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,919
examined by the fire investigation department

462
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,399
after investigating the remaining items in the RV.

463
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,760
What we are doing today

464
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
is recreating the scene and verify it.

465
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:51,280
Yes.

466
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
However, there's a certain danger

467
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
to this experiment.

468
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,159
Let's stand back.

469
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,960
This mobile refrigerator

470
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,280
is an absorption refrigerator.

471
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,879
It uses an old thermostat.

472
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,040
If the product
does not reach a standard,

473
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
the refrigerant will leak

474
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,960
and release isobutane.

475
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:25,919
Isobutane is a flammable gas.

476
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,280
If there's electromagnetic interference

477
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,280
or an increase in temperature,

478
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,599
it will cause explosion easily.

479
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:33,280
Jin Shichuan.

480
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,800
Did you get good grades

481
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,639
in Chemistry and Physics

482
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,679
when you were studying?

483
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,879
Do you think firefighters

484
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,679
are only good in physical education?

485
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,480
With the fire investigation report,

486
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,119
we can prove our previous hypothesis.

487
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,040
The truth is that the mobile refrigerator

488
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,879
caused the explosion.

489
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,839
This mobile refrigerator produced by TC

490
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,280
has a huge safety risk.

491
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,240
What will you do next?

492
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,080
Interview the ones
who are involved in the incident

493
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,520
to get more details and report the truth

494
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,119
as soon as possible.

495
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,439
However,

496
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,879
I still need to learn from you

497
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,520
regarding professional firefighting knowledge.

498
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,040
No problem.

499
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,560
I feel relieved with you around.

500
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Your face is dirty.

501
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,280
Why did you close your eyes?

502
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,960
No.

503
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,040
What were you expecting?

504
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,839
I didn't.

505
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:04,760
Jin Shichuan, you've changed.

506
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:06,599
How?

507
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,199
You are invasive.

508
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,199
Do you think I only know how to defend?

509
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:23,879
Look over there.

510
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,119
Counter attack!

511
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,080
When I walked pass the square this morning,

512
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,399
what do you think I saw?

513
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,119
What?

514
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
I saw Captain Jin and Xu Lai

515
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
sticking to each other.

516
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,159
Really?

517
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,839
They were so sweet.

518
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,800
They must be dating.

519
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,879
Since they are sticking to each other,

520
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it must be real.

521
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:58,720
Real?

522
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,119
Sticking to each other is nothing.

523
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,839
I even saw them hugging.

524
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,879
When?

525
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,359
What are you doing?

526
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,919
Go to work!

527
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,839
Lu Fangqi.

528
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:17,320
Come with me.

529
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
He's doing even worse.

530
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,560
What's wrong with you recently?

531
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,879
You are not yourself
when doing everything.

532
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:53,720
I'm fine, Captain Jin.

533
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,280
Liu Xu told me

534
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,040
you fell out of love.

535
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:57,960
No.

536
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,119
When did you start dating?

537
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,000
Why didn't you tell me?

538
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,639
Don't listen to Liu Xu's nonsense.

539
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,240
I don't object to you dating

540
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,760
but it mustn't affect your work.

541
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,679
As a firefighter,

542
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,800
you must always
maintain a high concentration level.

543
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,960
Your current condition definitely won't do.

544
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:20,919
Don't worry, Captain Jin.

545
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,359
I will buck up

546
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
and not harm the team.

547
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:27,839
Also,

548
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
I'm really not dating.

549
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,080
It's just a one-sided love.

550
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,320
She rejected me.

551
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,679
You also know that person.

552
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,000
I know her?

553
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,280
Who?

554
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:53,546
(Admission Record)

555
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,040
Dr. Zang.

556
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,760
I realize you care a lot about the burn patient,

557
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:00,879
Zhao Li.

558
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,760
Her family members are already giving up.

559
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,720
Why are they giving up?

560
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,280
Isn't she recovering well?

561
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,800
It's about the money.

562
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,839
She already owes a lot of medical fees.

563
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,520
Previously,

564
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,439
her husband was the breadwinner.

565
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,240
Now that her husband passed away,

566
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,960
the family has lost the support.

567
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
They are full of debt.

568
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
They can't hold on anymore.

569
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,000
Just now,

570
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,800
her mother did the discharge procedure.

571
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,839
She will probably be discharged today.

572
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,639
Madam.

573
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,240
Please come with me.

574
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,119
I heard you are going to get Zhao Li discharged.

575
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,159
Do you know

576
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,320
the follow-up care for a burn patient

577
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,320
is very complicated?

578
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,839
Her current condition doesn't allow her
to be cared for at home.

579
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,040
It'll be serious if there's an infection.

580
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:04,000
We can no longer afford to treat Zhao Li.

581
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,119
We also owe our relatives
a lot of money.

582
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,199
My daughter's life

583
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,320
was exchanged with Dayong's life.

584
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,599
As her mother,

585
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:17,199
I won't give up unless it's the last resort.

586
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,720
I am backed into a corner.

587
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,599
I understand your concern

588
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,720
but I don't want you and Zhao Li

589
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,040
to give up just like that.

590
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,720
Well,

591
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,040
let me pay the bills for you first.

592
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,760
We'll let Zhao Li receive treatment
at the hospital now.

593
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,520
Dr. Zang.

594
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,480
I accept your kindness,

595
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,839
but I don't know

596
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,040
when I can return the money to you.

597
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't worry.

598
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:55,639
I won't chase you to pay me back.

599
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,240
Zhao Li is my patient.

600
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,760
I won't give up on my patient.

601
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,679
So, all of you mustn't give up.

602
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,760
All right?

603
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,679
Dr. Zang.

604
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,399
You are a good person.

605
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't know

606
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,759
how to repay you.

607
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,639
It's what I should do.

608
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,000
Thank you!

609
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,520
Madam, stand up.

610
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,639
Stand up.

611
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
Don't do this.

612
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:21,599
Actually,

613
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,319
there's no need to thank me

614
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,920
because I feel you.

615
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,520
I know

616
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,360
how suffering it is to be the one

617
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,719
that got left behind.

618
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,560
It'll be fine.

619
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,319
Captain Jin, are you all right?

620
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,440
I know you have complicated feelings.

621
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,960
After all, you had a relationship with Zang Qiu.

622
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,679
You've misunderstood.

623
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,440
Zang Qiu and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

624
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,319
What is your relationship with her then?

625
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,840
Zang Qiu's husband, Fang Huai,

626
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,759
was my teammate.

627
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,840
Why was Zang Qiu treating you in that manner?

628
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,799
He passed away.

629
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,560
I need to take a huge responsibility
regarding his death.

630
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:28,651
(Doctor's Office)

631
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,119
Dr. Zang.

632
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
Zhao Li is your patient, right?

633
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,400
I got some details

634
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,799
from the traffic police at the scene.

635
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,840
I want to interview her.

636
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,400
Interview?

637
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,239
No.

638
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,319
Although she recovered well
after her surgery

639
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,360
and was transferred to a normal ward,

640
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,840
her emotion is still not stable.

641
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,239
If you interview her now,

642
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,679
it will cause mental stress.

643
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,480
I don't agree.

644
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,920
But this interview is very important.

645
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,360
I already examined the RV.

646
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,159
The cause of the fire was not the car accident

647
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,880
but the explosion from the mobile refrigerator.

648
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,639
Now that Wang Dayong is dead,

649
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,920
Zhao Li is the only one

650
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,319
who can restore the truth of the scene.

651
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,960
I really want to help her.

652
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,000
Even if I agree to the interview,

653
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:07,440
she is suffering
from respiratory tract infection

654
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,040
and can't speak now.

655
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:09,759
Don't worry.

656
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I did some work.

657
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,040
I will interview her

658
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,119
with a method suitable for her.

659
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,560
It won't affect her recovery.

660
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,560
Fine.

661
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,840
Let's go.

662
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,719
I'll bring you to her.

663
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,520
Thank you.

664
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,960
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

665
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,960
I am Xu Lai, a reporter.

666
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,920
Everyone now thinks

667
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,880
your husband Wang Dayong braked illegally

668
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
while driving the RV and caused the accident.

669
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,040
I know

670
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
that is not the truth.

671
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,520
Your husband, Wang Dayong,

672
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,040
can't defend himself anymore.

673
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,239
You are the only one

674
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,880
who can tell the truth and prove his innocence.

675
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,400
I believe

676
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,560
you don't want your husband

677
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,599
to leave with the identity of a perpetrator.

678
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,599
Right?

679
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,279
Can I ask you a few simple questions?

680
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,360
I know you can't speak right now.

681
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,360
Do you think this works?

682
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,920
You can blink your eyes

683
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,199
to tell me if you agree or disagree.

684
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,119
Blink once if you agree.

685
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:09,400
Blink twice if you disagree.

686
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,599
How is that?

687
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,719
Before the traffic accident,

688
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,920
the mobile refrigerator first exploded

689
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
and caused the fire.

690
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,440
That was why your husband braked

691
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,080
and caused the car behind
to crash into you.

692
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,360
Right?

693
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:30,880
Sorry.

694
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,239
We can take it slowly.

695
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
She told me

696
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,639
the refrigerator exploded

697
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,000
and the RV caught fire.

698
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,199
Dayong stopped the car

699
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,880
and wanted to escape with her.

700
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,799
However, the car from behind
crashed into them.

701
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,880
Dayong hugged her tightly to protect her.

702
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,920
I investigated it.

703
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
There was a problem
with the mobile refrigerator.

704
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,400
Please believe me

705
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,719
and give me some time.

706
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,719
I will seek justice

707
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,799
for you and your husband.

708
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,199
The treatment period
for a burn patient is long.

709
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,239
They can't pay the bills.

710
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,759
If it is proven that the incident

711
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,119
is TC's responsibility,

712
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,840
they can request compensation from TC

713
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,599
which will reduce their burden.

714
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:24,759
Don't worry.

715
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,279
I will investigate to the end

716
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,840
and report the truth
as soon as possible,

717
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,279
and help them
request compensation from TC.

718
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,679
Thank you.

719
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,199
I thank you on behalf of Zhao Li and her family.

720
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,520
You need to thank Jin Shichuan instead.

721
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,360
I won't find the truth so quickly

722
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
if he didn't help me with the verification.

723
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,480
Although I don't know

724
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,360
what happened between you and Jin Shichuan,

725
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,719
he is a nice person.

726
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:53,360
Do you want to know

727
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,400
why I hate him?

728
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,040
Let's go out and take a walk.

729
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,119
Sure.

730
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,719
Fang Huai sacrificed himself

731
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:09,599
to save Jin Shichuan?

732
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,239
That's what he told me.

733
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,360
Is this why you hate him?

734
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,759
Since the day I married Fang Huai,

735
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,719
I was already mentally prepared.

736
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,040
I can understand a firefighter's choice

737
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,599
regarding his work ideals.

738
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,639
I can also understand that

739
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:32,000
saving Jin Shichuan
was his first reaction.

740
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,599
I would do that too

741
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,520
if I were in his shoes.

742
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,080
Why do you...

743
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,799
I don't hate Jin Shichuan.

744
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,719
I just can't forgive him.

745
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,319
I missed out

746
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,679
on seeing Fang Huai for one last time
because of him.

747
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,080
Fang Huai!

748
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,199
(Operating Room)
Fang Huai!

749
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,759
Let me go inside!

750
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,040
Jin Shichuan, let me go inside!

751
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,639
Fang Huai!

752
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,840
Jin Shichuan!

753
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,360
I beg you!

754
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,960
Let me see him one last time, all right?

755
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
I beg you!

756
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:23,759

Jin Shichuan.

759
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,520
I just want to take a look.

760
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,719
Let me take a look.

761
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,920
Why won't you let me go inside?

762
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,080
Why?

763
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,040
I won't be able to see him again!

764
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,360
Jin Shichuan,

765
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,040
I hate you!

766
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,480
I can't keep an open mind

767
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:36,639
for something like this.

768
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,719
I can't let go of the obsession in my heart.
