(Don't Give Up On Me, All Right?)

18
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,519
Let's break up.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,920
I know you are still angry,

20
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,600
but you shouldn't say
that even if you are angry.

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
I mean it.

22
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,200
I already considered it thoroughly.

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,600
Let's break up.

24
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,959
Is it because of what my mother said that day?

25
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,600
She didn't mean it.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,320
Believe me.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
Even if my mother doesn't agree,

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,999
I will also...

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,200
This has nothing to do with your mother.

30
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,160
This is a fundamental problem for both of us.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
When we are together,

32
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,200
we can't take care of each other.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,519
We will only cause each other trouble.

34
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,239
Instead of dragging it out
and suffering in the future,

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,320
it's better to end it now.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,999
What's wrong, Jin Shichuan?

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,959
Why didn't you say this

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
when we decided to be together?

39
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,640
Perhaps it has been a mistake
since the beginning.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
I don't agree.

41
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,399
I don't accept this reason.

42
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,239
You suggested the breakup yourself.

43
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,839
I don't agree so there's no breakup.

44
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,799
We are finally together.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,921
Why do you want to break up?

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,119
We have already broken up.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,279
Do you understand?

48
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,080
I don't agree.

49
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:42,920
Jin Shichuan!

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,040

51

I'll wait here until you come out!

00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,440
Jin Shichuan!

53
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,679
Jin Shichuan!

54

(Do you want to date me?)

55
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,719
I want to tell you directly.

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,519
I like you.

57
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
Because I'm afraid that if I fall,

58
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,719
I will regret

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
not confessing to you earlier.

60
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,120
With your current condition,

61
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,000
you can't take good care of Xu Lai.

62
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,719
She's the one
taking care of you instead.

63
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,599
(You are still hurting her in this condition.)

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,039

No.

140
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,520

144
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Go back.

145
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,400
I want to be alone.

146
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,839

147
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,400

00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,440

and look at me.)

154
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,839
You're awake?

155
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,080
Are you here the whole night?

156
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm worried
something might happen to you again,

157
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,719
so I didn't go back.

158
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:57,920
Last night, I...

159
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,800
Are you hungry?

160
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
Let me cook some congee for you.

161
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,719
No. I don't have an appetite.

162
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:04,999
Eat a little at least.

163
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,639
You need to eat to recover your energy.

164
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,080
Let's go.

165
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Here.

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,959
It's my first time cooking.
I don't have much experience

167
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,440
so I only made plain congee.

168
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,479
Thank you.

No.

172
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,560
What are you thinking about?

173
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,599
I'm thinking about

174
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,239
the chicken soup

175
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,440
I gave Jin Shichuan last night.

176
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,719
I wonder if he already drank it.

177
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Don't eat if you don't have an appetite.

178
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,639
Don't force yourself.

179
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,680
Yes.

180
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
Many things can't be forced.

181
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,959
I know we have broken up

182
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,440
and know he doesn't want to see me.

183
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,800
I know I can't miss him

184
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,879
but I still can't do it.

185
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,639
Am I useless?

186
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,959
Don't worry.

187
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,359
You will forget it after a long time.

188
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,119
I miss him.

189
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,759
I can't forget him.

190
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Ten years.

191
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,320
For ten years.

192
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,599
You still have me.

193
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,320
Don't be afraid.

194
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,119
I will always be with you

195
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,879
until you forget about him completely.

196
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,999
All right?

197
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,239
Thank you, Huo.

198
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,200
You have been accompanying me
since last night.

199
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Don't worry.

200
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,440
Go back.

201
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,879
I want to be alone.

202
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,479
All right.

203
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,599
If you need me, just call me anytime.

204
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,719
I'll always be here.

205
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,119
You know how serious

206
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,119
your leg injury is,

207
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,040
yet you still went out
and got soaked in the rain.

208
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,879
Thankfully,

209
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,599
your wound isn't infected.

210
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,599
Otherwise, your leg is gone.

211
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,639
There's no use in treating it.

212
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,440
What do you mean?

213
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
Are you going to
give up on the treatment?

214
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,400
Do you know all doctors here

215
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,200
have been thinking about solutions day and night

216
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
because of your leg?

217
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
Who are you to give up?

218
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,959
What is the meaning of being persistent?

219
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
Why is it meaningless?

220
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm telling you.

221
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,719
I won't allow you

222
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,599
to be irresponsible for yourself.

223
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Remember.

224
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,879
Your life was exchanged with Fang Huai's.

225
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,359
You have no right to give up.

226
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,879
Grandpa, why are you here?

227
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
You were badly injured
and got admitted to the hospital,

228
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,200
yet you still didn't inform me.

229
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,160
I would still be in the dark

230
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,440
if Wen didn't tell me.

231
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,239
This is not a minor issue.

232
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
Hiding such a serious incident from me.

233
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,800
Do you still see me as your grandpa?

234
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,839
I don't want you to worry.

235
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,400
How can I not worry?

236
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,719
Your injury...

237
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,199
I don't think it can be treated.

238
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,760
What do you mean it can't be treated?

239
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,760
It's only a possibility.

240
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,320
It's not absolute
that it can't be treated.

241
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,040
Cheer up.

242
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:33,800
Don't be dejected.

243
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:35,960
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

244
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,520
you need to put in all efforts and not give up.

245
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,520
Where's Xu?

246
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,919
Does she know that you were injured
and got admitted to the hospital?

247
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,240
We broke up.

248
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,119
What?

249
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,119
When did it happen?

250
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,639
Is it because of your injury?

251
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,639
No.

252
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:02,679
Then...

253
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,720
She doesn't know.

254
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,080
She doesn't know about my injury.

255
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,639
You hid it from her?

256
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,280
Grandpa, look at my injury.

257
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,119
I can't be a firefighter

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,919
and I can't protect her.

259
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,839
What's the point of living?

260
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,439
I can't even stand

261
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,359
these few days.

262
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm no different from a cripple.

263
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,159
How can I drag a girl down with me?

264
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,480
How can I get her to take care of me?

265
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,240
Xu Lai performed well in the TC case.

266
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,359
She showed the attitude

267
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,240
and spirit worthy of a newsperson.

268
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,240
All of you should learn from her.

269
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,679
Apart from that,

270
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,040
Jiang Xin,

271
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,960
you were reckless
in publicizing information

272
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,520
before verifying it.

273
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,560
You failed to be cautious

274
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,679
and to seek the truth.

275
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,639
You must learn more from Xu Lai regarding this.

276
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,919
Next time,

277
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,159
don't make the same mistake again.

278
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,119
All right?

279
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,399
You are right.

280
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,760
Xu Lai.

281
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,359
We must communicate more and improve together.

282
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,879
All right.

283
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,280
That's all for the weekly meeting.

284
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,520
Go back to work.

285
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,520
Xu Lai, stay here.

286
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,520
What's going on?

287
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,480
Do you have something on your mind recently?

288
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,000
I fell out of love.

289
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,439
Fell out of love?

290
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,560
I can understand.

291
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,800
When a person is in a relationship,

292
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,399
it will affect their condition and emotions.

293
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,439
However, if you lose control of your emotions,

294
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,399
you can't do anything or make any judgments.

295
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,480
The Xu Lai I know

296
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,599
is a very excellent news reporter.

297
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,480
So I believe

298
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
you can find your form

299
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,760
and control your emotions, right?

300
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,040
Don't worry.

301
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,240
I will find my form as soon as possible.

302
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,199
Don't think you will always be lucky.

303
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,919
Although Huo Yanzong escaped this time

304
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,599
and you were lucky,

305
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,520
it won't happen again.

306
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:04,960
Why are you smiling?

307
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,639
I'm smiling because your reminder
came right on time.

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,199
I almost forgot there's someone like you

309
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,359
who is waiting to laugh at me.

310
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,280
Seems like I need to focus on my work.

311
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,399
After all,

312
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,639
I can't allow people like you
to take advantage.

313
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,359
You...

314
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,520
I'm not free to have small talk.

315
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:21,520

Huo?

Have you had dinner?

No. I'm not hungry.

00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,399
not been to the hospital recently?

371
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,760
I just want to work

372
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,520
and not talk about relationships.

373
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,599
Don't mention him
in front of me in the future.

374
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,359
Let's go.

375
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:17,480
You have dark circles.

376
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,599
It's bad to exhaust yourself.

377
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:22,919
Let me send you back.

378
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,679
I'll go and call the lift.

379
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,599
Hello.

380
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:53,839
(Mr. Huo, I got the information.)

381
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,280
(I already sent the information)

382
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,119
(of the disease to you.)

383
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,639
Sure. Thank you.

384
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,580
(Popliteal artery aneurysm)

385
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,380
(Symptoms, Complications)

386
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,280
Huo.

387
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:18,080
The shareholders of TC agreed

388
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,320
to transfer their shares.

389
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,240
We can prepare to acquire TC now.

390
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,080
Huo.

391
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,240
Should we tell Xu Lai?

392
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,879
She doesn't need to know.

393
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,919
It will be a mess
if we don't get rid of the cause.

394
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,399
I must get rid of all future troubles for her.

395
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,879
We're here?

396
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Are you awake?

397
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,760
I'm leaving.

398
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:17,720
Thank you for sending me back.

399
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,320
Xu Lai.

400
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,080
What is it?

401
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,560
It's nothing.

402
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,599
I see that you are very tired recently.

403
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,679
You must rest more.

404
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,280
Don't worry.

405
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,960
Take care.

406
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:39,960
Sure.

407
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,700
(To University City)

408
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,080
Make way!

409
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:16,080
Make way! I'm late!

410
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,560
Wait! She fell!

411
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,199
She fell!

412
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,040
Who was that?

413
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,280
He's so rude!

414
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:21,960
Why is he like that?

415
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,280
How are you?

416
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,720
What's wrong with her?

417
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,679
Do you know her?

418
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,359
She's my friend.

419
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,119
She's fine.

420
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,399
She suffered from hypoglycemia
caused by flu and overworking.

421
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,879
She just needs an injection and a rest.

422
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:50,720
Thank you.

423
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,399

My leg is hurt.

451
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,240
If something happens to you,

452
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,919
I can't even protect you.

(No.)

454
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,639
(Something's wrong
with Jin Shichuan's injury.)

455
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:45,639
Hello.

456
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
Hello, are you busy?

457
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,919
I'm tired and don't feel like talking.

458
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,199
I just finished three operations.

459
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,320
I'll call you again

460
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,399
when you are not busy then.

461
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,800
Although I'm tired,

462
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,919
I still have the energy to go for a drink.

463
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm off duty now.

464
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,839
Let's get a drink.

465
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,280
Sure.

466
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,639
I called you to ask you

467
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
about Jin Shichuan!

468
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,040
What are you saying?

469
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,400
I can't hear you! The music is too loud!

470
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,719
I'm asking

471
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,199
if Jin Shichuan came to visit me

472
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,880
when I was on the IV drip.

473
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,239
Is the condition of Jin Shichuan's leg improving?

474
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,679
Let's go and dance!

475
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:35,239
Come here.

476
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,639
I'm telling you!

477
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,759
Since I broke up

478
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,759
with Jin Shichuan,

479
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,000
I've been feeling so relaxed!

480
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,080
I no longer need to worry about

481
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,799
whether he will get hurt on missions!

482
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,599
I also don't need to worry if he eats well!

483
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
I don't need to worry...

484
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,520
I don't need to worry

485
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,840
about whether he loves me or not.

486
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,440
All right.

487
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,759
Cheers!

488
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,840
In the future,

489
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,159
I will no longer
go find Jin Shichuan anymore!

490
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,279
I want to forget him completely!

491
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,759
No.

492
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,799
Come back.

493
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,000
You are drunk.

494
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,000
If you drink any more...

495
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,920
If you collapse, I can't save you.

496
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,639
I'm telling you.

497
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,400
Let's go.

498
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,759
Be careful.

499
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,279
Get up.

500
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,080
The floor is cold.

501
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,040
Get up.

502
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,000
What's wrong?

503
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,880
What's wrong, Xu Lai?

504
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,639
Didn't you say

505
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,000
drinking makes me forget everything?

506
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,960
Why do I miss him more?

507
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,279
Do you know?

508
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:30,199
I waited for him for ten years.

509
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:34,920
Ten years.

510
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,599
All right.

511
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,199
All right.

512
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,440
Are you a fool?

513
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:49,639
You can still see him

514
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,759
unlike me.

515
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,080
I can't even see mine
even if I want to.

516
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,119
All right.

517
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,960
I miss him!

518
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,400
It's all right.

519
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,360
Let's go find him.

520
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,520
It'll be fine.

521
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,319
All right?

522
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,719
Jin Shichuan.

523
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,719
This person misses you like crazy.

524
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,239
I can't hold her back.

525
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,440
Deal with her yourself.

526
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,199
Stand still.

527
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,080
Stand.

528
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:00,799
Are you drunk?

529
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,360
Sit down.

530
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,599
Jin Shichuan.

531
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,520
I miss you so much.

532
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:06,960
You are drunk.

533
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:08,799
Don't move!

534
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,840
What are you doing?

535
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:28,159
I want to know what you are thinking.

536
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,880
You are drunk.

537
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,799
Why did you break up with me?

538
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,199
Do you know I will miss you every day.

539
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,199
Jin Shichuan.

540
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,840
Don't give up on me, all right?

541
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,840
Jin Shichuan.

542
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,799
You're awake?

543
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,599
You were drunk yesterday.

544
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,400
Do you know what you did last night?

545
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,199
Don't move!

546
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,480
I came here to take the flask.

547
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:04,319
Move.

548
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,199
Move.

549
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,360
Where's my note?

550
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,599
What note?

551
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
It's best if you didn't see it.

552
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:41,279
Since we already broke up,

553
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,719
assume I wasn't here last night.
