(Is This Something A Woman Should Tell A Man?)

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,200
Come up.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,590
Why are you asking me to come up?

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
Let me introduce her.

25
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,110
Her name is Xu Lai.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
She is my family member

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,950
and an amazing reporter.

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,360
At times, as a firefighter,

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,830
I will often face different kinds of danger.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,160
For her,

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,230
as a reporter in the front line,

32
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,640
she will always be fighting alongside me.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
Not only is she my lover,

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,990
but she is also my partner

35
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,830
and my comrade-in-arms.

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,230
When I injured my leg,

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,760
I once thought I'd never be able to stand again.

38
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,670
It was all because she was with me, encouraging me,

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,920
staying by my side and giving me strength.

40
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,230
To the world, I might look like a hero,

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
but in my heart,

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,360
she is the heroine who saved me.

(Fire Prevention and Safety Talk)

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,230
Why did you ask me
to go up there just now?

45
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,080
I was so embarrassed.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,110
If I didn't ask you to go up there,

47
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,670
and a woman confessed to me,

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,550
would you be jealous?

49
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,080
Of course, I would.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,360
I want the whole world to know

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,830
that I have a family member

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
and the others have no chance.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Dating a firefighter is such a happy thing.

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,920
What's wrong?

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm wearing my uniform.

56
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm not working tonight.

57
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,910
What do you want to eat?

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,830
Hotpot.

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
You're skillful with the knife.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,200
It seems like I've found a brave warrior

61
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,440
who can also cook as my boyfriend.

62
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,510
There's no choice.

63
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,440
It's so that I can feed you well.

64
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,680
I can't just let you feed me.

65
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,880
Do you know?

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,390
It was the first time I made the chicken soup

67
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,200
by learning from the recipe.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,560
Why don't you teach me?

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,800
Okay.

70
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,350
Show me.

71
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,120
Sure.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Not like that.

73
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,270
Your knuckle

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
is supposed to be against
the back of the knife.

75
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,120
That's right.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes. Just like that.

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you all right?

78
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,800
Where did you get hurt?

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,830
You little liar.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
See how I punish you.

81
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,440
Don't run!

82
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,030
Don't run!

83
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,470
Don't run!

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,440
Don't run!

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,030
Dad. Mom.

86
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,350
Why are you here?

87
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,440
Preserved vegetables.

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,910
Your mother made
some preserved vegetables for you.

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,270
We would like to give it to you

90
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,440
since we are passing by.

91
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,080
Don't just stand there. Sit down.

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,910
Sit down.

93
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,200
Here.

94
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Introduce him to us.

95
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,800
Who is this young man?

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,270
This is my boyfriend,

97
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,150
Jin Shichuan.

98
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,030
Hello, Mr. Xu. Mrs. Xu.

99
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,150
Boyfriend?

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,640
Why have I not heard you mention it?

101
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,240
Sit. Sit down.

102
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,950
Jin, right?

104
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,710
How old are you? Where do you work?

105
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm 30.

106
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,000
I work at the fire brigade.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Jin Shichuan is

108
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,910
the captain of
the Emergency Response Unit.

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,150
Emergency Response Unit?

110
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,390
The Emergency Response Unit is

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
in charge of

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,470
major rescue situations.

113
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,760
Isn't that very dangerous?

114
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,510
A little.

115
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,440
This...

116
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,150
You prepared so much food.

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
There's even hotpot.

118
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,270
Yes.

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,950
We're having hotpot.

120
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,830
Mr. Xu. Mrs. Xu.

121
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Have you had dinner?

122
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Why don't you join us?

123
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,200
Sure.

124
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,470
Let's eat and talk.

125
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't have an appetite.

126
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,440
Allow me.

127
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
I forgot.

128
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,000
I have some work at the brigade.

129
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,510
Why don't you eat first?

130
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,390
I'll go back now.

131
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,910
Sorry. I forgot my clothes.

132
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,350
Goodbye, Mr. Xu. Mrs. Xu.

133
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,230
Mom.

134
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,230
What are you doing?

135
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,400
He's here to eat.

136
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,280
You made it all awkward now.

137
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,830
How dare you say that.

138
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,590
If your father and I didn't see this,

139
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,560
how long would you hide this from us?

140
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,710
I wasn't trying to hide it.

141
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
We just started dating.

142
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,830
I just didn't get to tell you before.

143
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,400
Great.

144
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,470
I don't think you're right
for each other.

145
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,950
Break up with him.

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,750
What do you mean to break up?

147
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,160
No.

148
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,400
Why should I listen to you?

149
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,950
He's a firefighter.

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
It's a dangerous job.

151
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,470
I disagree.

152
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,110
I'm the one who is dating him, not you.

153
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,440
Is that how you talk to your mother?

154
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
You're taking his side
right after you're in a relationship.

155
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,440
Anyway,

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
I just feel that Jin Shichuan and I
are good together.

157
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,630
There's no one else in this world

158
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,800
who is a better match for me
than Jin Shichuan.

159
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
I don't think you two
should be together.

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,990
No matter how good you think he is,

161
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,080
I will not agree.

162
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,920
All right.

163
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,110
Stop arguing.

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,950
Calm down.

165
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,280
Calm down, okay?

166
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,080
Xu Lai.

167
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,040
Your mother cares about you.

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Look at it this way.

169
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,470
This is your first boyfriend.

170
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,830
We have to see if he's good enough.

171
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,440
Right?

172
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,590
You too.

173
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,280
You shouldn't be
getting angry for no reason.

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,040
This is only the first time we're meeting Jin.

175
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,280
We must get to know him

176
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,630
before we decide, right?

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,280
Well,

178
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,870
since tomorrow is the weekend,

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,750
let's invite Jin

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,920
over to our house for dinner.

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,870
What do you think?

182
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,200
What do you think?

183
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,350
I'll check with him

184
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,400
to see if he has time.

185
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,990
If he doesn't even have time
on the weekends,

186
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
do you think he'll have time

187
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,950
to look after you in the future?

188
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,870
All right.

189
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,280
Tomorrow at 6:30 pm.

190
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,230
Invite him over for dinner.

191
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay.

192
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,700
(Obey The Rule, Safety First)

193
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,470
Captain Jin.

194
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,680
Didn't you go to the campus
to give a talk?

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,710
Why did you come back so late at night?

196
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,110
I went to Xu Lai's house.

197
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,560
Xu Lai?

198
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,470
Do you have any cup noodles left?

199
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,440
Make one for me.

200
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,590
Wait.

201
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,920
Why didn't you eat with Xu Lai

202
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,280
since you went to her place?

203
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,350
Her parents showed up suddenly.

204
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
You've met her parents?

205
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,920
How was their first impression of you?

206
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
He looks terrible.

207
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,110
His first impression
must have been bad.

208
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,350
He didn't even have a meal together.

209
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,350
He is worse than I am.

210
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,590
(Hello.)

211
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:23,950
Hello.

212
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,400
(Are you back at the station?)

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,230
I just did.

214
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,350
I didn't have time to report to you.

215
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,750
My parents just left.

216
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,160
Don't take my mother's attitude to heart.

218
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,320
It's fine.

219
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,630
Why would I?

220
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,990
I can understand her,

221
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,990
since my job is something that concerns them.

222
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,830
I'm glad.

223
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,440
I was actually worried before I make this call.

224
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,920
What is it?

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,350
I was worried

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,350
that my boyfriend

227
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,830
would run away because of my mother.

228
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,560
I don't get scared easily.

229
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,230
You are underestimating me.

230
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,470
Do you think I can't take a challenge?

231
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,320
All right.

232
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,870
You should prepare

233
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,110
for the next challenge.

234
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,470
My mother invites you over

235
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,530
for dinner at my house tomorrow night.

236
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,710
Tomorrow night?

237
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,160
If you don't have time,

238
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
we can do it another day.

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,520
No.

240
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
It's fine.

241
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I didn't expect

242
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,614
the challenge to come so soon.

243
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,440
Don't panic.

244
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm here.

245
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,400
I'll look after you.

246
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm a man.

247
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,320
I don't need a girl's protection.

248
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,680
I can even run into the fire,

249
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,680
let alone your home.

250
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,080
It's fine.

251
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,830
I will do well tomorrow.

252
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,350
It's decided.

253
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:34,807
Tomorrow at 6:30 pm.

254
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,590
See you at my place.

255
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Don't be late.

256
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,560
My mother hates it when people are late.

257
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,200
Bye.

258
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Did he get into a fight again?

259
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,320
Look at him being serious.

260
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,230
What is up with Captain Jin?

261
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,470
Did he have a fight with Xu Lai again?

262
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,630
No way.

263
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,110
They just made up a few days ago.

264
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,710
All right.

265
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:08,920
Let me ask.

266
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,920
Captain Jin.

267
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Did you quarrel with Xu Lai again?

268
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,680
It's all right.

269
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
We are experienced.

270
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,560
Let's help you come up with an idea
to win Xu Lai over.

271
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:20,950
Yes.

272
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes.

273
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,920
Yes.

274
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
I have more important people to win over this time.

275
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,680
Who is it?

276
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,520
Who is it?

277
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,160
Xu Lai's parents, especially her mother.

278
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,990
Mother-in-law?

279
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,990
Listen to me.

280
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,080
This is my first time

281
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,400
going to her house for dinner.

282
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,080
It is my first time meeting her parents.

283
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,750
I have no experience.

284
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,950
Help me out.

285
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,280
Hello, Commissioner.

286
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,160
Shichuan.

287
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,750
There's going to be a major celebration

288
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,120
in the city.

289
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,400
Our response unit

290
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,350
received an urgent order to help out.

291
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,080
Come back now for a meeting

292
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,750
and deploy the execution plan.

293
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,280
But...

294
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,200
This event is very important.

295
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,710
It involves fireworks and explosives.

296
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,630
We must ensure the safety of the citizens.

297
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay.

298
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,750
I'll return to the brigade later.

299
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Do you need help?

300
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,350
No.

301
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,830
There's no need.

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,350
You don't know.

303
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,590
You can teach me.

304
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,680
I want to learn anyway.

305
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,080
Why are you learning?

306
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,920
Are you making it for that brat?

307
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
I never let you cook since young.

308
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,440
I didn't raise you up

309
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,160
just to serve a man.

310
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,470
This misfortune is enough for me.

311
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,040
Not my daughter.

312
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,710
A misfortune?

313
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm right here listening.

314
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
I said it because you were listening.

315
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,520
This is done.

316
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,830
Check the taste.

317
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,590
Your mother has a soft heart.

318
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,320
She said she doesn't like Jin

319
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,320
but she went to the market

320
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,040
early in the morning.

321
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,990
Look at the groceries she bought.

322
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,230
She's been busy the whole afternoon.

323
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,920
Hello. Are you arriving?

324
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,110
Sorry.

325
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,750
I received a call to return to the brigade.

326
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,680
I will try my best to get there
before dinner.

327
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,160
What is the urgent mission?

328
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,680
(An urgent meeting.)

329
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,680
(It shouldn't take too long.)

330
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,160
(Please explain)

331
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,920
(to Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu.)

332
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,680
I'll come over soon.

333
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,320
Try to come soon.

334
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,950
I'll wait for you.

335
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,110
(Okay.)

336
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,420
(Culture Centre Plaza, Metro Station)

337
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,280
Well.

338
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,430
Give Jin a call.

339
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,720
See if he has left the brigade.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
I called him just now.

341
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,830
He said the Emergency Response Unit

342
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,910
called for an urgent meeting.

343
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,240
He'll be late.

344
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,670
Late for two hours?

345
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,040
He has no choice since it's work.

346
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,830
He said he'll be here
as soon as it ends.

347
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,830
That's okay.

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,760
Work is more important.

349
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,110
It's understandable.

350
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's not wait.

351
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
Tell him he doesn't need to come.

352
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,760
This is his first visit.

353
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,670
Is this person even reliable?

354
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,040
I told you not to date a firefighter.

355
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,000
It'll be just like your father.

356
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,760
They always give up their family
for others.

357
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Why are you talking about me again?

358
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,670
Seriously.

359
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,000
Mother.

360
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,190
Think about it this way.

361
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,800
He's serious about his job
which means he is responsible.

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,430
His sense of responsibility is
to his work

363
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,560
and not to the family.

364
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,720
A woman's happiness is to find someone

365
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,760
who can stay by her side to protect her.

366
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,590
Do you understand?

367
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,520
I can tell you right now.

368
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
I disagree.

369
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:04,910
Mom.

370
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,670
Can you not be extreme in your thoughts?

371
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,190
He really has something to do.

372
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,190
What do you know?

373
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,110
I'm telling you, Xu Lai.

374
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,430
You must break up with him.

375
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:13,960
Otherwise,

376
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,040
you can stop calling me your mother.

377
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,760
No. What is wrong with you?

378
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,280
Do you have to do this?

379
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,590
Why do you have to be the one

380
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,720
to decide everything?

381
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,150
You've never asked me in any decisions you made

382
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,350
including your divorce.

383
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,760
You only informed me about it.

384
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,720
Do you even care about what I want?

385
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm doing this for you.

386
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,560
I cannot let you walk my path.

387
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,190
Know that?

388
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,590
It won't be the same as you.

389
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,590
You have a failed marriage.

390
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,720
Not for me.

391
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,760
Enough.

392
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,320
It's not easy to sit together

393
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,110
for dinner as a family.

394
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,670
What are you doing?

395
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,040
Do you have to turn it into a mess?

396
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,350
I'm leaving.

397
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,240
Xu Lai.

398
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,280
Xu Chengyun.

399
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,190
I'm telling you...

400
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,150
Listen to me first.

401
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,320
Our girl is not a child anymore.

402
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,240
Why do you want to plant your thoughts

403
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,150
into her mind?

404
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,870
Why?

405
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,430
I'm telling you this, Xu Chengyun.

406
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,520
You have no right to say this to me.

407
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,280
If it wasn't for you,

408
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,760
I wouldn't have been who I am today.

409
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,670
Everyone, got it?

410
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

411
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,190
Okay. Dismiss.

412
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,470
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief
First Brigade)

413
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,000
Your captain is in a hurry.

414
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,630
Where is he going?

415
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,320
He was supposed to be at Xu Lai's house

416
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,560
to have dinner with her parents.

417
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,480
He was going to have dinner
with her parents?

418
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,350
It's late now.

419
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,590
Xu Lai's parents didn't like it

420
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,430
when they're together,

421
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,760
because being a firefighter is too dangerous.

422
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,720
Judging by the time,

423
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,830
I think it's going to be late.

424
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,000
Xu Lai's parents must have a bad impression of him.

425
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,000
Thank you, Commissioner.

426
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,640
(Jin Shichuan)

427
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,320
Hello.

428
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,630
(Huaigang Fire and Disaster Relief
First Brigade)

429
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,190
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,560
I just got off work.

431
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,630
I'm on the way to your house now.

432
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,830
Is Mrs. Xu really mad?

433
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,560
No.

434
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,960
I explained to them.

435
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,910
They can understand.

436
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,630
(I was worried that
they'd wait too long,)

437
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,800
(so I told them to eat first.)

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,560
(What a waste.)

439
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
(You don't get to try
my mother's cooking.)

440
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,560
Maybe next time.

441
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,390
Why does your voice sound hoarse?

442
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,390
Are you crying?

443
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,560
No.

444
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,910
You're not at home. Where are you now?

445
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,190
(I came out from my parent's house.)

446
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,720
(I don't know where I am now.)

447
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,590
Send me your location.

448
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,630
Don't go anywhere.

449
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,350
I'm coming to you.

450
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,110
What happened?

451
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,760
You don't have to be strong
in front of me.

452
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,190
I was prepared

453
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,560
that my mother would not acknowledge us.

454
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,280
But I never thought

455
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,910
she would disregard my feelings like that.

456
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,800
It's all my fault

457
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,150
that you're going through this.

458
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,910
Thankfully, you weren't there.

459
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,350
Even if you were,

460
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,720
my mother would not acknowledge
our relationship.

461
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,870
It will only make it difficult for you.

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,110
I thought about it.

463
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,150
Even if she disagrees,

464
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,560
I will fight to the end.

465
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,080
No.

466
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,590
I don't want you to argue with them

467
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,560
because of me.

468
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,590
I want them

469
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,760
to acknowledge our love.

470
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,800
I will try my best

471
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,760
to have them acknowledge me.

472
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,670
It's going to be fine.

473
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,630
Mrs. Xu.

474
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm here to apologize.

475
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,590
Can you still read?

476
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,240
He's already at the door.

477
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,190
Do you think it's right
to not let him in?

478
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,240
What will the neighbors think?

479
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,110
Whatever.

480
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm not meeting him no matter what.

481
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,240
Let's eat.

482
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,350
I'm not eating.

483
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
You're heartless.

484
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,630
The kid is still at the door.

485
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,110
He's been there the whole morning.

486
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,080
If he wants to stand there, let him be.

487
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,720
Do you want our neighbors

488
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,320
to make fun of us?

489
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,040
Tell him I won't meet him.

490
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,110
Mr. Xu.

491
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,390
Jin.

492
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Don't wait here.

493
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,670
Go home.

494
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,670
I know her attitude.

495
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,080
She's not going to see you today.

496
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,590
Listen to me.

497
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,830
Go home now.

498
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,830
It's okay, Mr. Xu.

499
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,110
I just want to use my actions

500
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,430
to show her my sincerity,

501
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,480
so she will know

502
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,520
that I can look after Xu Lai.

503
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,520
I hope that Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu

504
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,870
can give me a chance to be assessed.

505
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,320
We must be cautious about Xu Lai's future.

506
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,830
Right?

507
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,560
Yes.

508
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,430
Why don't you go back today?

509
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,800
Come back when she is in a better mood,

510
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,110
all right?

511
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,110
Okay.

512
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,760
So, I'll...

513
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,320
Look at you.

514
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,870
I'll leave them at the door.

515
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,590
I'll leave them at the door.

516
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,150
Leave them here.

517
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,320
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

Hello.

522
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,040
Is there anything?

523
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,150
Nothing.

524
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm looking for someone.

525
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,720
Who are you looking for?

526
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
The captain of the fire brigade,

527
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,190
Jin Shichuan.

528
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,190
You're looking for Shichuan?

529
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,480
You are...

530
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm Xu Chengyun,

531
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,800
a friend of Jin Shichuan.

532
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,390
You must be his leader.

533
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,480
I'm the commissioner of

534
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,830

535
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:06,760
Commissioner.

536
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,520
Hello.

537
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,520
Shichuan is over there.

538
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,150
Let me call him here.

539
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,870
It's okay.

540
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,110
I don't want him to know that I'm here.

541
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,000
I just wanted to come here
to have a look

542
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,870
at how Jin is doing

543
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
in life, at work,

544
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,480
and how he is getting along with others.

545
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,870
Do you think Jin is a reliable person?

546
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,430
Of course.

547
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,910
Definitely.

548
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,190
Shichuan is a good captain.

549
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,080
He's also an ambitious young man.

550
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,240
Shichuan is responsible.

551
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,040
He is excellent at work, trustworthy

552
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,390
and values friendship too.

553
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,480
There was a female reporter.

554
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,150
She has the same surname as yours.

555
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,150
Xu.

556
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,800
Ms. Xu was kidnapped and Shichuan was the one

557
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,430
who saved her with his life.

558
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,630
Did you say the girl called Xu

559
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,000
whom he rescued was kidnapped?

560
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,760
Yes.

561
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,240
At that time,

562
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,670
Shichuan's leg was injured

563
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,240
and it was pretty bad.

564
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,190
But when he knew about it,

565
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,870
he ignored his injury

566
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,350
and rescued the girl with his life.

567
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,830
What do you think about this kid?

568
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Good.

569
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,830
I think Jin is not bad.

570
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,150
He's a responsible person.

571
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,560
You see.

572
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:34,951
I could already tell

573
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,320
when he came to our house
to show his sincerity.

574
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,760
He is patient and determined.

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,240
Just like how I was back then.

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,430
He is kind and upright.

577
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,910
I think

578
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,520
we can leave our girl

579
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,240
in his hands.

580
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,590
Why don't we give him a chance?

581
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,590
Observe and understand him.

582
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,670
What is there to understand?

583
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,350
I've understood you well enough

584
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,960
for the many years being with you.

585
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,480
This...

586
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,040
We're talking about our daughter.

587
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,390
Why are you talking about me?

588
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,280
It's because he's just the same as you.

589
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,040
You left me alone when I was pregnant for months.

590
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,280
You didn't even call me.

591
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,670
I can't let my daughter

592
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
marry someone like you.

593
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,430
You have no time for family,

594
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,520
and your work is so dangerous.

595
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,430
If something were to happen,

596
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,630
Xu Lai would be the one to suffer.

597
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,390
Yes. It was my fault

598
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,630
but this is between the two of us.

599
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,630
You can't affect the kids' happiness.

600
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,430
I have been trying to make up

601
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,590
for what I owe you.

602
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,720
When are you going to

603
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,480
stop digging into the past?

604
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,240
Make up?

605
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,630
Can you really make it up?

606
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,240
I'm telling you, Xu Chengyun.

607
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,430
I will never forgive you
for what you did back then.

608
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,320
Move aside.

609
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,720
I'm watching TV.

610
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,830
You...

611
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,000
You're being unreasonable.

612
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,390
Go away if I'm unreasonable.

613
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,760
Why are you waiting here?

614
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,520
Go!

615
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,480
Get out of my sight.

616
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,110
You are always asking me to leave.

617
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,240
Do you think I won't?

618
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,670
Leave.

619
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,000
I'll leave today!

620
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,560
Go!

621
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,750
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital)

622
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,660
(Dr. Zang, please go this way)

623
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,800
Dr. Zang.

624
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,960
What are you doing?

625
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,320
Let me show you some magic tricks.

626
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,590
Look at my ring.

627
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,080
Do you want to touch it?

628
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,110
No.

629
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,670
I have another trick.

630
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,800
Watch this.

631
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,720
Nothing here, right?

632
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,320
Nothing.

633
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,480
How is it?

634
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,830
A heart.

635
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,760
That's so childish.

636
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,430
You're crazy.

637
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,000
Liu.

638
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,520
This is useless.

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,080
I'll deal with you when I get back.

640
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,830
I'm so mad.

641
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,430
Wait. Let me answer a call.

642
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,960
Hello, Mom.

643
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,040
What?

644
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,240
Okay. I'll look for him.

645
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,830
Calm down.

646
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,390
What happened?

647
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,830
My parents fought again.

648
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,590
My father left the house and didn't return home.

649
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,630
His phone is off too.

650
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,760
Don't worry.
We'll look for him together.

651
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,280
Could he be looking for me?

652
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,110
Dad!

653
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,520
Mrs. Xu.

654
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,670
Where is he?

655
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,910
Xu Chengyun.

656
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,800
Not bad.

657
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,240
Do you think you are mature?

658
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,630
How dare you run away from home

659
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,320
and not come back last night.

660
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,760
How is this my fault?

661
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,280
You were the one who chased me out.

662
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,110
Now you're blaming me.

663
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,390
I told you to leave and you went ahead.

664
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,190
Don't come back ever again
if you're that good.

665
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,080
Sure.

666
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,720
I won't be going back.

667
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,040
It's been 20 years

668
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,430
that I've been listening to you nagging.

669
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Today, I'm a free man.

670
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,000
From now on,

671
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll stay at my daughter's place.

672
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,230
Are you rebelling now?

673
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,360
What is the matter with you?

674
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,360
You took my daughter

675
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,000
and now you are taking

676
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
my husband with you.

677
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,040
What drugs did you give them?

678
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,150
What drugs did you give them?

679
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,270
What has this got to do with Jin?

680
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,630
Of course, there is.

681
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,270
Move aside.

682
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,480
Of course, there is.

683
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,310
If it wasn't for him,

684
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,080
the two of you

685
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,960
wouldn't have been against me today.

686
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,150
Mom. What are you trying to do?

687
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,920
Mrs. Xu.

688
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,230
Calm down.

689
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,310
Please don't argue with them

690
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,190
because of me.

691
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,750
Mr. Xu.

692
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,960
Go back with Mrs. Xu.

693
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Are you staying here?

694
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,920
Fine.

695
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,000
I'll stay too.

696
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm not leaving.

697
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,670
I'll stay here.

698
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,670
I'll watch you

699
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,480
so you can't be with this brat here.

700
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm telling you.

701
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,840
Xu Lai. Remember this.

702
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,880
As long as I'm here,

703
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,920
don't even think about being with him.

704
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,150
You're unreasonable.

705
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,790
You want to stay here, right?

706
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,590
Fine.

707
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,080
Both of you stay here.

708
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,790
I'll leave.

709
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,190
Let's go.

710
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,080
Come back!

711
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,790
Are you done?

712
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
No!

713
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,790
Leaving like this

714
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
is going to make your mother angrier.

715
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,480
Why don't you go back?

716
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,670
I'm not going back.

717
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,110
You heard her.

718
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,270
She said she's going to watch me

719
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,670
so we can't be together.

720
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,360
This time, I will stand firm.

721
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,480
I will not give in.

722
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,150
Think about it.

723
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,520
If you leave like this,

724
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,590
it's only going to make things worse

725
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,710
for you and your mother.

726
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Staying there will make it worse.

727
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,710
With my mother's temper,

728
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,360
we'll start arguing again.

729
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,750
Besides, if I am there,

730
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,750
my parents will not make peace.

731
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,270
I'm giving them a chance

732
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,630
to spend time together.

733
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,710
It sounds reasonable.

734
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,110
But I just don't think

735
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,110
this is a good way.

736
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,960
I know my mother's temper.

737
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,400
She won't listen to anything at this time.

738
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,040
So, we need to change our strategy

739
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,270
and go on the offensive.

740
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
When she comes to us,

741
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,000
we'll have a chance to talk.

742
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,790
We can then convince her

743
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,670
with sincerity and facts.

744
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,000
Perhaps it'll make things easier.

745
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,080
Why do you have so many ideas

746
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,560
in this little head of yours?

747
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,920
You're even using strategies
on your mother.

748
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,750
This is wisdom.

749
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,790
How else do you think I could get you?

750
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,040
Get me?

751
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,840
All right.

752
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,840
If you won't stay here,
