(No Watching The Recording Without My Permission)

22
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,630
We're doing an interview

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,550
with a large-scale
cold chain logistics firm in the city.

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,790
I've spoken to the person in charge.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,070
Take someone with you there now.

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,190
I'll get to it.

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,470
I'll go with her.

28
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,230
You want to go too?

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,590
Chief.

30
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,470
You can't always be so biased,

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,550
assigning every piece of news to Xu Lai.

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
If I go with her,

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,950
I can support her.

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,070
Anyway,

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,470
Xu Lai doesn't have

36
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,390
a cameraman, right?

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,230
Zhou worked with her before.

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,110
They know each other.

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,270
Right, Zhou?

40
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,750
Ms. Xu.

41
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,190
I can be the cameraman.

42
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,150
Alright then. You guys go ahead.

43
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,110
Okay.

44
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,870
Ms. Xin.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,350
You knew

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,790
Ms. Xu and I fell out

47
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,670
previously.

48
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,710
I don't care if you two get along

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,550
or not.

50
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,710
From now on,
we'll fight for every piece of news

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,670
that she gets.

52
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,710
Xu Lai said it.

53
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,630
When she becomes the Chief,

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,710
the first thing she'd do is to kick

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,870
you and me out.

56
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,670
Don't forget.

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,390
You and I are on the same boat.

58
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,630
If I fall,

59
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,950
you'll suffer too.

60
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,430
It's you.

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,750
Did Huo Yanzong

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,870
find you last night?

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,910
You asked him to come?

64
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,630
Yes.

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,270
So it was just my wishful thinking.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,350
Huo Yanzong does care about you.

67
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,550
I went to see the client today

68
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,030
to settle the damages

69
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,230
caused by your turning down the job.

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,310
They said

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,790
Huo Yanzong had paid

72
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,550
the compensation.

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,550
I later found out

74
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,590
that he actually paid off

75
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,070
the compensation fees
for other brands too.

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,990
I asked him about it,

77
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,110
but he said

78
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,350
not to tell you.

79
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,110
He only did that

80
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,110
so he could feel better.

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,230
He's used to using money as a solution.

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,710
That's never changed.

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,430
How come your house is so clean today?

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,950
Did you clean it?

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,950
Don't tell me Mr. Huo cleaned it.

86
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,230
See what I just said?

87
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,870
He really does care about you.

88
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,070
I'm over him.

89
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm not going back.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,190
By the way,

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,670
prepare the materials.

92
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,350
I want to make an announcement

93
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,470
about my breakup with Huo Yanzong.

94
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,830
And that

95
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,190
I'm officially leaving Yunkai Group.

96
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,950
Hello.

97
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,750
I heard the cold storage here

98
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,230
is mainly used to store edibles.

99
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,750
Can I take a look around?

100
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,510
Ms. Xu.

101
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,270
No problem.

102
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,950
What would you like to see?

103
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,390
I can give you a tour.

104
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,910
Let's check the freezers first.

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,070
Sure.

106
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,270
Zhou.

107
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,230
I'm going to the freezers.

108
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,590
You go take some b-roll
related to logistics

109
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,230
at the monitoring room.

110
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,070
We'll work separately.

111
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,150
Will do, Ms. Xu.

112
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,310
Zheng.

113
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,030
Please go with Zhou.

114
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,830
Okay.

115
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,670
- Ms. Xu.
- Mr. Zhou.

116
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,590
Come this way.

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,950
This is basically our integrated

118
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,550
platform.

119
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,990
Doing an interview

120
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,470
at such a huge place?

121
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,990
My legs are sore from walking.

122
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,590
Where are you going?

123
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,750
I...

124
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,190
Where is Xu Lai?

125
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,870
Ms. Xu went to the freezers

126
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,150
with the person in charge.

127
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,230
Freezers?

128
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,670
Where are the freezers?

129
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,310
That way.

130
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,830
Follow me.

131
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,950
Here we are.

132
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,430
Ms. Xu.

133
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,630
This is one

134
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,950
of our large freezers.

135
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,110
All the frozen goods that arrive

136
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,230
are stored here to be distributed.

137
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,750
Our company...

138
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,630
Excuse me.

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,190
Hello?

140
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,870
Yes, it's me.

141
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,270
Okay.

142
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,910
I'll be right there.

143
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,270
Ms. Xu.

144
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,510
I'm very sorry.

145
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,510
Something urgent came up.

146
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,990
I'm afraid I have to leave you.

147
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,910
You are free

148
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,030
to take photos.

149
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,510
But do not close the door.

150
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,110
The temperature inside is very low.

151
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,950
I've notified

152
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,670
the staff.

153
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,350
You can contact them

154
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,870
if you need anything, okay?

155
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,750
Okay, thanks. You go ahead.

156
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,310
Okay, see you around.

157
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,630
Hello.

158
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,590
Can I go inside

159
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,910
to see the condition?

160
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,150
The supervisor has informed us.

161
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,190
Go ahead.

162
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,030
Thanks.

163
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,910
What's up with Xu Lai?

164
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,350
What's so interesting about this place?

165
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,110
It's so cold and dry.

166
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,510
(The last thing you want)

167
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,630
(is for me
to become the Chief, right?)

168
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,870
(When I become the Chief,)

169
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,710
(the first thing I'd do)

170
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,390
(is to kick you out of the team.)

171
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,710
Look here. This is the output chain.

172
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,110
Freezer trucks

173
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,870
transport the frozen goods
out from here.

174
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,070
The input chain is where frozen goods

175
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,390
are received to be stored.

176
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,950
Our efficiency

177
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,710
greatly improved

178
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,790
with a standardized

179
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,790
logistics system.

180
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,230
Human labor is also reduced.

181
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,990
We are able to have accurate information

182
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,550
of our inventory.

183
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,430
Look.

184
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,470
Anyone there?

185
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,110
Hello?

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
(Cannot be opened from the inside.
Safety first. Avoid chill)

187
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,030
What do I do?

188
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,310
Anyone there?

189
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,550
Ms. Xin.

190
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,230
Did you see Ms. Xu?

191
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,270
Why are you looking for her?

192
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,830
She's probably

193
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,670
gone back.

194
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,270
She didn't tell me.

195
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,950
She's a busy person.
She has no time for you.

196
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,550
You're nobody to her.

197
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,030
Head home if you're done.

198
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,030
That's weird. How come the door

199
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,910
is closed?

200
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,610
(Cannot be opened from the inside.
Safety first. Avoid chill)

201
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,100
(Cannot be opened from the inside.
Safety first. Avoid chill)

202
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,470
Come here.

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,430
The reporter is still here.

204
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,350
She's lost consciousness.

205
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,630
Call an ambulance!

206
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,790
Hey, wake up.

207
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,870
Wake up.

208
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,590
Wake up!

209
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,330
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital.
Inpatient Department)

210
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,710
What are you doing here?

211
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,910
Why can't I be here?

212
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
Do you feel unwell?

213
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,230
Are you cold?

214
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,710
How did you get locked inside?

215
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,510
I asked the staff.

216
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,950
They said they didn't close the door.

217
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,070
I don't quite remember.

218
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,830
But I know

219
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,390
when I went in,

220
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,110
the door was open.

221
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,550
After that, I found the door locked.

222
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,830
Maybe it accidentally closed.

223
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,110
But the staff told me

224
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,630
that the door
can only be closed from the outside.

225
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,310
I don't think

226
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,270
it's an accident.

227
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,070
Think.

228
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
Was there anyone else?

229
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,550
At the time, the person in charge

230
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,710
accompanied me there.

231
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,630
But he left when we got

232
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,350
to the entrance.

233
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,920
(Commissar)

234
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,230
Hello, Commissar.

235
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,070
(Shichuan.)

236
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,310
(I have something important)

237
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,990
(to tell you.)

238
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,150
The headquarters has decided to have you

239
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,910
work there for a year.

240
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,990
The assignment is effective immediately.

241
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,510
(The headquarters
is located next to Huaigang,)

242
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,790
(but you should still prepare yourself)

243
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,390
(for this assignment.)

244
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,150
(Alright?)

245
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,750
Okay.

246
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,310
Have you guys heard?

247
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,390
Xu Lai got hurt.

248
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,630
I know.

249
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,950
It happened at the cold storage.

250
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,910
Xu Lai was locked in a freezer

251
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,990
and almost lost her life.

252
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,350
That's terrible.

253
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,430
Thank goodness she was found.

254
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,830
I don't want to think
what could've happened otherwise.

255
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,710
What's up, Zhou?

256
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,230
Sorry?

257
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,550
Didn't you go there with Ms. Xu?

258
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,870
Weren't you two working together?

259
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,590
No... We weren't.

260
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,990
Really?

261
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,310
Ms. Xin.

262
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,630
Can I talk to you?

263
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,430
Well then...

264
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,950
You carry on.

265
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,630
Okay.

266
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,710
You saw Ms. Xu

267
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,070
at the cold storage that day,
didn't you?

268
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,670
I told you.

269
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,310
I didn't see her.

270
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,030
I heard

271
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,790
she was locked in the freezer.

272
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,070
I didn't go that far

273
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,070
onto the ground.

274
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,870
So I had no idea

275
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,630
she got locked inside.

276
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,150
You liar.

277
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,790
You did see her.

278
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,990
And you even purposely closed the door.

279
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,030
You can't simply
make accusations like that.

280
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,550
Do you have proof?

281
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,190
Don't you know what you did

282
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,190
could've gotten her killed?

283
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,870
That's a human life.

284
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,670
You better not run your mouth.

285
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,750
Think about the consequences
you have to bear.

286
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,910
Do you want all your efforts

287
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,150
to go to waste?

288
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,070
Besides,

289
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,710
so what if it was me?

290
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,550
Aside from Xu Lai,

291
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,950
only you and I were there.

292
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,030
If both of us don't talk,

293
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,470
who else would know?

294
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,430
So just keep your mouth shut.

295
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,630
Give me the footage you got.

296
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,670
I'll be sure to reward you.

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,060
(Inpatient Department)

298
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,190
The discharge paper has been signed.

299
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,350
You can leave now.

300
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,510
Get up.

301
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,030
Are you leaving or not?

302
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,550
But I can't get up.

303
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,390
I need help.

304
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:26,870
Actually, staying in the hospital

305
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,950
isn't so bad.

306
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,710
Because you're here to accompany me.

307
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,990
Don't get hurt again.

308
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,830
Don't make me worry about you.

309
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,390
Then you have to promise

310
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,190
you won't get hurt either.

311
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,030
What does that mean?

312
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,590
It means I promise

313
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,670
not to get hurt.

314
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,350
Now, get up.

315
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,310
Aren't you too old

316
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,070
to laze in bed?

317
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,030
Zhou?

318
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,830
Why hide

319
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,510
when you already made the trip?

320
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,630
Because

321
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,550
I can't bring myself to face you.

322
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,230
Ms. Xu.

323
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,710
Actually,

324
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,910
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

325
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,270
It's okay if you won't forgive me.

326
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,550
I had...

327
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,190
Zhou.

328
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,310
I accept your apology.

329
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,350
But you should know

330
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,990
that a sorry

331
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,990
won't change the fact.

332
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,870
Actually, the one
you should apologize to

333
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,750
isn't me.

334
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,310
But to you yourself.

335
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,150
Do you still remember?

336
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,550
When you first came to the station,

337
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,870
you told me

338
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,790
the reason why you chose
to work at a TV station

339
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,270
and become a cameraman

340
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,670
was that you wanted to be

341
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,670
an honest chronicler.

342
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,510
To capture honest and truthful news

343
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,870
through the camera.

344
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,310
To help

345
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,270
every person in need.

346
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,710
Do you still remember what you said?

347
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,430
Yes, I do.

348
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,470
But the choice you made

349
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,310
let yourself down.

350
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,710
It let the once

351
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,150
hopeful and pure you down.

352
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,110
Making a mistake isn't scary.

353
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,550
What's scary
is continuing to make mistakes.

354
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,430
Ultimately losing yourself.

355
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,110
I hope you find

356
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,790
your old self again.

357
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,510
It's not too late.

358
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:04,950
Let's go.

359
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,390
Done talking?

360
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,870
I waited so long.

361
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,190
It was boring.

362
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,630
Why don't you have a chat with me?

363
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,830
Okay.

364
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,270
Do you know how long one centimeter is?

365
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,270
How about one meter?

366
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,430
One meter.

367
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,230
One meter?

368
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,630
One meter is this long.

369
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,150
Keep still.

370
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,630
You set me up.

371
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,910
Let's go.

372
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,950
I heard from Captain Jin

373
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,510
that Liu Xu is leaving the team soon.

374
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,990
Since I just got discharged,

375
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,270
I thought to treat everyone

376
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,430
to a meal.

377
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,790
I wish to thank everyone

378
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,470
for the care you've shown me.

379
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,670
The rule for you is no alcohol.

380
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,070
So I'll drink this myself.

381
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,350
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

382
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,390
- Nice.
- Great.

383
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,950
Welcome back, Ms. Xu.

384
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,590
It's what we should do.

385
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,310
Yeah.

386
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,870
If Ms. Xu is happy, so is Captain Jin.

387
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,470
When Captain is happy, so are we.

388
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,430
Anyway, I'd consider Xu Lai

389
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,190
a member of the team.

390
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,550
She's gone through hell and back

391
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,550
with Captain many times.

392
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,870
Right, we are comrades who went through

393
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,070
thick and thin together.

394
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
I suggest we drink to that.

395
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,990
- Come.
- Great.

396
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,110
Captain Jin.

397
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,830
I have a favor to ask of Xu Lai.

398
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,470
Xu Lai, let's go.

399
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,990
- Come on. Eat.
- Dig in.

400
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,270
I thought about it a long time.

401
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,270
I could only ask you for help.

402
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,390
What do you plan to record?

403
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,710
I'd like to record

404
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,470
a message

405
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,430
for each of my brothers in arms.

406
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,190
Like a farewell message.

407
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,190
Alright. Everything is set.

408
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,910
Later, press this button

409
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,030
and it will start recording.

410
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,950
This red button?

411
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,550
Yes.

412
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,510
Okay.

413
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,390
Go ahead then.

414
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,430
Return it to me once you're done.

415
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,430
Thank you.

416
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,230
You're welcome.

417
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,630
Liu Xu.

418
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,870
I want to record something too.

419
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,670
Do you know how?

420
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,110
I can do it. Xu Lai taught me.

421
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,950
I'll start it.

422
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,710
Three.

423
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,790
Two.

424
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,030
One.

425
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,030
I can manage by myself.

426
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,990
Xu Lai.

427
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,990
When you see

428
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,830
this video...

429
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,670
I'm going.

430
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,990
By the way,

431
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,150
Liu Xu said you recorded something

432
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,950
for me.

433
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,310
What did you say?

434
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,190
You want to know?

435
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,830
I'm not telling you.

436
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,070
It's a secret.

437
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,510
Listen.

438
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,430
Although the tape is in

439
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,190
your safekeeping,

440
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,750
you're not allowed to watch it

441
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,990
without my permission.

442
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,110
You're being so mysterious.

443
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,710
Fine, I won't look.

444
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,910
I'll go then.

445
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm really going.

446
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,830
Hold on.

447
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,790
There's one more step.

448
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,950
Okay, rest early.

449
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll video call later.

450
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,950
Bye-bye.

451
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:02,870
(Footage of the freezers)

452
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,630
(Zhou Tingwei.)

453
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,510
(You've passed
the probationary assessment,)

454
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,950
(with recommendation
from the Chief.)

455
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,950
You can go ahead and
switch to permanent employment.

456
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,510
(Making a mistake isn't scary.)

457
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,750
(What's scary
is continuing to make mistakes.)

458
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,750
(Ultimately losing yourself.)

459
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,670
(Zhou.)

460
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,150
(I hope you find)

461
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,390
(your old self again.)

462
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,390
(It's not too late.)

463
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,350
(Ms. Xu Lai.)

464
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,790
(I know what I have to do now.)

465
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,048
(Footage of the freezers, sent)

466
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,510
Zhou.

467
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,190
Why haven't you

468
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,310
sent me the footage
from the freezers?

469
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,270
Did you forget?

470
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,310
I'm not going to send you the footage.

471
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,830
What do you mean?

472
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,990
I urge you to turn yourself in.

473
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,030
What about I get you fired

474
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,990
from the TV station?

475
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,950
I'm warning you.

476
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,830
It won't be just the TV station.

477
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,590
I'll make sure you'll never have a place

478
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,510
in this industry.

479
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,470
I was scared before.

480
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,430
But not anymore.

481
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,910
I've already committed

482
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,710
a lot of mistakes.

483
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,910
I will not continue making them.

484
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,550
Even if that means I get fired
from the TV station,

485
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,990
or I'd never get to be
a cameraman again,

486
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,230
I will not wallow in the mire

487
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,310
with a person like you again.

488
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,790
We are having a meeting

489
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,110
in half an hour.

490
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,750
I have something important to announce.

491
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,230
Ms. Jiang, are you okay?

492
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,950
I'm fine.

493
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,110
Don't mind me.

494
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,230
The management has unanimously agreed

495
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,510
to assign Xu Lai

496
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,950
as the new Chief.

497
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,870
Thanks, everyone,

498
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,110
for your trust and support.

499
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,030
Moving forward,

500
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,350
I will continue to work hard

501
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,870
and uphold the spirit of journalism.

502
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,430
Good or bad, let's do our best together.

503
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,110
Excuse me. While I get this call,

504
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:42,950
Xu Lai,

505
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,710
you chair the meeting.

506
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,830
Okay.

507
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,950
Jiang Xin.

508
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,830
Wait a minute.

509
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,230
I have something else to say.

510
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,790
That's shocking.

511
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,630
It was her.

512
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,630
How could she do it?

513
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,310
I can't believe it.

514
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,830
Yeah.

515
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,230
The footage is edited.

516
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,550
Don't believe Xu Lai.

517
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,870
She's deliberately framing me.

518
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,990
Ms. Xin really went too far.

519
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,710
I've sent

520
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,910
a copy of the video to the police.

521
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,070
True or not,

522
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,270
the police will decide.

523
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,150
As the Chief,

524
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,230
I have something else

525
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,230
to announce today.

526
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,470
Jiang Xin.

527
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,910
You are suspended.

528
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,070
On what grounds?

529
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,550
You're abusing your power
for personal reasons.

530
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,350
Xu Lai.

531
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,550
You think

532
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,390
you can decide what happens to me

533
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,230
just because you're now the Chief?

534
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,510
You went against professional ethics

535
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,750
and even broke the law.

536
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,470
This time,

537
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,110
no one can save you.

538
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,710
You better cooperate with the police.

539
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,310
Officer.

540
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,870
She is Jiang Xin.

541
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,390
We received a report.

542
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,710
The victim provided evidence

543
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,510
of your intention to cause bodily harm.

544
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,470
We need you to come with us

545
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,590
to be investigated.

546
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,750
Cause bodily harm?

547
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,990
Who said I hurt anybody?

548
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,030
I didn't harm anyone.

549
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,830
Take her.

550
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,790
I didn't harm anyone.

551
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,310
I didn't harm anyone!

552
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,990
Please cooperate.

553
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,590
I didn't harm anyone!

554
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,910
I didn't harm anyone!

555
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,950
Let me go!

556
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,790
I didn't harm anyone!

557
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,990
What's next for you?

558
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,470
I'm going to start over.

559
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,350
I will bear what I should bear.

560
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,630
And face what I should face.

561
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,230
I'll get back

562
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,790
onto the right road.

563
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,390
Thank you, Ms. Xu,

564
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,990
for giving me the courage to start over.

565
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,550
The road ahead is long.

566
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,470
I wish you all the best.

567
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,030
I am Intern Zhou.

568
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,950
My internship period is officially over.

569
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,190
Goodbye, Ms. Xu.

570
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,470
Goodbye, Zhou.

in this earthquake relief operation,

573
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,790
following a discussion
at the headquarters,

574
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,470
Comrade Jin Shichuan will be assigned

575
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,670
to join the headquarters for training
for one year.

576
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,390
During this time,

577
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,190
Comrade Lu Fangqi

578
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,190
will take on the duty

579
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,430
as the acting captain

580
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,190
and manage
the First Brigade's operations.

581
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,630
Yes, sir.

582
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,910
From now on, you are the captain.

583
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,710
The members will look toward you.

584
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,550
As the role model,

585
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,310
you'll be the one

586
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,150
shouldering the responsibilities
at First Brigade.

587
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,750
But don't forget about your back injury

588
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,550
while you're shouldering.

589
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,750
Don't overdo it.

590
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,230
Don't worry, Captain Jin.

591
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,310
Do your best.

592
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,910
Lead them well.

593
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,790

Because I miss you.

637
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,230
I have something to tell you.

638
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,990
I also have a piece of good news

639
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,630
to tell you.

640
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,990
Today, I've officially

641
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,950
been appointed as the Chief.

642
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,230
Congrats.

643
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,590
And on my first day in the new role,

644
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,550
the first thing I did

645
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,870
was to suspend Jiang Xin.

646
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,310
What did you want to tell me?

647
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,710
I received an order from my superior.

648
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,750
I've been reassigned to
the fire and rescue headquarters

649
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,670
for a year.

650
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,750
When are you leaving?

651
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,870
Next week.

652
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,470
That soon?

653
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,390
I was going to tell you

654
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,270
at the hospital.

655
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,590
But I worried it might affect you.

656
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,510
Moreover, I hadn't received

657
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,110
the official order.

658
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,430
So I didn't tell you.

659
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,270
So you're telling me
right before you leave?

660
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,110
I didn't mean to do it now.

661
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,750
I never planned

662
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,550
to keep it from you.

663
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,990
But

664
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,390
after you were discharged,

665
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,150
you were so busy with work.

666
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,110
I couldn't find the chance.

667
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,390
And I worried you'd get angry.

668
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,270
It's too late. I am angry.

669
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,470
Let me explain.

670
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,110
Let me explain, okay?

671
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,950
Stop following me.

672
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,190
Did he really leave
just because I told him to?

673
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,070
Calling.

674
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,630
(Calling.)

675
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,870

679

Please give me a chance, madam.

683
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,830
Tell me what you did wrong.

684
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,790
I was wrong
not to inform you straight away

685
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,870
about what happened.

686
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,950
I failed to keep

687
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,150
the rule you had set.

688
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,510

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,910
There's plenty of time to practice.

756
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,470
But there's no way I am fine

757
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,710
with just listening to you
but not seeing you.

758
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,950
You're breaking the rules.

759
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,270
I'm going to do something even worse.

760
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,910
Let me hold you a while longer.

761
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,350
I won't be able to

762
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,190
for some months.

763
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,310
Jin Shichuan.

764
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,270
I woke up early

765
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,750
so I made breakfast.

766
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,830
You're so nice.

767
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,630
A heart-shaped fried egg.

768
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,630
I never knew

769
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,910
you are so romantic.

770
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,990
I stayed the night

771
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,270
at your place.

772
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,150
I should repay the kindness.

773
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,750
Try it.

774
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,270
Sweet.

775
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,150
I wish

776
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,550
I could eat the breakfast you make
every day.

777
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,350
But I have to control myself.

778
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,990
Or else, I'd just miss you even more.

779
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,030
I have a few days off
before the reassignment.

780
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,230
I can keep you company.

781
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,270
Really?

782
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,870
Then let's go shopping.

783
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,990
I can help you buy the things

784
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,190
you need in another city.

785
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,350
As you wish.

786
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,340
(Huaigang Medical University Hospital.
Inpatient Department)

787
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,470
Where are you

788
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,470
sending these first aid guides?

789
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,670
They're for the fire station.

790
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,510
I just counted them

791
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,550
and will deliver them in a bit.

792
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,110
I have the afternoon shift off.

793
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,990
I can do it for you.

794
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:00,990
Saves you the trouble

795
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,910
of commuting.

796
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,790
Doctor Zang.

797
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,590
Are you sure you're not going there
to see your boyfriend?

798
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,150
I'm so jealous.

799
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,150
How I wish

800
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,990
I had such a thoughtful boyfriend too.

801
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,470
Who said I'm going to look for him?

802
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,870
It's because it's on the way.

803
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:21,990
Bean.

804
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,390
Bean!

805
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,310
Lu Fangqi.

806
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,830
Your goddess is here.

807
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,270
What are you doing here?

808
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,630
I came to deliver the first aid guides.

809
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,790
They're so heavy.

810
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,190
Are your hands okay?

811
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,750
They're fine.

812
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:46,750
Next time,

813
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,870
tell me if there's anything.

814
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,710
I'll go and get it.

815
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,430
You need your hands to do surgery.

816
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,790
They must be looked after.

817
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,590
Does he look like it?

818
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,710
- Look like what?
- Look like what?

819
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,390
Does Lu Fangqi look like

820
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,550
his dog, Coal?

821
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,390
Come on. That's so mean.

822
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,950
Throw the ball for me.

823
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,070
Okay.

824
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,430
Coal.

825
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,110
Go!

826
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,670
Liu Xu.

827
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,830
Help me look after Coal.

828
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,310
I'll take Doctor Zang

829
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,310
on a tour of the station.

830
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,710
Okay. Go ahead.

831
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,150

your lovey-doveyness anyway.
