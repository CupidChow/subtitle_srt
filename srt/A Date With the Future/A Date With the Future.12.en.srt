(This Kiss Is A Direct Attack)

18
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:49,122
(I think)

19
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,922
(I messed everything up this time.)

20
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,402
(Peace.)

21
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,202
(What should I do?)

22
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:06,361
(Hello.)

23
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,602
(The number you've dialed is...)

24
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,241
Ms. Xu, Chief wants to have a meeting.

25
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:24,322
Tell him I'm taking the day off.

26
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,121
I have to go somewhere.

27
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:26,722
But...

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
(Go through fire and water,
Serve the people whole-heartedly)

29
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,202
Lu Fangqi.

30
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:36,801
Where is Jin Shichuan?

31
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:38,002
Captain Jin is inside.

32
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:38,961
We just finished training.

33
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,282
Listen.

34
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:42,282
Since he came back

35
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:43,162
from that interview,

36
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:44,442
he has been very moody.

37
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:45,762
Today is his day off.

38
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,801
Go talk some sense into him.

39
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,561
I'm glad you're here, Ms. Xu.

40
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:50,641
Better go check

41
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,521
how he's doing.

42
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:58,641
Jin Shichuan!

43
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:03,121
Let's go.

44
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,162
Jin Shichuan!

45
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,002
What happened?

46
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,121
You won't answer my calls
nor reply to my messages.

47
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,762
Can you just tell me what's wrong?

48
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,722
What did Huo do wrong?

49
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,482
I'm talking to you.

50
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:20,322
I don't have anything to say.

51
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:22,042
Jin Shichuan.

52
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,162
Are you okay? Did you sprain your ankle?

53
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,081
Not okay.

54
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:32,361
Do you know

55
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,081
my mind's been a mess

56
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,081
because of you the past two days?

57
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,282
Can't you just tell me?

58
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,002
What exactly is the problem?

59
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:42,042
Are you

60
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,202
going to marry Huo Yanzong?

61
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,002
Marry Huo Yanzong?

62
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:47,282
Answer me first.

63
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,681
Of course not.

64
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:49,641
He's my friend.

65
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,401
Are you really not marrying him?

66
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:56,641
No way.

67
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:59,882
Since the beginning, I, Xu Lai,

68
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:01,922
have only wanted you, Jin Shichuan.

69
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:12,841
So you got angry

70
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,442
because of this that day?

71
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,282
No.

72
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,402
Why didn't you just ask me?

73
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,441
Were you so scared

74
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:22,602
I was going to marry another guy?

75
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,402
I was not.

76
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:28,842
Who would've thought

77
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,361
the esteemed Captain Jin

78
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:31,761
is actually Mr. Jealous?

79
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:33,842
No, I'm not.

80
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:34,681
You are.

81
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:37,842
I'm not.

82
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,282
Mr. Jealous.

83
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,881
Mr. Jealous.

84
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,001
Mr. Jealous.

85
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,042
Now you've turned me into a mess.

86
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,962
Whenever I faced dangerous situations,

87
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,441
I could always deal with them calmly.

88
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,162
But with you, I can't.

89
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:37,681
You are definitely my outlier.

90
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,042
My foot is injured.

91
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,282
I can't ride my motorbike.

92
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,642
I'll send you back.

93
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,321
You know how to ride it?

94
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:53,962
I can even drive fire trucks.

95
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,082
No vehicle is too hard for me.

96
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,602
You're really an all-rounder.

97
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,042
What don't you know?

98
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,121
Am I heavy?

99
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,602
I climb up ten floors
with weights every day.

100
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:05,441
Carrying you is no problem at all.

101
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:26,842
The key.

102
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:28,761
The key.

103
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,042
Can you really drive?

104
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:43,801
You already

105
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,962
gave yourself to me, right?

106
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:46,722
Just sit tight.

107
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:48,962
Hold onto my waist.

108
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:41,642
(In the past, I used to wonder)

109
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,162
(what happiness is.)

110
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,922
(How long is its validity?)

111
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:48,722
(I thought happiness)

112
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,162
(was momentary.)

113
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,962
(As brief as a firework display.)

114
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,001
(Quickly forgotten.)

115
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,042
(Now,)

116
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,282
(I seem to have
finally found the answer.)

117
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:04,681
(Happiness is having anticipation.)

118
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,522
(To constantly reminisce the moments.)

119
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:10,722
(Just like many years later,)

120
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:12,561
(I would think back of the time)

121
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,522
(Jin Shichuan rode a motorbike)

122
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:17,962
(on an unremarkable afternoon)

123
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,082
(with me at the back.)

124
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:22,761
(Every time I think about it,)

125
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,642
(I'd feel the happiness.)

126
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:29,361
(Full of anticipation for the future.)

127
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:46,042
This is the revenue data of TC

128
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:46,882
for this quarter.

129
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,242
Compared to last quarter,

130
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,002
the overall net profit income

131
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:50,961
increased by 0.4 times.

132
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,122
The reason

133
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,321
we were able to achieve this

134
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,321
was mainly due

135
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:54,841
to the company's

136
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,081
newly launched product.

137
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,242
The mobile refrigerator.

138
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,081
Please look at the slides.

139
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,002
I've seen the quarterly report.

140
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:05,122
The results are pretty good.

141
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,481
We just purchased the mobile
refrigerator company last year.

142
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,362
The group thought
it would incur a huge loss.

143
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,601
Who knew that with your efforts,

144
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:13,841
we managed to turn a profit.

145
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:15,601
Thank you.

146
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,441
It's the result

147
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:18,882
of every senior staff's help.

148
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,362
We tried our best

149
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,601
to minimize production costs,

150
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,402
and push for market exposure

151
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:25,642
to ensure a profit.

152
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:27,841
I believe that having quick turnovers
with minimal profit

153
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:28,681
to gain greater market share

154
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:30,681
is the way to improve overall sales.

155
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,282
In the next quarter, our plan

156
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,762
is to expand production
and increase marketing.

157
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,522
We wish to attract more customers,

158
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,841
and fight for a bigger share
of the market.

159
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:41,922
Personally,

160
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,441
TC is currently still expanding.

161
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:47,961
We should go for the win.

162
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,601
Naturally, that's only possible

163
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,561
with the group's financial support.

164
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,561
Regarding expanding the production,

165
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:55,201
I think

166
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,081
we shouldn't rush into it.

167
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,601
Better to be cautious.

168
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,242
Mr. Huo.

169
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,042
Is there anything you're worried about?

170
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,081
Sales is important, yes.

171
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:07,402
But it's more important
to stabilize first.

172
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,922
But TC is currently...

173
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,642
At the current stage, attempting

174
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:13,841
to develop new markets

175
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:14,561
is much too early.

176
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:15,681
Wait a bit more.

177
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:19,122
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:21,122
TC made 20 percent of this quarter's profit

179
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,201
for the group.

180
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,362
By reason,

181
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,922
Mr. Huo should've
supported the expansion.

182
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,481
Why was he adverse to it?

183
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,201
Mr. Huo probably has his reasons.

184
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,321
Like what?

185
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:32,801
He must be wary about TC

186
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,162
climbing up too quickly.

187
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:37,642
Let's go.

188
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,162
Sun Lei's proposal is pretty good.

189
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:52,441
Why not let him try?

190
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:55,002
Sun Lei dabbled in mining.

191
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:56,961
There are rumors of him being

192
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,321
too greedy for success.

193
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:01,122
If we give him more support
at this time,

194
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,081
he might get ahead of himself.

195
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,681
A person who crosses the line for profit.

196
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,481
I will not take such risks.

197
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:11,642
Understood.

198
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:14,882
I heard you attended

199
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,441
the show Xu Lai hosted.

200
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,042
Jin Shichuan was there too.

201
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,002
Did you two love rivals

202
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,122
get into a fight?

203
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:23,801
Almost.

204
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:24,922
Seriously?

205
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,441
To be exact,

206
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,042
he was the one who wanted to hit me,

207
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:32,441
but I won.

208
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,961
He wanted to hit you but you won?

209
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,522
How did that happen? Tell me.

210
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,321
I have no time to explain.

211
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:43,002
I have to go.

212
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,201
Where to?

213
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,122
To look for Xu Lai.

214
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,522
The boy's grown wings now.

215
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:51,481
Get lost.

216
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,282
Didn't you hurt your foot?

217
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,242
It's fine now.

218
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,162
Is it?

219
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:19,441
Yeah.

220
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:21,402
That's good.

221
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,201
Watch where you're going next time.

222
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,362
Be careful. Take care of yourself.

223
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,801
I'll be off.

224
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,081
The last kiss was a counter attack.

225
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,321
What about this time?

226
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,162
A direct offense.

227
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,402
I don't know when it began.

228
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,721
But I realized

229
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,561
I've become more worried about you.

230
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,122
More concerned.

231
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,721
The more I wish to kiss you.

232
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:16,402
Hello?

233
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:17,201
(Hey, Captain Jin.)

234
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:18,441
(The unit has an emergency meeting.)

235
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:19,242
(They need you there.)

236
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:20,481
Okay, got it.

237
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,681
There's an emergency meeting.

238
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:23,922
I have to go.

239
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,801
Didn't you go to look for Xu Lai?

240
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,642
Why are you here by yourself?

241
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:19,481
I saw her with

242
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:20,882
Jin Shichuan.

243
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:25,242
Just that?

244
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,282
I'll drink with you.

245
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:28,481
You're quite the drinker.

246
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,081
Here you go.

247
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,081
Go on.

248
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:42,441
That's enough.

249
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,282
Stop drinking!

250
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,481
Stop it.

251
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,801
What's the point of you

252
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:51,642
brooding about it?

253
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:53,762
You should go to Xu Lai

254
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:54,841
and tell her.

255
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,162
Haven't I tried?

256
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,601
I wanted to find the right opportunity.

257
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:05,122
But seems like

258
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,522
I'm always a step too late.

259
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,081
Have you thought about it then?

260
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,481
What if Xu Lai really starts
a relationship

261
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,601
with Jin Shichuan?

262
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,481
Then what?

263
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,042
I'll lose my mind.

264
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:27,321
Then go ahead. No need to hold back.

265
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,601
It'll be too late to stay sane.

266
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,762
The last kiss was a counter attack.

267
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,242
What about this time?

268
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:03,762
A direct offense.

269
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:10,642
(This is bad.)

270
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,321
(We only just parted,)

271
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,321
(and I'm already)

272
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:14,081
(missing you.)

273
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:15,601
(I wish to see you.)

274
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:20,402
(We'll see each other soon.)

275
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,042
He's here?

276
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,801
Huo, what are you doing here?

277
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:37,561
Why?

278
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,721
You seem disappointed to see me.

279
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:41,201
Not so.

280
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,481
Why did you come here so late?

281
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:50,801
Xu Lai.

282
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:53,801
Promise me.

283
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,441
Don't fall in love
with somebody else, okay?

284
00:16:57,522 --> 00:16:58,681
What are you talking about, Huo?

285
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:01,481
Did you drink?

286
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,122
No.

287
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,241
I'm not drunk.

288
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,721
I'm very sober.

289
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,802
What I'm about to say next

290
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:11,481
isn't some drunken nonsense.

291
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,322
And about what I said on the show

292
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:15,122
that day.

293
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:17,441
They're all true.

294
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,241
May I know what your

295
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,362
initial dream is?

296
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,882
And what made you change it?

297
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:26,602
My initial dream

298
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:28,681
was to become a soldier.

299
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,642
But I changed my ambition

300
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,882
because of a girl.

301
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,481
What a lucky girl she is.

302
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:38,922
She made you

303
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,281
give up military service
to go into business.

304
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:41,761
Since we're on the topic,

305
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,521
I'd like to ask Mr. Huo

306
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:44,681
on behalf of all the women out there.

307
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,082
As an accomplished entrepreneur,

308
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,721
what is your criteria for your partner?

309
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,122
My criteria

310
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,441
is someone like you.

311
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:56,961
You jest, Mr. Huo.

312
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,922
Now, let's welcome the actress,

313
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,681
Yu Shishi.

314
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:07,402
Xu Lai.

315
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,001
I've been waiting

316
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:11,922
for the right opportunity

317
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,122
to confess my feelings to you.

318
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,281
But I can't wait anymore.

319
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,041
I can't watch another man

320
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,521
taking you away from me.

321
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:25,562
I love you.

322
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,882
I've loved you for 13 whole years.

323
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:29,922
Long before anyone else loves you.

324
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,402
I've loved you deeper and longer.

325
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,241
Wait a minute, Huo.

326
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:36,602
What exactly are you saying?

327
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:39,602
We grew up together.

328
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:41,041
You are my best friend.

329
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:41,882
You're like a brother to me.

330
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,602
I don't want to be
just friends with you.

331
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,922
Nor am I your brother.

332
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:46,602
Xu Lai.

333
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,362
I'm being serious.

334
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,162
Wake up, Huo!

335
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:55,681
Sorry.

336
00:18:58,642 --> 00:18:59,481
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,402
Can you please go back?

338
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:05,761
I need some time alone.

339
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,602
I know it's hard for you to accept it
right now.

340
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:26,961
But I can wait.

341
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,281
(Are you asleep?)

342
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:14,602
(Goodnight.)

343
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:39,802
I haven't had the chance
to tell her yet.

344
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,721
So I don't know.

345
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,001
I'm scared I might lose her
if I tell her.

346
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:43,922
I might even lose a friend.

347
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:46,521
What? What's with that look?

348
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:47,721
Regretting it?

349
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:50,761
Yes, I am.

350
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:54,842
It's tiring being your friend,

351
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:55,481
you know?

352
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,281
Huo.

353
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:25,602
He confessed to me yesterday.

354
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:28,802
I guessed as much.

355
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,761
You did?

356
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:34,241
You think I'm as dense as you are?

357
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,521
Between you two,

358
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:37,802
one thinks too little,

359
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:38,882
while the other thinks too much.

360
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,082
Were you shocked

361
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:49,201
by Huo's confession?

362
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,441
Actually,

363
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:55,241
I can understand

364
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:56,882
why you've never noticed.

365
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:58,481
For one,

366
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,681
you two grew up together.

367
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:02,281
You've always been more tomboyish.

368
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,681
You probably never thought of Huo

369
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,681
as a male.

370
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:05,961
Secondly,

371
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:08,201
Huo hides his feelings too well.

372
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,041
He's too objective.

373
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,001
Always thinking about this and that.

374
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:12,882
When he was about
to confess his feelings,

375
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:13,842
you went abroad.

376
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,001
Now that you came back,

377
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,001
Jin Shichuan appeared.

378
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:21,642
So,

379
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,441
since when did you know?

380
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:28,082
Since the earthquake.

381
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:30,241
I started suspecting it

382
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:31,322
when he went to look for you
risking his life.

383
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,642
I was sure of it

384
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,281
when he changed his ambition
during the college entrance exam.

385
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:39,681
Huo's dream had always been

386
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:40,882
to be like his father.

387
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:41,721
To be a soldier.

388
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,481
Because he wanted
to go abroad to find you,

389
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:44,842
he made a deal

390
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,481
with his mother to do commerce instead.

391
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:02,001
Hello, Huo.

392
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:09,281
Huo?

393
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,521
What are you doing here?

394
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:14,481
Surprised?

395
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:15,681
I'm shocked.

396
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,602
I applied for the finance major

397
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:18,562
at this college.

398
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:20,481
Finance?

399
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:21,521
Xu Lai.

400
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,521
(Is he your boyfriend?)

401
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:23,761
No.

402
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:26,322
Why are you suddenly doing finance?

403
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:28,882
I was worried about you

404
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:29,521
being here alone,

405
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:30,362
so I came.

406
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:31,882
Are you serious?

407
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:33,882
Let me show you around.

408
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:34,761
Of course not.

409
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:35,562
Come on.

410
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:37,082
Let's go.

411
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,041
Isn't our campus beautiful?

412
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,922
Not bad. Just a little too cold.

413
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:46,721
Anyway,

414
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:48,441
what is your dream?

415
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:50,681
You go first.

416
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,201
Me?

417
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,842
My dream is to be a great

418
00:23:56,842 --> 00:23:58,001
news reporter.

419
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,122
Respected and talented.

420
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:01,802
So good that I'm shining.

421
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,041
That way, I'd be able

422
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,362
to be with equally shining people.

423
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:08,681
What about you?

424
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:12,402
My dream is to...

425
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,281
I have another dream.

426
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,602
It's to find the fireman

427
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,201
who saved me years ago.

428
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,322
You mean the fireman

429
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:24,402
who saved you during the earthquake?

430
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,961
We made a ten-year promise back then.

431
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:29,322
After I grow up,

432
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:31,041
I'm going to look for him.

433
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:32,961
And yours?

434
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:36,521
Mine doesn't matter.

435
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:42,642
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

436
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:44,001
If I had told you,

437
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:44,642
would you not

438
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:45,681
have fallen in love with Jin Shichuan?

439
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,122
I...

440
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:49,721
Xu Lai.

441
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:51,122
I get it.

442
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:52,882
You've been in love
with Jin Shichuan for a long time.

443
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:54,802
But you know what?

444
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:57,281
Huo has loved you even longer.

445
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,602
Before you even met Jin Shichuan,

446
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:01,041
he'd already loved you.

447
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:03,162
He has always

448
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:04,402
been right behind you.

449
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:06,362
Maybe you should

450
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:07,441
take a proper look at him.

451
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:22,562
Listen.

452
00:25:23,162 --> 00:25:25,122
Captain Jin's in a good mood today.

453
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,642
He must have made up

454
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:27,441
with Ms. Xu.

455
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:29,882
I'm guessing that's probably it.

456
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:31,162
You know what?

457
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:32,481
Yesterday, I saw

458
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:33,681
Captain Jin driving Xu Lai
on the motorbike.

459
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:35,681
Xu Lai was holding onto his waist.

460
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:37,961
So intimate?

461
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,281
Could they really be dating?

462
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,241
No wonder

463
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:44,441
Captain's been so...

464
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:47,441
Is it normal

465
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:48,761
for a man in love to be so moody?

466
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:49,961
You're asking me?

467
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:51,441
I'm not in love.

468
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:52,162
How should I know?

469
00:25:55,642 --> 00:25:57,481
I'm so jealous of Captain Jin.

470
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,721
I want to be in love too.

471
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:00,642
Oh, enough with you.

472
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:01,802
You don't even have a target.

473
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:02,642
Who are you going to date?

474
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,241
Who said I have no target?

475
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,041
Who? Who is it? Do I know her?

476
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:09,241
I doubt if you even talked

477
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:10,001
to a lady before.

478
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,362
That female doctor!

479
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:17,882
No wonder you've been

480
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:18,802
frequenting the hospital.

481
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:20,761
So you're pursuing a love interest.

482
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:21,842
Lu Fangqi.

483
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,562
There's nothing
between Doctor Zang and me.

484
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,162
Nothing?

485
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:27,521
But,

486
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:30,241
it's true that I haven't seen
Doctor Zang lately.

487
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:31,882
I wonder if she's doing okay.

488
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:34,961
Squad Leader.

489
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,562
Why don't you punch me?

490
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:37,441
Don't be silly.

491
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:39,602
I have to have a reason

492
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,402
to go see Doctor Zang.

493
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,001
I think you're really sick.

494
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,441
Lovesick.

495
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,362
More like being crazy.

496
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:54,922
Do your jobs properly.

497
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,322
Put this away.

498
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:06,562
I'm off, Captain Jin.

499
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:23,681
Captain Jin.

500
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:26,362
What are you thinking about?

501
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:27,602
Nothing.

502
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:28,882
Captain Jin.

503
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,001
Let's go play basketball.

504
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:31,281
You guys go ahead.

505
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:33,562
We're off then.

506
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:34,281
See you.

507
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,082
Hello, Grandpa.

508
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:38,562
Brat,

509
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:40,001
how long has it been
since you came home?

510
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:43,041
Do you even remember your grandpa?

511
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,201
I've been busy lately.

512
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:46,681
I was setting up the rescue team.

513
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,001
So I was at the training camp.

514
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,481
I don't care if the station captain

515
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,402
is busy.

516
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,521
You're my grandson.

517
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:53,681
I'm formally informing you.

518
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,322
You're coming home for dinner tonight.

519
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:56,761
Eat with this old man.

520
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:58,882
Got it.

521
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,162
I'll go see you tonight.

522
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:11,281
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

523
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:14,122
Are you alright?

524
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:32,721
(My initial dream)

525
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:34,402
(was to become a soldier.)

526
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,802
(But I changed my mind)

527
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,001
(because of a girl I like.)

528
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:44,922
(I just realized)

529
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:46,481
(that those)

530
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,761
(unassuming jokes)

531
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,082
(were all hiding his true feelings.)

532
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:53,602
(I know I won't be able to reciprocate)

533
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:54,882
(his feelings.)

534
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:58,362
(But I hope that one day)

535
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:00,281
(he will find)

536
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,281
(the real happiness for himself.)

537
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:07,402
Huo.

538
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:11,961
What brought you here?

539
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:14,001
I have something

540
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:15,602
to tell you face-to-face.

541
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:19,681
I'm sorry.

542
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:21,122
I was too impulsive...

543
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,322
I should be the one to say sorry.

544
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:24,481
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:26,721
I failed to notice

546
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:27,521
how you feel.

547
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,001
I took your kindness

548
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:30,082
for granted.

549
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:33,322
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:35,562
I made you stand

551
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:36,521
by yourself behind me.

552
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:38,882
And I've never turned around

553
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:39,602
to acknowledge you.

554
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:41,402
I don't need you to apologize.

555
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:42,281
Please let me finish.

556
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,562
I kept thinking on the way here.

557
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:46,521
What can I do for you?

558
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:48,082
What should I do for you?

559
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:51,201
I've thought about it for a long time,

560
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,162
and I finally came to a conclusion.

561
00:29:52,562 --> 00:29:53,681
It's something I can't do

562
00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:56,162
because of you.

563
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,122
I cannot continue

564
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:00,481
to accept your kindness

565
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,362
knowing how you feel.

566
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:05,521
And I don't want

567
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,721
to selfishly keep you to myself.

568
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:08,122
Say no more.

569
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:10,842
Huo.

570
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,481
We won't be able to become lovers.

571
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:18,001
Nor can I reciprocate your feelings.

572
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,001
So before you're able

573
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,041
to sort through your feelings,

574
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,001
we should stop contacting each other.

575
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,681
I'm afraid of hurting you.

576
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,602
And I don't know how to face you.

577
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:45,441
So,

578
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,041
am I about to lose you?

579
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:48,041
No.

580
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,761
We will always be best friends.

581
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:55,362
But being friends

582
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:56,362
is not what I want.

583
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:03,681
As a friend,

584
00:31:04,402 --> 00:31:05,521
the only thing I can do

585
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:07,681
is to move on.

586
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:10,241
That's the best outcome for us.

587
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:14,162
Xu Lai.

588
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:36,602
Did the setting up of the rescue team

589
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:37,241
go smoothly?

590
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,642
Yes, it was. Every member passed.

591
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,481
I met Wen.

592
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:44,721
He praised you,

593
00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:46,001
saying what a capable leader you are.

594
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:47,082
And you are a reliable trainer.

595
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:50,201
He should have expected it
from my grandson.

596
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:57,922
I never worried about you
when you were a student.

597
00:31:58,322 --> 00:31:59,402
Now that you're a working adult,

598
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:00,842
I don't worry either.

599
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:03,241
The only thing

600
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,721
that makes me worry

601
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,201
is your personal life.

602
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:08,761
I can't sleep easy.

603
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:11,082
This weekend,

604
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:12,362
make some time to come home.

605
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:14,201
My old comrade, Qiao,

606
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,602
is coming for a visit

607
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:17,041
with his granddaughter.

608
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:18,842
Get to know her.

609
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,201
Grandpa.

610
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,642
How many times has it been?

611
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:23,602
How many more old comrades do you have?

612
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:26,882
Seriously, not many.

613
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,882
Shichuan, if you don't hurry up,

614
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,842
my old friends' granddaughters

615
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,082
would all be married.

616
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:34,162
I'm not in a hurry.

617
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:35,961
Are you really not going

618
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,402
to get married?

619
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:40,162
Are you going to be single forever?

620
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:44,201
Grandpa.

621
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:45,441
Actually I...

622
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:46,122
Hush.

623
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:47,681
Are you going to tell me

624
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,481
how dangerous your work is,

625
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,961
and you can't serve
both the country and the family?

626
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,882
I understand.

627
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:55,241
I just feel bad because

628
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,281
I won't be able to answer
to your parents.

629
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,602
Forgive me for being blunt.

630
00:32:59,922 --> 00:33:00,922
When I die,

631
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:02,521
I won't have the face to see them.

632
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,402
Grandpa.

633
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:04,802
Don't talk about death.

634
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,201
So ominous.

635
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:07,481
Let's just eat.

636
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,802
Don't be upset. Eat.

637
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,162
I have my own plan.

638
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:50,722
Chuan.

639
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,041
It's midnight.

640
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:53,322
Why don't you go to sleep?

641
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,282
When daddy comes back,

642
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,402
we can cut the cake tomorrow.

643
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:57,161
No.

644
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,641
I'm going to wait for Dad

645
00:34:58,762 --> 00:34:59,922
and blow the candles together.

646
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:13,802
(Hello?)

647
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:15,561
(Mrs. Jin.)

648
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:16,521
(Something happened to Captain Jin.)

649
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,121
(While carrying out a mission)

650
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:18,682
(at the site of a fire,)

651
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:19,282
(he got seriously injured.)

652
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,521
(He's at the People's Hospital)

653
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,242
(undergoing emergency treatment.)

654
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:22,641
(But the situation is dire.)

655
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:23,601
(You have to be prepared.)

656
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:24,802
(I'll be right there.)

657
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:39,441
Mom.

658
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:41,922
Did something happen to Dad?

659
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,121
Mom.

660
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:46,402
Where is Dad?

661
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:47,882
What's happened?

662
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:17,202
Mom.

663
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,322
I can't see anything.

664
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,322
Mom?

665
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:25,282
Mom.

666
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:26,922
What's wrong?

667
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:32,161
Mom.

668
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:34,081
Mom.

669
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:35,362
What's the matter with you?

670
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:38,282
Mom, what's wrong?

671
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,362
Wake up!

672
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:44,282
Wake up.

673
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:51,722
Please wake up.

674
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,322
Mom, what's wrong?

675
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:59,081
What's wrong with you?

676
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:00,601
Mom!

677
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:06,601
Mom.

678
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,041
Mom.

679
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:13,242
Mom!

680
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,161
Mom, please wake up!

681
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,161
Shichuan.

682
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:44,842
I know there's a burden in your heart.

683
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:47,001
All these years,

684
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,322
I haven't had a proper talk with you

685
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:51,441
about it.

686
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,481
But now you're a grown man.

687
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:58,641
You are mature.

688
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:01,282
You should know that

689
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:02,682
you are you.

690
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,802
Your parents are their own persons.

691
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:07,001
What happened to them back then

692
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:08,441
was an accident.

693
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,322
It doesn't mean that

694
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,521
you would be like them,

695
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,641
unable to build

696
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,041
a stable family.

697
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:17,882
Grandpa.

698
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:20,802
I have someone I like.

699
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:22,601
You do?

700
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:23,922
Did you just meet her?

701
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:26,161
Yes.

702
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,081
Actually, no.

703
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,481
We met ten years ago.

704
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,081
Ten years?

705
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:35,802
Who are you bluffing?

706
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,521
Why haven't you told me about it then?

707
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:40,041
If it's been ten years,

708
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:40,802
then bring her here right now

709
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:41,601
and show me.

710
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:42,961
I haven't

711
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:44,161
officially asked her out yet.

712
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:45,481
Once we're officially together,

713
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:47,242
I'll invite her here right away.

714
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:47,722
Okay?

715
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,081
Then confirm your relationship

716
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:50,682
with her right now,

717
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,561
and then bring her to me.

718
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:53,722
I have to get back to work.

719
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,282
Trust me. I'm not lying to you.

720
00:40:56,842 --> 00:40:57,521
Once it's confirmed,

721
00:40:57,802 --> 00:40:59,242
I will bring her here, okay?

722
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:04,242
Stop looking at this.

723
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,961
Trust me. Stop worrying so much.

724
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:09,922
Wear your glasses.

725
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,202
Alright. I'm leaving.

726
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:15,081
I didn't lie.

727
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,001
That brat is so mysterious.

728
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,081
Is he for real?

729
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:45,121
(Hello.)

730
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:47,081
(The number you've dialed)

731
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:49,402
(has incoming call alert enabled.)

732
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,481
(Your call has...)

733
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:57,641
Peace.

734
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,641
Do you miss her too?
