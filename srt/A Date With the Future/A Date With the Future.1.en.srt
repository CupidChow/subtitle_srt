Anyone?

Help!

19
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Help!

20
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,080
Is anyone out there?

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,919
Help!

22
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,560
(When I was 15,)

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,919

Is anyone out there?

Is someone here?

32
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,040
Can you hear me?

33
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,319
Hold on!

34
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,879
I'm coming to save you now!

35
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,399

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,079

(with radiance,)

38
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,040
(and illuminated)

40
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,680
Don't worry.

41
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,879
I will bring you out soon.

42
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,920

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,399
How is she?

45
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,680
Her injuries are fine,

46
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,120
but she is in shock

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
and is suffering from PTSD.

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,639
Since she came here,

49
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,360
she hasn't eaten, drunk
or spoken anything.

50
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,399

(Huaigang Emergency Response Unit)

76
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,200
Today, we will be demonstrating

77
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,639
the helicopter rappel.

78
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,720
It is mainly used in

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
rapid air extraction scenarios.

80
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,559
For example,

81
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,919
highways,

82
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,919
earthquakes,

00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,159
and floods.

Every rescue operation

86
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,360
is a race against time.

87
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,639
We need to arrive

88
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,360
at the extraction target's side
as soon as possible.

89
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,960
While rappelling,

90
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,320
the sway of the helicopter

91
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,919
and the engine's noise

92
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,960
will become a disturbance.

93
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,159
We need to have good teamwork

94
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,360
with the pilot

95
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,440
and the coordinator.

96
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,399
Remember.

97
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,440
If we can get

98
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
one more second,

99
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,279
we will be able to save one more life.

100
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
Dangers are everywhere.

101
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,000
From the moment we chose

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
to become firefighters,

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,240
we should

104
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,879
always be prepared.

105
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080

- Yes!

Let's go.

111
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,352
Go in under the middleman's name.

112
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,320
It won't raise any suspicions.

113
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,519
Take care.

114
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Don't worry.

115
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,440
Just leave the rest to me.

117

Follow me.

118
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,360
I have

119
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,240
cosmetic products

120
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,799
and skin care products from every brand.

121
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
From the anti-counterfeit page,

122
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
the packaging, to the label,

123
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
they look exactly the same
as the authentic ones.

125
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,919
This month,

126
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
I've investigated

127
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,120
and gathered materials
on some workshops and shops

128
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,559
that distribute

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,279
and manufacture

130
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,080
counterfeit cosmetics

131
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,039
in this city.

132
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,879
Next,

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
I will interview

134
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,279
relevant experts

135
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,320
to analyze the selling

136
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
of counterfeit products
in the cosmetics industry.

137
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,240
This is a surprise, Xu Lai.

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,639
You are working so hard
even if you've just started to work.

139
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,919
Just do your investigation.

140
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,879
Why are you using a disguise?

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,879
This is

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,919
to infiltrate the enemy's base.

143
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,200
I admire you.

144
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,720
However, there's one thing

145
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,320
that I don't understand.

146
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,080
You were doing well

147
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,960
in the overseas branch.

148
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,240
Why did you apply

149
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,320
to return to the country?

150
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,919
Because

151
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,360
I still have an important promise.

fell and crushed two vehicles,

162
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,240

The current situation

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
is more complicated
than the information we received.

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Cancel the original plan.

Report to the Command Centre

176
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
and request the power company
to stop the power supply

177
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,279
to make sure the area is safe

178
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,759
before we begin the rescue.

179
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,159

Yes!

182
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,679
Wear insulating boots and gloves.

183
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,799
Examine the scene with me.

184
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes!

Lu Fangqi.

186
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,159
Yes.

187
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,440
Lead Squad 1

188
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,080
and get two fire hoses

189
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,320
to stand by on the west.

190
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,039
Prepare to extinguish the fire.

191
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Understood.

192
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,880

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
evacuate the area.

- Yes!
- Yes!

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,120
What's the situation?

198
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,240
Commissioner.

199
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,039
Every squad of Brigade 1 and 2 of
the Emergency Response Unit

200
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
is ready to carry out
their respective duties.

201
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,240
Before the power is cut, we will
use dry chemical fire extinguishers.

202
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,320
Once the power is cut,

203
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,960
we will set up fire hoses

204
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
to extinguish the fire.

205
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,200
You must guarantee the safety and assets

206
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
of the people.

207
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,879
Brigades 1 and 2

208
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,799
should work together.

209
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,399
Yes!

210
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,679
Move back.

211
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,639
Move back.

212
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,879
Move back.

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
What if it explodes?

214
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
Why is there another congestion?

215
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,600
What's going on?

216
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Zhang.

217
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,639
Take more pictures of the scene

218
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,799
and close-ups of the trapped victims.

219
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,440
Wide shots from multiple angles as well.

220
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,039
Hey,

221
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,840
what's going on?

222
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,879
You've set up the hoses.

223
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,480
Why can't you

224
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,279
use the fire hoses?

225
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,279
The transformer might be electrified.

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:45,960
Using a fire hose

227
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,120
will electrocute everyone.

228
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,559
That's...

229
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:47,919
Hey.

230
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,480
Captain Jin.

231
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,559
Why don't we try using mist cannon

232
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,559
so the leakage is weaker

233
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,480
and it might be safer.

234
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,720
Test the current.

235
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,759
Use dry chemicals to control the fire.

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
We can only begin rescue
once the power supply is cut off.

237
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,720
Understood.

238
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,279
That's all I witnessed just now.

239
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,320
Liu Xu.

240
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
Make a triangle mark

241
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
at the area that is not electrified
after checking.

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,879
Yes.

243
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Begin rescue quickly

244
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,799
according to the route we marked.

245
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,000
Let me save him!

246
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,759
Don't move! Spinal injury!

247
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,559
Zhou Changqing, stretcher! Hurry!

248
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,559
Let's go!

249
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,519
Stretcher! Hurry!

250
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,120
Increase pressure!

251
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,399
Can you hear me?

252
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,559
Hurry!

253
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
More pressure!

254
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,240
Move.

255
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,559
Move.

256
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,680
A bit further.

257
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,559
Thank you for your cooperation.

258
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,559
Please move backwards.

259
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,079
Please move backwards.

260
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,440
Stop filming.

261
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,039
Stop filming.

262
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Please stand further back.

263
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,359
Is anyone else in there?

264
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,240
Zhang.

265
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,119
Zoom in.

266
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,079
Be careful.

267
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,880
What's wrong?

268
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
It's nothing. I made a mistake.

269
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,640
Help!

270
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,279
Save me.

271
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm trapped.

272
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,359
It's going to fall down.

273
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,759
Don't come here!

274
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,000
Liu Xu, hydraulic cutter.

275
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,920
Hurry up!

276
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
It's coming down!

277
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,359
I don't want to die.

278
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,119
Hurry.

279
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,359
Hurry.

280
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,000
Hurry.

281
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,359
Let's go.

282
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,359
Run!

283
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,720
Go! Hurry!

284
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,519
When will the people from
the power company be here?

285
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,079
They are here.

286
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,240
They will cut the power now.

287
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,240
Stay safe!

288
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,119
There will still be explosions.

289
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,839
What is the fire brigade doing?

290
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,880
After so long,

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,559
there's still a huge fire.

292
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:18,839
I think

293
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,599
they can't proceed further
because of the electricity.

294
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,599
I'm here, Xu Lai.

295
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,359
Just leave it to me.

296
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,079
Xin.

297
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,119
We have most of the materials

298
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,279
and the interviews are done.

299
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,640
I'll leave the rest to you.

300
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,759
Thank you.

301
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,079
Take care.

302
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,599
Take care.

303
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,960
Xu Lai is quite professional.

304
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,279
In terms of interviews
and getting footage,

305
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,480
she also has many ideas.

306
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,079
She's a rookie.

307
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,039
What kind of idea would she have?

308
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,640
What kind of angle is this?

309
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,519
It's full of smoke.

310
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,559
You can't even see anyone.

311
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,559
She only knows how to fool the leader.

312
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,000
This is still

313
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,119
far from being good.

314
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,079
Captain Jin.

315
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,079
Captain Jin!

316
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,559
The power company confirmed
that the power has been switched off.

317
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,440
Use the hoses now!

318
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,759
Be careful.

319
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,079
Xin.

320
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,880
Xin, you can't go in.

321
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:27,920
It's dangerous!

322
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,680
Xin!

323
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,519
Hurry!

324
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:31,799
Extricate!

325
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,400
Quick! Be careful!

326
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,599
Stretcher!

327
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,400
There's someone here.

328
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,759
Over here!

329
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,599
Hold on!

330
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,519
Give me the hydraulic cutter!

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,480
Extricate!

332
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,000
Be careful!

333
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,359
Extricate immediately. Hurry!

334
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,519
Over here!

335
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,720
Slowly.

336
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:04,960
Move!

337
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,000
Here. Give me a hand!

338
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,119
Child.

339
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,119
Save the child.

340
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,599
I will save you both!

341
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,400
Don't worry!

342
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,599
We will be getting out soon.

343
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,799
I'm undoing your seat belt

344
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,799
and saving you first.

345
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,000
Does it hurt here?

346
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,640
Dapeng!

347
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,279
Why is there another explosion?

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,519
Xin is still inside.

349
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:58,920
Zhang.

350
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,400
Did you film the explosion?

351
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,640
Xin took the camera

352
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
and rushed inside.

353
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,880
Xin!

354
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,880
Xin.

355
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,759
Don't go through
the police line next time.

356
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,160
Thank you.

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,480
Are you all right?

358
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:12,960
Are you all right?

359
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,680
Are you hurt?

360
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:17,920
Where's the camera?

361
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,799
Camera...

362
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,759
The camera is inside.

363
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,480
It's beside the white SUV.

364
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,319
We haven't extracted the footage yet.

365
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,319
What should we do?

366
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,039
Xu Lai!

367
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:30,680
Hurry!

368
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,359
Captain Jin!

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,079
Someone is rushing inside the scene!

370
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,519
Dapeng!

371
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes!

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,759
Captain Jin, be careful!

373
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,440
The fuel tank of the car in front
is going to explode!

374
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,400
It's dangerous!

498
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,920

to extinguish the fire.

509
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,039

516
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640

535
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,000

536
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,240
a controversy online.

537
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,839
Some people

538
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,039
took footage

539
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,960
from our report

540
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,839
and purposely

541
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,279
defamed the firefighters.

542
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,359
It gave a negative impact

543
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,039
on the firefighters of
Emergency Response Unit Brigade 1.

544
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Although the responsibility
is not with the TV station,

545
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,480
they still used footage

546
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,519
that came from our report.

547
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,359
Can someone tell me

548
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,160
who was the one

549
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,000

550
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,480
Sorry, Chief.

551
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,039
I was responsible.

552
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,559
I arrived

553
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,279
at the scene late

554
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,200
so another colleague

555
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,279
already collected the materials.

556
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,640
Since she knew the situation

557
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,440
better than me,

558
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
I asked her to help me

559
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,160
with arranging and editing.

560
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,240
When we were on our way to the scene,

561
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,119
there was congestion.

562
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,039
Xu Lai volunteered

563
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,319
to take me to the scene.

564
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,599
Ms. Jiang

565
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,839
had no first-hand materials at all.

566
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,119
Xin,

567
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,400
let Zhang ride with me

568
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400

569
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,200

570
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,519

571
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,279
Yes.

573
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,839
I got hurt at the scene

574
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,680
just now.

575
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,119
I need to go to the hospital later.

576
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,319
This report

577
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,680
is urgent.

578
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,079
You are a rookie.

579
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:58,799

a good learning opportunity for you.

581
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,200
Why don't you

582
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,039
be in charge of this video?

583
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:02,559
Really?

584
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,480
Don't worry.

585
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,119
I promise

586
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,880
to complete the task.

587
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,559
I watched the video

588
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,759
and saw nothing wrong with it.

589
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,240
So I submitted it directly.

590
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,119
Xin,

591
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,920
why did you

592
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,079
add that footage?

593
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,799
Which footage?

594
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,680
I don't understand what you are saying.

595
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,440
The bystanders' opinion

596
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,680
on the firefighters at the scene.

597
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,960
The final version I gave you

598
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
didn't have that content.

599
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
Do you know doing that

600
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
will mislead the public?

601
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:29,799
They will think

602
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,880
this is misfeasance by the firefighters.

603
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,400
The footage

604
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
has been extracted

605
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,440
by bloggers.

606
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,640
I didn't edit

607
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
or submit the footage.

608
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,279
Go and check the website.

609
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,680
Besides,

610
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,200
we are reporting

611
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
the firefighters

612
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,519
putting out the fire.

613
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,960
It's the objective truth.

614
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,200
I added

615
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
the bystanders' discussion

616
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,039
to explain

617
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,880
the scene

618
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,960
that firefighters

619
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,680
can't use fire hoses

620
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,599
before the electricity is cut.

621
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,039
But people are taking it

622
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,759
out-of-context

623
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,599
after you added that part.

624
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,799
Let me say it again. It wasn't me.

625
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,799
Let me remind you, Xu Lai.

626
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,920
You are the one in the video.

627
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,839
You are also the one

628
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,519
who arranged the footage.

629
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,960
Even if there's a joint liability,

630
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,000
you will be the one
to bear the consequence.

631
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,079
I don't blame Xu Lai.

632
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,839
She's a rookie and is inexperienced.

633
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,079
Besides, there's no problem
with the report.

634
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,559
People are only misusing our footage.

635
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,079
I am partly responsible for this.

636
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,799
We will be more careful in the future.

637
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,519
Xin is right.

638
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,680
I am a rookie

639
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,000
and am inexperienced.

640
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,680
So,

641
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,200
I lack experience
in taking responsibility

642
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,319
for my senior.

643
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,240
I just sent

644
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,599
the security camera footage
of Xin editing the footage

645
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,400
to everyone.

646
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,880
You can take a look
if you are interested.

647
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Not only did Xin

648
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
see the footage I arranged,

649
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
but she also helped me add new footage.

650
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
After all, uncovering the truth

651
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,759
is the duty of a reporter.

652
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,519
Chief.

653
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,800
I won't take the blame for this

654
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,920
but I'm going to
shoulder the responsibility.

655
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What are you planning to do?

656
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,679
I want to do a special report

657
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,800
on the firefighters.

658
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,639
Doing that

659
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,400
can help them

660
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
get rid of the negative impact

661
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,159
and help increase

662
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,119
the TV station's reputation.

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,960
It's killing two birds with one stone.

664
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
You can try it.

665
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,559
I'll say this first.

666
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,079
If your report

667
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,159
is not good enough,

668
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,679
I won't use it.

669
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,920
No problem.

670
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,880
(Jiang Xin.)

671
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
(Xu Lai is a rookie.)

672
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,360
(As her senior,)

673
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,320
(you should guide her well)

674
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,320
(instead of pushing the responsibility.)

675
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,840
(Thankfully, no incident happened)

676
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,400
(and the station does not
need to take responsibility.)

677
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,559
(However, I feel ashamed for you.)

678
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,199
(Reflect on it.)

679
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,039
Miss.

680
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,599
That is my resume.

681
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
You're the new intern, right?

682
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,159
What is your major?

683
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,239
Hello, I am a graduate
of Huaigang University's

684
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,599
editing course,

685
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,119
Zhou Tingwei.

686
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,480
I specialize in photography.

687
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,920
Today is my first day here.

688
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,079
Please take good care of me.

689
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,199
I'm busy.

690
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
I have no time to guide you.

691
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:21,038
Our station

692
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,159
always has strict guidelines.

693
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,559
A graduate

694
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,119
can never stay
and become a full-time employee.

695
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,480
Zhang.

696
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,159
I need a photographer.

697
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,840
Can you arrange one for me?

698
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,159
Our photographers

699
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,480
have all been sent away.

700
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,960
Are you the new intern?

701
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,920
Do you know photography?

702
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes.

703
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:44,719
Follow me.

704
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,519
Be my photographer.

705
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,119
Let's go.

706
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:47,880
All right.

707
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,760
An intern

708
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,199
who is destined to be eliminated

709
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,320
and a topic

710
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,639
that is destined to be eliminated.

711
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,719
Both of them are such a good match.

712
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,079
Isn't this Huo Yanzong?

713
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,639
Why is he here?

714
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,079
I think he is waiting for someone.

715
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Is it a pretty host

716
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,239
from our station?

717
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,280
Perhaps.

718
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,599
We will gather

719
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,000
at Emergency Response Unit Brigade 1
tomorrow.

720
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:27,559
Sure.

721
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:33,760
What's wrong?

722
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,599
Han Fang.

723
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,920
How dare you run away.

724
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,199
Go back first.

725
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,960
Who asked you to come to my workplace?

726
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,440
It's because of Huo...

727
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,119
You're here.

728
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,960
Let's go. Get in.

729
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,400
Let's go.

730
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,000
Seriously.

731
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,000
One of you is an entrepreneur

732
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,280
and the other

733
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,360
is a notorious playboy.

734
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,079
Being with you two

735
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,000
attracts attention.

736
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:12,760
I need to keep a low profile.

737
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,320
A low profile? You?

738
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,960
I've never seen someone

739
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,199
as high profile as you.

740
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:17,960
What's wrong with that?

741
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,639
I'm doing it for my work.

742
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,239
Bringing attention to my work
and still keeping a low profile.

743
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,760
Do you understand?

744
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,880
Yes.

745
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,190
(Qiancao Train Restaurant)

746
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,039
I didn't expect

747
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,159
the abandoned train station

748
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
to become a restaurant.

749
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,119
Time passes by quickly.

750
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,440
Stop feeling emotional.

751
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,400
Eat.

752
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,280
It's been a month since you returned.

753
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,960
How do you feel

754
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,679
about your new work environment?

755
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:45,559
It's not bad.

756
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:47,400
There's just a certain person

757
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,119
who is annoying.

758
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,400
The working place is complicated.

759
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:52,679
If you

760
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,519
need any help,

761
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,360
remember to tell me.

762
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
That's right. We are buddies.

763
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,159
We will help you.

764
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,679
Are you joking?

765
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,320
Have you seen anyone

766
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,400
who can bully me

767
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,920
since young?

768
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,599
I don't need your help.

769
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,400
It's true.

770
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
You were the king

771
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,679
of our neighborhood.

772
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,840
When Huo and I

773
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,960
were being bullied,

774
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,159
you were the one who helped us.

775
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,840
Stop!

776
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,880
Who allowed you to fight here?

777
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,480
Who are you?

778
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,159
Do you know them

779
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,840
and want to help them?

780
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,599
I'm not interested

781
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,320
in nerds like them.

782
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,440
Why are you crying?

783
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,719
Isn't that shameful?

784
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,920
Who are you calling shameful?

785
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,239
You!

786
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,079
You only know how to be beaten. Coward!

787
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,679
What does it have to do with you?

788
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,079
Are you crazy?

789
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,440
Why are you still spacing out?

790
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,079
Run!

791
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,119
After them!

792
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,400
Xu Lai.

793
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,679
It has been so many years.

794
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:09,480
Why do you

795
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,559
still not look elegant?

796
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:11,920
Can't you even pretend?

797
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,400
I grew up with you two.

798
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,679
How can I be elegant?

799
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,039
Besides,

800
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,519
we are buddies.

801
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,000
Why should I pretend in front of you?

802
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,519
I am a reporter now.

803
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,639
I run around everywhere
with the equipment.

804
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,679
I have no time for that.

805
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,199
I've always wanted to ask you.

806
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,760
You were doing fine abroad.

807
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,880
Why did you return suddenly?

808
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,079
It's not a sudden decision.

809
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,840
I planned it.

810
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm sure you don't know.

811
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,079
I've been following

812
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,280
his news for the last 10 years.

813
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,480
I came back

814
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,320
because of him.

815
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,599
No way.

816
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,320
It has been ten years.

817
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,159
Are you telling me

818
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,039
that you still remember that person?

819
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:44,960
Of course.

820
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,960
No. Even if you find...

821
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,559
It's no use even if you find him.

822
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,480
It has been so many years.

823
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm sure he doesn't remember you.

824
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,559
How do you know that? It's true.

825
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,320
Last time...

826
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,960
It's time.

827
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,280
Time for what?

828
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,119
Walk Peace. He's waiting for me at home.

829
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,519
Are you going to leave
shortly after sitting down?

830
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:04,800
Both of us

831
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,360
are not as important as a dog.

832
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,239
Reflect on yourself that

833
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,639
why you are worse than a dog.

834
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,639
Peace is

835
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,679
way more loyal than you.

836
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,760
Wait. Let me send you back.

837
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:15,480
No.

838
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,480
Remember to pay the bill.

839
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:27,920
Thank you.

840
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,960
This place is nice.

841
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:31,800
Of course.

842
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,719
I spent a lot of time

843
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,440
to find this place.

844
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,199
It's cheap and comfortable.

845
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,480
If you have time,

846
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,599
you should stay with your parents.

847
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,960
It's boring to stay here alone.

848
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,159
I don't want to go home

849
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,360
and argue with them.

850
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,280
I think

851
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,280
living alone is great.

852
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,840
However, you must be careful.

853
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
Why don't I find someone

854
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,079
to install

855
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,679
a security gate or something?

856
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,000
No need.

857
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,639
Don't worry.

858
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm safe

859
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,280
with Peace by my side.

860
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,800
That's enough.

861
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm going up.

862
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:00,320
Bye.

863
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,119
Drive safe.

864
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,599
Rest earlier.

865
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,320
Bye.

866
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,519
Stop looking. She already left.

867
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,039
If you miss her, chase after her.

868
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,559
Why would I miss her?

869
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,679
I will still get to see her anyway.

870
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,760
Stop pretending in front of me.

871
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:17,526
Only that silly girl

872
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,199
can't realize your feelings for her.

873
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,360
What a pity.

874
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,247
Xu Lai is only thinking

875
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,199
the person who saved her.

876
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,079
Do you not feel anxious at all?

877
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,480
Why should I?

878
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,840
It has been so long.

879
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:30,840
She might not find him.

880
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,480
Even if she does,

881
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
no one can replace me

882
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,679
in Xu Lai's heart.

883
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,559
When are you

884
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,760
planning to confess?

885
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
You didn't get a chance
because she went abroad

886
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,360
to study.

887
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,639
Think about it.

888
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,960
Now that she's back,

889
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,119
are you still going to

890
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,800
wait for her?

891
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,119
That's none of your concern.

892
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:46,920
Let's go.

893
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,360
Nice.

894
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,159
Captain Jin.

895
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:21,840
We meet again.

896
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,559
It's you again?

897
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,360
Do you remember me?

898
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,480
Yes.

899
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,079
