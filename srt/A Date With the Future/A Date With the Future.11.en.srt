(I Don't Like You Praising Other Men)

18
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,420
(Xu Lai)

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,360
Hello.

20
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,600
(Hello, Huo.)

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,839
(Can you talk?)

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,999
Yes.

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
You called me so late at night.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,480
What is it?

25
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,160
It's nothing much.

26
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm still a little worried

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,399
about what happened to you

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,399
in the morning.

29
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,327
How are you? Are you all right?

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,880
Do you care about me so much?

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
(Nonsense. What is our relationship?)

32
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,080
Don't worry. I'm fine.

33
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,880
(Really? Don't lie to me.)

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,999
Yes.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm relieved to hear that.

36
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh.

37
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,440
Our station has a talk show

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
that wants to invite you as a guest.

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
(I'm the host for that episode.)

40
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,959
(Are you free?)

41
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,679
Of course,

42
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,959
I'm free for your show.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,839
You are my buddy indeed.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll text you

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,119
the details later.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,320
(All right.)

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,160
Bye.

48
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,679
Why do I feel like
your mood has improved

49
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,320
after picking up the call?

50
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,119
Do you know where we are going already?

51
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:20,880
Let's go.

52
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,399
Why did you drive back?

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,559
I thought about it,

54
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,080
and don't think
I'm obligated to help you.

55
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,559
(Isn't that Mr. Huo?)

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320
(Where is she?)

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,559
Shishi.

58
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,080
Why are you

59
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:01,679
in Mr. Huo's car?

60
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,080
What did you two do just now?

61
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,279
If I tell you

62
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,719
we didn't do anything

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,679
and just drove

64
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,600
on the road,

65
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,080
will you believe me?

66
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,279
I...

67
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,360
I believe...

68
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:15,719
Is Huo Yanzong

69
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
crazy?

70
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't you like people like him

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,919
who are handsome yet a little crazy?

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,519
You are right.

73
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't be angry. Let's go.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,279
(What are you doing?)

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,359
(I just got home.)

76
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,919
Hello.

77
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,320
(What is it? Do you miss me?)

78
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,159
Peace misses you.

79
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,440
Peace.

80
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,919
(Peace, look at the camera.)

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,800
(Peace.)

82
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,240
(Maybe he's still not used to it)

83
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,159
(since he's new here.)

84
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,479
(What about you?)

85
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,599
(Do you feel tired
after going back to the brigade?)

86
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,519
(I'm not tired)

87
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,640
(but I'm not used to it.)

88
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,880
Not used to it?

89
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,479
Perhaps you are not around.

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,519
(I don't think
Peace is the one that misses me.)

91
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,560
(Someone else does.)

92
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,359
It's late now.

93
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm hanging up.

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,399
All right. Sleep early.

95
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,200
(Goodnight.)

96
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:36,440
Goodnight.

97
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,320
Halt and turn.

98
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,240
Eyes front!

99
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,680
Right turn!

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
Right turn!

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,440
Left turn!

102
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,159
Left turn!

103
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Liu Xu.

104
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,359
Yes!

105
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,560
That's all for today.

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:31,919
Take everyone back.

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,640
Yes!

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Everyone!

109
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,120
At ease!

110
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,159
Dismissed!

111
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,039
- Yes!
- Yes!

112
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:44,159
Zhang Yang.

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,200
Yes!

114
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:49,680
The rescue uniform

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,479
for the new team member is here.

116
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:51,599
I'll bring you to retrieve it.

117
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Let's go.

118
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,719
Why are you here?

119
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,680
I want to invite you

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,279
to join a talk show.

121
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,750
(HGTV Invitation)

122
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,590
(Huaigang TV Station
sincerely invites you)

123
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,640
You know

124
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,279
I don't like to be interviewed

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,839
and won't join this show.

126
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,279
Don't be in a rush to reject me.

127
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:15,640
This talk show

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
will invite all the outstanding youths
of this city.

129
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,880
This is a task given to me
by the TV station.

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Just think of it as helping me,

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,919
all right?

132
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,800
Captain Jin, just go.

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
Think of it as promoting

134
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,000
our fire brigade.

135
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,440
Oh, Xu Lai.

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,680
Who else will be on the show?

137
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,359
For male guests,

138
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,359
we invited Captain Jin and Huo.

139
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,160
Huo Yanzong will be there too?

140
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,879
Captain Jin, you must go then.

141
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,599
Comparison reveals the truth.

142
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,879
In terms of excellence,

143
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,879
Captain Jin is more excellent
than anyone else.

144
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll think about it.

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,879
Peace.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,599
Come here.

147
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,160
Come.

148
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,320
You're so excited.

149
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Let me take a look.

150
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,119
Do you miss me?

151
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,126
Is Huo Yanzong

152
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,479
definitely going to be on the show?

153
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,200
Yes.

154
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,479
This is a good opportunity
for both of you

155
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,599
to know each other.

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,999
I believe both of you

157
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:31,879
will become good friends

158
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,839
after getting to know each other.

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,440
Why should I

160
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,520
become good friends with him?

161
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,080
Are you jealous?

162
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:52,999
No.

163
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,639
No?

164
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,200
No.

165
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
Jin Shichuan!

166
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm calling you.

167
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,800
Why did you get angry suddenly?

168
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,920
I didn't.

169
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,479
You are angry.

170
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,560
I don't like you

171
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,400
praising other men,

172
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,040
especially Huo Yanzong.

173
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,200
Jin Shichuan.

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,479
Do you realize

175
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
that you care more about me now?

176
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,920
I still have work to do. Leave.

177
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
No. I won't leave
before you make it clear.

178
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes.

179
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:43,920
I care about you.

180
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,200
I care about you a lot.

181
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I will participate in

182
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,440
the show you mentioned.

183
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,359
I'll text you the time and schedule!

184
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,599
Remember to check your phone!

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,879
Commissioner.

186
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,400
I want to take a day's leave

187
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,119
for the filming
of a show at the TV station.

188
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,080
Being a guest on TV?

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,759
That's good. I approve.

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,119
Thank you, Commissioner.

191
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,040
I remember

192
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,080
you used to reject

193
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,999
interviews and being guests on TV

194
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,959
in the past.

195
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,080
Why did you

196
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,160
change your mind suddenly?

197
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm going to help out a friend.

198
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,720
(Contact, Xu Lai)

199
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,959
I was wondering

200
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,639
you've changed

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,920
after coming back

202
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:04,440
from the training.

203
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,119
You became happier,

204
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,920
and more talkative.

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,239
You have been smiling more.

206
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,759
Who is the one

207
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,239
that forged this piece of hard metal again?

208
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,200
Let me take a guess.

209
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,080
Xu Lai?

210
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,040
I said you must

211
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,359
keep a close eye on her.

212
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,080
You must...

213
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Commissioner.

214
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,359
I forgot.

215
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,479
I need to lead the team.

216
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,479
I'll be leaving.

217
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,440
Don't forget what I told you!

218
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,879
How is it? Not bad, right?

219
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,119
Not bad. You look great.

220

(Blood Type: B)
Why is my blood type here?

221
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,440
This is because the blood type

222
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,639
of firefighters
can be confirmed immediately

223
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,320
for emergency rescue

224
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,080
if they get hurt

225
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,200
during a frontline operation.

226
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,460
(Combatant)

227
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,959
I still hope

228
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:56,999
you won't need it forever,

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,599
so you won't be injured.

(Huaigang Emergency Response Unit)

231
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Wear it

232
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,879
and you will be an official firefighter.

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,599

234
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:21,200
Yes!

235

Protect yourself well

236
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
at the rescue scene.

237
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,599
Yes!

238
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:38,680
This is the recent schedule.

239
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,359

(June Schedule, Yu Shishi)

241
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
(Yu Shishi, April Schedule)

242
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,959
Why is there a talk show?

243
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,479
People don't really
talk about these shows.

244
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,879
I want to take a break.

245
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:51,879
Help me reject it.

246
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,520
I saw the name list for other guests

247
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,560
and they are all positive.

248
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,040
This show is also

249
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,160
interviewing outstanding youths.

250
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,879
It helps to improve your image.

251
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:03,680
Oh.

252
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,999
There's a guest

253
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,879
that you know.

254
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,999
Who is it?

255
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,160
Yunkai Group's CEO, Huo Yanzong.

256
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,440
You met him last time.

257
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,680
So?

258
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:18,920
I changed my mind.

259
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,959
I'm going to join this show.

260
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,359
Do you have other questions?

261
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,879
Xin.

262
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
Are these two people the guests

263
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,359
for this show?

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,239
Both of them are joining
Xu Lai's show at the same time.

265
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,040
This is interesting.

266
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:55,520
Thank you, Xin.

269
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,479

It's this time already?

275
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,560
He should be asleep.

276
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,040
Time to get off work.

277
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm leaving, Captain Jin.

278
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,040
There were so many cases today.

279
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm exhausted.

(Take care. Rest early.)

00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:54,919
All right.

381
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,639
Mr. Huo, we meet again.

382
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,760
Why are you here?

383
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,919
The production team invited me,

384
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,760
so I'm here.

385
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,359
I didn't expect you to be here too.

386
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Do you think this is fate?

387
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,240
Forget about fate.
It's just a coincidence.

388
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,439
What if it's not a coincidence?

389
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:35,480
This is weird.

390
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
There shouldn't be
any congestion at this time.

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,599
(Take note.)

392
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
(There's a traffic accident
on Xiafei Road.)

393
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:43,240
(Someone is trapped.)

394
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,280
(The road is congested.)

395
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,919
(Don't use this road.)

396
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,280
I'll get down here.

397
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm at Xiafei Road.

398
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,720
It's serious. Come and help.

399
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,199
Did you call the police?

400
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:03,679
Yes.

401
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,480
I called 120.

402
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm a firefighter in Huaigang.

403
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,720
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

404
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,639
No.

405
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:11,359
Do you feel anything?

406
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:12,280
Yes.

407
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,639
My leg hurts.

408
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,960
I can see your left leg being caught.

409
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:18,960
What is your name?

410
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,000
I am Lv Feixiang.

411
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,399
Lv Feixiang, listen to me.

412
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:23,560
I will get you out soon.

413
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,320
Hang in there.

414
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,760
There's a wounded
being trapped under the car!

415
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,000
I need help!

416
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
Those who can help, come over!

417
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,119
(Sorry.)

418
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,359
(The person you are calling)

419
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,599
(is busy.)

420
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:33,240
Mr. Huo.

421
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,960
Take a look.

422
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,040
Shishi, take a look at this.

423
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,040
This is

424
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,720
the tentative schedule

425
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,320
for today's interview.

426
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:39,679
We'll film one part first.

427
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:40,439
If there's any problem,

428
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,359
tell us anytime.

429
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,320
Xu Lai.

430
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,639
Why isn't Captain Jin here yet?

431
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:47,240
Sorry, Director.

432
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,199
He should be on his way.

433
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:48,760
Please wait a little longer.

434
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,080
Sorry, everyone.

435
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
How long does it take?

436
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,320
Shishi's schedule

437
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
has been arranged.

438
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,839
All of you are not punctual.

439
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,040
Yes. How did you communicate with him?

440
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:59,520
Didn't you arrange the schedule

441
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,280
for the guests?

442
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,000
Sorry.

443
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,960
What's the use of apologizing?

444
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,560
Director.

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
What do you think about this?

446
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,040
Let's prepare

447
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:10,919
a backup solution.

448
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,080
If Captain Jin

449
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,240
cannot be here on time,

450
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:15,320
the host can ask me

451
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,639
and Ms. Yu Shishi more questions

452
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,639
to fill the time.

453
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,839
Ms. Yu Shishi and I

454
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,919
will collaborate soon.

455
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,960
Just think of it as a promotion
to kick things off.

456
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,359
I believe

457
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,399
Shishi is willing to cooperate,

458
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,199
right?

459
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,599
Since Mr. Huo said that,

460
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
I won't refuse.

461
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,560
That's great.

462
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,760
We'll do that.

463
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:39,879
Hurry.

464
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
Anyone else?

465
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,359
We don't have enough people!

466
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,439
Come and help!

467
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,520
Come. Follow me.

468
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,639
Come. I'll help.

469
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,119
Everyone together.

470
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,520
- Come!
- Come!

471
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,679
One. Two. Three!

472
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,800
A little harder!

473
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:04,679
The car is lifted.

474
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,800
A little more!

475
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,159
One. Two. Three!

476
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,000
Everyone, move.

477
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Make way for medical personnel.

478
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,280
Hurry.

479
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,520
The victim is conscious.

480
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,919
His leg was caught under the car.

481
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,720
Hurry and take a look.

482
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,639
Got it. Thank you.

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,159
Hold on.

484
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,199
I'll leave the rest to you.

485
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,320
Let me get you some water.

486
00:25:59,359 --> 00:25:59,839
Wait here.

487
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,599
Huo Yanzong.

488
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,599
That host, Xu Lai.

489
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,839
You like her, right?

490
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,439
Yes.

491
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,320
I'm so disappointed.

492
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,480
She is too normal

493
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,800
to become my love rival.

494
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,240
Both of you won't be love rivals

495
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,000
because I won't give you

496
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:27,839
this opportunity.

497
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm just joking.

498
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,839
Why are you so serious?

499
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
Are you afraid that she will mind?

500
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,560
She doesn't mind. I do.

501
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:38,887
Do you like her so much

502
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,679
to the point of preparing to marry her?

503
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,280
That's right.

504
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,159
I will marry her.

505
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,760
Xu Lai is the woman I want.

506
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,639
No one knows
what will happen in the future.

507
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,439
Let's see.

508
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,520
Do you want coffee?

509
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,240
Every department, get ready.

510
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
We have a temporary adjustment

511
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
to the interview content
and guest positions.

512
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:15,520
Xu Lai.

513
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,080
Add a few questions

514
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,159
and interactions

515
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,199
for the guests here.

516
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,119
Hello.

517
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,320
Sorry.

518
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
I had an emergency situation.

519
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,000
I just arrived at the TV station.

520
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,320
You haven't started, right?

521
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:42,560
(Great. I'm coming to pick you up.)

522
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,839
Director.

523
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,040
Captain Jin is downstairs.

524
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,320
He's here?

525
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,880
We don't need to change our plan then.

526
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,280
Stick with the original plan.

527
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,679
Prepare the opening.

528
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,080
Director, I know Captain Jin.

529
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,599
I'll go welcome him.

530
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,639
Go on.

531
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,919
Zhou.

532
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,919
Xin, what is it?

533
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,800
Are you going

534
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,080
to pick up Captain Jin Shichuan?

535
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:13,080
Yes.

536
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,280
Let me go instead.

537
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,439
I can even run through the questions

538
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,080
with Captain Jin

539
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,480
to lighten Xu Lai's workload.

540
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Go back and help Xu Lai.

541
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,159
Sure. Thank you, Xin.

542
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,159
You're welcome.

543
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,439
You must be Captain Jin Shichuan.

544
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,720
I am Xu Lai's colleague.

545
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,839
She asked me to pick you up.

546
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:44,199
This way, please.

547
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,679
I'm late.

548
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,240
Will it affect

549
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,679
Xu Lai's work?

550
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:49,879
The director

551
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:50,800
was not happy at first.

552
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,000
Thankfully,

553
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,879
Mr. Huo was there

554
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,280
and helped Xu Lai.

555
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,240
Everyone in the station

556
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,439
envies Xu Lai.

557
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,839
She has Mr. Huo,

558
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,839
a gentle and considerate fiancé.

559
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:03,839
Fiancé?

560
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,679
Yes.

561
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,639
Everyone in the TV station knows

562
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:07,839
Xu Lai has

563
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,919
a special relationship with Mr. Huo.

564
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,159
Mr. Huo also said

565
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,560
that he is

566
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
going to marry Xu Lai soon.

567
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,080
Why?

568
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,919
Didn't Xu Lai tell you?

569
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
I spoke too much.

570
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,919
Perhaps she doesn't want you to know.

571
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,599
Don't tell her that I told you about it.

572
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,480
Huo, your mic dropped.

573
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:46,879
Let me help you.

574
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,000
Here.

575
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,439
Captain Jin. This way, please.

576
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,760
Thank you.

577
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,839
You are finally here.

578
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,839
I've been waiting for you.

579
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,199
I have something to ask you. Just now...

580
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:13,879
Captain Jin.

581
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:14,800
Hello.

582
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,879
I am the director

583
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,679
in charge of this show.

584
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,599
This is

585
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,720
the schedule for today's interview.

586
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Please take a look.

587
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,760
This way, please.

588
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:23,919
Wardrobe.

589
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,639
Adjust Captain Jin's outfit.

590
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,720
Xu Lai, get ready.

591
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:29,800
All right.

592
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,839
Welcome to Huaigang Interview.

593
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,280
We have invited

594
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,080
three guests today.

595
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,679
They are a firefighter,

596
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,839
an entrepreneur and a young actress.

597
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,800
All three of them
might have different careers

598
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,399
but they are also Huaigang's

599
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,480
outstanding youths.

600
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,080
I'm honored to invite the three of them

601
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
to our interview.

602
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,760
I believe all of you

603
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,119
want to know more about their stories

604
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,119
just like me.

605
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,080
Next,

606
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,720
let's begin with
our firefighter's introduction.

607
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,919
This is the captain of

608
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,320
Huaigang City
Emergency Response Unit First Brigade,

609
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,960
Jin Shichuan.

610
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,639
I heard Captain Jin

611
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,599
just rushed here from a scene.

612
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:21,760
Yes.

613
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,520
Captain Jin is not just

614
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,679
the captain of a brigade.

615
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:26,560
He is also

616
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,040
the team leader
of the earthquake rescue team.

617
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,080
The earthquake rescue team

618
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,320
has just been formed recently.

619
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,160
I am also lucky enough
to be a part of it.

620
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:32,879
At the same time,

621
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,000
I documented

622
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,599
the process of the formation
of the team.

623
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,639
(Everyone in the TV station knows)

624
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,919
(Xu Lai has a special relationship)

625
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,800
(with Mr. Huo.)

626
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,040
As a firefighter,

627
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,879
Captain Jin has to go through

628
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,320
various rescue
and disaster relief missions

629
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,320
every day.

630
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,439
Captain Jin,

631
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,000
in your past missions,

632
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,439
do you have any memorable people

633
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,199
or incidents

634
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,439
that you can share with us?

635
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,839
My most memorable incident

636
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,839
should be the Huining earthquake

637
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,720
from ten years ago.

638
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,919
That was

639
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,040
my first rescue mission.

640
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,879
I was still a rookie
in the fire department.

641
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,090
(Providing aid during disasters)

642
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,240
(2012·Huining)

643
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,000
(When I first saw)

644
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,679
(the scene of a disaster)

645
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,800
(from up close,)

646
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,040
(I couldn't describe how tragic it was)

647
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,439
(with words.)

648
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,280
Is the rope over there?

649
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Yes.

650
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,879
Stay.

651
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:43,960
This is

652
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,520
my first mission with you.

653
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,760
Windchase, do your best.

654
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,399
Let's go.

655
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,960
(The collapsed houses)

656
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:52,240
(and injured people.)

657
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,240
(Their home)

658
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,879
(no longer existed.)

659
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,800
(As a member of the
earthquake rescue team,)

660
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
(we were running against time.)

661
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,919
(Search-and-rescue operations
were ongoing every day and night)

662
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,000
(to transport the injured to safety.)

663
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,159
(If we could rescue victims)

664
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
(a minute earlier,)

665
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,599
(they would have more hope
of surviving.)

666
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,960
How is it over there?

667
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,199
Chuan!

668
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:25,320
How is it?

669
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,800
Looking at the situation,

670
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,919
I don't think we will
find any more survivors.

671
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:33,599
Let's keep searching.

672
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,399
What if there's a miracle?

673
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,199
Attention, everyone!

674
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,199
The leader says
there will be aftershocks.

675
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,399
Retreat accordingly! Hurry!

676
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,839
Let's retreat first.

677
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:48,520
Retreat!

678
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,599
Windchase.

679
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,799
Fang Huai! Someone's here!

680
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,440
Quick! Come and help us!

681
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,080
All right!

682
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,560
Up!

683
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,239
One!

684
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,279
Two!

685
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,639
Three!

686
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,440
Be careful!

687
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
After that rescue,

688
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,040
I realized how fragile life is.

689
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,639
I also see how tough life is.

690
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,840
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

691
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,520
we should still be persistent
and not give up.

692
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
So, it became

693
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,920
my mission and my duty since then.

694
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:19,920
Thanks to Captain Jin

695
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,880
for sharing his story.

696
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,040
After hearing his story,

697
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:22,920
I can also feel

698
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,279
the greatness of a firefighter.

699
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,759
They sacrifice themselves

700
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,599
to rescue the people

701
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,880
and are the heroes of this time.

702
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,119
Any line of work

703
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,239
has its master.

704
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,000
Regardless of

705
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,159
the position we are in,

706
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:35,119
we can also

707
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,400
have a special life.

708
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,820
(A tribute to the firefighters!)

709
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,360
Mr. Huo, you've worked hard.

710
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,159
I was worried

711
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:41,920
that you'd be nervous.

712
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,199
I didn't expect you to do so well.

713
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,520
Are you free after the show?

714
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,759
What's wrong?

715
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,119
I'll be waiting for you outside.

716
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,400
I have something to ask you.

717
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,480
Sure.

718
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:50,679
Xu Lai.

719
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:51,400
I need you to record

720
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,319
the section's narration.

721
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,199
No problem.

722
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,719
Wait for me.

723
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:57,271
Mr. Huo.

724
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,319
Sorry, Director.

725
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,040
I have other schedules today.

726
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,799
Please go to

727
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,799
Yunkai's PR department

728
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
for the followup work.

729
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,400
I will remember this.

730
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,480
Thank you, everyone.

731
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,279
You've worked hard.

732
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,799
Let's meet again soon.

733
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,000
All right. Let's meet again.

734
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:31,880
During the Huining earthquake,

735
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,480
Xu Lai was supposed

736
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,840
to go there with me.

737
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,360
If I wasn't late,

738
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,480
she wouldn't even know you.

739
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Why are you telling me this?

740
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,239
I already told you

741
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,400
to stay away from Xu Lai.

742
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,880
Who are you

743
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,840
to tell me that?

744
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,759
Who are you

745
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,159
to disturb our relationship?

746
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,920
Because I love her.

747
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,520
I have been the one

748
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,080
to be by Xu Lai's side all these years

749
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,679
and not you.

750
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,159
No one can replace

751
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,880
my relationship with Xu Lai.

752
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,199
Xu Lai will still choose me

753
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,360
in the end.

754
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,560
Are you two going to be married?

755
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,799
Yes.

756
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,360
Why do I feel like

757
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,199
it's your one-sided love

758
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,679
between you and that host?

759
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,560
Is this any of your business?

760
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,599
It's none of my business at first.

761
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,520
But I see

762
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,920
she is not interested in you at all.

763
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
So I'm feeling anxious for you.

764
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:10,560
Why don't I help you?

765
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,960
Jealousy is the best way to test

766
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,920
whether a person cares about you.

767
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,360
What?

768
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:25,360
Yu Shishi.

769
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,639
What's wrong?

770
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,560
What are you doing?

771
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,040
Let go.

772
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,960
Ask him what he did.

773
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,119
What's wrong, Huo?

774
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,239
I don't know.

775
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,840
Captain Jin suddenly grabbed my collar.

776
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,239
Is there

777
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,000
a misunderstanding?

778
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,360
It's not worth
protecting someone like him.

779
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,319
I'm fine, Xu Lai.

780
00:38:59,279 --> 00:38:59,719
There might be

781
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
a misunderstanding
between Captain Jin and me.

782
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,480
It's fine.

783
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,840
I was being nosy.

784
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,520
Huo.

785
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,279
What happened just now?

786
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:16,840
Why was he angry?

787
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,319
Didn't I tell you?

788
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,279
I really don't know.

789
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,199
He doesn't feel like someone
who will get angry

790
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,040
for no reason.

791
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Since you trust him so much,

792
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,360
why are you still protecting me?

793
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,199
Of course.

794
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,679
We have known each other
for more than a decade.

795
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,360
If something happens to you,

796
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
I'll rush in to protect you immediately.

797
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,920
I think

798
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,639
there's a misunderstanding.

799
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:33,960
I believe in you

800
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,199
and also believe in Jin Shichuan.

801
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,599
Don't take it to heart.

802
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:38,759
Don't worry.

803
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,599
I'm fine.

804
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:50,159
Captain Jin is back.

805
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,920
Captain Jin is back.

806
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,920
- Captain Jin!
- Captain Jin!

807
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,719
You're back?

808
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,400
Captain Jin.

809
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:56,799
How is it?

810
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,639
Did the show

811
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,639
go well?

812
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,319
Of course.

813
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:00,920
With Xu Lai there,

814
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,719
it would go well.

815
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
I can imagine them

816
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,119
sending love signals on the show.

817
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,000
I envy you.

818
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:08,400
Let's find those signals

819
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,000
on the show.

820
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,799
- Sure!
- No problem!

821
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:10,799
What?

822
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,279
Are you very free?

823
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,480
Did you quarrel with Xu Lai?

824
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,119
Don't mention her.

825
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,119
(My most memorable incident...)

826
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,960
Hey.

827
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,960
(It should be ten years ago.)

828
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,520
Captain Jin,

829
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,880
don't be nervous when you go on TV.

830
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:36,040
Ms. Xu looks good on camera.

831
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:39,279
Darn it. Huo Yanzong is so handsome.

832
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,639
How is he handsome?

833
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:43,239
I don't think so at all.

834
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,599
He's definitely

835
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,840
not as handsome as Captain Jin.

836
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,679
But Captain Jin,

837
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,560
you should

838
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,360
smile on the show at least.

839
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,360
Look how gloomy you are.

840
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:52,696
I think he's fine.

841
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,360
What? I'm right.

842
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,400
What should he do then?

843
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,840
No. His face is quite gloomy.

844
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,279
Look.

845
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,679
He is even gloomier now.

846
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,520
Squad Leader.

847
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:03,960
Huo Yanzong is Yunkai's boss

848
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,000
at a young age.

849
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,560
He's rich and capable.

850
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,119
I'm sure many girls like him.

851
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,840
Definitely. I'm so envious of him.

852
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,480
What's so good

853
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,319

854
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,799

No.

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,599
