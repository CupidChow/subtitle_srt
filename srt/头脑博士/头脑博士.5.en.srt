[Myung, in Korean] You must be Sewon.

00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,448
My name is Taesuk Myung.

3
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,619
I'm a scientist who studies the brain.

DR. BRAIN

00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,488
Are you sure he's here?

17
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,157
The bus driver said he got off here.

18
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,827

we're in the middle of nowhere.

21
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,721
He joined our temple stay program
late last night.

22
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:47,728
The morning service will start soon,
so he's probably at the main temple.

23
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,771
Thank you.

28
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,770
[sobs] Please.

00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,899
Please.

00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,488
Why would you do something so stupid?

32
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,542
-Don't put this on me, all right?
-[cries] No, wait!

33
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,502
Don't move!

34
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,803

You see, I'm a fair man.

I treat kids and adults the same.

Jaemin!

-Jaemin, you can't go in there.

63
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,471
Isn't this a lovely house?

64
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,015

65
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,601
-Hello.
-[Myung] Hi.

66
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,272
Say hello to Dr. Myung, huh?

67
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,734
So glad to see you, Sewon.

68
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,155
Since your mom's gone,

69
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,782
you're going to live
at this house with me, okay?

70
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,369
Let's go pick out your room. [mutters]

71
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,958
Hmm? There are many to choose from.
Pick your favorite.

72
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,019
You like this one?

73
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,028
Okay, then. This is your room now.

[knocking]

76
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,860
Wow, you're already studying
quantum mechanics?

77
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,363
I find these concepts interesting,
so I've been applying it here and there.

78
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,452
[chuckles] Oh, really?
What are your theories?

79
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,999
If we can induce entanglement
between two brains…

80
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,962
my theory is that
the brains could communicate.

81
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:39,092
Communication between brains
through quantum mechanics?

82
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,597
[laughs] Wow, what a hypothesis!

83
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,974
But…

84
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,271
how about you look into
something more practical and realistic?

85
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,776
[scoffs]

86
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:01,907
This theory is realistic
and practical enough.

87
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,245
And I'm going to prove it.

88
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:15,379
A company in San Jose has agreed
to invest a lot of money in our research.

89
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,799
[laughs] No one would believe it.

90
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,176
Every company in Korea turned us down,

91
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,763
but those folks in San Jose recognized
the value of our work.

92
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,642
I looked into this so-called sponsor.
I don't think he'd be interested

93
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,853
in scientific research
that wouldn't make him any money.

94
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,146
Isn't it strange, though?

95
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,899
He might make unethical
or unreasonable demands.

96
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:36,984
Sewon,

97
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,529
we'll never get an opportunity
like this again.

98
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,072
You're wrong.

99
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,491
I think he's using you.

100
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,328
You know it,
and you're still going with it.

101
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,621
Sewon!

102
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,252
I'm not going to the US.

103
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,883
And I think it's time I left this house.

104
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:05,888
Thank you for dinner.

105
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:40,589
Oh, my. Look at you.
You don't look so well. [chuckles]

106
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,300
How long has it been?

107
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,137
Why did it take you so long
to come see me?

108
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,069
This is Yoon, my personal secretary.

109
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,072
He's been helping in so many ways
because of my physical condition.

110
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,323
[chuckles]

111
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,578
I just came from Saera Clinic.

112
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,373
So you met Dr. Hyun.

113
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,875
I saw a picture
of the research team in the US.

114
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,630
Such brilliant minds.
You'll get to meet them very soon.

115
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,715
I know most of them already.

116
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,931
I know that you had something to do
with Doyoon's disappearance.

117
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,812
Where's my son?

118
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,105
[breathes shakily]

119
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,152
[laughs]

120
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,905
Are you expressing anger?

121
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,617
You can express emotions now?

122
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,079
How did that happen, I wonder? [laughs]

123
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,123
I'm not here to talk.

124
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,084
I want to see my son now!

125
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,713
All right.

126
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,634
I understand how you feel about your son.
I feel that way about you.

127
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,137
But first…

128
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,639
[whispers indistinctly]

129
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,683
Yeah.

130
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,571
But first listen carefully
to what I'm saying.

131
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,074
Hopefully you'll make the right choice.

132
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,759
You're gonna tell me everything
about the person behind this.

133
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,518
An innocent officer died,

134
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,855
a man like a brother to me,
my colleague of ten years,

135
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,608
because of you.

136
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,903
[cries]

137
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,573
And your mother…

138
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,244
her life was threatened,
and she's lost a finger.

139
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,122
What?

140
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,165
The bastard tortured her.

141
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,212
She kept silent to protect you.

142
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,298
[sobbing]

143
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,597
[sighs]

144
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,057
[sniffles]

145
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,268
[sniffles]

146
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,111
There are more.

147
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,865
There are more innocent people
who died because of me.

148
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:58,328
I had three great opportunities
in my life,

149
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,290
and I took all of them.

150
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:08,255
The first was meeting you,
my inspiration for this research project.

151
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:15,470
The second was receiving funding
to go to the US.

152
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,600
12 YEARS AGO
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA

153
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:27,357
All right, this talented young man
is Dr. Namil Hong.

154
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,443
He's a rising star in neural nets,
machine learning,

155
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,237
and digital neuron modeling.

156
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,365
-Nice to meet you. I'm Soojung Hyun.
-I'm Namil Hong.

157
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,533
My name is Yoojin.

158
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:37,784
Nice to meet you.

159
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,786
[in English] This is Dr. Hong.

160
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,038
[Namil, in Korean] At the time,

161
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,498
I thought I'd never get
an opportunity like it again.

162
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,044
Um, excuse me.

163
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,923
Why don't any of these people have
emergency contacts?

164
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,883
Most of them are also malnourished.

165
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,177
I guess they need extra care then.

166
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,556
[Namil] That's when I knew…

167
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,018
that something wasn't right.

168
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,270
CLINICOLABORATORY

169
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,648
They were all homeless people
from shelters.

170
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,027
No one would fight for them
if anything went wrong.

171
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,612
They were powerless.

172
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,991
[Myung] Increase the stimulation
to 14 hertz.

173
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,160
Increasing to 14 hertz.

174
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,789
His vitals are unstable.
I think we need to stop.

175
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,082
[Hyun] What?

176
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,125
No, we must continue.

177
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,128
If we stop now, the data will be useless.

178
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,673
-Increase to 170 hertz at 3.5 volts.
-A hundred…

179
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,592
Wait. No, no. That's dangerous.

180
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,885
Keep going.

181
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,807
Continuing at 170 hertz at 3.5 volts.

182
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:43,892
[sighs]

183
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,186
[rapid beeping]

184
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,230
[gags]

185
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,528
[Namil] The test subject lost
all of his memories.

186
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,074
But even after that,
the experiments continued.

187
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,535
[Myung] When did the symptoms begin?

188
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,124
It's been 11 hours.

189
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,962
[Myung] It seems like sensory loss, right?

190
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,090
[Yoojin] Yes.
Would you like me to make note of this?

191
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,884
[Myung] Hmm.

192
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,193
[Myung] Of course,
we had our share of trial and error.

193
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,612
[rapid beeping]

194
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,115
[panting]

195
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,826
[grunting]

196
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,538
[steady beep]

197
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,458
[Namil] We lost another one.

198
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,378
Even after the second and third deaths…

199
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,172
It's already our third failure.

200
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,050
[Namil] They were obsessed
with the research.

201
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,219
Because it almost worked once.

202
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,637
[sighs]

203
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,056
-[Myung] It was unfortunate…
-Isn't it a living being?

204
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,142
…but the tests yielded
extremely valuable data.

205
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,941
None of this would have been possible
without the team's passion.

206
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,110
It was madness.

207
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,031
Eventually, it caught up to them.

208
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:27,204
[Myung] Insignificant problems led
to severe restrictions.

209
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,541
The government opened an investigation
into the experiment process.

210
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,000
Aren't you overreacting?

211
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,462
They knew there would be risks
and signed the agreements.

212
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:37,464
We have their signed consent.

213
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,924
Forget what's legal or not.

214
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,552
The problem is
that we used homeless people.

215
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,929
I understand
why the sponsor may be nervous.

216
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,432
Exposure to something like this will be
a huge blow to him and his company.

217
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,060
This means that Dr. Myung,
as the lead researcher,

218
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,436
will be held responsible.

219
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,190
Same for you, Yoojin,
since you conducted the tests.

220
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,026
[Yoon] For now,
you will all return to Korea.

221
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,447
We must keep
what transpired here between us.

222
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:07,703
Of course,
we must never betray one another.

223
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,085
What does my son have to do with this?

224
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,254
[Myung] Listen to the rest of my story!

225
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,218
Officially, we terminated the experiments.

226
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:26,180
Our sponsor and I were determined

227
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:31,977
not to give up on the progress we'd made.

228
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,688
So… [laughs]

229
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:40,485
…we came back home
and continued the research.

230
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,571
[laughs]

231
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,989
Once in a while,

232
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,327
you'd provide tremendous inspiration.

233
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,246
What are you talking about?

234
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,664
Sewon,

235
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:57,836
we've been research partners
the whole time.

236
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,759
Was Dr. Hong keeping an eye on me?

237
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,303
I had no choice.

238
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,098
Had I refused, there was no telling
what they would have done to me.

239
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,769
Dr. Yoojin was placed
as the head of BC Medical Center.

240
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:19,066
I acted like Sewon's assistant
and shared the lab reports with them.

241
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,361
I was a spy.

242
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,830
COPYING 41 FILES
FROM BC MEDICAL TO LOCAL DISK

243
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,837
[Namil] But as time passed,
I grew fond of him.

244
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,051
I'd like to apply your research proposal
on axion voltage.

245
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,013
Really?

246
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,975
Yeah. It's a little better
than the existing academic data.

247
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,227
[Namil] I really liked the guy.

248
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,646
-You may not believe me…
-I didn't put that much effort into it.

249
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,357
-…but it's the truth.
-But let's do it!

250
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:10,450
We're waiting on the results,
but I'll check again once we get them.

251
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,618
[Yoojin] Hello.

252
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,086
[Namil] Then, one day,
the accident happened.

253
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,764
Everyone called Sewon crazy
for showing up to work

254
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:36,643
the day after his son's funeral.

255
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,898
Sewon, you good?

256
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,399
No.

257
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,904
I'm having trouble with the fiber optics.

258
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,531
No, not that. [sighs]
I'm talking about you.

259
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,661
Sorry.

260
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,583
[sighs] I can't imagine how you feel,

261
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,002
how broken your heart must be.

262
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,589
I can't even imagine.

263
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:12,471
A broken heart changes nothing.

264
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,019
How's your wife?

265
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,854
She's acting irrationally.

266
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,398
She's going through a lot.

267
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,444
She believes Doyoon is alive.

268
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:32,616
She's suffering from hallucinations
due to extreme stress.

269
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,161
Turn the centrifuge on.

270
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,834
[centrifuge whirs]

271
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,468
Dr. Koh's wife attempted suicide
soon after?

272
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,846
Yes.

273
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,600
Did Dr. Koh seem suspicious
about what happened to his wife?

274
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,352
No, he didn't.

275
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,857
He was the same as always,
to the point I felt really sorry for him.

276
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,776
But I didn't find
anything different about him.

277
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,861
Until then.

278
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,280
Until then?

279
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,950
Someone came to see me.

280
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,963
There was something suspicious about him.

281
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,299
Oh, Dr. Namil Hong?

282
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,551
Yes, hello. How can I help you?

283
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,720
You work with Dr. Sewon Koh, yes?

284
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,680
I do. Who are you?

285
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,764
Ah.

286
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,102
I'm an investigator
from Hanshin Life Insurance.

287
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:43,896
KANGMU LEE,
HANSHIN LIFE INSURANCE

288
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,523
Dr. Koh recently took out
a policy in his wife's name.

289
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,568
I'm reaching out
to a few of his acquaintances.

290
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,069
Just protocol.

291
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,074
[Namil] I knew Sewon had
no interest in money.

292
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,953
So, I reported it to Dr. Myung.
To Secretary Yoon, actually.

293
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,957
Yoon said he would take care of it.

294
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,377
Also…

295
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,379
[reporter on TV]
Kangmu Lee, a former detective,

296
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:12,966
has died in a car crash after his vehicle
slipped off the road in the rain.

297
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,260
There were no other passengers in the car.

298
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,013
The police are looking for witnesses.

299
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,641
They believe that he was
either driving under the influence

300
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,351
or was falling asleep at the wheel.

301
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,478
[Namil] That's when I realized…

302
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:29,858
what happened to Sewon
wasn't a coincidence.

303
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,069
His son died in a fire.

304
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,656
His wife attempted suicide.

305
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,492
And the investigator
looking into him died.

306
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,287
All this right after I,
like a fool, told Yoon.

307
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,541
Yet you didn't share any of this
with the police.

308
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,625
[sniffles]

309
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,585
You didn't tell Dr. Koh.

310
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,840
I thought they would kill me if I did.

311
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:53,924
[scoffs]

312
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,762
But then there was
an unexpected opportunity…

313
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,474
and I acted impulsively.

314
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,273
Kangmu Lee's body turned up at our morgue.

315
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,483
You have access to the morgue.

316
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,652
[sighs]

317
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,654
Wait, Sewon!

318
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,197
[sighs]

319
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,367
If you want it so badly…

320
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,578
I do have an idea.

321
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:25,914
You mean you led Dr. Koh
to Kangmu Lee's body on purpose?

322
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,416
Why?

323
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,837
I was hoping he'd find some evidence
by syncing with Kangmu.

324
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:39,303
[Myung] Sewon, I'm dying.

325
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:44,933
Cancer has spread
to almost every organ in my body.

326
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:48,729
I'd say I'm essentially
a dead man already.

327
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:49,855
[chuckles]

328
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,940
Isn't that a shame?

329
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,195
Everything inside me is rotting.

330
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,031
Don't expect any sympathy from me.

331
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,575
I'm only here for my son.

332
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,203
You spend your life studying and learning,

333
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:08,165
and just when you think
you're starting to get it, you die.

334
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,169
Then the newborns have to start it
all over again.

335
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:19,343
If you want the world to truly advance,
valuable brains must be preserved!

336
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:26,058
And that's why I'm going to take something
only possible in sci-fi or religion,

337
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,977
and turn it into reality.

338
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,313
I've made the resolution…

339
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,400
and have finally succeeded.

340
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,867
Immortality.

341
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:48,705
Immortality?

342
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,461
Why are we talking about
such a delusional concept right now?

343
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,713
You've experienced it.

344
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,424
If you brain sync with the dead,
their memories,

345
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:05,013
habits, hobbies
and preferences are passed on to you.

346
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:08,684
Then, if you take a few more steps,

347
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,688
wouldn't you be able to transfer
an entire human consciousness into AI?

348
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:15,941
Don't tell me…

349
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,195
That's right, Sewon.

350
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:25,450
I'm going to transfer
my consciousness to your son,

351
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,079
who has the same brain structure as you.

352
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:33,876
This is my gift to humanity.

353
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,255
Our entry into the realm of gods.

354
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,258
[wheezes, coughing]

355
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:59,026
An exceptionally large hippocampus,

356
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:06,700
young, lively neurons
and extreme neuroplasticity…

357
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,873
Doyoon's brain is perfect.

358
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,838
The third great opportunity in my life

359
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:25,844
was meeting your son, Doyoon.

360
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,639
You're out of your mind.

361
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,099
[sighs]

362
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,601
Son…

363
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:39,191
You are a scientist.
Don't be illogical and misunderstand me.

364
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:45,697
[in distance] This isn't simply
a base ambition to extend one's life.

365
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:49,201
Its value is transcendent.

366
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,162
Just imagine…

367
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,960
my consciousness in Doyoon's brain.

368
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:05,509
I will become both your father and son.

369
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,556
If what you're saying is true…

370
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:14,852
my son will be lost forever.

371
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,190
He'll be nothing but a hollow shell,
you fucking psycho!

372
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,401
[grunts]

373
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,112
-Speak! Where is my son?
-[chokes, grunts]

374
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:26,280
Tell me!

375
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,614
Tell me!

376
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,907
I said tell me!

377
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,200
[grunts]

378
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:43,839
[Sewon groans]

379
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,051
[Myung] You've changed so much.

380
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:55,184
Your willingness to sacrifice yourself
for your son is admirable.

381
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,688
You don't want to lose him.

382
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,860
I feel the same.

383
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,615
I can't lose you either.

384
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,957
I'd like to take more time
to think it over,

385
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,044
but I'm running out of time.

386
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,757
My body will soon expire.

387
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,384
[groans]

388
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:36,308
It will all be over by this time tomorrow.

389
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:44,816
[sighs]

390
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,781
I knew they were coming for me.

391
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,367
That's why I ran.

392
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:58,497
So, you know nothing
about the man who tried to kill you?

393
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,962
Wait, I met him once.

394
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:08,549
Where?

395
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,592
Secretary Yoon instructed me
to hand him the lab reports.

396
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,594
It was an alley in some obscure place.

397
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,889
After I handed in the reports,
I think I saw him talking to someone

398
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:22,771
who runs a temp agency
or a debt collection company.

399
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,315
They looked like they knew each other.

400
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,955
QUICK LOANS

401
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,308
I'm looking for someone.

402
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,977
Do you know this man?

403
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,691
I'm not sure.
I don't think I've seen him before.

404
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:53,654
A lot of people take temp jobs here,

405
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,406
so it's hard for me
to remember every face.

406
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,825
Is that right?

407
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,078
How can I help you remember?

408
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,372
[sighs]

409
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,755
[sniffs, spits]

410
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,717
[breathing heavily]

411
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,306
[cell phone vibrates]

412
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,144
MR. CHANG - RUN

413
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:32,985
[gasps]

414
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,611
[grunting]

415
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,577
[grunting]

416
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,371
Hey, it's the fixer! The fixer!

417
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,516
[tires squeal]

418
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,436
[tires squeal]

419
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:09,897
[Namil groans]

420
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,212
[Choi] Alpha-Romeo B9,
pursuing the suspect!

421
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,756
Block all the routes off Yongin Road!

422
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,900
[sighs]

423
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,069
Damn it.

424
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,118
Officer Kim, block the road over there.

425
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,580
Excuse me, this is a checkpoint.
Where are you coming from?

426
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,046
Oh, man.

427
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,849
I think this is it.

428
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,393
We found the vehicle.

429
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,145
-The suspect isn't here.
-[sighs]

430
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,817
Yeah. No, I won't be able
to travel on the road.

431
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,445
I'm trapped. [laughs]

432
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,700
I don't think I can take
the normal routes right now.

433
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,494
[groans] Shit.

434
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,247
I'm climbing a hill.

435
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,834
I can see…

436
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,175
the Yongin Rest Stop from here.

437
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,052
Stay there. I'll send someone over.

438
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:05,762
[clicks]

439
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:13,645
Will this be a problem for us?

440
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:16,356
I'll make sure it isn't.

441
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:44,927
[sighs]

442
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,113
You figured out the truth…

443
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,617
[sighs]

444
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,328
…but it vanished like smoke.

445
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,082
What are you going to do now?

446
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,503
I don't know.

447
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,421
[sighs]

448
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,634
We can't just sit around.
We have to find a way.

449
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,470
We're out of time.

450
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,015
If I don't find Doyoon now…

451
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,812
he will cease to exist.

452
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,529
Jaeyi kept telling me he was alive.

453
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,243
But I was lost in my own little world.

454
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,412
I…

455
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,126
I ruined my family. This is on me.

456
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:00,836
[breathes shakily]

457
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,339
So ultimately, your wife was right.

458
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:09,970
I wonder how she knew.

459
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,436
She must have seen…

460
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,190
or heard something.

461
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,741
[clicking]

462
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,128
[clicking fades out]

463
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,714
Yes, Jaeyi.

464
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,383
She must've seen an important clue.

465
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,553
So, now you know what to do.

466
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,013
But to sync with Jaeyi,

467
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,891
I need Dr. Hong.

468
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,563
Can you forgive him?

469
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,859
I don't have time to worry about that.

470
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,487
I need Dr. Hong now.

471
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,533
Where's my phone?

472
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,377
Answer the phone.

473
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,844
Hello?

474
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,679
[Sewon] Namil.

475
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,143
Sewon…

476
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,271
[sniffles]

477
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,900
-I'm sorry.
-Not now.

478
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,362
Dr. Hong, I need your help.

479
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:53,615
Tell me. I'll do anything.

480
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,784
I need to sync with Jaeyi one more time.

481
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:58,829
A living subject's brain waves are
too volatile to sync with!

482
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,747
That's why I need you.

483
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,959
Jaeyi or I could have seizures
at any moment.

484
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,462
I need someone to monitor the sync.

485
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:08,755
Namil…

486
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:12,384
this is the last chance
for me to find Doyoon.

487
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,095
Please.

488
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,052
Why the fuck are you sitting
in the corner? I couldn't find you.

489
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:56,637
Hey, man.

490
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,392
What's up? Let's go.

491
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,067

00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:45,602
-Where's the car?
-Over there.

497
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,918
-You alone?
-Yes.

498
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,842
You gonna be okay at the checkpoint?

499
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,178
No worries.

There's the entrance.

00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,979
-Did you call?
-Yeah, I think I saw this man.

518
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:35,063
Where?

519
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,467
-Block off the entire area.
-Yes, ma'am.

522
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,125
Jaeyi.

523
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,587
Help me find Doyoon.

524
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:44,758
Sewon.

525
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:45,884
Let's begin.

526
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,557
[whirring]

527
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:36,768
Huh?

528
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,271
I thought you couldn't make it.

529
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,656
It's been a while.

530
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,701
Huh? This place?

531
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,953
[chuckles] I guess so.

532
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:57,080
We haven't been here since we got married.

533
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:00,584
It's good to see you,
even though most of this isn't real.

534
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,085
Thank goodness.

535
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:03,712
[chuckles]

536
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,464
What's gotten into you?

537
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,424
Jaeyi.

538
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,094
There's something
I have to tell you right now.

539
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,013
Right now? Um…

540
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,265
Now's not a good time.

541
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,104
I've invited someone else
because you told me you couldn't make it.

542
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:24,233
This is really important.

543
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,155
I know this will be hard
for you to understand,

544
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,240
but hear me out.

545
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,867
Remember the research
I've been working on?

546
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:37,621
The technology that enables
one brain to communicate with another.

547
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:38,997
[sighs]

548
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,875
I finally made it work. So, I'm…

549
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,879
I'm inside your brain.

550
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,507
What are you talking about?

551
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,467
-You're in a coma right now.
-What?

552
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,094
After you fell into a coma,

553
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:56,139
I threw myself into my research.

554
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,851
-I wanted to save you and talk to you.
-[sighs]

555
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,436
This is why we're able to talk right now.

556
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,397
You're being ridiculous.

557
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:05,941
Jaeyi.

558
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,526
[sighs]

559
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:11,029
Everything you said was true.

560
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:14,199
Doyoon…

561
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,910
Our son is alive.

562
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,875
I came all the way here to find Doyoon.

563
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,545
There are clues in your memories.

564
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,213
So, please help me out.

565
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,509
Why?

566
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,638
Why are you talking nonsense?

567
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,766
What's wrong with you, seriously?

568
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:43,729
[Junki] Jaeyi.

569
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,276
What are you doing here, Dr. Koh?

570
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:52,738
I need to speak to my wife.

571
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,990
You're making things awkward
by showing up.

572
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,450
Give us a minute.

573
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,411
Are you okay with that, Jaeyi?

574
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,835
Let's talk at home later.

575
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:09,046
Jaeyi, wait. Just listen to me.
What happens now is important.

576
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,340
[Junki] She doesn't want to.

577
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,135
This doesn't concern you.

578
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,179
Were you ever concerned about her?

579
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,266
Who do you think you are, huh?

580
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,602
This is none of your business!

581
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:30,108
-Jaeyi, let's go. Let's talk outside.
-What is wrong with you?

582
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,446
You can't talk to her like that!

583
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:39,535
-Who do you think you are, huh?
-[Jaeyi screams]

584
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:40,619
Huh?

585
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,623
Please stop!

586
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,337
Jaeyi.

587
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,505
Jaeyi!

588
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:54,383
Jaeyi!

589
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:06,645
[sighs]
