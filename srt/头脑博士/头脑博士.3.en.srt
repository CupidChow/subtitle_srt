00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,140
[rattles]

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,809
Who is it?

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,728
It's Kangmu Lee.

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,142
DR. BRAIN

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,734
The night Junki was killed...

6
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,115
I saw a car parked in front of his house.

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,371
The police ran the license plate.

8
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,166
And found out...

9
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,712
The car's yours.

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,718
And?

11
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,722
You still don't trust me?

12
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,017
I told you, I wasn't there.

13
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,312
- I guess you couldn't have been.
- Huh?

14
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,938
Couldn't?

15
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,817
Your car was completely destroyed.

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,489
And you were found dead.

17
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,077
You're saying...

18
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,622
...I'm dead?

19
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,336
Guess you must be high.

20
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,381
Huh? [laughs]

21
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,677
Something must have gone wrong
during the brain sync.

22
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,308
[laughs]

23
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,187
Yeah, the brain sync.

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:32,569
Perhaps you're here now
because you're part of Junki's memories.

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,743
It was my determination to solve this case
which extracted you from his memories.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,123
Since you're an investigator...

27
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,754
...something in my subconscious
knew that you could be helpful.

28
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,800
The man I'm looking at...

29
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,971
...exists inside Junki's memories.

30
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,556
Bullshit.

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,267
That makes no sense at all.

32
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,563
I exist inside Junki's memories?

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,111
Just think about how things went down.

34
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,823
Who did you meet first?

35
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,873
I synced with you...

36
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,544
...before my brain synced with Junki.

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,524
KANGMU LEE, MALE, AGE 46
ADMITTANCE: MARCH 13TH

38
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,672
[Kangmu] That's me?

39
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,939
[Sewon] You were my first brain sync.

40
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,235
But why can't I see your memories?

41
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,948
Instead, why do I see you
as a living person?

42
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,078
Are you trying to tell me that
I've been absorbed by your brain?

43
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,539
Since you were the first one...

44
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,667
Perhaps some error occurred.

45
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,089
And your memories ended up
imprinted into my brain.

46
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,551
Your memories,
your subconscious, all of it.

47
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,888
You've been absorbed into my brain.

48
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,059
That's why I perceive you
as an independent being.

49
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,069
Then what am I?

50
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,449
A ghost?

51
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,495
[laughs]

52
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,002
[electronic voice] The person
you are trying to reach is not--

53
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,546
[scoffs] What the hell's wrong
with that guy?

54
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,842
Why do you think he's trying
to incriminate a dead guy?

55
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,637
He's feeding us false information
to sabotage the investigation.

56
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,515
And trying to show all of us
that he's pretty clever.

57
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,686
- Then let's arrest that asshole.
- Why? For tampering with a corpse?

58
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,104
He'd beat that charge easily.

59
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,856
We have Dr. Koh's location.

60
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,566
Okay, stay on him.

61
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,860
I need a team at his house and at the lab.

62
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,944
Yes, ma'am.

63
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,580
So...

64
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,210
Let's say all that's true.

65
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,634
Let's say I'm dead and I'm a ghost.

66
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,555
Don't you find it strange?

67
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,893
Your first brain sync
just happened to be...

68
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,688
...on the private investigator
hired by your wife's boyfriend?

69
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:39,942
Really?

70
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,945
What are the odds?

71
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,449
You think it's a coincidence?

72
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,119
Tell me that.

73
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,581
Why was I your first one?

74
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:59,503
Recently, we've seen very strong
interest for brain-inspired AI.

75
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,215
That is, AI systems that are inspired
by the structure and functions...

76
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,341
[cell phone vibrating]

77
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,176
...of the human brain.

78
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,178
AI still has a long way to go
when it comes to...

79
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,263
DR. SEWON KOH

80
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,015
...emulating curiosity,
social interaction, metacognition,

81
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,559
and things of that nature.

82
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,270
Our efforts are geared
towards imitating...

83
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,396
[cell phone vibrating]

84
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,981
DR. SEWON KOH

85
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,650
We want AI to be able
to produce its own emotions,

86
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,405
read emotions from other agents,
and also be able to empathize.

87
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,866
And so that's why this brain-inspired AI

88
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,159
is the most important part
of our research...

89
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
Hey, Sewon, I'm in a meeting--

90
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,248
The first body
we used for the brain sync...

91
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,834
Who was it?

92
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,213
How the heck would I know?
What's this about?

93
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,675
Namil... How did you get the body?

94
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,597
What do you mean, how?
I just picked the first one I found.

95
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,516
What's going on? Did something happen?

96
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,601
I need to see you.

97
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
[sighs]

98
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,899
I can't right now. Let's say 10.

99
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,984
At the BB Park Mall.

100
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,694
[Sewon] Okay. See you later.

101
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,196
[line beeps]

102
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,493
I can't wait any longer.

103
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,998
I have to find out what happened to me.

104
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,458
Your accident...

105
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,463
Do you remember anything?

106
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,758
What's the last thing you remember?

107
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,513
Where were you going?

108
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,518
I was on my way to meet Junki.

109
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,370
We're almost there.

110
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,132
[tires screech]

111
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,181
This is it.

112
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,017
This is where your car crashed.

113
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,744
What a shitty way to die.

114
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,667
Maybe I slipped in the rain?

115
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,589
[Sewon] No... I saw something else.

116
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,424
Let's go take a look.

117
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,864
[Kangmu] Is this it?

118
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,117
[sighs]

119
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,288
There were so many things I wanted to do.

120
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,460
I didn't get to say goodbye to my father.

121
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,962
[high-pitched ringing]

122
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,091
What?

123
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,978
[Sewon] You're driving somewhere.

124
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,063
[cell phone vibrating]

125
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,981
- But...
- [Kangmu] But what?

126
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,902
Yes, I'm on my way.

127
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,950
Wait.

128
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,619
I'm being followed.

129
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,207
Let me call you back.

130
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,136

- [tires squealing]
- [strains]

134
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,487
[Sewon] Someone was tailing you.

135
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,615
[Kangmu] I remember.

136
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,700
I thought I threw them off.

137
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,162
[Sewon] But you didn't lose them.

138
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,664
They came back for you.

139
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,215
[grunts]

141
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,574
What?

142
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,545
It wasn't an accident.

143
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,588
What?

144
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,757
You were murdered.

145
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,390
Did you see his face?

146
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,556
Is he still alive?

147
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,020
Why are you digging for info
on Jaeyi Jung?

148
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,440
Who sent you?

149
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,653
He's in bad shape.

150
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,116
He saw our faces.

151
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,167
Let go of me!

152
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,797
- [grunts]
- [splatters]

153
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,341
Why was I killed?

154
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,344
They were after the man who hired you.

155
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,516
Junki Lim?

156
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,435
They killed everyone.

157
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,609
I think Dr. Hong
can help us figure this out.

158
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,493
[sighs]

159
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,959

161
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,414
Going somewhere?

162
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,749
Yeah, I'm going home.

163
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,627
I'm tired. I've been working overtime.

164
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,257
Did you notice anything odd about Dr. Koh?

165
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,260
Well, Dr. Koh's a weirdo,

166
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,388
so I'd say everything
he does is pretty odd.

167
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,977
Fair enough.

168
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,647
Also, Secretary Yoon wants to see you.

169
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,067
Secretary Yoon? For what?

170
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,613
He's pretty concerned
about your recent activities.

171
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,907
He'll reach out to you.

172
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,826
Okay, sure.

173
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,218

Yes?

178
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,625
Got it.

179
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,587
Turn around.
Dr. Koh is heading towards Yongsan.

180
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,257
- Alpha Romeo B9, requesting backup.
- [mutters] Shit...

Anything?

00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,062
His phone's off.

185
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,991
What?

186
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,952
I think that's the man who killed you.

187
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,787
No, wait...

188
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,082
I'll go.

189
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,407
Dr. Sewon Koh.

190
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,705
Let's not make a scene.

191
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,999
Be cool.

192
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,627
[grunts]

193
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,797
[killer] Hey, hey, hey...

194
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,342
That's no way to treat a doctor, right?

195
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,639
[sniffs]

196
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,439
We don't need that. Put it away.

197
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,276
You come with me.

198
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,037
- Upstairs.
- Hmm.

199
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,590
[killer] Most people think
that in a situation like this...

200
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,050
they can just run away.

201
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,429
But it's not that easy.

202
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,639
Think about it.

203
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,352
You never know,
you might just get stabbed in the ribs.

204
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:33,567
Or you might just get stabbed in the back
when you're not even looking.

205
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,112
Imagine I cut your face or your neck.

206
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,947
You wouldn't make a sound.

207
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,367
[inhales] Try not to think about it.

208
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,708
Don't let them take you
or you'll end up like me.

209
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,049
[crowd chatters]

210
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,719
[bystanders scream]

211
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,806
[screams]

212
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,391
- Out of the way!
- [screams]

213
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,354
[panting]

214
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,772
[door handle rattles]

215
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,696
[panting]

216
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,035
Son of a bitch.

217
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:31,500
[Kangmu, echoing]
Dr. Koh, what will you do now?

218
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:36,713
Why is it that you stupid bastards...

219
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,758
...never, ever, listen?

220
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,353
[grunts]

221
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,566
Oh, shit! This motherfucker...

222
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,734
[hammer cocks]

223
00:21:58,777 --> 00:21:59,987
Don't shoot!

224
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,870
Shit!

225
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,923
What the fuck?

226
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,736
Dr. Koh, you should probably run now.

227
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,365
[grunts]

228
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,537
[people screaming]

229
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,374
Don't move!

230
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,638
Get back inside!

231
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,108
Shit, man...

232
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:23,654
[shouts]

233
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,534
Stay here!

234
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,172
Doyoon, where is he?

235
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,174
[shouts] Where is my son?

236
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,515
[police] Second floor!

237
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,766
Second floor!

238
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,768
- Coming through!
- Go, go!

239
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,279
[people screaming]

240
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,826
Freeze!

241
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,792
- [Choi] Stop!
- [officer] Downstairs!

242
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,379
- Move it!
- [people screaming]

243
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,930
[police officers shouting]

244
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:34,600
[sighs]

245
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,151
[Choi] Start talking.

246
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,404
Who the hell is that? And the other guy?

247
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,823
I need to know why
they're trying to hurt you.

248
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,325
I have no idea.

249
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,869
The answer is in his memories.

250
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,581
I have to do a brain sync with him
before it's too late.

251
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,335
Lieutenant, we lost him.

252
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,754
We're checking cameras
with the help of the guards.

253
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,839
We have to get him to the lab immediately.

254
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,342
I'll explain everything later.

255
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,802
Do you think this is some kind of joke?

256
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,138
[shouts] Tell me what's going on!

257
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,563
If I'm lying,
and brain syncs are impossible...

258
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,067
how can I know things
before you know them?

259
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,404
What are the things we don't know?

260
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,908
Those men killed Kangmu Lee.

261
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,870
Kangmu died in a car accident.

262
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,623
Junki Lim hired Kangmu
to investigate something.

263
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,918
Whatever it was,
those guys didn't like it.

264
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,629
And that's why they murdered Kangmu.

265
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,299
If I'm right,
it's the same men who killed Junki,

266
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,884
and kidnapped his kid.

267
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,931
Ask her what forensics said
about Junki's murder.

268
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:00,352
She might know something
about the way I died.

269
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,188
- That's not what's important.
- [Kangmu] Then what is?

270
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,608
Find the killers
and you find out everything--

271
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,236
Syncing with the man who just died
would be a lot faster.

272
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,196
Asking her is a lot faster. Just do it!

273
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,952
It's pretty obvious that
what you need is psychiatric help.

274
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,371
Not to sync with another brain.

275
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,831
I'm not crazy.

276
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,083
Then maybe you're lying
to sabotage the case.

277
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,003
Prove you're not lying to me.

278
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,506
But not your way. You do it our way.

279
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,567
My name is Dohyung Kim.
I'm here to take your polygraph.

280
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,986
I'm going to ask you
a few questions today.

281
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,072
Just answer yes or no.

282
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,534
Is your name Sewon Koh?

283
00:26:58,869 --> 00:26:59,745
Yes.

284
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,372
Is your wife Jaeyi Jung?

285
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:04,750
Yes.

286
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,254
Have you ever tried to kill your wife?

287
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:11,632
What?

288
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,302
You can only answer yes or no.

289
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:17,888
Hell no.

290
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:27,356
Do you know Junki Lim?
And have you ever met him?

291
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,650
No.

292
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,944
JUNKI LIM, MALE, AGE 38

293
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,792
[Choi via earpiece]
Ask him if he killed Junki Lim.

294
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,463
Did you kill Junki Lim?

295
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,259
No.

296
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,471
What does he know about Kangmu Lee?

297
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,140
And Kangmu Lee? Do you know him?

298
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:06,395
[Kangmu, echoing]
This really isn't going well for you.

299
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,567
That polygraph is looking pretty bad.

300
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,443
[sighs]

301
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,532
I know him, but--

302
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,242
Yes or no.

303
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,788
It's just not that simple.

304
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,380
Ask about the relationship
between Junki and Jaeyi.

305
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:38,552
And did you know Junki and your wife
were a little more than just friends?

306
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,267
No.

307
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,937
Were you worried that
your spouse might one day leave you

308
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,480
to be with Junki?

309
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,988
Were you angry, or even furious,
because of your wife's affair?

310
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,327
Answer the question.

311
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:09,541
Enough, please.

312
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,464
I won't answer any more questions.

313
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,473
[Choi sighs]

314
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,022
That polygraph means absolutely nothing.

315
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,859
It was my nervous system reacting
to someone else's memories.

316
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,277
I can prove it to you.

317
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,530
Let me do the brain sync.

318
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,783
You're in no position to make any demands.

319
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,787
I don't think
you understand the situation here.

320
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,540
It's you who doesn't understand.

321
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,960
Do you not want to find the girl?

322
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,463
We're running out of time.

323
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,675
You're right.

324
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,844
We're done here.

325
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,646
[people on TV chattering indistinctly]

326
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,026
[TV audience laughing]

327
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,698
[chattering continues]

328
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,158
[person grunts]

329
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,997
[breathes heavily]

330
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,540
- [grunts]
- Who is it?

331
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,836
[panting] Mom, it's me! It's me!

332
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,088
I didn't mean to scare you.

333
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,424
Why did you sneak in through the window?

334
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,259
Someone must be watching the door.

335
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,220
- What are you talking about? Who is?
- Mom, listen...

336
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,848
What's going on? What's wrong with you?

337
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,017
I'll tell you later.

338
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:55,522
Mom, I'm sorry, but could I borrow
your credit card and your car?

339
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,327
- [parent 1] Seungchae!
- [child] Dad!

340
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,830
Oh, my girl! Come here. [laughs]

341
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:15,125
- Did you go to day care?
- Yeah, I played with Eunha today.

342
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,794
Oh yeah? That's so awesome!

343
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:19,880
[Sewon] It's you who doesn't understand!

344
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,258
Do you not want to find the girl?

345
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,135
- [parent 2] Did you eat?
- [parent 1] Yeah, I did.

346
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,721
- Here's your jacket.
- Oh, thanks.

347
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:32,184
-Are you happy to see Daddy? [chuckles]
-Really? Give me a kiss.

348
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,606
[gate buzzes, opens]

349
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:51,578
Tell me...

350
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,457
Why are you so set on finding that girl?

351
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,501
Heejin said

352
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,838
that she saw my son alive.

353
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,549
[breathes heavily]

354
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,844
I have to find her.

355
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,221
I beg you.

356
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,348
[sighs]

357
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,410
Mind waiting outside?

358
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,539
I'm not leaving a suspect unattended.
Keep going.

359
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,415
[machine spinning up]

360
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,088
[whirring]

361
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,578
[vibrating]

362
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,997
MINA

363
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,043
[vibrating]

364
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,420
Yeah?

365
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:11,385
I have a job today
and I'm gonna have to be out all night.

366
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,764
Yeah, babe, I miss you a lot too.

367
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,141
Of course, every day.

368
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,643
I have to go. I'll call you later.

369
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,277
[keys clatter]

370
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,830
Get your stuff and get over there.

371
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,540
Call me if you run into trouble.

372
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,766
Damn it, I think he saw us.

373
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,853
[killer] Shit...
I told you not to tail him too close!

374
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,105
What the hell?

375
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:30,297
Why are you investigating Jaeyi Jung? Huh?

376
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,174
Who sent you?

377
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:45,979
[groaning]

378
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,481
Go start the car.

379
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,873
[groans]

380
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,379
Come on, let's get out of here.

381
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,283
[killer] We took care of that investigator
who was poking around.

382
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,035
And we got rid of the man
who hired him also.

383
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,830
Well, you see...

384
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,875
That guy has a daughter.

385
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,253
She's quite extraordinary.

386
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,300
She has the ability to draw
anything she's seen with great precision.

387
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,844
Yeah, don't worry about her.

388
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,221
She didn't see us. She wasn't even there.

389
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,392
Are you sure about that?

390
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,685
Yeah, absolutely.

391
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,242
Take care of her.

392
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,912
[sniffs]

393
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:28,832
[sighs]

394
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,340
- Did you see the girl?
- I didn't see anything.

395
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,510
You looked everywhere?

396
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,848
[sighs] You fuck face...

397
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:56,693
[child groaning, muffled]

398
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,207
Stop right here.

399
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,251
Report back when you're done.

400
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,169
[inhales deeply]

401
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,130
Bury all three where they can't be found.

402
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,927
And don't cause any more problems.

403
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,728
[sighs]

404
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:45,993
[child whimpering]

405
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,876
[grunts]

406
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,545
[sighs]

407
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:57,713
Shit...

408
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,092
[breathes heavily]

409
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,678
[sighs]

410
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,181
What do I do?

411
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,768
Shit, shit, shit! Fuck me!

412
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,608
I told him I don't do kids, goddamn it!

413
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,109
Fucking asshole!

414
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:26,408
[child whining, whimpering]

415
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,039
[grunting]

416
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,672

GORYEO TEAHOUSE

418
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,548
Ah, shit.

419
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,384
What am I supposed to do with her?

420
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:30,013
Just keep her for two days
until I figure out what to do next.

421
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,767
You know I fucking hate children!

422
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,187
Tell me she's not yours.

423
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,690
Of course not. She looks nothing like me.

424
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:42,943
[sighs]

425
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,033
Okay. 48 hours.

426
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:51,827
And not a minute longer.

427
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,748
Should we blindfold her?

428
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,378
Absolutely.

429
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,923
This is bullshit.

430
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:05,841
Jeez...

431
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:10,762
[breathes heavily]

432
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,851
Heejin is still alive.

433
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:18,979
What?

434
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,941
We have to hurry.

435
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,612
I think he left her with his girlfriend.

436
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:28,572
Who did?

437
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,741
This dead guy?

438
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,243
Teahouse.

439
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,454
She's at a teahouse.

440
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,414
A teahouse?

441
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,249
I think I can find it.

442
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,016
Yeah, it's around here.

443
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,604
[police officer]
Is this the only way to do this?

444
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,940
How many times
do we have to go around in circles?

445
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,776
Just shut up.

446
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,110
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,946
[high-pitched ringing]

00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,420
[breathes shakily] What do I do?

450
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,130
Where do I go?

451
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,884
Shit! I'm so fucked.

452
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,683
[cell phone vibrating]

453
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,810
MINA

454
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,150
Mina...

455
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:48,861
JINNAM-SI: 16KM
HAENGWU-MYEON: 10KM

456
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,196
Mina.

JINNAM-SI
HAENGWU-MYEON

458
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:55,576
Take this exit.

459
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,560
GORYEO TEAHOUSE

460
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,533
- See if there's a back door.
- Yes, ma'am.

461
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,577
- [speaking indistinctly]
- [door chime rings]

462
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,870
Come on in!

463
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,333
We're looking for someone.

464
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,626
Who?

465
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:46,919
Her name's Mina.

466
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,303
Girls don't work here for very long.

467
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:58,013
[chuckles]

468
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:00,891
I don't know a Mina,
if that's even her real name.

469
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,275
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

470
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,403
Oh!

471
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,281
No, don't talk to them. Talk to me.

472
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:20,035
Hello, ladies. I'll need to see some IDs.

473
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:21,954
[shop owner]
Please, let's talk about this!

474
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:25,874
You run a prostitution business,
you have sanitary violations...

475
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:29,253
[scoffs] and you're selling
alcohol without a license.

476
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,421
I would talk if I were you.

477
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,924
Mina. What was her last name?

478
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,425
It's Mina Song.

479
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,139
Where can I find her?

480
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,394
Fuck me...

481
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,522
Ah, shit...

482
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,107
[door chime rings]

483
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,361
It's me! I'm back!

484
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:06,081
Tell us where the girl is.

485
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:08,667
We know your boyfriend,
Taegu Lee, left her with you.

486
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:14,673
[scoffs]

487
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,967
What the hell are you talking about?

488
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:19,887
I haven't seen that dummy in ages.

489
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,973
And that was the last time.

490
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,809
We found his corpse at a crime scene.

491
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:27,811
What do you mean?

492
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,772
What happened to him?

493
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,152
He was involved in a serious crime
and was shot to death.

494
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,947
If you don't want to be treated
as his accomplice and end up in prison,

495
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,992
then I strongly recommend you come clean.

496
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:43,827
[scoffs]

497
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,455
Who died? No one died.

498
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:49,374
I don't understand
what you're talking about!

499
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:53,253
Where's Heejin? Tell us now.

500
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,924
Oh, shit...

501
00:45:57,883 --> 00:46:00,219
Shit! Shit! [cries]

502
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,889
- Arrest her.
- No! Please wait!

503
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:07,643
Taegu left her at my apartment
and never came back.

504
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:11,230
That girl wasn't right in the head,
and he wouldn't answer any of my calls.

505
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,107
She ran away while I was out.

506
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,401
I didn't know what to do.

507
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,612
I couldn't run all over town
looking for that girl.

508
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:21,031
Why is she my responsibility?
I don't even know her!

509
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:24,576
I'm not lying!

510
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:27,120
If you don't believe me, we can look.

511
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:28,664
I swear to God!

512
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,465
It's true. She's not here.

513
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,177
Of course not! Just like I told you.

514
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:44,179
Do you have memories of this place?

515
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:46,932
No, not this place.

516
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:50,227
What's this about?
How the hell would he know my house?

517
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,495
[Choi] Too much time has passed.

518
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,707
It's going to get dark soon.

519
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,837
The darkness could work to our advantage.

520
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,294
Stand back!

521
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:22,796
[blows whistle]

522
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,716
[blows whistle]

523
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:49,907
Whoa!

524
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:04,880
[exhales]

525
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:21,813
Heejin.

526
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:48,382
[Sewon] Let me go alone.

527
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,850
Heejin.

528
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,354
I'm Doyoon's appa.

529
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:55,365
Are you okay?

530
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,671
[police officers gasping]

531
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,011
[police officer]
He found her! Someone call an ambulance!

532
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,896
Here, I got you.

533
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:05,561
WONIL GENERAL HOSPITAL

534
00:53:26,582 --> 00:53:28,292
We're getting nowhere.

535
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,961
She won't answer any of our questions.

536
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:34,798
Heejin is very special.

537
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,509
I know about special children.

538
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,304
Like Doyoon.

539
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:44,850
I was one also.

540
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,443
Can I please try to talk to her for a bit?

541
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,461
Heejin.

542
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:24,389
I know you're friends with Doyoon.

543
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,561
And that you took care of Mika.

544
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:33,774
And I also know...

545
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,486
that you're very good at drawing.

546
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,869
I have...

547
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,417
something very important I need to ask.

548
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:56,255
It's about Doyoon.

549
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:02,761
Where was the last time you saw Doyoon?

550
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,182
Can you please tell me, Heejin?

551
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,439
[breathes shakily]

552
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,317
[sighs]

553
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:22,531
Or maybe you could draw it?
