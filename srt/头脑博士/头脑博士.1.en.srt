[thump]

00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,905
[narrator] They say I was always
different from the other kids.

9
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,325
Whatever the object was,

10
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,415
I wanted to take it apart
and understand what was hiding inside.

11
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,376
[teacher] Sewon!

12
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,256
Sewon, can you please
explain to me why you did that?

13
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,342
[children crying]

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,972
Sewon! [pants]

15
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,810
Are you okay? [pants]

16
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,898
[crying, sniffling]

17
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,031
Sewon, did you do this?

18
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,949
[mother breathes deeply]

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,790
It's okay. Wait for me here.

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,794
Listen Mrs. Koh, I understand
he might have been curious

21
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,964
about what was inside
the fire extinguisher.

22
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,091
But the problem here is

23
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,720
that while all the other children
were screaming and crying all around...

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,180
[sighs]

25
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,934
Sewon just kept on playing
like there was nothing wrong at all.

26
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,687
Oh, I'm very sorry.

27
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,357
I'll talk to him about it
when we get home.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,068
I'm afraid that we're far beyond that now.

29
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,322
He needs professional attention.

30
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,866
I think you know what I mean.

31
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,871
Sewon isn't really able to feel things.

32
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,706
He has no empathy.

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,334

00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,558

00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,356
I'm sure you... [gulps]

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,527
I'm sure that you...

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,575
Even if you can't really smile or cry,
I know that you...

38
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,787
I know that you can feel everything too.

39
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,045
I'm always going to be by your side.

40
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,423
Don't you worry, okay?

41
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,889
Stop that.

42
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,854
[sighs]

00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,525

[crying continues]

46
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,908
Did you solve it all by yourself?

47
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,036
You're so smart! Good!

48
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,747
Can we solve another cube together?

49
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,083
[doctor] You don't want to?

50
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,877
Then how about we play with dice?

51
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,923
His cognitive skills have improved
greatly over the past two months,

52
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,051
but as far as social skills are concerned,
there's been no progress.

53
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,096
What does that mean exactly?

54
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,308
Daily routines won't be an issue,
however having a social life will be hard.

55
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,853
-Oh.
-Mmm.

56
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,399
We'll need to see him more often
and perform an occasional brain scan.

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,235
Let's see here...

58
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,903
-[chair slides]
-Ah, here it is.

59
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,321
[items slide, clatter]

60
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,949
Hmm... [sighs]

61
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,704
There is a new program
that started at our hospital.

62
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,206
I'll find out
if I can secure a spot for you.

63
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,084
This will be very helpful.

64
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,337
WHAT IS AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
(ASD)?

65
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,218

66
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,961
[horn honks]

67
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,815
[breathes shakily]

68
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,291
[tires screech]

69
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,637
[people shouting]

70
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,952
[doctor 1] He saw his mother die
right in front of him,

71
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,830
but he shows no signs
of distress or any kind of emotion.

72
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,833
This is an MRI of his brain,
and as you can see,

73
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,378
the distance between his hippocampus
and amygdala is too far apart.

74
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,130
His memory is excellent,

75
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,508
but he does not display
any emotional reaction to those memories.

76
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,637
[doctor 2] You must be Sewon.

77
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,975
Do you remember what happened?

78
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,019
Can you tell me about the accident?

79
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,022
Short version, or long one?

80
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,443
What's the short version,
and what's the long version?

81
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:09,364
The short version is that my mom
was standing and got hit by a truck.

82
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,283
What about the long one?

83
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:18,207
A man in a blue hat,
his eyes opened wide, and then a crash.

84
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,753
The windshield of the truck
looked like a spider web.

85
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,798
Seoul 7 KA 1947.

86
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,092
[doctor 2]
You remember the license plate number?

87
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:41,480
White powder and white shards
spread like water over my mom's head.

88
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:46,985
And then my mom's mouth moved,
and then said something...

89
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,946
Your mother spoke?

90
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,073
What did she say?

91
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,452
[echoing] Sewon.

92
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:57,996
"Sewon."

93
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,555
That child has...
an extremely unique brain structure.

94
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:21,186
Just look at the ratio
of his hippocampus to the amygdala.

95
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,940
His hippocampus is twice the size
of an average child's,

96
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,401
but his amygdala is only a quarter of it.

97
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,238
He has a brain structure
worthy of a case study.

98
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm very curious to see
how his brain develops.

99
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,912
[Sewon] Mom said that
she'd always be by my side.

100
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,124
But she left me.

101
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,418
What was she thinking in that moment?

102
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,423
From then on, I've always wanted
to know the human mind...

103
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,721
My insatiable curiosity
gave way to brain research.

104
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:02,060
Unlocking what was inside the brains
of others became an obsession.

105
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,785
PRESENT DAY

106
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,330
[footsteps approaching]

107
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,505
[announcer] Now, please welcome
Dr. Sewon Koh for his presentation.

108
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,638
We all have the desire to understand
what people are thinking or feeling.

109
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,183
What started as a question,
born out of curiosity

110
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,685
has developed into
synchronization of brain waves,

111
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,687
done via quantum entanglement.

112
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,691
But wouldn't that entail
access to memories?

113
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,777
Or even access to one's thoughts?

114
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,155
It doesn't matter
how complicated the brain is,

115
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,991
since neurons just use
electricity to communicate.

116
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,452
Now we can analyze
the changes of these signals

117
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,998
and probe the depths of consciousness
in ways we've never seen before.

118
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,420
I get the connections with brain waves,
but why understand the language?

119
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,755
What benefits are there?

120
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,757
First, let's talk about
the medical aspect,

121
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,759
which concerns life and death.

122
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,303
We can help patients with brain disease,

123
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:22,015
those who cannot communicate,
or those who suffer from severe dementia.

124
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,603
We would also be able to extract
the thoughts of a comatose patient,

125
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,190
which could potentially lead to
a diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

126
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,318
The day may come
when we will be able to communicate

127
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,821
solely through thoughts
and without language.

128
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,533
So you're saying that you're trying
to hack into the human brain?

129
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,743
That would be correct.

130
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,454
This could have several uses
in the medical field.

131
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,001
Though aspects of your research
clearly disregard fundamental issues.

132
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,963
For example,
if all of your thoughts are unfiltered,

133
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,632
can you imagine how seriously
disturbing that would be?

134
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:02,389
Yes, brain synchronization
might present human rights dilemmas.

135
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,808
And certainly has a risk of being abused.

136
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:09,688
Meaning, it's critical that
before we establish the actual system,

137
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,151
stringent laws and proper protocols
must be enacted to avoid such matters.

138
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,030
In a few months' time, my pilot
experiment will be proof to you all.

139
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,531
Thank you for your time.

140
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,869
[scattered applause]

141
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,255
[sighs]

142
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,055
[chattering]

143
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,479
Hello, Dr. Sewon Koh.
My name is Jiwoo Hong.

144
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,357
I report for Science Magazine.
Thank you for your presentation.

145
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,858
Oh, yes. Thank you.

146
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,985
[mutters] So, off the record, of course,

147
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,197
I was wondering if I could ask you
some questions I've been curios about.

148
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,157
Sure, go right ahead.

149
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,661
Is your research at all driven
by any kind of personal interest?

150
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,580
Are you asking me
what my personal motives are?

151
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,831
Yes.

152
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,338
Well, it seems only natural to wonder
what other people are thinking, no?

153
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,799
Our family, friends, wife, or children.

154
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,009
We want to know
what's going on in their minds...

155
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,638
A neurologist would be fascinated
with the subject alone,

156
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,724
without involving any personal motives.

157
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,853
Yes, of course.

158
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,481
You see, as a journalist,
I always make sure

159
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,193
to do as much homework as I can
on people of interest, such as yourself.

160
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:43,699
I discovered that your mother was killed
in a car accident when you were a boy.

161
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,868
I also learned things
about your wife and son.

162
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,830
Could what happened to them
be your personal reasons?

163
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,749
My condolences.
Very sorry to hear about that.

164
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,043
I take special interest
in what personal motives

165
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,087
drive accomplishments, big or small.

166
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,089
I've even written articles on the topic.

167
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,591
I don't know.

168
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,469
Can a civilization exist without ambition?

169
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,348
Please excuse me. Sorry, I'm late.

170
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,600
It's been a pleasure.

171
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,906
[thunder rumbles, rain pattering]

172
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,597
[doctor] Here are the test subjects.
They've been anesthetized.

-Subject 72 has a normal brain.

174

175
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,734
Subject 32 is untrained.

176
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,070
It has no knowledge
of what's at the end of the maze.

177
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,824
Synchronization test number 32.

178
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,994
Our objective, transfer memories
of the white mouse to the black mouse.

179
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:15,290
Initiating brain sync between the mice
while still anesthetized.

180
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,626
[beeping, pulsating]

181
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,844
Let's raise the frequency.

182
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,224
Raised by 1.5.

183
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,393
Raise it by three.

184
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,979
[pulsating intensifies]

185
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,200
[pulsating sputters out]

186
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,163
-[computer beeps]
-[sighs]

187
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,878
Test 32 concluded.

188
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,629
Synchronization failed.

189
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,475
Good evening.

190
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,981
Don't you think you need a break?

191
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,441
Why's that?

192
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,526
You're pushing yourself pretty hard.

193
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,872
-Namil, we're going out for drinks.
-Oh, yeah?

194
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,249
-Sewon, you wanna to join us for a--
-[Sewon] I'll pass.

195
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,298
You're too nice. [clicks tongue]

196
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,217
Why even bother?

197
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,719
You can keep trying,

198
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,931
but he won't really care,
so there's no point.

199
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,016
Still, we should try to be friendly.

200
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,061
Showing some humanity sure wouldn't hurt.

201
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:04,023
So what's the point of being humane
to a man who isn't even human?

202
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:04,983
Yeah!

203
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,984
You know, what's really weird,

204
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,656
is how he can show
zero emotion after such a loss.

205
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,032
[mutters]
Can we be more discreet? We're all family.

206
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,666
Hey, Dr. Koh!

207
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,461
How about a drink?

208
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,963
[Sewon] No, thank you.

209
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,048
Come on...

210
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,386
A man needs to relieve his stress
with a drink on a day like this.

211
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,762
Forget it.

212
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,265
I don't why I even bother.

213
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,393
[swallows, sighs]

214
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,480
Don't you have any friends
to hang with on a rainy day like today?

215
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,773
I don't.

216
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,577
[cat meows]

217
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,509
[thunder rumbles]

218
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:35,532
[object thumping]

219
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,871
[Sewon] I had a wife and son...

220
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,964
[echoes] Jump, jump! Be careful.

221
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,302
I always knew I couldn't be
an typical husband or dad.

222
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,932
But occasionally, I felt like
I was living a normal life.

223
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,687
[cat meows]

224
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,147
But I was mistaken.

225
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,857
What was that?

226
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,026
Mika!

227
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,199
-[Sewon] Get rid of it.
-What?

228
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,702
Get rid of the cat.

229
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,330
It makes a mess of everything.

230
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,918
-We need him.
-[Mika meows]

231
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,045
We need Mika for Doyoon.

232
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,721
You know that Mika
is Doyoon's only friend.

233
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,978
Please, Sewon.

234
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,231
They help with empathy,
communication, and social skills.

235
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,901
Doyoon could seriously benefit
from a program like this.

236
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,528
[Sewon] He doesn't need that.

237
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,822
I was like Doyoon when I was young.

238
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,076
I'm doing just fine
with every aspect of my life.

239
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,620
I get along with colleagues fine too.

240
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:07,958
All I want is for my little boy
to be a little more ordinary.

241
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,089
[Sewon] My son was killed in an accident
when he was five years old.

242
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,633
[bell tolls]

243
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,303
After losing our son, my wife spiralled.

244
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,430
She refused to accept his death.

245
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,515
[breathes shakily]

246
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,226
-[distant footsteps]
-[Mika mewling]

247
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,356
What are you doing?

248
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,694
I told you to get rid of it.

249
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,906
And I already told you
that cat is Doyoon's only friend!

250
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,034
[Mika meows]

251
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,661
What's wrong with you?

252
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:46,997
Doyoon is dead.

253
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,000
Doyoon is not dead!

254
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,170
He died in the fire.
We recovered his body.

255
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,507
You're being unreasonable.

256
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,344
You need to accept reality.

257
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:05,682
Our son is clearly... dead.

258
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,644
[breathes shakily]

259
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,356
[Sewon] My wife just kept
repeating that our son was alive.

260
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,359
I couldn't accept what she was becoming.

261
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,029
-[wailing]
-She fell into further despair.

262
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,572
And eventually...

263
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,119
[siren wailing]

264
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,424
Someone get the monitor
and get an IV going!

265
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,763
-Is the monitor ready?
-Yes.

266
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:45,889
Check for a pulse.

267
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,183
Epinephrine, stat!

268
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,329
[Sewon] In the end, I wasn't able
to protect my son or my wife.

269
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,415
[rain pattering]

270
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,184
[beeping, pulsating]

271
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,356
[pulsating speeds up]

272
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,742
[pulsating intensifies]

273

[computer beeps]

[pulsating sputters out]

275
00:22:58,587 --> 00:22:59,880
[sighs]

276
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,768
-[machine beeps]
-[pulsating starts up]

277
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,078
[squeaking]

278
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,438
Test 37 concluded.

279
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,275
After the death of Subject 77,

280
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,653
a complete transfer
to Subject 37 occurred.

281
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:09,199
Brain wave sync successful.

282
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,496
[Sewon] The experiment was successful
because the mouse died.

283
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,833
There can be memory retrieval only if
the brain sync subject is deceased.

284
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,544
-I need a clinical trial!
-You want a trial?

285
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,922
Yes.

286
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,632
I need a fresh corpse as well.

287
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,428
You know how fast neurons decay
without proper blood flow.

288
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:34,183
For brains to sync, I would need
a recently deceased human body,

289
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,393
one that died within 36 hours.

290
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:40,522
Tell me you're not asking
for a human subject, Sewon...

291
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,025
Let's say I manage to get you one...

292
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,527
Then who would be the recipient?

293
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:46,945
Me.

294
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,156
You think you'll find
a better test subject?

295
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,700
First, I'd need
a dissertation draft of your results,

296
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,411
but I doubt
the institutional board would approve.

297
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,247
You'd have to collate
the results of the pilot experiment,

298
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,999
which we would need to review.

299
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,418
And we'd need follow-up measures.

300
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:03,337
Just bring me the results, Sewon.

301
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,506
The experiment means nothing
if it's a secret.

302
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,299
But that might take years.

303
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:10,928
Just for one day.

304
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,721
Find me a body.

305
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,974
[scoffs] You must be crazy.

306
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,146
Go away. And go back to work.

307
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,325
What? It worked because one of them died?

308
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,285
That's why I need a body.

309
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,870
Look, that's great and all,

310
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,623
but you can't go to human trials
just because it worked with mice.

311
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,959
Which is why we need a corpse.

312
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,545
But you're saying
you'll be the recipient as well.

313
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:48,215
[inhales] No way!
That could be very dangerous.

314
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,383
It doesn't matter.

315
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,427
If we succeed,
we can come up with a protocol

316
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,888
that will be work on someone conscious
or in a coma.

317
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:58,934
[sighs] Look, I mean...
How can this work if you rush it?

318
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,187
Just calm down and maybe just
take your time with the experiment.

319
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,527
I've asked the clinical team,
but they refused.

320
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,113
I need an alternative.

321
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,157
You have access to the morgue, am I right?

322
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,536
Oh... [scoffs]

323
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,745
Oh!

324
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,081
No way! No, I won't!

325
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,792
And you shouldn't even
be thinking about it either.

326
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:27,087
-Even if the test was successful--
-I've made my decision.

327
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,465
So, are you in?

328
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,426
[sighs]

329
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,053
Wait, hold on!

330
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,763
[sighs]

331
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,558
If you want it that badly...

332
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,476
[distant footsteps]

333
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,232
I think I have an idea.

334
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,580
[cart rolls]

335
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,123
[guard] Who's there?

336
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,465
-Who are you?
-Uh... Excuse me!

337
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,966
I'm Dr Hong...

338
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,345
Oh, yes! How have you been?

339
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,305
I'm so sorry.

340
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,558
I'm sorry, I should have told you.
Us doctors keep some strange hours.

341
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,352
-[guard] Yes, of course.
-Then...

342
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,355
-We'll get going--
-However... Where are you going?

343
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:28,440
Oh, well... To the morgue.

344
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,734
-Oh, I see.
-Thanks so much.

345
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:44,957
[typing]

346
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:33,922
Presents facial injuries...

347
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,632
But there was no brain damage.

348
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:38,802
It was internal bleeding
from a car accident that killed him.

349
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,100
[shaver buzzing]

350
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,778

Sewon.

359
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,117
Sewon!

360
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:50,786
Hey!

361
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,996
Hey, Sewon!

362
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,748
Damn it!

Get off me.

374
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,301

378
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,943
I might have seen something...

379
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,364
Is that important right now?
You were dead a second ago!

382
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,919
You can't be serious right now!

[sighs]

384
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,792
You really can't remember anything?

385
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,002
No.

386
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,547
Bye...

387
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:17,891
Yeah?

388
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,601
I thought about it, and...

389
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,188
We need to increase
the theta wave frequency

390
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:26,984

391
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:29,945

398
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,353
Yeah... "Detective agency".

399
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:51,276
You could say that I deal
with sensitive issues for my clients.

400
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,240
Do you know Junki Lim?

401
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:57,950
I'm afraid not.

402
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,410
Seems you've found the wrong guy.

403
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,912
Jaeyi Jung.

404
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,045
I'd like to find out what happened
to your wife, Jaeyi Jung.

405
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,338
What happened, Doctor?

406
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,176
Why are you asking me about my wife?

407
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,888
Mr. Lim is a client of mine.

408
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,809
And he would like to know
what happened to your wife.

409
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:26,603
Junki Lim?

410
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,691
I've no idea who that is,
and you're on private property.

411
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:32,943
I suggest you leave.

412
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:36,989
Okay.

413
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,158

-Yes, that's right.

I'm Lieutenant Ji Un Choi
from the ST Unit.

434
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,134
We have a few questions. Can we come in?

435
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,720
What's going on? It's pretty early.

436
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,640
Are you Jaeyi Jung's husband?

437
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,559
I would like to have a word with her.

It doesn't seem like
your wife is home today.

441
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,589
What's going on here?

442
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:04,469
Any chance you know a man named Junki Lim?

443
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,014
I don't.

444
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,600
Are you sure?

445
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,895
I think Junki Lim was close to your wife
for a long time.

446
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,398
And then, yesterday he was found murdered.

447
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,693
-What?
-Thursday, March 12th.

448
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,779
Can you tell us where you were
and what you were doing?

449
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:25,991
I was home.

450
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,952
And can anyone confirm that?

451
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:31,413
Perhaps your wife can?

452
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,252
Are you accusing me of murder
because some dead guy knew my wife?

453
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,591
We never meant to imply
anything like that.

454
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,512
In any case, let your wife know
we'll be in touch soon.

Thank you for your time, Doctor.

456

He was murdered two days ago.

Yes, of course.

461
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,178
You'll be well compensated.

464
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:49,116
The police think I'm a suspect
because he was close to Jaeyi.

465
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:56,707
I need to find out why everyone
keeps asking me if I know that man.

to have remained stable.

Brain waves and all vitals were normal.

479

But it's unclear
whether the test was a success or not.

480
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:52,317
I may have gotten a glimpse
into some of his memories.

481
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,946
But I can't recall any of them clearly.

My memory has always been... infallible.

483
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,915
So why can't I recall his memories?

484
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,060
Hey, I'm gonna grab something to eat.

485
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,270
Wanna join?

00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:33,233
I guess not.

I never thought I'd see you drink.
I'm surprised.

Uh, yeah...

503
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,582
I just feel like a drink for some reason.

504
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,084

Is that your bio?

533
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:12,578
A bit bored, are we?

534
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:16,623
Or maybe doing a self-help questionnaire?
[laughs]

535
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:19,418
Dr. Koh, you drink coffee now?

536
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:25,632
Good point.

537
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:35,809
4. I DO NOT LIKE COFFEE.

538
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,521
See you. Don't work too hard.

539
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,108
[door closes]

540
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:53,994
5. I'M NOT FRIENDS WITH DR. NOH.

541
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:29,571
Who's there?

542
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:32,950
Dr. Noh?

543
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:11,196
[car alarm beeps]

544
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:04,499
[Sewon] Weird things are happening
after syncing with the dead.

545
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:11,840
I'm experiencing strange feelings
for the first time, and...

546
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:18,055
I'm seeing things,
and I don't know what they are.

547
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:28,482
[gasps]

548
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:33,695
[brakes squeal]

549
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,073
What the hell? You almost killed me!

550
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:44,373
[breathes heavily]

551
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,423
[horn blaring]

552
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,105
[high-pitched ringing]

553
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,731
[grunts] Ah!

554
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:15,404
[groans]

555
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,740
[gagging, retching]

556
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:21,535
[Sewon] This could be
a side effect of my brain waves

557
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,620
colliding with the deceased.

558
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,675
[gags]

559
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,721
[panting]

560
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,728
[retches]

561
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:57,154
[gagging]

562
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:07,456
[gasps]

563
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,753
[mutters] What...

564
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,880
[pants]

565
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:17,299
[screaming]

566
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:24,348
This has to be a hallucination,
just a brain sync side-effect.

567
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:40,030
[gags, gasping]

568
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:02,010
The memories of the dead
are creating these illusions.

569
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,348
[person] Who is it?

570
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,560
-[Jaeyi] Doyoon? Doyoon.
-[overlapping voices, indistinct]

571
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:16,984
[Sewon] I need to strip them away
and look into the actual memories.

572
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,244
Doyoon isn't dead.

573
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,496
[voices echoing]

574
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,998
Wait...

575
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,418
What do you mean?

576
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,963
Doyoon?

577
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,008
My son Doyoon is alive?

578
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:46,096
[thunder rumbles]

579
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,931
-[alarm beeps]
-[door opens]

580
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,435
[door closes]

581
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:05,032
[thunder rumbles]

582
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,916
[door creaks]

583
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,793
[breathing heavily]

584
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:47,157
[Sewon] That girl said
the same thing as Jaeyi.

585
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,118
That Doyoon is alive.

586
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,165
[machine beeping]

587
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,876
Why did Jaeyi believe that?

588
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,682
There is only one way to find out.

589
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:22,985
I'm sorry.

590
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,738
I didn't believe you.

591
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:31,660
I think you were right.

592
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,498
Jaeyi, please help me.

593
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,713
[beeping continues]

594
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,264
[breathes heavily]

595
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,289
Do you know where our Doyoon is?

596
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:24,379
Could he really be alive?

597
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,134
Show me what you know.

598
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:36,725
[breathes shakily]

599
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,897
[beeps, pulsating]
