1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,646
Sewon.

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,127
What time is it?

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,256
You can sleep some more.

4
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,425
Where's Doyoon?

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,766
He's gone, Sewon.

6
00:00:58,934 --> 00:00:59,852
Huh?

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,355
Can you look for him?

8
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,240
There you are!

9
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,340
Was that fun?

10
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,886
Higher! Higher!

11
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,307
Doyoon.

12
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,351
Your little kitty looks upset
we're having fun without her.

13
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,603
Oh, Mika!

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,771
Mika!

15
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,440
Mika!

16
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,607
Looks like Doyoon is going outside.

17
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:32,903
Jaeyi.

18
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,657
Doyoon is going out the gate.

19
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,870
Doyoon!

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,502
No, please. Stay here.

21
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,213
Doyoon just left though...

22
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,131
Can't you please just listen?

23
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
-Jaeyi...
-Please!

24
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,637
Why is it impossible
for you to just listen?

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,348
Doyoon is out there all alone!

26
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,767
And it's safer that way!

27
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,271
The father away he is from you,
the better! You hear me?

28
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,332
Jaeyi...

29
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
Jaeyi.

30
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,689
What's the matter? Huh?

31
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,573
Sewon...

32
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,825
Listen, I'm begging you.

33
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,786
Go and find our Doyoon, please...

34
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,682
Jaeyi!

35
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,602
Brain sync attempt.

36
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,607
LIA, 6.9 hertz.
Stimulation interval, 2.1 seconds.

37
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,029
Brain sync was successful
for a brief moment.

38
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:08,118
Sync aborted due to a seizure
in the subject's temporal lobe.

39
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,955
The memories accessed were...

40
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,209
It's safer that way!

41
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,925
They felt like dreams or fantasies.

42
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:28,222
Perhaps they were hallucinations
reflecting Jaeyi's psyche.

43
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,894
Most probably because
the brain waves of the living

44
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:39,149
are much more difficult to control
and interpret than the dead's.

45
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:45,697
Executing a brain sync
with the living is most unstable...

46
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,742
...and dangerous.

47
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,703
Until I can find a solution...

48
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,249
No more attempts will be made.

49
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,718
Don't you worry.

50
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,056
I promise to find Doyoon another way.

51
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:41,753
DR. BRAIN

52
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,395
Yes?

53
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,648
Hey, I was just worried
because you're not at work.

54
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,151
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.

55
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,236
I'm just staying home today.

56
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,322
Okay... All right.

57
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,408
Let me know immediately
if you feel weird or--

58
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,701
I'll call you later.

59
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,086
Oh...

60
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,006
Oh, you're home?

61
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,177
Hmm... Did something happen to Jaeyi?

62
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,347
No, I just wanted to work from home today.
That's all.

63
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,850
Oh, I see. I'll be downstairs then.

64
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,591
You have some explaining to do.

65
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,346
Why wouldn't you tell us
that your wife tried to commit suicide?

66
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,726
Not sharing personal information
with you a crime?

67
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,354
It is when you're clearly doing it
to avoid suspicion.

68
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,606
Why would I purposefully
incriminate myself?

69
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,150
Your wife attempted suicide.

70
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,986
And a man she was close to was murdered.

71
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,363
And her husband
is still trying to hide something.

72
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,744
I have to say,
this reminds me of Occam's razor.

73
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,749
The theory states that the easiest
explanation is the most likely.

74
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,961
A husband knew his wife was cheating, so--

75
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,714
So of course, I must have
killed my wife out of jealousy.

76
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,675
And naturally, murdered her lover as well.

77
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,803
I think you brought your wife home

78
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,973
to finish the job you set out
to do in the first place.

79
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,641
That's a good point.

80
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,519
So see for yourself.

81
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,996
If I wanted my wife dead...

82
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,500
Then why would I bother doing this?

83
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,670
I don't know why
you're keeping your wife like this, but...

84
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,048
This doesn't mean
you're free of suspicion.

85
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,427
You're still a suspect
for murdering Junki Lim.

86
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,763
We'll be back.

87
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,564
Mika!

88
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,065
Mika!

89
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,028
Hey, kid! Come here!

90
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,908
Heejin!

91
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,953
Heejin! Come here!

92
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,665
Heejin, come here, sweetie!

93
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,725
The brain sync with Jaeyi
wasn't a complete failure.

94
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,062
Traces of her memory are clear.

95
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,814
The little girl I saw

96
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,651
came to our house with Junki Lim.

97
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,694
1. LIM AND JAEYI WERE CLOSE.
2. LIM HAS BEEN TO MY HOUSE.

98
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,904
Heejin?

99
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,281
3. THE GIRL IS LIM'S DAUGHTER.
4. DOYOON IS ALIVE?!!

100
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,867
I think Heejin is Junki Lim's daughter.

101
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,998
I have to find this girl who saw Doyoon.

102
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,693
Can't say I expected you to call.

103
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,697
Why did Junki Lim
tell you to look into me?

104
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,868
He was under the impression
that you killed your wife.

105
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:52,207
By the way, did you kill my client too?

106
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,878
I had absolutely no clue
who Junki Lim was until I met you.

107
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,088
All right, relax...

108
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,925
So then, tell me why I'm here.

109
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,431
Jaeyi and that man...

110
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,767
How did they meet exactly?

111
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,731
The info I gave you earlier was for free.

112
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,442
If you want more, you'll have to hire me.

113
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,111
If I do,

114
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,407
will you find out what was really
going on between those two?

115
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,535
Come on... That's what I do.

116
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,538
All right, fine. You're hired.

117
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,210
They met at this special clinic

118
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,588
for children with issues,
who have trouble communicating.

119
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,716
Children's clinic?

120
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,316
Daddy!

121
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,280
Daddy!

122
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,365
Heejin.

123
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey, say hello. This is Jaeyi and Doyoon.

124
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,578
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello there.

125
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,040
You're gonna lose!

126
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:20,045
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

127
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,764
Doyoon, are you ready?

128
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,743
I told her not to take Doyoon there.

129
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,957
Not as obedient
as you thought she was, huh?

130
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,002
Let's take a walk.

131
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,011
Where is Heejin now?

132
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,057
You don't know Lim,
but you know his kid's name?

133
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,187
It's a long story.

134
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,982
Do you know where she might be?

135
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,276
No.

136
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,323
I assume she's with a relative
now that her father's dead.

137
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,784
What's so important about her?

138
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,330
I think she knows something about my son.

139
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,125
The one who died in that fire?

140
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,757
Just how much do you know about me?

141
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,384
And how do you know about that?

142
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,643
It's my job to know things, all right?

143
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,482
Let's go to Lim's house.

144
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,406
Go straight,
turn right at the intersection,

145
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,157
and keep going.

146
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,243
You'll see a white wooden house.

147
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,829
That's Lim's house.

148
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,002
What exactly do you need
to find out about him?

149
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,260
Was there anything strange
about your son's death?

150
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,762
Or...

151
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,849
Do you have regrets about anything?

152
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,351
Something you wish you hadn't done?

153
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,061
Regret is

154
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,897
a non-productive emotion.

155
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,111
Can any father-son relationship
not have regrets?

156
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,907
I lost touch with my father
a very long time ago.

157
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,496
Turns out the things we fought
about then really didn't matter.

158
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,998
I don't want to hear it.

159
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,459
I don't need to know
about your personal life.

160
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,421
Yeah...

161
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,133
We're gonna get along just fine.

162
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,241
What the hell?
How'd you know the code?

163
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,831
What's wrong?

164
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,501
Hey! You all right?

165
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:28,187
Abdomen, solar plexus,
and here at the neck.

166
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,981
The fatal blow must have been to the neck.

167
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,027
Sure looks that way, but take a look.

168
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,450
This stab here is what killed him.

169
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,664
It pierced through his liver, stomach,
and aorta into the lumbar vertebrae.

170
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,167
He would've been instantly paralyzed.

171
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,631
But they also stabbed the neck
then went for the chest too.

172
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,634
Eliminating any chance of survival.

173
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,135
What did they use?

174
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,263
It's no ordinary weapon, that's for sure.

175
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,432
22 centimeters.

176
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,144
These knives are about
22 centimeters long.

177
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,147
And the killer was an expert
at handling these knives.

178
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,151
Three perfect strikes.

179
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,945
Your killer is skillful.

180
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,404
So a professional hit?

181
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,157
Or maybe it was a doctor
with serious medical knowledge?

182
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,243
Is your main suspect a doctor then?

183
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,580
Well, then here's something
even more surprising.

184
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,834
If this here is film noir,

185
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,670
then this part is mystery.

186
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,630
Take a look at this.

187
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,843
You see this hole?

188
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:42,928
Huh?

189
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:47,015
This hole was made long after he died.

190
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,350
What's bizarre here...

191
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,895
...is that this was
an extremely delicate procedure.

192
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,650
It was done with great care
on a person who was long dead.

193
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,204
So that about catches us up.

194
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,500
So you're saying...

195
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,423
Lim's memories are somehow
now inside your head?

196
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:24,011
And Lim's daughter, Heejin,
told you your son's still alive?

197
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,722
Something like that.

198
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,766
Do you do drugs?

199
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,023
Forget that brain sync bullshit.

200
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,859
They're more likely
to believe that you killed Lim,

201
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,236
seeing as you knew the code to his house.

202
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,655
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

203
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,324
Listen, Dr. Koh.

204
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,869
It doesn't matter
what I believe or don't here.

205
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,954
If what you say is true, why are we here?

206
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,457
If you have Lim and Jaeyi's memories,

207
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,543
you should know how it all went down,
isn't that right?

208
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,088
Memories can't be controlled like that.

209
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,510
It's nothing like recalling the past
or trying to remember a phone number.

210
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,055
All these different memories
are tangled up in my head now.

211
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,016
I can't really tell them apart just yet.

212
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,520
So you have the memories,
but you can't control them yet?

213
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,731
-Right.
-I see.

214
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,985
Okay, let's say that's true.

215
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:25,656
What can help you recall
the info you need?

216
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,366
I'm not sure. Not yet.

217
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:34,456
But I believe that certain places,
objects, and smells or feelings...

218
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,752
All seem to intensify the memories.

219
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,046
Like what just happened.

220
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,387
How about we scan your brain then, Doc?

221
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,015
Pause it.

222
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,770
This is just getting spooky now.

223
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,857
This kind of behavior isn't bold.
It's insane.

224
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,692
We met him that day.

225
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:05,279
He denied ever knowing Lim,
but then came straight here?

226
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,073
What a total psycho.

227
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,659
This guy is seriously dangerous.

228
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,768
This has got to be her room.

229
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:40,814
What's this?

230
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,402
Did that girl draw all this?

231
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,240
She's an extremely rare case.

232
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,161
Born a genius,
but has developmental issues.

233
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,888
It's Mika. Doyoon's cat.

234
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,473
Hmm.

235
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,893
You have to take care of Mika from now on.

236
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,397
Why?

237
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,527
Well...

238
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,700
Doyoon isn't with us. Not anymore.

239
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,327
Where is he then?

240
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,752
He lives in heaven now.

241
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,174
But Doyoon's not dead.

242
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,511
I saw him this morning.

243
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,013
-Huh?
-Heejin...

244
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,807
Heejin, what did you say?

245
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:39,808
Jaeyi.

246
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,227
Heejin sometimes talks about things

247
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:45,355
that she imagined or dreamed
as if they were real.

248
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,066
She doesn't understand
the concept of death yet.

249
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,944
So, Heejin...

250
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,781
Where did you see him? Tell me.

251
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,120
Did you see something again?

252
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,591
I want to put Mika in my treasure box.

253
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,010
Ah, that's going to be tricky.

254
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:18,347
Mika is a living, breathing creature.
Mika needs water and sunlight.

255
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,782
"Grandma"?

256
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,243
FROM: PYEONGTAEK-SI
MIJAN-MYEON 54-GIL 61914

257
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,536
There's an address.

258
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,632
Good evening.

259
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,387
What are you doing?

260
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,016
What is it?

261
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,727
There's a dead cat.

262
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,729
Mika?

263
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,115
It's my son's cat.

264
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,076
Looks like it got hit by a car.

265
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,994
Rigor mortis hasn't set in yet.

266
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,121
And her body's still warm.

267
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,087
What is it?

268
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,381
Are you burying it?

269
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,134
I'm going to brain sync with her.

270
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,845
What?

271
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,888
You can't be serious.

272
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,849
You want to do what with that dead cat?

273
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,685
I think she might have seen the killer.

274
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:14,189
Or more importantly, she could've
seen what happened to my son.

275
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,234
I really think we're better off
checking out the grandma's house.

276
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,151
No.

277
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,862
I'm syncing with Mika.

278
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,908
If we wait too long to synchronize,
her neurons will be too deteriorated.

279
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,209
Are you Heejin?

280
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:54,164
You should get out here.
They don't let outsiders in the lab.

281
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,210
No point in wasting more time then.

282
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,212
I'll go visit the grandmother.

283
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,673
No, let me go.

284
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,217
Don't you trust me?

285
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,386
I have something important to ask her.

286
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,515
Fine.
I'm not really sure I trust you either.

287
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:17,354
I'll reach out to my informant
about Lim's autopsy, all right?

288
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,983
-He might tell me something useful.
-Fine.

289
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,278
Let's talk tomorrow, around...

290
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,950
Wait, when did this piece of junk die?

291
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,204
Anyway, I'll be in touch.

292
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,430
Are you really doing
a brain sync with that cat?

293
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:53,098
Yes.

294
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,392
I'm sure she saw something.

295
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:02,107
You're most definitely off your rocker.

296
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,341
- Mika.
- Mika!

297
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,718
Good girl.

298
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:24,393
Sewon!

299
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,813
Sewon!

300
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:29,898
Are you okay?

301
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:36,321
-What time is it?
-About 7:30.

302
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,328
Sewon, what happened?

303
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,872
Over there.

304
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,874
-Mika, the cat...
-Oh my God!

305
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,333
Oh my God!

306
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,588
Can you put her in the freezer...

307
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,424
...and clean this place up for me?

308
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:57,718
Wait a minute...

309
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,513
Just like a cat...

310
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:27,331
54-GIL, MIJAN-MYEON,
PYEONGTAEK CITY

311
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,601
Since feline visual fields are different,

312
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:51,438
I saw strange
and indistinguishable phenomena

313
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,232
and heard sharp noises.

314
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:57,486
I think I saw someone
attacking Junki Lim, but...

315
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,697
I couldn't identify him.

316
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,861
Excuse me, what happened?

317
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,489
Why? Are you a journalist?

318
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,782
No, I'm not.

319
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,035
I was just passing by
and stopped to admire the view.

320
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,453
Oh.

321
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:15,332
They say that
the old woman who lives here,

322
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:18,836
her son and her granddaughter
from Seoul, all just vanished.

323
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,716
Goodness, can you imagine
how shocked her husband must've been

324
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,802
when he saw that the house was ransacked?

325
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:28,887
At least the cops came immediately.

326
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:29,972
Yeah.

327
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,057
They've been searching all night

328
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,433
but can't find any clues.

329
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,477
How can something like this happen?

330
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:39,773
That family must be cursed.
Her son-in-law died a little while ago.

331
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,862
Anyway, there isn't much
to see around here.

332
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,739
But if you go down that way,
you'll see a creek and a temple.

333
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,741
Thanks.

334
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,287
My goodness...

335
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,372
I hope nothing serious happened.

336
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,877
The child has gone missing.

337
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,713
Frightening things keep happening.

338
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,591
Where did Heejin disappear to?

339
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,720
I don't know what to do anymore.

340
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,437
Wow!

341
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:27,863
Dynamic visual acuity!

342
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,494
Hey! Sir, over here!

343
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,039
Sir, can you throw us the ball?

344
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,549
This is a cat's perspective.

345
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,136
Have cat traits been transferred to me,

346
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,389
just like Lim's?

347
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:43,814
Oh my God! That was scary...

348
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,538
I saw it!

349
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,509
05 NA 2046

350
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,014
-Yes?
-This is Sewon Koh.

351
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,015
Dr. Koh?

352
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,851
I need a favor.

353
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,978
Could you run a license plate for me?

354
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:27,983
Dr. Koh, if you have something to say,
come into the station.

355
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:32,821
I know that Lim's daughter, Heejin,
and her whole family have disappeared.

356
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,241
How do you know that?

357
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:39,036
I was just at her grandmother's house.

358
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:42,122
If you agree to help me,

359
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:45,375
then there's a chance
I might be able to find her.

360
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,836
You have to run the license plate.

361
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,421
I think I saw that same car.

362
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:52,132
It was in front of the house
when Lim was killed.

363
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:56,053
05 NA 2046.

364
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:56,970
Please.

365
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:13,779
So what if Dr. Koh is also responsible
for Heejin's disappearance?

366
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,366
It's quite possible.

367
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,870
But why is he asking me for a favor then?

368
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:26,583
What could he be up to?

369
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:17,926
KANGMU LEE
POLICE ACADEMY GRADUATE

370
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:22,723
HOMICIDE POLICE DETECTIVE
BECOMES A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

371
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,433
What the hell?

372
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:29,915
LIEUTENANT JI UN CHOI

373
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,376
Yes?

374
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:34,962
This is Lieutenant Choi.

375
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,757
We found the owner of the car
you were talking about.

376
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,761
The name is Kangmu Lee.

377
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,015
He's an ex-cop
turned private investigator.

378
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:48,934
Do you know him?

379
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:53,272
Are you saying that Lim's killer is...

380
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:55,399
...Kangmu Lee?

381
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:58,735
That's impossible.

382
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:00,904
What are you talking about?

383
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:05,993
Kangmu Lee has been dead
for four days now.

384
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,871
He died before Lim was killed.

385
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:11,582
That car was scrapped
the day we found him dead.

386
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,754
Are you there?

387
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,215
Dr. Koh?

388
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,514
Hold on.

389
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:29,474
I have to call you back.

390
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,262
Who is it?

391
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,850
It's Kangmu Lee.
