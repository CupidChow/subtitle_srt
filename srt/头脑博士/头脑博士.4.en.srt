1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,681
Heejin, could you draw
a picture of where you last saw Doyoon?

2
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,639
DR. BRAIN

3
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,704
Heejin.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,040
Do you know who this woman is?

5
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,879
Where is this? Have you been there?

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,968
Sir, Heejin needs to rest.

7
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,219
One moment, please.

8
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,602
Heejin, is it OK
if I take this drawing you made?

9
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,522
Thank you very much.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,906
I am certain that my son is alive.

11
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,702
And this drawing is proof?
Are you absolutely certain?

12
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,205
The fire happened this summer.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,208
This drawing had
fallen leaves on the ground.

14
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,294
It could be last autumn.

15
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,088
They only met a few months ago.

16
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,134
She could have drawn something
from her imagination,

17
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,970
or it could be she misunderstood
what she saw.

18
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,974
No, Heejin drew exactly what she saw.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,060
She has a very rare gift.

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,938
She has a photographic memory,

21
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,440
meaning she has the ability to remember

22
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,776
and recreate things
she has seen perfectly.

23
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,195
Dr. Koh,

24
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:37,616
I'm very grateful
that you helped us find Heejin.

25
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,661
I'd also like to apologize
for treating you as a suspect.

26
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,496
- But…
- You have to reopen my son's case.

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,374
The police recovered
Doyoon's body at the scene,

28
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,459
and you even held a funeral for him.

29
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,294
We can't reopen a missing person's case

30
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,838
when the person is dead.

31
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,091
But the brain sync I did to find
Heejin wasn't authorized either.

32
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,219
I'm not going to continue
breaking protocol like this.

33
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,598
Never mind.

34
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,935
If you insist on looking for your son,

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,981
you need to consider your own safety.

36
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,692
We need to go after the real suspects.

37
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,443
Please don't do this without me.

38
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,865
Come on. I'll take you home.

39
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,170
You see that car?

40
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,754
Those are my colleagues,

41
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,339
and they were put there
for your protection.

42
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,633
You mean to keep an eye on me.

43
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,302
That's right.

44
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,263
Regardless of what I think of you,

45
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,600
officially,
you're still the primary suspect

46
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,143
in Junki Lim's murder.

47
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,645
I hope you understand.

48
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,445
Hey, can you please help me find Dr. Hong?

49
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,949
The day you saw me at the mall
I was supposed to meet with him.

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,702
I'm not exactly sure how,

51
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,330
but it's possible
that Dr. Hong is involved.

52
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,749
If that's the case,

53
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,669
he could have some information
about the guy that got away.

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,214
But I haven't been able to reach him.

55
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,507
OK. I'll look into it.

56
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,926
Thanks.

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,273
This is very disappointing.

58
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,692
The girl's alive,

59
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,695
and Dr. Koh continues to cause problems.

60
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,619
The most infuriating thing,
though, is that…

61
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,920
Dr. Namil Hong is nowhere to be found.

62
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,801
I get it. There's a lot to do.
I'll take care of it right away.

63
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,530
One person came in,
and the three left together?

64
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,198
Yes, they came separately
but left together.

65
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,369
- Around what time was that?
- Around 10:20 p.m., I think.

66
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,288
Thank you.

67
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,961
Maybe the guys took the elevator
instead of the escalator,

68
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,379
because they knew where they were going.

69
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,382
They were heading to the parking
lot in the basement.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,678
Or maybe they just didn't want to be seen.

71
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,763
So, check this out.

72
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,225
This is the last time
the suspect was caught on camera.

73
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,228
If he came in a car,
wouldn't he have left in it?

74
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,023
He must have known where the cameras were.

75
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,192
So he stuck to the alleyways
and sidewalks.

76
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,778
He knew his way around.

77
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,655
Get any witness statements yet?

78
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,908
Well, I checked with the employees.

79
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,202
I checked the license plates
in the parking lot as well.

80
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,996
Oh, what do we do about Dr. Hong?

81
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,208
- We still don't know where he is?
- No.

82
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,585
You need to go to BC Research Center

83
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,629
and see if you can find out anything more.

84
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,047
Then send that footage out for analysis.

85
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,548
Hang on,

86
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,634
do I look up the plates first
or do I go to the BC?

87
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,843
Both.

88
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,060
Jaeyi, Doyoon is alive.

89
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,396
He's the boy in this drawing.

90
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,728
I'm all over the place right now.

91
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,482
I can't tell if I'm holding your hand

92
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,111
because of how I feel about you
or the way he does.

93
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,534
Me or Junki…

94
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,021
I've been so confused.

95
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,609
How are you so sure
that Doyoon was still alive?

96
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,447
I don't think your wife
can answer that question.

97
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,243
You're been out of sorts lately.
That's very unlike you.

98
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,790
I don't know how to find Doyoon.

99
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,341
Every investigation hits
a point like this.

100
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,637
You're backed into a corner,
and everything goes haywire.

101
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,849
That's when you go back
to basics and start over.

102
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,227
So,

103
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,895
what information do we already have?

104
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,275
Where was your son
the last time you saw him alive?

105
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,402
Meaning I should go back to the cabin?

106
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,780
Got any other ideas?

107
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,493
Well, there are cops all over the place.

108
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,455
Never mind, then. You're fucked.

109
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,042
I guess you'll just have to
sit around and kill some time.

110
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,685
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

111
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,147
- I think it's the caregiver.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

112
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,110
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

113
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:32,656
The doctor asked to give this to you
for all your hard work. Here you go!

114
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,283
Thank you. You didn't have to.

115
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,244
We've been feeling
so much safer thanks to you.

116
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,453
- No, no.
- We're just doing our job.

117
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,997
- We're just thankful.
- Appreciate it.

118
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,374
- Here, have some oranges.
- We will. Thank you so much.

119
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,001
- Oh, thank you.
- Please enjoy!

120
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,461
- Hey, that's Dr. Koh. We have to go!
- Since you're staying,

121
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,380
- Sorry, watch out!
- where are you having your meals?

122
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,132
- Hurry! Follow him!
- OK.

123
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,195
What? Did something happen at Koh's place?

124
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,654
He just left
without a word.

125
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,531
We're following him now.

126
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,659
Don't lose him. See what he does.

127
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,246
Protect him if you have to,
and call me if anything changes.

128
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,789
Copy that.

129
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,131
Send that to me as soon as you're done.

130
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,509
And get them out
to all the other precincts.

131
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,145
What's wrong with him?

132
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,632
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell?

133
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,762
That was fucking crazy!

134
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,225
Dr. Hong hasn't called in

135
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,811
and hasn't been here the last two days.

136
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,272
He's never done this before.

137
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,108
He's not usually this irresponsible.

138
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,027
We're all so worried about him.

139
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,989
When's the last time you saw him?

140
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,995
I think 9:00 p.m. on Monday.
when he was leaving work.

141
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,874
Did you notice anything strange
or unusual?

142
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,047
Well, it was like any other night.
We just said goodnight. So…

143
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,513
Do you mind
if I look at his employee file?

144
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,974
He must have an emergency contact
or something like that.

145
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,436
I think his mother is the contact.
She hasn't seen him in a while.

146
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,856
So, you've reached out to her?

147
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,528
Yes, well, because he wasn't here.

148
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,114
I see what you mean.

149
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,805
There's even a lake over there.

150
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,891
Hmm?

151
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,769
Oh…

152
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,813
Actually, I can't go.

153
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,530
Doyoon was really excited you were going.

154
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,491
I was too.

155
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,037
The lab scheduled an approval review
for early next week.

156
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,502
I don't understand.

157
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:20,884
Why are you always working?
Is that really your only priority?

158
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,722
What can't you understand?

159
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,350
You used to be consumed
by your own research as well.

160
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,269
You're right. I really was.

161
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,273
I still think about it sometimes,

162
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,819
and sometimes I really do miss
that part of my life.

163
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:45,576
But I made the choice to put it aside

164
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,744
for you and for Doyoon.

165
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,915
Can't you do the same for us, Sewon?

166
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,836
Sacrificing work won't make me
a better father.

167
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,672
I don't want you to sacrifice work.

168
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,426
I just want to know
when we'll be a priority.

169
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,139
Soon, I promise. But for now, I can't.

170
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,562
You'll both have to go on without me.

171
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,549
- Look, it's Doyoon!
- Yeah.

172
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,344
Hey!

173
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,409
Sorry we're late.

174
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,746
- Hi. Was it hard to find?
- It was fine.

175
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,623
Want to give me a push?

176
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,333
Okay!

177
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,172
This place is beautiful.

178
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,925
Thank you for inviting us.

179
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,511
Thank you both for coming
all this way, Junki.

180
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,512
Of course.

181
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,313
I think Doyoon is so happy
now that Heejin is here.

182
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,744
♪ Mom and Dad are gone ♪

183
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:37,289
Thank you so much!
Please allow me. I got it.

184
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,624
- You guys want snacks?
- Wow!

185
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,126
- Yum!
- Thank you!

186
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,381
- Are you having fun?
- So good.

187
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,134
- Happy Heejin is here?
- Hmm.

188
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,806
Is Dr. Koh OK with this?

189
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,392
What do you mean?

190
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:02,731
Well, with us…
with us being here together.

191
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,986
It's fine really.

192
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,534
He's too preoccupied
to care about you guys being here.

193
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,789
He also doesn't even know
how to be jealous.

194
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,209
There are times…

195
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,005
I wonder if he actually feels
any kind of emotions at all.

196
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,970
I wish he would…

197
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,475
just once try to understand me
or how I'm feeling.

198
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,478
What did you see?

199
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,408
They looked…

200
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,662
more like a family with him.

201
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:11,842
It's that sort of insecurity
that tears relationships apart.

202
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,679
What am I doing here?

203
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,724
The only thing I've learned

204
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,727
is that I was a terrible husband,

205
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,939
and it turns out
my wife was seeing someone else.

206
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,111
None of this is actually going
to help me find Doyoon.

207
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,370
I have no idea
what else I should be doing.

208
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,248
Then stop trying so damned hard.

209
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,586
And maybe wait for your eyes
to adjust to the darkness.

210
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,911
Who is it?

211
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,832
Hello, ma'am. I'm Namil's friend.
I came by because I was worried.

212
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,625
What do you mean? Why?

213
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,669
We were supposed
to have drinks last night,

214
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,380
but he never showed up at the bar.

215
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:17,342
Oh, is that so?
That's just terribly rude of him.

216
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,181
Do you also work at the research center?

217
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,298
Ah, well, I'm so sorry,

218
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,511
but Namil is visiting relatives
and won't be back for a while.

219
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,096
But I'll let him know you stopped by.

220
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,266
And I'll give him a piece of my mind
for breaking a promise like that.

221
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,321
And now you're going
to tell me where he's hiding.

222
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,500
STOP IMMEDIATELY.
LEAVE NO EVIDENCE AND RETURN.

223
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,248
Mika.

224
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,089
Mika?

225
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,471
Oh, no! How did you get outside, huh?

226
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,974
Mika?

227
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,481
Mika!

228
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,986
Mika!

229
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,933
Mommy?

230
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,484
Come here, Mika! Mika!

231
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,403
Mika!

232
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,290
Mika?

233
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,377
Come back. It's dangerous out here.

234
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,552
Mika, where are you?

235
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,262
Mika?

236
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,559
What the hell is that?

237
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:44,855
We have to give the cops
something to find.

238
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,294
That's enough. Get the car,
and I'll meet you out back.

239
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,726
Mika!

240
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,479
Mika, what are you doing here?

241
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,024
How did you get out?

242
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:39,117
Imagine how sad Doyoon would be
if you disappeared.

243
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:40,786
Huh?

244
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:54,800
Doyoon!

245
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,012
Doyoon!

246
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,436
Doyoon.

247
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,151
Doyoon, no!

248
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,114
Doyoon, no!

249
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,075
Doyoon!

250
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,227
Let's go! Go!

251
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,110
It wasn't Doyoon.

252
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,199
The child in that coffin is not my son.

253
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:06,038
He's alive, and I can finally prove it.

254
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:10,375
You were right. They drove a car
into the mall parking lot.

255
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,836
Detective Nam is looking for fingerprints.

256
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,922
- He'll tell me if he finds anything.
- And Dr. Hong?

257
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,133
I found some websites
in his search history.

258
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,969
He looked up rental cars, sea fare,

259
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,055
and train tickets. He's on the run.

260
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,516
- Where did he log in from?
- Dobong-dong.

261
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,143
His mom lives there, so I'm heading over.

262
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,562
I'll meet you there. Send me the address.

263
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,688
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:15,232
DOYOON KOH, OUR BELOVED SON

265
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,420
Hey! You trying to shoot
a horror movie?

266
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,090
I'm trying to figure out the truth.

267
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,593
The truth?

268
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,054
Wait a minute.

269
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:29,389
Listen, Dr. Koh.

270
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,984
This video will also prove

271
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,278
that you're guilty of destroying a grave.

272
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,887
I don't think
anyone is here.

273
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,144
- What's that?
- Someone's inside.

274
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,662
Anyone home?

275
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,959
Wait. The door's open.

276
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,770
Anyone here?

277
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,234
We can see you. Can you open the door?

278
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,572
Anyone there?

279
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,328
Who is it?

280
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:15,787
Oh, uh.

281
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,875
Are you Namil's mother?

282
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,085
Yes, I am.

283
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,589
Do you know where your son is?

284
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,802
I haven't been able to get
in touch with him.

285
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,556
We knocked several times.
I guess you were busy.

286
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,892
I'm sorry, I just woke up.

287
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:41,188
Are you OK? You don't look well.

288
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,815
I don't feel well.

289
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:54,159
Tell me, do you know
where Namil could have gone?

290
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,954
Or is there any way we can reach him?

291
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,165
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

292
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,544
Just one more thing before we go.

293
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,005
We're looking for someone.

294
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,054
Can you tell us if you've seen this man?

295
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,643
SAY NO. WHEN I COUNT TO THREE,
STEP ASIDE.

296
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,148
I'm sorry, I haven't seen him, no.

297
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,864
One…

298
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,409
Two…

299
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,413
Three.

300
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:23,999
I have Dr. Hong's location.
I'm on my way over there.

301
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,835
I'll call you as soon as
I take care of him.

302
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,378
TAXI - AVAILABLE

303
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,588
Hello.

304
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,633
Let's go to Hapcheon.

305
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,447
Yes?

306
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,617
He was torturing her
to get Dr. Hong's location.

307
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:03,038
And he took one of her fingers.

308
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,291
What a crazy psycho.

309
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,544
If they find out where he is,
Hong is dead.

310
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,128
We have to find him first.

311
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:13,590
Dr. Hong took his mother's card
and bought a train ticket.

312
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,677
He arrived in Jinju two hours ago.

313
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:19,888
He took a bus from Jinju station
to Hapcheon.

314
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:23,559
Hapcheon? What's he doing over there?

315
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,896
Ask his mother what he might be
looking for in Hapcheon.

316
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,314
I realize she's in a lot of pain,

317
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,441
but tell her that her son's in danger.

318
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,777
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,195
Just a sec'.

320
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,327
A HEALING JOURNEY
TONGINSA TEMPLE STAY

321
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,372
What's that? What are you gonna do?

322
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,500
To obtain DNA from a burnt body,

323
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,336
I need to extract a deep-bone sample.

324
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,762
Dr. Koh's back.

325
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,227
What's he doing?

326
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,647
I think he's trying to sneak in.

327
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,831
You're right.

328
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,379
-ALL GOOD WITH DR. SEWON KOH.
-OK.

329
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,256
DR. KOH HOME SAFE.

330
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,857
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY
TEST RESULTS: NO MATCH

331
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,569
I have regrets.

332
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,200
I shouldn't have ignored you

333
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,620
at Doyoon's funeral.

334
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,792
Even if I wasn't able to grieve,

335
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:23,048
I could have held you.

336
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:26,510
But you were right,

337
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,889
the child they found at the cabin,

338
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,019
it was not our son.

339
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:46,280
I wish that…

340
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,285
I had believed you.

341
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:51,178
I don't know who took Doyoon's place,

342
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,723
or where the body came from.

343
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,811
The DNA only says…

344
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,940
that this was not Doyoon.

345
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:08,987
If it were you,

346
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,824
you'd worry for the boy's parents.

347
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,454
You'd say someone
lost their child, like us.

348
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,074
What are you doing?

349
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:58,161
That poor boy had a scar on his head.

350
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,915
It could have been brain cancer
or epilepsy.

351
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,795
If I can figure out
what kind of surgery he had and why,

352
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,381
I can figure out who he was.

353
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,387
It's 78% likely that he was
somewhere on the autism spectrum.

354
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,640
An abnormal brain.

355
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:23,228
Doyoon could seriously benefit
from a program like this.

356
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,397
Doyoon, let's go.

357
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:30,360
Here he is.

358
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,414
Dr. Koh?

359
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:45,125
I can prove that Doyoon is alive.

360
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,670
Oh, what do you mean? Dr. Koh…

361
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,631
I need to see you right away.

362
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:55,385
Sorry, I can't right now.
I'm down south looking for Dr. Hong.

363
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,137
So you were able to find out where he is?

364
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,516
I'll let you know
as soon as I get back to Seoul.

365
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,142
Wait. Hello?

366
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,531
Hey! Now he's not even hiding it.

367
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,741
- Wake up! It's Dr. Koh.
- Huh?

368
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,118
Dr. Koh!
Who else would I be talking about?

369
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,037
Where's he off to?

370
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:34,591
Wow.

371
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,636
Well, we lost him again. Damn it.

372
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,264
What kind of doctor drives like that?

373
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,850
We're in trouble. Shit!

374
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,381
Hello, sir.

375
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:18,051
- I'm Doyoon Koh's father.
- One moment, please.

376
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:20,304
I would like to speak
to his primary doctor.

377
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,513
Yes, of course.

378
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,155
DR. SOOJUNG HYUN, DIRECTOR,
CHILDREN / TEEN SPECIALIST COUNSELOR

379
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,997
Excuse me, sir.

380
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,167
If you'll please take a seat,
we'll assist you shortly.

381
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,380
- Sanghee?
- Yes? Please, follow me, sir.

382
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,011
Please have a seat.

383
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:10,229
Dr. Hyun, Doyoon Koh's father
is waiting for you.

384
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:35,212
Heejin.

385
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:38,799
What are you doing here?

386
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,759
Doyoon was over there.

387
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,421
OK, yes, ma'am.

388
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,119
Excuse me, sir. You can't just walk in.

389
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,371
Dr. Hyun, I'm sorry.

390
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,498
He let himself in
while I was on the phone.

391
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:55,792
It's all right. We'll be fine.

392
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,510
Please, have a seat.

393
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:15,020
I've always wanted to meet you,
so thank you for coming here.

394
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,981
Meet me? Why?

395
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:21,568
Well, your book had quite an impact
on my work.

396
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,196
I know that my son was here
receiving treatment.

397
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:28,700
Obviously, I wanted to meet you
as Doyoon's father as well.

398
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,537
I'd like to review
his medical records, OK?

399
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,959
I'll grab them. Just one minute.

400
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:45,884
Doyoon.

401
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:47,886
Doyoon.

402
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:53,851
DR. KOH IS IN MY OFFICE

403
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,452
DR. M: WHAT DOES HE WANT?

404
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:18,750
Doyoon's file number is…

405
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:22,838
REQUESTED DIAGNOSTIC RECORDS

406
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:45,319
CALL ME

407
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,572
Oh…

408
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,159
Uhm, no, this isn't good.

409
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,786
I think his records
have been archived already.

410
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,498
I'll go ask the manager.
I'll be right back.

411
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:25,943
Yeah, he's in my office right now.
What should I do?

412
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:29,738
I'll take care of it.

413
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,832
DOYOON KOH: NO RECORD FOUND

414
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,385
