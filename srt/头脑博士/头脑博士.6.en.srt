1
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,438
Jaeyi... Jaeyi!

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,778
Jaeyi!

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,112
Doyoon!

4
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,281
Jaeyi.

5
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,121
What is this? Where are we?

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,374
How is this possible?

7
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,169
What I'm about say is going to be
difficult to understand.

8
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,839
I trust you'll understand
since you were also a scientist.

9
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,299
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,094
You and I are in a brain sync right now.

11
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,304
What?

12
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,099
Using brain waves in the hippocampus,

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,101
I was able to sync my brain
with dead people...

14
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,228
Wait. Dead people?

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,312
Jaeyi.

16
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,982
Just listen to me.

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,359
Are you telling me that I'm dead?

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,443
No.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,530
You're not dead.

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,479
I would've seen your memories of Doyoon
if you were dead.

21
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,704
You're in a coma right now.

22
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,331
What happened?

23
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,417
Why am I in a coma?

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,627
You tried to take your own life.

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,427
No. There's just no way.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,304
Why would I ever do that?

27
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:40,434
Leave you and Doyoon?
I would never do something like that.

28
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,019
Jaeyi.

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,646
If we want to find Doyoon,
you have to calm down.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,900
Do you...

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,403
remember where Doyoon is right now?

32
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,957
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,001
Do you remember something?

34
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,502
Huh?

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,717
I think I was looking for something...

36
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,929
but I can't remember
what I was looking for.

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,099
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

38
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,352
Jaeyi... Jaeyi...

39
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,896
It's painful, but we have to try.

40
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,949
Doyoon!

41
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,456
Doyoon!

42
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,173
I can't.

43
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,259
I can't.

44
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,720
It's alright. It's alright.

45
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,514
It's okay.

46
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,016
What do we do?

47
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,480
Jaeyi, take a deep breath.

48
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,400
Let's try one last time, okay?

49
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,080
You said that a brain sync
with dead people...

50
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,170
lets you see
their memories clearly, right?

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,838
What?

52
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,854
No.

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,355
Jaeyi.

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Jaeyi!

55
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,706
I'm stuck in a coma.

56
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,751
I can't help anyone like this.

57
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,087
Please, you have to let me go.

58
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,425
Jaeyi, not like this. You can't.

59
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,719
You said you wanted my help.

60
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,349
So let me help you.

61
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,562
Promise me...

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,649
that you'll find our son.

63
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,609
Jaeyi, no. I beg you.

64
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,946
Don't, please...

65
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,035
Thank you so much
for finally showing me that you care.

66
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,121
No, no, no. Jaeyi, no!

67
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,004
Jaeyi!

68
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,063
Jaeyi!

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Sewon.

70
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,292
Please, Sewon, stop...

71
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,294
Sewon.

72
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,839
Jaeyi. Jaeyi.

73
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,861
DR. BRAIN

74
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,202
Maybe...

75
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,167
She doesn't have to be gone for good.

76
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,252
What do you mean?

77
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,341
I'm still here, aren't I?

78
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,602
You're right.

79
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,605
We need to stop my heart.

80
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,272
What?

81
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,944
I can see Kangmu Lee,
unlike all the other subjects.

82
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,279
I can talk to him, as if he were alive.

83
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,700
This means if we can replicate
what we did with Kangmu Lee...

84
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,578
Jaeyi might actually appear.

85
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,209
Even if you're right, inducing
a cardiac arrest is way too risky.

86
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,961
You could die!

87
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,338
I need to see her memories clearly.

88
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,466
It's the only way to find Doyoon.

89
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,135
Jaeyi said the same.

90
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,304
She's willing to do
whatever it takes to save him.

91
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,849
What if I can't bring you back?

92
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,518
What happens to Doyoon then?

93
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,477
Namil...

94
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,022
I know you can do it.

95
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,234
I'll definitely be back.

96
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,530
Jaeyi and I are going to find our son,
and be together.

97
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,534
Lower my body temperature
to 30 degrees Celsius.

98
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,953
Then stop my heart.

99
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,832
Wait five minutes, then revive me.

100
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,729
Our program is specially designed
for children like Doyoon.

101
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,732
As you can see, this has been proven

102
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,901
by multiple case studies.

103
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,548
Dr. Hyun, Hyunju in room 301
is having a seizure.

104
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,593
I'm sorry,
could you excuse me for a moment?

105
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,655
Turritopsis...

106
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,428
Doyoon!

107
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,721
Doyoon!

108
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,348
Doyoon!

109
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,354
Doyoon!

110
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,147
Doyoon!

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,317
Doyoon!

112
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,485
What's going on?

113
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,155
Open this right now! Doyoon is in here.

114
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,033
What are you talking about?
Ma'am, you need to calm down.

115
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,370
- You seem a little worked up right now...
- But I just saw my son!

116
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,497
Open this door immediately!

117
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:05,958
Alright.

118
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,643
Doyoon?

119
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,491
Ma'am, I think that's enough for today.

120
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,357
Sewon, please pick up...

121
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,353
Who is it?

122
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,564
I'm from the clinic.

123
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,858
Dr. Hyun prescribed
some medication for you.

124
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,503
Thank you so much.

125
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,473
The doctor instructed me
to watch you take them.

126
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,577
Are we good?

127
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,245
She said you should take all of them.

128
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,329
What?

129
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,127
Please leave. Who are you?

130
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,117
SEWON

131
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,357
Can't leave any loose ends...

132
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,326
Now everyone will think that
you followed your son to the other side.

133
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,876
We'll take good care of Doyoon.

134
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,484
Sewon! Sewon!

135
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,278
Hey! Wake up!

136
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,547
Sewon! Sewon!

137
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,716
Wake up, Sewon!

138
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,352
Sewon!

139
00:16:58,894 --> 00:16:59,894
Sewon!

140
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,319
Jaeyi...

141
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,489
Jaeyi...

142
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,784
Jaeyi...

143
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,993
Jaeyi.

144
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,875
Jaeyi.

145
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,816
Jaeyi?

146
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,014
We have to go upstairs.

147
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,392
- What?
- We have to go upstairs.

148
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,134
Wait, what's this?

149
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,806
Looks like a company
connected to Dr. Myung.

150
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,019
It's similar to the one
in Jaeyi's memories.

151
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,448
Ji Un Choi speaking.

152
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,367
Hey, Lieutenant Choi. Hold on a sec.

153
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,118
Sewon, she's on the line.

154
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,871
I think we found a clue.

155
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,790
Turritopsis.

156
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,417
We need to find any company,
or even research center,

157
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,941
called Turritopsis or Red Jellyfish.

158
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,130
Could be a scientific
or medical equipment company,

159
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,842
or even a research foundation.
Anything research related.

160
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,224
Nothing about Red Jellyfish,

161
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,853
but I see an international
joint venture company called Turritopsis.

162
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,564
Their next experiment will be
beyond anything I've ever done.

163
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,982
It's much more sophisticated.

164
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,151
The testing environment
will be extremely important.

165
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,322
Somewhere far from residential
and commercial areas.

166
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,075
A place that minimizes
external stimuli.

167
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,744
No electronic interference.

168
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,414
Could be somewhere underground.

169
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,540
Let me look into it.

170
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,257
I got it.

171
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,717
Inje, Gangwon Province.

172
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,469
It looks like they own
a bunker in a tunnel.

173
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,722
That's it. It has to be.

174
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,599
Wait.

175
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,644
This location was recently shut down.

176
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,146
What?

177
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,778
We don't have time for this.

178
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,823
We have the location.
Now we need to move quickly.

179
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,450
I'll call for backup.

180
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,744
Okay. Let's go.

181
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,938
Dr. Myung, how are you feeling today?

182
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,606
I'm wonderful.

183
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,361
Today, my life's dream
and mission will be fulfilled.

184
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,030
From this moment forward,

185
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,409
countless others will be able
to have infinite dreams.

186
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,215
Let's do it.

187
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,135
May I be of assistance?

188
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,914
Placing the brain lid on your cranium.

189
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,814
We've identified the child.

190
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,900
Jung Hwan Park,
reported missing two years ago.

191
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,027
He was treated at Saera Children's Clinic.

192
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,466
Wait a minute.

193
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,553
Do you know how to use a gun?

194
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,681
No, I don't.

195
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:51,765
I've used one before.

196
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:34,975
The door's open.

197
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,294
They haven't been dead for very long.

198
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,338
They've been shot.

199
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,299
That means we're not the only ones here.

200
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:08,884
What is this?

201
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,553
What's going on here?

202
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,735
That way.

203
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,276
They're using an insane amount
of electricity right now.

204
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,240
I think the generator is running.

205
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,035
When it reaches full power,
the transfer will start.

206
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,495
Then it'll be too late.

207
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,205
Then which way should we go?

208
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,041
There has to be a way down.

209
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,711
The deeper underground,
the less interference there is.

210
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,351
So, did you think
I was just your little bitch?

211
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,937
Did you think
you could get rid of me so easily?

212
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,774
Well, seeing as you got this far,

213
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,026
I admit that I underestimated you.

214
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,738
Huh? "Admit"?

215
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,783
I don't think you understand
what's happening here.

216
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:41,662
Why don't you put that away,
and we renegotiate our deal?

217
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,207
Nah, bit too late for that.

218
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,292
I have my own plans.

219
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,629
I'm taking the kid
and getting out of here.

220
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,675
Then I'm going to make a deal
with your bosses.

221
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,846
I think this is it for you.

222
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,082
Son of a bitch.

223
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,338
You're one stubborn little shit!

224
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,548
Freeze!

225
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,480
Go get your son. Hurry!

226
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,108
Doyoon!

227
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,906
We have to get him out of there!

228
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,597
Doyoon!

229
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,766
Doyoon!

230
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,861
Stop!

231
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,375
It's too late.

232
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,796
Sorry, but it's over.

233
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,332
Dr. Koh...

234
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,710
I had nothing to do
with what happened to Doyoon.

235
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,212
This was between
Dr. Hyun and Secretary Yoon.

236
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,882
Keep your mouth shut...

237
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,800
before I kill you all.

238
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,336
Sewon, what are you going to do?

239
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,755
I'm going to sync with Doyoon.

240
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,715
Connect me with him.

241
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,217
What?

242
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,011
Dr. Myung's brain waves
are beginning to take over Doyoon's.

243
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,349
If new brain waves interfere,
the defense mechanisms will activate.

244
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:35,687
Then Dr. Myung's brain waves
will be forced to focus on me.

245
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,648
Sewon, that's insane.

246
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,527
Dr. Myung's brain waves are amplified
by the generator.

247
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,654
Your consciousness will be crushed.

248
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,156
As soon as his brain waves
converge with mine,

249
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,408
amplify my wave parameters to the maximum.

250
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:51,203
But that's basically double suicide!

251
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,497
No brain can survive that much shock.

252
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,875
You'll be brain-dead.
Seriously, you'll die!

253
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,589
But you know my brain is different.

254
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,425
How many brain syncs have I done so far?

255
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,346
I've built up a tolerance
to foreign brain waves.

256
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,473
And I can recover quickly.

257
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,061
Take the brain lid off Dr. Myung's head.

258
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,397
Maintain current brain wave levels.

259
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,484
Stop saying crazy shit!

260
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,612
If you meddle with the system,
you could overload it.

261
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:28,407
You have absolutely no idea
what could happen here!

262
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,077
Doyoon, you, all of us here,
we could all die!

263
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,579
That's right.

264
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:37,499
If I can't bring Doyoon back,
you and everyone else in here will die.

265
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,878
If you've gotten this far,
you were aware of the risks.

266
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,346
Damn it.

267
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,504
Oh, no.

268
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:08,882
Shit...

269
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,594
What should I chop off first? Your neck?

270
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,138
Hands? Feet?

271
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,435
Dr. Myung...

272
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:48,941
No.

273
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,442
Dr. Myung!

274
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,739
Doyoon...

275
00:35:57,115 --> 00:36:00,786
I'm about to go into your brain.

276
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,580
So don't be afraid.

277
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:07,459
Don't hide or run. Just hang in there.

278
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,550
I'll be with you soon, alright?

279
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,886
Dr. Myung!

280
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,735
The moment Dr. Myung's
brain waves cross over...

281
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,822
maximize the stimulation.

282
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,993
I don't know
if I can get the timing right.

283
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,493
I'll do my best...

284
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,290
to give you a hand signal.

285
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,013
We're ready.

286
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,224
Excuse me.

287
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,602
Have we met before?

288
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,401
You and I met a very long time ago.

289
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,821
But you may not remember.

290
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,701
Where are we?

291
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,037
It's my old school.

292
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:54,668
I first dreamt of becoming
a brain scientist right here.

293
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,632
I come here every once in a while
when I need to clear my head.

294
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,511
What are you doing here now?

295
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,181
I'm waiting...

296
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,226
for my son.

297
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:16,315
I've never waited for anyone
like this before.

298
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,452
Do you have children of your own?

299
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,121
I have a son.

300
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,875
What does it feel like to be a father?

301
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:37,628
Well...

302
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,840
I'm always wondering...

303
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,887
where he is, or what he's doing.

304
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,724
And what he's thinking about.

305
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,396
I wonder if he's in pain or lonely.

306
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,858
Right.

307
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,946
I always feel that way.

308
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,573
The older the child grows...

309
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:12,621
the more you have to better yourself.

310
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,923
You were such a great and strong presence.

311
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,525
You must be Sewon, then.

312
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,194
Yes, Dr. Myung.

313
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,434
Sewon...

314
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,022
That's right.

315
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,650
So the one I was waiting for...

316
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,112
was you, right?

317
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Yes, Father.

318
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:34,786
Now I can...

319
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,458
I can understand emotions
I wasn't able to before.

320
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,050
Dr. Myung...

321
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,010
No, Father...

322
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,014
Please forgive me...

323
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,227
for not recognizing your love.

324
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,480
Dr. Myung...

325
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,110
I need one last favor from you.

326
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,075
Will you give me back my son?

327
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,326
I beg of you.

328
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,030
Sewon...

329
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,494
It's all over.

330
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:04,501
It's too late, Son.

331
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:10,674
It's time for you to accept that now.

332
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,056
Do you see that door over there?

333
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:24,438
Once I go and walk through
that door, it's over.

334
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:28,817
Everything will begin anew.

335
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:35,532
Now, I'm going to go
through it with Doyoon.

336
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:38,952
And there will be a new beginning.

337
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,044
So go back. Just go back.

338
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,962
Just go back.

339
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,345
No, there's no way I will let that happen.

340
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,598
Doyoon is going back with me.

341
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,443
You are such a fool.

342
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,988
It's too late for those realizations.

343
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:19,910
I'm not the only one to blame
for all of this.

344
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:11,545
You see, most people
make promises about the afterlife.

345
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,464
They'll say something like,
"See you on the other side."

346
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:20,470
Unfortunately,
I can't even say that to you...

347
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:25,100
since I am never going to die.

348
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,607
Doyoon!

349
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,444
Doyoon...

350
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,070
Doyoon, don't! Get away!

351
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,296
Hello, Doyoon.

352
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,174
It's all over now.

353
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,552
Come on. Let's go.

354
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:01,637
Doyoon.

355
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,387
Doyoon.

356
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,434
Doyoon!

357
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,983
Doyoon, don't go! No!

358
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:16,902
Doyoon!

359
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,911
Now!

360
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:36,856
Doyoon!

361
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,988
Wait, how can you...

362
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,120
You have to stop this now.

363
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:07,304
There's no way
you can win against me in here.

364
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:13,101
Dr. Myung, this is only your first sync.

365
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,567
I've risked my life on these experiments

366
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,819
from the moment Jaeyi fell into a coma.

367
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:31,495
Are we...

368
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,623
Are we inside your brain?

369
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,593
No, it can't be!

370
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,428
It can't be!

371
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:50,764
This is my world!

372
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,724
I am the master of all this!

373
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,978
I am infinite!

374
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:57,604
I am imperishable.

375
00:48:57,688 --> 00:48:59,398
I am immortal!

376
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,150
This can't be happening.

377
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,987
I am immortal!

378
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,239
I am...

379
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:38,103
I won't cease to exist!

380
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,442
I can't die.

381
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:49,656
I need to live for humanity's sake...

382
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,215
Rest in peace, Father.

383
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,323
Doyoon.

384
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:34,659
Doyoon!

385
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:36,703
Doyoon Koh!

386
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,299
Doyoon!

387
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,305
Doyoon!

388
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,486
Doyoon!

389
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:13,990
Doyoon.

390
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,384
Doyoon...

391
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,723
It's me, Dad.

392
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,142
Come on out, huh?

393
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:43,895
Doyoon.

394
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,534
Sewon!

395
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,244
Sewon, wake up now!

396
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,538
Sewon, wake up! Sewon!

397
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,379
Turn off the switches,
or we're all going to die!

398
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,592
We have to leave now. Right now.

399
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,388
Doyoon, please stop.

400
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:21,433
Doyoon? It's going to be okay.

401
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,353
I'll wait here.

402
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:48,584
It's all right.

403
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,589
Jaeyi.

404
00:52:58,095 --> 00:52:59,179
I think Doyoon is...

405
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,975
afraid of me.

406
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,603
No.

407
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:12,651
Doyoon is hiding in his own world,

408
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,237
just like you used to.

409
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,618
Let him know that his dad is here.

410
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,412
So he can feel safe.

411
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:25,246
How?

412
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,040
There was

413
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,587
a song that I used to sing to him.

414
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,256
Why don't we try that?

415
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:43,223
Mother, sister

416
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:47,269
Let's live by the river

417
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:53,483
Where the golden sand

418
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:57,362
Dazzles in the yard

419
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:03,577
Fallen leaves sing

420
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,497
Outside the back door

421
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:13,712
Mother, sister

422
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:17,883
Let's live by the river

423
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,515
Just wait.

424
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:08,307
Doyoon, come here.

425
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,611
Come here, Doyoon.

426
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:28,745
I'm so sorry.

427
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:31,248
I'm sorry.

428
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:43,718
Are you okay?

429
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:53,979
Thank you so much...

430
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,443
for keeping your promise.

431
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,869
Sewon, wake up!

432
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,209
Sewon!

433
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,419
Sewon!

434
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,588
Sewon!

435
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,925
Doyoon, we have to go now.

436
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:26,136
Are you ready? Come on.

437
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,403
Sewon! Sewon!

438
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,447
We have to go now! Sewon!

439
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,824
Sewon!

440
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:50,369
- Doyoon!
- Sewon, we have to go right now!

441
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,204
- Doyoon!
- Sewon!

442
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:55,457
The equipment isn't responding!
It's malfunctioning!

443
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,130
Go over there
and turn off the main switch!

444
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:15,477
Doyoon!

445
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,442
Open the door!

446
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:26,530
Doyoon!

447
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,534
It's not working!

448
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,369
Sewon...

449
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:48,218
Namil...

450
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:50,345
Sewon...

451
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:51,429
Go ahead.

452
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:53,140
Get out of here!

453
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:56,435
Sewon...

454
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:48,487
Sewon...

455
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:07,714
Sewon...

456
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,176
Sewon...

457
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:30,319
Doyoon...

458
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:34,825
Doyoon.

459
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,745
Doyoon.

460
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,329
Doyoon!

461
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,541
Doyoon!

462
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,544
Doyoon.

463
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,135
Dad...

464
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:57,306
Yes, it's me.

465
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,017
It's Dad! It's Dad!

466
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:02,728
Thank you.

467
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,439
Thank you...

468
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,067
Thank you, Doyoon.

469
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:43,477
Dr. Myung...

470
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:23,350
You all right?

471
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:26,979
Took you long enough.

472
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,314
I came as soon as I heard, kid.

473
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,152
Take a few days off,
then come back when you're ready.

474
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,406
Yes, sir. I will.

475
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,284
All right, let's hurry it up!

476
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:54,756
We've arrested all the suspects.

477
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,593
- Take them.
- Yes, ma'am.

478
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,993
Is Doyoon okay?

479
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:26,079
Yes. He's alright.

480
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,457
It's over now.

481
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,962
Yes, it is. It's over.

482
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:40,362
JAEYI JUNG, WE WAIT FOR THE DAY
WHEN WE SHALL MEET AGAIN

483
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:50,789
Doyoon, say hi to Mommy.

484
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:28,470
Sewon Koh speaking.

485
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,598
Juhyun Yoon has been on the run,
but we figured out his next move.

486
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:34,302
We found his passport broker
through the black market.

487
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:35,894
You have to catch him.

488
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,273
Yoon attempted to murder my wife.

489
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:41,316
You have to catch him.

490
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:45,445
Right now, our team is going
to their rendezvous point.

491
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:47,197
I'll get back to you.

492
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,490
Okay.

493
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:43,252
Who's there?

494
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:48,008
Who are you?

495
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,101
Sewon...

496
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:06,193
There you are.
