1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,170
   

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,170
 What's the disciplinary meeting for? 
   

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,470
 Hey. 

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,400
 Move, you bastards. 

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,050
 Geez, what the f***. Seriously. 

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,240
   

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,070
   

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,540
   

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,530
 Geez, how embarrassing. 

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,870
 Oh Jeong Hwa did this, didn't she? 

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,570
 Did that bitch go senile or what? 

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,380
   

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,230
   

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,980


15
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,060
 I heard there's a disciplinary meeting on you. 

16
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,870
 Is it that hard to graduate without issues? 

17
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,590
 I'll make sure to take care of it. 

18
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,320
 People are animals motivated by their gains. 

19
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,630
 Are you scared? 

20
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,850
 I don't think anyone was born bad. 

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,920
 So, you can change, too. 

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,680
 Hey. 

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,440
 You think you're the first high schooler 

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,860
 who acts cool with dead eyes? 

25
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,550
 Ms. Oh, you don't just fix people. 

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,840
 Pi Han Wool! 

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,550
 That woman is... 

28
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,570
 also just using me to be a good teacher. 

29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,560
 No! Stop! 

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,200
 Mom! Mom! 

31
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,120
 The woman who was stabbed to death 

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
 in an alleyway in Dong-gu, Ancheon 

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,670
 turned out to be a high school teacher. 

34
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,920
 The suspect is a teenage boy named Song. 

35
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,280
 He turned himself in after the killing. 

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,010
 The police believe 

37
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,930
 Song could flee while being investigated. 

38
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,810
 Thus, they requested an arrest warrant. 

39
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,260
 The disciplinary meeting was canceled, Han Wool. 

40
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,610
 Okay, let's all check our phones. 

41
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,870
   

42
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,220
 Download the app and prove yourself. 

43
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,160
 Then, you'll join the Yeonbaek Family. 

44
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,210
 Ready, go! 
   

45
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,990
 I will turn... 

46
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,280
 this school back to normal. 

47
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
 Regardless of who my opponent will be. 

48
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,910
 What's this? 

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,360
 What? 

50
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,060
   

51
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,430
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,530
The disciplinary committee is on you now.

53
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,120
Keep your neck clean until then.

54
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,430
♫  Yeah, we the back packers  ♫

55
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,650
   

56
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,220
   

57
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,010
   

58
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,070
   

59
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,870
♫  Low life living up, started from the bottom  ♫

60
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,460
♫  I risk it all, follow me to the streets  ♫

61
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,080
♫  I greet with fists, fighting is my passion  ♫

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,310
♫  The anticipation burns up, caution  ♫

63
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,620
   

64
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,950
   

65
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,850
   

66
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,180
♫  I return with a ragged breath  ♫

67
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,690
♫  That's right baby, like I said, bet my whole life  ♫

68
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,300
   

69
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,780
   

70
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,810
- This. 
 - We're doing it ourselves.

71
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,070
The school feels different these days.

72
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,960
Right? I felt that, too.

73
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,800
There hasn't been any ranking update today.

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,410
This never happened before, right?

75
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,640
The Yuseong kids quit fighting?

76
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,360
Wow, is this for real?

77
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,600
It's all thanks to Ms. Lee.

78
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,790
And...

79
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,370
Yoon Ga Min.

80
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,300
What are you doing?

81
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,120
Don't hold the disciplinary meeting.

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,260
What?

83
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,220
I told you last time.

84
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,490
A fair punishment.

85
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,440
Don't believe in stuff like that.

86
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,370
You've told me once...

87
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,030
that I remind you of your late mother.

88
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,310
I've always wondered...

89
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,560
what you meant by that.

90
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,350
 I found out while investigating the case. 

91
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,570
 The late Ms. Oh's son attends Yuseong Tech High. 

92
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,330
I should've known and cared for you more.

94
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,860
By the way, Geon Yeop,

95
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,630
what does Ms. Oh's case...

96
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,460
have to do with Pi Han Wool's disciplinary meeting?

97
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,120
Because the bastard who killed my mom was Pi Han Wool.

98
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,230
The culprit in the case was caught.

99
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,720
Were you so naive to believe that?

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,340
He was just Yeonbaek Gang's minion serving time.

101
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,190
You know what Pi Han Wool is like, too.

102
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,540
You think he can't do the same thing again?

103
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,970
- Geon Yeop— 
 - Please...

104
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,530
just stop now. I beg you.

105
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,730
 I guess the substitute teacher... 

106
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,170
has been only focusing on Han Wool.

107
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,440
She prepared a ton of materials for the meeting.

108
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
I tried my best to stop her, but...

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
 You! 

110
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,070
 I didn't know you were this unreasonable. 

111
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,540
 Why would you sign this stuff? 

112
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,550
 Why would you get me involved, too? 

113
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,850
 The Office of Education will inspect, too. 

114
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,900
 There's no choice, sir. 

115
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,320
 Pi Han Wool's disciplinary meeting... 

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,060
 can't be avoided now. 

117
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,040
Han Wool might need to be expelled.

118
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,620
Oh, Han Wool.

119
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,590
I wanted to tell the chairman something.

120
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,250
Leave if you're done.

121
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,840
Huh?

122
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,140
Okay, I will.

123
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,690
I-I'll be in touch, then.

124
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,130
- Just go overseas— 
 - The meeting won't happen.

125
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,220
Don't worry.

126
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,670
I can take care of it.

127
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,830
 Last night, a fight broke out 

128
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,590
 in a building in Ancheon 

129
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,550
 and the videos are going viral. 

130
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,810
 Based on the report, 

131
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,760
 some 10th graders from a high school in Ancheon 

132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,950
 wore a different school uniform in disguise 

133
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,600
 and broke in to steal business equipment. 

134
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,780
   

135
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,000
 Hello, subscribers. 

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
 I'm at the infamous thug school, 

137
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,790
 Yuseong Technical High School. 

138
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,000
 The student who was on the news yesterday 

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,460
 is apparently a study group member here. 

140
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,060
 Let's get to the bottom of it. 

141
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,890
 She's from the Heemang Orphanage. 

142
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,920
 Along with her twin brother Lee Hyeon Woo, 

143
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,780
 she's an infamous thug. 

144
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,620
 What are you doing? Move! 

145
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,070
 Choi Hee Won, you were a bottom-tier loser, 

146
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,320
but you leech off the thug friend, Lee Ji Woo.

147
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
- What are these fruit flies doing? 
 - Move it!

148
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,310
You're a student here, right?

149
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,830
They say there's a gang in the school.

150
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,010
Is that true?

151
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,160
Pardon?

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
- Hold on. The redhead. 
 - The redhead.

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,580
- It's him. 
 - By chance, are you...

154
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,210
- Yes, the redhead. 
 - Hey! Hey! It's him.

155
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,410
Hold on right there!

156
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,560
Lee Ji Woo!

157
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,490
Run, run, run, run!

158
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,320
The redhead!

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,480
The redhead! Wow!

160
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,870
Vice Principal.

161
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,860
You want a disciplinary meeting for Ga Min?

162
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,980
What do you mean by that?

163
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,540
Haven't you seen the news?

164
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,000
There must've been a reason.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,860
I guarantee my students aren't bullies.

166
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,840
I barely managed to stop the reporters

167
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,290
from entering school.

168
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,010
I'll assess the situation first and—

169
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,160
It's too late now.

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,730
You did this, Ms. Lee. It's your responsibility.

171
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,750
Get Yoon Ga Min and his whole gang

172
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,400
expelled through a meeting or

173
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,990
cancel Pi Han Wool's disciplinary meeting.

174
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,700
- Pardon? 
 - Right.

175
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,890
Shutting down the study group should come first.

176
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,910
Vice Principal.

177
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,280
Get your resignation letter ready.

178
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,780
We agreed you'd be dismissed

179
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,380
if the study group failed.

180
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,290
Remember, right?

181
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,650
You must be shocked.

182
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,410
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

183
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,440
It's my fault.

184
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,700
I heard from Detective Na.

185
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,620
You tried to save one of our students Soon Cheol.

186
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,990
It's bad you endangered yourselves behind my back.

187
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,630
But the gesture wasn't wrong.

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,040
Instead, don't do anything dangerous from now on.

189
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
Promise me.

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,260
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

191
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,090
I'll correct the news and the disciplinary meeting.

192
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,560
That's my duty.

193
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,750
So, trust me and wait a bit.

194
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,990
Don't let anyone provoke you either.

195
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,200
Especially, Ga Min.

196
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,730
I know it's not fair,

197
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,530
but please hang in there a bit.

198
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,590
I beg you.

199
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,920
Okay.

200
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,730
What will Ms. Lee do?

201
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,330
I know.

202
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,730
We're in trouble, but she's about to get fired.

203
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,710
That can never happen.

204
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,570
Geez, we need to beat up that bastard.

205
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,640
He fabricated everything.

206
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,670
Huh? What the f*** is this?

207
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,140
What's wrong with you?

208
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,380
Just now, the ranking app—

209
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,150
What?

210
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,150
 Special notice. 

211
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,530
 Whoever moves up in ranking in an hour 

212
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,100
 will each be awarded a million won. 

213
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,990
Yuseong Tech High is so full of fighting spirit.

214
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,420
Crazy bastards.

215
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,980
Fight him. Kim Se Hyeon is a loser.

216
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,010
You might win if you attack him first.

217
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,600
Kim Se Hyeon, you f***er!

218
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,590
I need a million! Fight me!

219
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,240
   

220
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,820
It's okay.

221
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm fine. Go inside.

222
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,510
Let's go in together.

223
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:39,040
What if... our efforts don't change anything?

224
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,510
Huh?

225
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,830
Even if we studied hard and went to college,

226
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,600
but if society were like this school...

227
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,610
That wouldn't be the case.

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,820
I thought things could change.

229
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,530
But...

230
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,340
having a dream...

231
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,370
having a dream is so hard.

232
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,470
   

233
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,100
Hello?

234
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,960
Hey, here they are.

235
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,010
I enjoyed the news.

236
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,670
Give me your autograph.

237
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,560
It's all fake news.

238
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,600
The truth will eventually come out.

239
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,240
A plausible story with a hint of truth

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,410
makes anything true these days.

241
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,390
They'll go after you and get sick of it quickly.

242
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,960
You'll be remembered

243
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,420
as a gang regardless of the truth.

244
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,570
Yoon Ga Min,

245
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,810
are the students here really worth it?

246
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,950
No matter what you do,

247
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,680
Yuseong Tech High won't change.

248
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,720
I can give them what they want.

249
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,650
Whether that's money or connections.

250
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,410
But what can you give them?

251
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,720
Dreams?

252
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,820
Hopes?

253
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,930
Would the scums who only live a day want that?

254
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,460
Wake up.

255
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,240
I represent the reality here.

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,630
Make Lee Han Kyeong cancel the meeting.

257
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,330
I'll let you graduate, then.

258
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,620
Move, move, move.

259
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,740
What?

260
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,750
What are you bastards doing?

261
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,160
Oh, I forgot.

262
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,970
I don't think you'd need the room anymore.

263
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,720
Until the disciplinary meeting,

264
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,750
I heard you disqualify as a club.

265
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,640
Hey, tear it apart!

266
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,150
   

267
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,080
   

268
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,130
You promised Ms. Lee.

269
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,280
 Ga Min, I know it's not fair, 

270
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,180
 but please hang in there a bit. 

271
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,160
 I beg you. 

272
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,600
   

273
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,950
 Stop that! 

274
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,890
 Move! 

275
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,220
What? What? You bastard.

276
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,140
Did you think you could just say anything?

277
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,370
I called him a thug because he acts like one.

278
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,610
Is he a teacher, then?

279
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,790
Did you see him?

280
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,020
Did you see my son acting like a thug, bastard!

281
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,740
Damn it!

282
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,540
Why would you defend a kid like him?

283
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,240
What did you say, you bastard?

284
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,380
Come here! Come here!

285
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,940
Come here, you bastard!

286
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,870
You bastard.

287
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,140
Are you really a thug?

288
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,850
Why can't you answer?

289
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,960
Are you really a bully or something like that?

290
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,790
You bastard.

291
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,220
You said you'd only graduate high school.

292
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
You made such a fuss about it.

293
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,100
But is that what you've been up to?

294
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,010
You're old enough, but you can't fend for yourself.

295
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,840
Even so, you shouldn't be a thug, at least. Okay?

296
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,120
I'll come to work.

297
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,420
What?

298
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,350
I'll quit school... and make money.

299
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,820
Geez, look at them.

300
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,860
Is it them?

301
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,970
Lee Ji Woo...

302
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,240
Her brother stabbed a teacher, too.

303
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,460
Geez, you can't help where you come from.

304
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,080
What hopeless siblings.

305
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,250
Lee Hyeon Woo is in juvenile jail right now.

306
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,950
Blood is thicker than water.

307
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,750
Their parents must've abandoned them, too.

308
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,050
Hey!

309
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,010
What...

310
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,060
Let's go.

311
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,610
They weren't wrong.

312
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,100
But still. They can't insult your parents.

313
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,810
Those bitches don't know anything.

314
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,820
Choi Hee Won, you're a bad kid now.

315
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,600
You swear so naturally.

316
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I'm not a bad kid. I'm your underling.

317
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,250
My parents work at KEPCO,

318
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,110
I live in a luxury apartment, and I'm loaded.

319
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,610
That's why I bribe you to survive.

320
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,620
Sorry, they found out where your parents work.

321
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,390
I don't care.

322
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,010
They aren't that interested in me, anyway.

323
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,080
 Choi Hee Won! 

324
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,820
Mom?

325
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,040
Dad.

326
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,720
I told you to come home right after school.

327
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,550
- Get over here. 
 - What are you doing?

328
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,940
Take care.

329
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,070
Seriously. You don't listen.

330
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,600
 Are you okay? 
   

331
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,330
 Today was kind of rough. 

332
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,300
 You'd better stop ignoring me. 

333
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,950
 We aren't going down, are we? 

334
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,640
 I started enjoying studying a little bit. 

335
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,340
 F***. Are you all dead? 

336
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,970
 Why are you ignoring me? 

337
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,150
♫  On these narrow streets, my days are  ♫

338
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,810
   

339
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,520
♫  filled with my dried-up dreams  ♫

340
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,960
   

341
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,410
♫  If I look at you silently  ♫

342
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:35,610
    
 ♫  Will you embrace me?  ♫

343
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,000
   

344
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,420
   

345
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,920
♫  I sit blanking out and shed tears  ♫

346
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:58,770
♫  In a painful memory, I close my eyes  ♫

347
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,350
♫  I fall asleep after wandering a while  ♫

348
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,350
♫  All by myself  ♫

349
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,280
♫  As long as I can open my eyes  ♫

350
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,630
♫  All by myself  ♫

351
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,730
 What if our efforts don't change anything? 

352
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,170
 Having a dream... 

353
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,800
 Having a dream is so hard. 

354
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,140
♫  I may already be  ♫

355
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,100
 I can give them what they want. 

356
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,070
 Whether that's money or connections. 

357
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,370
 But what can you give them? 

358
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,030
Let's eat.

359
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,700
♫  Even the warmth is gone  ♫

360
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
What? Is something wrong?

361
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
I think the study group...

362
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
will fall apart.

363
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,990
We just...

364
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,670
wanted to study.

365
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:24,400
♫  I close my eyes while being paused  ♫

366
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Ga Min,

367
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,040
do you know why I let you stay in Yuseong?

368
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,520
Because you looked...

369
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,050
happier than ever.

370
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,970
♫  As long as someone could hear it  ♫

371
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
   

372
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,990
 How did you come up with this? 

373
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,360
 Here. This question gets two stars. 

374
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
 You sound just like Ms. Lee. 

375
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,320
 Here are minerals. 

376
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,210
 And this is Omega-3. 

377
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,380
 One, two, three. 

378
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,800
 And here. 

379
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,390
 This is egg yolk lecithin. 

380
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,840
 - Really? 
 - Yes. 

381
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
 All of this is good for brain cells. 

382
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,350
 - Thank you. 
 - Sure. 

383
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,890
 Your body might not rot after taking all this. 

384
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,900
 Hey, Yoon Ga Min. 

385
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,660
 You look so red. 

386
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,870
 Look at your cheeks. 

387
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,200
 Why are your cheeks so red? 

388
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,930
 They're the same color as Joon's hair. 

389
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,810
 Why are they so red? 

390
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,220
 Try this. Try this. 

391
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,230
   

392
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,360
   

393
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,340
 Kim Soon Cheol is the witness. 

394
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,270
 He was involved in the case and a Yuseong student. 

395
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,910
 His testimony won't be so trustworthy. 

396
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,090
 Then will my students be framed like this? 

397
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,780
 I'm sorry, but we should keep an eye on it. 

398
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,320
 Insisting on the meeting can get Ga Min expelled. 

399
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,480
 You should give up. 

400
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,870
 But, sir... 

401
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,810
 Nothing can be done. 

402
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,300
 It's just how this school is. 

403
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,720
 I know how hard you tried. 

404
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,030
 Let's stop now. 

405
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,130
   

406
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,530
   

407
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,830
   

408
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:05,640
   

409
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,390
   

410
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,630
 Memorize the cube formula no matter what. 

411
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:59,200
 (a+b)³=a³+3a²b+3ab² 

412
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,730
 - +b³.  
 - +b³.

413
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,650
 Repeat three times. 

414
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,900
 (a+b)³=a³+b³ 

415
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,610
 Next. (a-b)³... 

416
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,880
 a-... 

417
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,230
Ms. Lee.

418
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,360
Should we tidy up?

419
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,070
What's with you?

420
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,040
Why are you here?

421
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,650
So, you'll be here instead of

422
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,320
Mr. Kim from now on?

423
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,490
Yes.

424
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,380
I can't replace Father immediately,

425
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,810
but I'll do anything.

426
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,930
Who are you?

427
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,950
We come as a set.

428
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Seriously.

429
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,130
Just leave now.

430
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,830
I'll leave if you do.

431
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,930
I'll study and go to college with you.

432
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,950
What? Bricks? Put them here.

433
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,590
Okay.

434
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,150
- Are you okay? 
 - I told you to leave!

435
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,590
Working together makes it go faster.

436
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,170
There isn't a set amount of work.

437
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,570
It won't go faster.

438
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,810
I'll study and go to college with you.

439
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,040
Seriously.

440
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,990
Hey, Yoon Ga Min.

441
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,220
Please leave now.

442
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't want to study, I said!

443
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,900
I won't go to college, you crazy bastard.

444
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,540
What?

445
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,880
Wait...

446
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,470
I'll study with you and go to college with you.

447
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,600
- Did you smile? 
 - Yes, let's.

448
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,110
You want to? Really?

449
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,310
Yes, you parrot.

450
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,200
Hold on.

451
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,990
Let's go.

452
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Huh? What?

453
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,880
I thought you weren't coming, but you came.

454
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,050
Where are you going? It's still work hours.

455
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,000
Excuse me, sir.

456
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,800
Father,

457
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,630
thank you for raising me all these years.

458
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,020
Now that I'm here, I realized...

459
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,050
how hard you've been working.

460
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:24,130
But... I really want to study.

461
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,450
Please wait just three years.

462
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,930
I swear I'll try my best.

463
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,430
I'll become successful...

464
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:40,240
and make sure you don't regret this.

465
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,900
Just wait and see, sir.

466
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,680
Se Hyeon... will own a building like this.

467
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,420
Let's go.

468
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,720
 Hello. 

469
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,340
I...

470
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,890
am the top student of this school.

471
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,820
Yes, the top student.

472
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,500
Her grades went up because of the study group.

473
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,370
You think we're bullies, but you're mistaken.

474
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,300
The thing is, we're...

475
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,970
very worried. We're considering a transfer—

476
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,530
No!

477
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,180
Specialized admissions allow

478
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,210
many at our school to go to colleges in Seoul.

479
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,450
You didn't know, did you?

480
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,230
- I-In Seoul? 
 - Yes, in Seoul.

481
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,270
If you let me, I'll be her study-mate

482
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,500
and make sure she goes to college.

483
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,080
By the way, what's that?

484
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,490
We were taught to bring something

485
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,160
when you visit a friend.

486
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,610
I see.

487
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,560
But why blueberries?

488
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,890
Blueberries are

489
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,510
a superfood that activates your brain.

490
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,980
Oh, brain?

491
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,220
Yes.

492
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,080
They must really care.

493
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,930
I want a friend to go on group blind dates with me.

494
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,780
I won't make friends in college since I'm a loser.

495
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,930
And no group blind dates, either.

496
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,060
Geez, how sad.

497
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,460
It'd be so fun to hang out with our boyfriends.

498
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,320
We have different ideal types, too.

499
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,450
You care about the face

500
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,580
and I care about the physique.

501
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,710
I don't get to go to college or have a boyfriend.

502
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,260
Why not? There's nothing wrong with you.

503
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,220
Yes.

504
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,240
Let's say I go to college and go on blind dates.

505
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,660
How will I introduce myself, then?

506
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,370
I'm an orphan who was born with nothing.

507
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,790
I have a twin brother, but he's in jail.

508
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,560
I work to death to feed him in jail.

509
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,390
Do you want to visit him with me?

510
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,670
Should I say that?

511
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,350
I suppose you have a point.

512
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,880
But someone might think this.

513
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,010
"She's an orphan who struggles...

514
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,510
and her brother is in jail, but...

515
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,190
she works so hard and goes to college.

516
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,420
She even takes care of her brother. She's really

517
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,290
cool and impressive."

518
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,620
If you marry him, I'll...

519
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,550
catch your bouquet.

520
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,470
   

521
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,140
   

522
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,470
 What? Where have you been, Kim Se Hyeon? 

523
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,140
 I was cooling my head a bit. 

524
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,950
You insist on the disciplinary meeting?

525
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,270
Yes.

526
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,360
After the transfer of duties and the meeting ends,

527
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,770
I'll leave the school.

528
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,760
You don't mind the study group getting hurt?

529
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,100
If you're a true teacher, you should protect them.

530
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,360
My students aren't just those in the study group.

531
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,810
I promised to protect Pi Han Wool's victims.

532
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,140
I still think

533
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,920
Yuseong Tech High needs to change to do that.

534
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,110
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong!

535
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:19,450
If the study group students were at fault,

536
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,990
I'll make sure they get punished and apologize.

537
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,760
But...

538
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,650
I won't stand by and let them get framed.

539
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,890


540
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,140
♫  All right.  ♫

541
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,380

542
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,690
