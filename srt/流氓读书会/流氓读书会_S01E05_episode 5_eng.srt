1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,230
 Son of a bitch! 

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,370
F***! Stop! Stop!

3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,390
   

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,670
   

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,080
- Hey! 
 - Don't come, you f***er. Don't come.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,160
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, you f***er?

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,700
Hey! Dong Soo! F***! Hey!

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,800
H-Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry. Spare me.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,360
We'll get the ranking app, too.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,620
We'll do anything. Please, please, please.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,650
The Haeseon High kids are here, too.

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,440
Ancheon is united, thanks to the ranking app.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,720
This is just the beginning.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,100
By the way, Han Wool,

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,770
why did you cripple everyone?

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,940


18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,660
I mean, they could join the YB family.

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,620
I thought it was a shame.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,430
I'm training them in advance.

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,930
Once they've been submitted by fear,

22
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,420
they become easy to handle.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,280
What's the point of having so many backup fighters?

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,870
Do you want to be like your dad?

25
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,690
No.

26
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,590
I should step on and climb over him.

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,220
♫  Yeah we the backpacker  ♫

28
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,520
   

29

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,780
   

31
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,800

♫  Risk it all, follow me up the road  ♫

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,830
♫  Entertain them with my fists, fighting with my passion  ♫

35
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,950
♫  Live up to expectations  ♫

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,000
Should we play a game to make this less awkward?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,180
What is this, a group date?

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,060
Guys, let's introduce ourselves.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,620
♪  I am ground. Let's introduce ourselves  ♪

47
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,870
Maybe not that one.

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,590
Huh? This is no good?

49
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,510
♪  Joon's favorite random...  ♪

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,280
This is why they look down on us.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,520
This is so annoying.

52
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,970
Hey, what's so great about you?

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,760
- Ji Woo. 
 - You've been looking pissed for a while.

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,250
- Do you really have to ask? 
 - Yes.

55
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,410
I have no clue.

56
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,900
Kids like you...

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,360
What are you so displeased with that you have to ruin our lives?

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,510
Ruin your lives? Us?

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,910
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,520
Why bother talking?

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,780
That little...

62
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,410
I shouldn't have spoken, right?

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,190
Guys, it's not that I don't understand you at all.

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,870
I was also like you until recently.

65
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,770
I know how we might seem to you guys.

66
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,960
I know Yuseong Technical High has a reputation,

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,980
but the group of us here came to study.

68
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,680
I think you're mistaken.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,360
To be honest, we're being bullied.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,680
Bullied? Are there bullies at a school like this?

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,450
The thing is...

72
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,660
Can't you let me go now?

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,610
Why did you have to suspend the card?

74
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,750
My mom said I couldn't use it because a three-million purchase was made.

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,660
F***, what a stupid bastard.

76
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,270
Hey, tell her you bought a watch.

77
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,680
You need one when you study, right?

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,840
She keeps asking if something's going on—

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,620
Gosh, that must f***ing hurt.

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,840
Wow, the poor Manil High bastards.

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,130
They had to build your school right next to ours.

82
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,510
F***, you have to bring us money because of that.

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,340
Go ahead and report us, you bastard.

84
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,290
I'll stab your parents on the way to jail.

85
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,760
Report me, you bastard.

86
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,970
F***. You gross bastard.

87
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,510
You'll be with us until you reactivate the card.

88
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,580
Call your parents or do whatever to reactivate it.

89
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,750
F***ing spoiled brat.

90
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,920
Hey, I'll go take a dump.

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,440
Take his pants off and take a video.

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,250
What color underwear are you wearing today, Joon Min?

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,170
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

94
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,640
A money bag I've never seen is walking in here on his own.

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,520
Is that a different school?

96
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,710
It's under the same foundation, but it's a different school.

97
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,710
Joon Min is probably not here because they have him.

98
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,530
We should report them, then.

99
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,040
A lot of your parents must be powerful.

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,510
Some kid actually reported last month.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,200
 They got caught and were sent to a juvenile prison, 

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,540
but his father is still unconscious.

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,360
 We're so frustrated, too. 

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
 Our friends are getting bullied, 

105
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,030
but we have no choice but to sit still.

106
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,260
I see.

107
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,290
Why did we have to be next to Manik High?

108
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,170
- What? Manik High? 
 - What? Manik High?

109
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,730
   

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,760
Is this an art school?

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,720
Something about this school...

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,960
They study even while their noses bleed.

113
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,790
I can tell it's an elite school.

114
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,020
 There he is. 

115
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,600
He looks like a rich boy.

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,110
Excuse me,

117
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,640
do you know where the study group exchange is happening?

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,660
What the f*** is he saying?

119
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,560
That's not the Manil uniform. Who are you?

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,530
I'm from Yuseong Technical High in Ancheon.

121
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,260
Yuseong Technical High in Ancheon?

122
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,040
Where's that?

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,780
Yuseong High is the highest-ranking school in Ancheon.

124
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,610
Oh, that Yuseong?

125
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,950
What's going on?

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,710
Did Eom Seok Dae invite him to form an alliance with Ancheon?

127
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, maybe he did.

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,850
Hey, why did a Yuseong student come to Seoul?

129
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,210
Are you expanding your territory or something?

130
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,920
Territory?

131
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,240
You mean, in terms of subjects?

132
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,390
I did think something was off.

133
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,610
Now I get it.

134
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,290
Top students wouldn't toss their eyeglasses like this.

135
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,910
F***. So many in-app purchases.

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,510
Hey, reactivate your card already.

137
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,130
M-My mom won't answer my call.

138
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,860
So what? Call until she answers. You f***er.

139
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,390
Okay.

140
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,900
So f***ing annoying.

141
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,380
F***. How badly are they beating him up?

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,860
   

143
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,460
What the f*** is this?

144
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,700
Why won't you answer your phone?

145
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,230
Reactivate the card quickly.

146
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,310
Do it now unless you want to see your son die.

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,050
N-Never mind, Mom.

148
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,930
It might be okay.

149
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,010
Are these your glasses, by chance?

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,750
Well, yes. They are.

151
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,740
Thank you.

152
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,650
Why do you look at me like that?

153
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,080
By chance—

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,910
One moment.

155
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,150
Hello?

156
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,140
Hello? Yoon Ga Min, are you at Manik High now, by chance?

157
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,930
 Yes. Where are you guys? 

158
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,400
 This is hilarious. 

159
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,110
Did you rewrite history, Ga Min?

160
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,010
Why didn't you answer your phone?

161
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,530
I put it on silent.

162
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,900
So it doesn't interfere with studying.

163
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,040
It's not Manik High. It's Manil High next to it. Manil.

164
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,190
Oh, I see.

165
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,110
 Four-eyed Psycho, who was it at Manik High? Yoo Joon something? 

166
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,870
- Min. Min. 
 - Yes, Min.

167
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,160
Haven't you seen Yoo Joon Min?

168
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,390
- Yoo Joon Min? 
  - He's a Manil High study group member. 

169
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,270
Are you Yoo Joon Min?

170
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,120
He's with me right now.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,730
There's no time to talk on the phone. Let's leave.

172
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,140
A real monster is about to show up—

173
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,180
 Is it you? 

174
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,410
Did you hang my guys like laundry?

175
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,740
What? Are you getting serious?

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,100
   

177
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,980
- W-What was that? 
 - A takedown?

178
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,410
- What do we do? 
 - This is bad.

179
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,890
That Yoon Ga Min could be in danger.

180
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,290
- There's a guy named Eom Seok Dae there— 
 - No. No, that's not what she meant.

181
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,580
Those bastards are in trouble.

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,000
Be thugs amongst yourselves if you must.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,470
Don't bother the kids who are studying.

184
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,250
No.

185
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,750
My glasses.

186
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,640
Your glasses.

187
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,100
Should we start the group exchange now?

188
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,630
There's something called "The Rule of Two Pizza Pies."

189
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,510
If each person eats two slices of pizza,

190
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,770
two pies are a good amount for about eight people.

191
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,260
We analyzed each person's strengths and weaknesses.

192
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,880
We established the study group's goal and detailed action plans

193
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,720
- to start the study group activities. 
 - Action plans?

194
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,970
- That's not it. 
 - No?

195
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,490
Each of us is in charge of our strongest subject.

196
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,220
We enhance strengths and improve weaknesses...

197
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,860
 It wasn't really an exchange since we were there to learn, 

198
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,060
 but there was so much to learn, including their passion for studying 

199
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,440
 and their system to support it. 

200
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,720
I apologize for speaking rudely earlier.

201
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,980
I was biased.

202
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm sorry I misjudged you, too.

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,490
It was my impurity.

204
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,850
What?

205
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,290
- Do you mean "insecurity"? 
 - Shut up.

206
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,750
I'm trying to help you.

207
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,450
So embarrassing.

208
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,050
- I was just informing you. 
 - Hey...

209
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,040
Should we talk for a moment?

210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,600
Yes.

211
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,860
Well...

212
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,750
Thank you and I'm sorry.

213
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,260
Why are you sorry?

214
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,410
I wasn't going to tell you because you didn't seem to recognize me.

215
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,110
Don't you remember me?

216
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,650
Huh?

217
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,150
 You can't join our study group. 

218
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,280
 You're at the bottom of our class. 

219
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,540
 Hey, don't make eye contact with him. 

220
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,090
 He has no conscience. 

221
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,390
 How dare he try to use us? 

222
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,600
You're that Yoo Joon Min?

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,620
You remember.

224
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,080
Of course. You were always at the top of the class.

225
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm sorry I rejected you and made fun of you then.

226
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,130
Well, I was a bit arrogant that I got good grades.

227
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,030
But I realized it now that I'm here.

228
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,810
There are so many people who are so much better than me.

229
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,910
I was just a big fish in a small pond.

230
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,660
I'm not saying this because you saved me.

231
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,080
I'm really sorry for what I did.

232
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,420
It's okay.

233
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,850
I was angry at myself then.

234
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,250
I never blamed you.

235
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,670
 Yes, I'm in first place. 

236
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,330
 I was more envious. 

237
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,130
But now, I have friends to study with.

238
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,070
I'm glad.

239
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,600
Yes.

240
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,160
By the way, how do you remember me?

241
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,380
Well...

242
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,520
How could I not?

243
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,640
You said your goal was to be the No. 1 student in school at the beginning of the semester,

244
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,550
but you actually made the bottom.

245
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,130
 But you kept insisting on studying. How could I forget you? 

246
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,200
Keep working hard.

247
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,900
With that kind of determination...

248
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,800
you could be the No. 1 in your school...

249
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,680
or the country, even.

250
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,540
What? Yoon Ga Min, are you crying?

251
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,610
- No. 
 - What do you mean, no?

252
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,440
- Hey, he's crying. 
 - What?

253
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,940
- Hey, why are you crying? 
 - Yoon Ga Min!

254
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,970
 Let's go. Let's go. 

255
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,240
Yoon Ga Min.

256
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,400
- You know where you're going, right? 
 - Seventh floor.

257
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,660
Stop complaining and hurry up.

258
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,670
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

259
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,220
Hurry up, Lee Ji Woo.

260
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,900
So dusty.

261
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,290
- Geez... 
 - Look at this cobweb...

262
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,370
Hey, is this really it?

263
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,900
Geez, are you kidding me?

264
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,260
I'll go and ask them again.

265
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm nervous.

266
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,940
What?

267
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,230
We'll put a desk and have meetings here.

268
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,340
We'll put a list of plans there.

269
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,030
I love it.

270
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,560
We're seeing the same thing right now, right?

271
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,760
He's in a different dimension now. Different dimension.

272
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,130
Excuse me.

273
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,600
This is a real cobweb, right?

274
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,810
Why would it be fake?

275
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,360
It's dirty. Don't.

276
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,270
You scared me.

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
How will we study here?

278
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,140
This isn't a study group room.

279
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,530
It is if the group leader says so.

280
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,120
Should we start by cleaning then?

281
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,310
♫  Bad girls make'm say "Wow!"  ♫

282

Look at this.

283
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,390
It doesn't even work.

284
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,870
Can't believe I'm removing cobweb.

285
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,030
Move.

286
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,610
Just go. You can go.

287
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,340
- Behave yourself. 
 - You be good.

Han Kyeong,

307
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,860
did someone at your level have to go there

308
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,960
by giving up on the Teacher Certification Exam?

309
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,850
I have something I need to do there.

310
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,180
Ms. Lee!

311
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,540
   

312
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,300
So, you want a disciplinary committee meeting to punish Pi Han Wool?

313
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,780
Yes. That's the only way for Yuseong High to change.

314
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,620
I need your support, sir.

315
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,040
You need my support?

316
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,480
You must know what this means.

317
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,030
Are you someone who can pull this off?

318
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,340
I will give it a try.

319
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,490
Giving it a try won't do.

320
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,720
I need to risk a lot, too.

321
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
What I'm asking is

322
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,580
what is it about you that I could possibly trust that I should bet on this?

323
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,510
You have nothing.

324
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,460
What gives you the confidence to ask me this?

325
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,450
   

326
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,380
- I can change it. 
 - Change what?

327
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,340
This school.

328
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm sorry but at my age,

329
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,510
you realize you can't change the world

330
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,540
with nothing but a cheeky spirit like that.

331
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,180
That's why I'm not interested in betting on you.

332
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,420
Instead, I want to test your abilities.

333
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,340
What do you say?

334
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,930
   

335
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,680
How could this work out for us?

336
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,110
- I know. 
 - Yoon Ga Min, you're the best!

337
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,630
You're the best, Group Leader!

338
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,770
What the f***? You made the smoking room so pretty.

339
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,490
This is the study group room.

340
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,820
Put out the cigarette unless you want your mouth on the floor.

341
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,130
What? What? What? Study group?

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,080
You're losers who are terrible at studying.

343
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,970
Give me a freaking break. Seriously.

344
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,860
Hey, try to think for a second.

345
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,660
Just because you put your heads together and did stuff here,

346
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,090
you won't be as smart as a person.

347
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,780
There will be static electricity.

348
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,940
- Hey, you— 
 - Calm down.

349
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,780
You have to deal with more than the Vice Principal if you hurt him.

350
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,790
Oh, it's you.

351
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,470
The No. 1 fighter of the 10th grade.

352
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,220
I'm the No. 1 in grades.

353
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,170
   

354
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,690
Should I stop?

355
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,140
Will you hit me if I say no?

356
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,530
Being a good fighter is nothing to brag about in school.

357
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,950
You're an idiot who can't even study.

358
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,380
That son of a bitch.

359
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,110
You know what? Not knowing when to give up

360
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,040
means you're f***ing stupid, too.

361
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,930
Hey, Kim Se Hyeon.

362
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,140
What are you doing here?

363
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,780
Do you have time to jerk around while playing the king of the losers?

364
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,710
Shouldn't you start making money soon?

365
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,980
Are you tutoring them privately?

366
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,070
Do you guys even know he's a poor bastard?

367
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,730
Anyway, study hard, guys.

368
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,590
I'd love a friendly competition.

369
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,850
Oh, well...

370
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,470
Ms. Lee, hello.

371
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,790
Fighting, everyone.

372
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,850
Fighting.

373
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,140
- Se Hyeon. 
 - Yes.

374
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,280
How much time do we have left until the midterms?

375
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,420
- Why? 
 - I need to beat him in grades.

376
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,830
First of all, you need to know yourself clearly.

377
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,440
Here are your placement test rankings.

378
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,350
Lee Ji Woo.

379
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,280
Average score, 14 points.

380
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,520
Out of 220 students, you're in 180th place.

381
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,040
Whoa.

382
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,850
- What? 
 - Lee Joon.

383
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,580
- Average score, 31 points. 
 - What?

384
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,180
132nd place in the entire school.

385
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,420
Geez, I'm worse than gochujang?

386
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,050
I fight with my mind, okay?

387
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,240
I'll pluck your eyeballs.

388
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,600
- Choi Hee Won. 
 - Yes.

389
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,420
Average score, 29.

390
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,000
162nd place in the entire school.

391
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,350
Anyone would think Hee Won is a good student.

392
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,300
Yoon Ga Min.

393
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,100
- Yes. 
 - Your total score is 25 points.

394
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,500
It's not the average score. It's the total score.

395
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,390
The average score is 8 points.

396
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,210
You're in 219th place in the entire school.

397
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,240
Four-eyed Psycho, 8 points?

398
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,280
Hey, you'd get a better score by guessing.

399
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,490
Lastly, it's Kim Se Hyeon.

400
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,600
Average score, 95 points.

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,340
Second place in the entire school.

402
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,940
- Wow. 
 - Second place?

403
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,000
Shit, you're a liar.

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,540
I'm impressed.

405
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,270
It's nothing.

406
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,190
Everyone but Se Hyeon is at the bottom, right?

407
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,150
But our grades could miraculously improve if we tried from now on, right?

408
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,050
Ga Min,

409
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,960
there's no such thing as a miracle in grades.

410
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,760
If you were in a normal high school, I mean.

411
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,640
But this is Yuseong Tech High.

412
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,660
We have 20 days until the midterms.

413
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,620
You can do it if you do as I say from now on.

414
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,100
- I'm hungry. 
 - Still?

415
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,870
- Yes. 
 - Right, I heard something earlier.

416
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,170
What is it?

417
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,170
 - I heard you are running a study group at school. 
 - Yes. 

418
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:29,090
 Improve all of their overall rankings by 10 then. 

419
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,050
 Why? Would it be too difficult? 

420
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,750
 No. 

421
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,230
 I'll give it a try. 

422
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,670
 I'll improve all of their rankings by at least 10. 

423
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,820
By 10 rankings each?

424
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,320
Yes.

425
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,710
- All of us? 
 - Yes.

426
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,450
I'm jealous, Four-eyed Psycho.

427
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,340
It'd be so easy for you.

428
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,860
How about Se Hyeon then?

429
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,780
Does he have to be in 1st place since he's in 2nd place?

430
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,350
- Wow. 
 - How intense.

431
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,490
Guys, I'll get going now.

432
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,220
What? Aren't you hungry? Let's get tteokbokki.

433
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,550
I'm meeting someone. I need to go now. Bye.

434
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,360
What's wrong with him? Is he shocked because he has to be in 1st place?

435
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,040
Tteokbokki, yes?

436
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,700
- Yes. 
 - Yes? Yes?

437
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,050
Let's get tteokbokki.

438
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,030
I'm on my way now.

439
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,690
 You bastard. Do you think I was joking? 

440
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,540
 Come to the site as soon as you're off school! 

441
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,380
 - Kim Se Hyeon. 
 - Yes. 

442
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
 Choi Jong Hwa. 

443
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,560
 Yes. 
   

444
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,340
 Kim Ho Min. 

445
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,610
 You should be stuck at home. 

446
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,060
 Why do you go around town and get scammed? 

447
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,610
 I didn't do that to only feed myself. 

448
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,770
 How long will we keep living like this? 

449
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,580
 F***! 

450
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,220
 You loser! 

451
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,850
 - Seriously! 
 - You son of a bitch! 

452
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,480
 - Die! Die! 

453
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,990
 Please stop! 

454
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,500
 Enough is enough! Stop! 

455
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,150
 Go kill yourself! 

456
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,880
 Poor bastard. 

457
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,610
 He can't come to our playground because he doesn't live in our building. 

458
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,350
 Why does he keep coming here? 

459
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,630
 Are you a beggar? 

460
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,930
 Se Hyeon. 

461
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,820
Hey.

462
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,310
I thought you were meeting someone.

463
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, I am.

464
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,930
Should we walk together?

465
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,590
I think we're going in the same direction.

466
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,560
Together?

467
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,350
- Let's do it later if you don't want to. 
 - I-It's not like that.

468
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's walk together. I'd like to.

469
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,580
Okay.

470
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,470
Thank you for what you did that day.

471
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,970
That day?

472
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,480
At the police station.

473
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,950
You accompanied me there.

474
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,930
Oh, that day?

475
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,290
I didn't do much then.

476
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,860
You explained the situation to the police calmly.

477
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,180
I couldn't have even gone in if I were alone.

478
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,190
It's nothing.

479
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,640
Yoon Ga Min was the impressive one.

480
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,400
He destroyed the real thugs

481
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,510
and he saved Manil High by fighting the bad kids, too.

482
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,750
He reminds me of a superhero in a comic.

483
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,860
If Yoon Ga Min were the main character,

484
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,710
I'm probably Friend No. 3 next to him?

485
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,980
That's probably all I am.

486
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,000
I think you underestimate yourself too much.

487
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,930
You destroyed the computer with the video in front of the disciplinary committee.

488
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,610
Not anyone can do stuff like that.

489
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,660
I think Ga Min is very impressive,

490
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,120
but I also think you're really...

491
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,010
really impressive.

492
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,210
- Really? 
 - Yes.

493
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,210
Huh? It's the poor bastard.

494
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,050
Come here.

495
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,510
Gosh, you immature bastard.

496
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,160
You're going out with a girl now?

497
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,300
You terrible son.

498
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,400
Come here. Come here. Come here.

499
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,510
You're a forever loser because you live such a pathetic life.

500
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,350
Stop it.

501
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,030
Who's worrying about whom? You bitch.

502
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,650
Hey, I'm glad I caught you today.

503
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,110
You bitch. Hey.

504
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,650
You had your fun last time.

505
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,760
Go ahead and do it again.

506
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,040
Why? Are you embarrassed in front of the boys?

507
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
Hey!

508
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
You'd better stop.

509
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,060
Stop what? Stop what?

510
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,370
Stop what, you f***er?

511
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,900
You're losers who can't fend for yourselves, but you're acting cool.

512
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Why does someone like you hang out with this loser?

513
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,190
He can't even buy you a roll of gimbap.

514
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,580
Look at him.

515
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,630
He actually dolled up for her.

516
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,850
Right, Se Hyeon?

517
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,530
Wow.

518
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,740
- Wow. 
 - Se Hyeon...

519
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,500
You thought you could do something if you fought me in that moment?

520
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,400
Does being Yoon Ga Min's underling make you feel like somebody, too?

521
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,970
What a f***ing loser.

522
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,600
Guys,

523
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,200
he needs to do physical labor. Don't break anything.

524
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,700
Beat him up enough and let him go.

525
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,610
- See you later. Bye. 
 - You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

526
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,330
Hey, are you okay?

527
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,090
Are you out of your mind?

528
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,560
You want to fight me right now?

529
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,700
No, I'm playing a game. Ddakbang game.

530
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,100
Let's just play 10 games to determine who the winner and loser is.

531
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,530
You're eager to get expelled, aren't you?

532
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,560
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

533
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,330
I won again.

534
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,140
It's 2:0.

535
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,130
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

536
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,900
You didn't play this time.

537
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,400
- Go on and play. 
 - Take pictures. Take pictures.

538
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,640
I hate getting pictures taken.

539
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,140
Sorry.

540
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,920
- Se Hyeon. 
 - Let's run.

541
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,660
Are you okay?

542
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,860
Se Hyeon.

543
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

544
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
It's okay.

545
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,910
I'm okay.

546
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,600
He called us losers, but we're winners. Right?

547
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,500
You're the winner.

548
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,050
What?

549
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
I'll leave now.

♫  My days on these narrow streets  ♫

Welcome home—

552
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,400
You bastard. Won't you make money?

553
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,300
I told you to come to the site and learn the job.

554
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,000
Is that really that hard?

555
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,260
Did I say I won't make money?

556
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,110
I'll do it once I graduate high school.

557
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,300
How about the debt?

558
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,000
What will you do with the debt your mom created?

559
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,100
I said I'll pay it.

560
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,110
It's not even my debt, but I said I'll pay it.

561
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,370
Listen to this bastard.

562
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,110
How dare you talk, looking at me like that?

563
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,600
Father,

564
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,700
being humiliated by your colleagues

565
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,430
matters more than the blood on my face. Right?

566
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,150
You bastard. You talk just like your mother, don't you?

567
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,380
You always say, "Your mother, your mother," because of some debt.

568
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,060
She was your wife before she was my mom.

Why are you here now?

572
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,800
Come to my place.

573
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
What?

574
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,830
To be honest, I have something in common with you.

575
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,200
So, come to my place.

576
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,990
It's okay. You go on.

577

No one takes you in past 10.

579
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,710
If we take a taxi and go home before the curfew time,

580
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,160
my mom won't say anything either.

581
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
How about the taxi fare?

582
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,600
It'd be more than 10,000 won from here.

583
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,200
It's okay. I'll pay.

584

You don't really understand...

585

why I'm like this over just 10,000 won.

00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,910
Hello? Hello?

654
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,570
You son of a bitch. You're dead today.

655
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,610
You f***er.

656
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,950
Roll backward. Backward.

657
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,530
No...

658
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,690
Cover your face, roll to the right, and get up.

659
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,030
Hello? Hello—

660
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,580
   

661
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,260
 It doesn't have to be a a great victory. 

662
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,390
Get up.

663
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,880
 What comforts you from losing... 

664
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,060
 isn't the perfect score test result. 

665
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,030
Huh?

666
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,040
Huh?

667
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,820


668
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,810
 One circle is enough. 

669
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,180
♫  All right. This is my world  ♫

670
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,770
♫  I have a question  ♫

671
