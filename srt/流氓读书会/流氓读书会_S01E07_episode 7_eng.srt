1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,330
 By chance, do any of you... 

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,450
 want to become a gangster in the future? 

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:19,570


4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm sure you don't.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,040
Of course, a few ended up on the wrong path.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,880
But someone placed a petition with the Education Office,

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,740
as if our school is a gangster training ground.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,730
 What the hell? 

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,310
This not only hurts

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,810
our school's public image seriously,

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,800
but we'll soon be under inspection, too.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,430
Sadly, this could result in the school closing.

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,410
Don't you agree, Ms. Lee Han Kyeong?

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,850
What do you think?

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,560
Would you like to come up and say a word?

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,410
Our students are being accused of

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,250
attending a gangster training school now.

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,170
Don't you think apologizing to them

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,570
would be the least you could do as an educator?

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,710
Go on.

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,610
 Hurry up. 

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,070
 Let's be done with this! 

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,220
 Hurry up! 

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,730
- Go up! 
 - Go!

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,810
 Go up there! 

26
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,120
   

27
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,460
Our school...

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,340
is not in a normal state right now.

29
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,100
 - It's not normal? 
 - What's she saying? 

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,700
I was assigned to this school only recently,

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,340
but I've known about it for a long time.

32
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,380
Through my teacher,

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,010
the late Ms. Oh Jeong Hwa.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,420
What?

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,610
   

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,950
 Looks like you aren't busy. 

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,990
 I have time to celebrate your birthday. 

38
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,950
 Can you pass the Certification Exam like that? 

39
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,250
 Of course, I can. 

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,210
 Of course? 

41
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,540
 - Of course? 
 - What? 

42
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,750
 - Wow. 
 - What? 

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,550
 - What? What? What? 
 - Lee Han Kyeong. 

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,460
 "Of course," you said? 

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,830
 Seriously. 

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,070
 Why do you still have that? 

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,510
 Delete it. 

48
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,380
 Gosh, seriously. 

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,370
 Isn't it amazing how much people can change? 

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,650
 Seeing you cheer me up, though. 

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
 It's hard, isn't it? 

52
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,590
 It's just that... 

53
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,340
 kids aren't on the same page as me. 

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,610
 I told you... 

55
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,530
 not to choose a school like that. 

56
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,360
 But it will change because you're there. 

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,070
 Just like I did. 

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,130
 Focus on yourself, okay? 

59
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,360
 Don't call me again if you fail the exam. 

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,990
 Got it. 

61
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,910
 I will give that a thought, too. 

62
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,810
 What? 

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,920
 Here's to Lee Han Kyeong passing the exam. 

64
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,450
 In an alleyway in Dong-gu, Ancheon, 

65
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,220
 a woman in her 40s was stabbed to death. 

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,230
 The police are investigating this 

67
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,740
 as a case of random assault. 

68
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,130
I will turn...

69
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,780
this school back to normal.

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,110
- Ms. Lee. 
 - I've been trying to...

71
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,160
change the ones who tried to destroy the school,

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
but now,

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,650
I'll protect the ones who are hurting from them.

74
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,090
Regardless of who my opponent will be.

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,850
 What? 

76
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,470
Getting hit hurts, doesn't it?

77
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,790
You're just a person, too.

78
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,300
So, stop acting so cocky.

79
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,170
♫  Yeah, we the backpacker  ♫

80
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,260
   

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,790
   

82
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,620
   

83
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,640
   

84
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
♫  Low life living up, started from the bottom  ♫

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,050
♫  I risk it all, follow me to the streets  ♫

86
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,560
♫  I greet with fists, fighting is my passion  ♫

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
♫  The anticipation burns up, caution  ♫

88
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,310
   

89
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,550
   

90
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,490
   

91
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,830
♫  Gasping for breath, I head back  ♫

92
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,370
♫  That's right, baby, just like I said, I bet my whole life  ♫

93
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,250
   

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,070
Geez!

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,940
Wasn't that incredible?

96
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,530
He punched Pi Han Wool.

97
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,080
Hey, hey, hey.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,410
You think he's your friend?

99
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,640
You'll get f***ed, you idiot.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,820
No one heard me.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,910
Everyone was saying his name in the auditorium.

102
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,020
Yoon Ga Min sure is a monster, isn't he?

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,930
How did he punch Pi Han Wool?

104
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,250
Hey, how can you read the vocabulary right now?

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,520
We're about to get fired from backup fighters now.

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,610
Is that so important?

107
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,060
We'll just get fired, then.

108
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,710
Really?

109
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,710
How will you make money, then?

110
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,910
Fighting is the only thing we know.

111
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,360
How will we make money?

112
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,790
You just want to make easy money, is that so?

113
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,510
What the f*** do you know?

114
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,970
What do I not know?

115
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,710
That you sold the reward car and lost it gambling?

116
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,280
You f***er!

117
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,230
Are you innocent? Even your grandpa—

118
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,960
Hey.

119
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,170
What about my grandpa?

120
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,630
Will you let him keep acting out?

121
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,230
Bang.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,040
I suppose you're frustrated, too.

123
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,370
You can't stand out at school because of your dad.

124
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,770
I noticed they were similar.

125
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,220
She was her student.

126
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,050
I know.

127
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,140
It's really interesting.

128
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,350
What will you do?

129
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,360
She said she'll protect.

130
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,830
Let her try if she can.

131
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,040
Yes, Ahjussi.

132
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,740
I've been thinking a bit.

133
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,990
How does Soon Cheol sound for that?

134
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,770
   

135
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,290
So, have you become a great man yet?

136
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,220
You're talking about that again.

137
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,100
You asked me yesterday, too.

138
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,760
How can anyone become great in a day, Grandpa?

139
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm impatient because I'm about to die, punk.

140
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll die in peace if I saw my grandson

141
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
become a great man.

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,650
I should become great slowly so you live longer.

143
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,120
You bastard.

144
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,670
So, stop saying you'll die.

145
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,810
You aren't even interested in dying.

146
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,870
That's why I'm studying for the TOEIC, too.

147
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,650
The moment a person stops learning,

148
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,860
their life stops, too.

149
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes.

150
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,640
You've been paying on time. What happened?

151
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,510
If you give me a bit more time, I'll try to—

153
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,070
I understand it's getting difficult.

154
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,530
It's a lot of money for a high school student.

155
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,490
I can try something this time,

156
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,540
but I can't delay it any longer. You know, right?

157
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,810
Yes, thank you.

158
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,550
Thank you.

159
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,240
Thank you.

160
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,550
What's with you?

161
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,950
Hey.

162
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,080
I wondered why you went after Pi Han Wool.

163
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,520
I see what happened now.

164
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,380
I'm sorry about that.

165
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,320
I didn't understand the situation.

166
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,370
It's okay.

167
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,020
Is your mother doing okay?

168
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,550
Yes, she can be discharged soon.

169
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,510
That's good to hear.

170
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,960
By the way, why do you listen to Pi Han Wool?

171
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,800
I know you want to study, too.

172
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,710
   

173
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,660
What would change if I studied?

174
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,420
Pardon?

175
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,360
Well,

176
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,090
- you'll go to college. 
 - Then what?

177
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,280
If I go to college, I'll graduate.

178
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,770
If I graduate, I'll find a good job.

179
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,370
But I can join YB Construction

180
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,870
if I just stay near Pi Han Wool.

181
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,160
It's a reputable corporation.

182
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,290
I'm in 12th grade.

183
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,070
Studying now won't change anything.

184
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,860
   

185
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,750
Yes, Dae Cheol.

186
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,230
Hide somewhere right now.

187
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,510
Those assholes are here.

188
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,170
- The trainer? 
  - Yes, it's me. 

189
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,400
   

190
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,350
   

191
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,730
Soon Cheol, long time no see.

192
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,990
- Hello. 
 - Hey.

193
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,650
Wow.

194
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,130
You look great.

195
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,780
We need to go somewhere together.

196
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,860
R-Right now?

197
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,530
Why? Are you busy?

198
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,590
No.

199
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,960
Where are you going?

200
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,710
What's this now?

201
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,630
What's your name?

202
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,120
Me?

203
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,110
- I'm Yoon— 
 - Go away, you idiot.

204
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,850
Are you f***ing crazy?

205
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,560
I think he's in 10th grade.

206
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,690
I don't know him.

207
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,590
Really?

208
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,340
What an interesting kid.

209
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,170
Let's go now.

210
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go.

211
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,530
Won't you study?

212
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,000
The midterm is coming up.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,140
He's saying something to you.

214
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,270
He's not right in the head.

215
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,040
I knew it. Just look at him.

216
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,350
Soon Cheol, you have a lot to do today.

217
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,830
It will be a long night.

218
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,150
   

219
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,020
All done.

220
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,650
So, how many answers did I get wrong?

221
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,000
Four...

222
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,080
I only got four wrong?

223
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,300
No.

224
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,450
You got everything wrong but four.

225
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,450
But this is very impressive.

226
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,390
I can't even solve one of these questions.

227
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
I got three right yesterday.

228
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,890
I got one more right. Here.

229
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,170
Why do you study for the TOEIC?

230
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,820
What do you mean?

231
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,770
Because... the TOEIC is for getting a job.

232
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,950
So, you mean,

233
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,980
why am I doing this when I'm about to die?

234
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,830
No, no.

235
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,950
That's not what I meant.

236
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,830
- It's fun. 
 - Pardon?

237
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,610
I'm becoming a better person than I was yesterday.

238
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,350
How could I not do something this fun?

239
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,430
 Hey. 

240
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,150
 If you meet Soon Cheol, 

241
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,860
 teach him how fun it is to study. Okay? 

242
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,510
 I think you could do it. 

243
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,130
 Last evening, near the Ancheon Port, 

244
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,430
 a man in his 40s was found dead from a stabbing. 

245
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,500
 The police used the CCTV 

246
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,110
 to determine that the suspect is 

247
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,500
 an 18-year-old high school student, Kim, 

248
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,040
 and they are searching for him. 

249
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,770
Isn't that obviously our school uniform?

250
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,440
But to kill someone?

251
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,550
By the way, I think I've seen him before.

252
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,390
Isn't this Kim Soon Cheol, the blonde?

253
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,160
- Kim Soon Cheol? 
 - Yeah.

254
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,860
- Pi Han Wool's underling, Kim Soon Cheol? 
 - Yes.

255
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,020
You're right.

256
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,900
Right? Look, Yoon Ga Min.

257
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,050
- Is it him? 
 - Look. He's blonde.

258
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,830
- Yoon Ga Min. 
 - It has to be him.

259
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,570
What's wrong?

260
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,120
It's nothing.

261
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,000
But don't you think it's him?

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,410
Yes, he's the blonde.

263
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,670
Yoon Ga Min,

264
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,620
you met Kim Soon Cheol last night. Right?

265
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,970
- Yes. 
 - What?

266
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,780
So, you suggested he study with you,

267
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,290
but he left the hospital with a Yeonbaek Gang member?

268
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,410
Yes.

269
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,730
And that was around 10:45 p.m.?

270
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,340
Yes.

271
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,280
And? Anything else?

272
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,150
 Soon Cheol, you have a lot to do today. 

273
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,550
 It will be a long night. 

274
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,700
No, there was nothing else.

275
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,890
Is that so?

276
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,680
Okay.

277
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,210
By the way...

278
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,610
Yes.

279
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,980
Do you...

280
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,390
really think Soon Cheol is the murderer?

281
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,020
He's the top suspect right now.

282
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,630
I mean,

283
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,030
do you really believe that, too?

284
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,840
Hey, this isn't about what I believe.

285
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm just saying that's how it seems.

286
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,820
   

287
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,040
Are you still thinking about that?

288
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,610
By the way, do you think Soon Cheol could have done that?

289
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,690
He's a backup fighter.

290
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,370
He's close to Pi Han Wool, too.

291
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,120
- But still. 
 - Why?

292
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,500
Do you think he didn't?

293
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,540
What are we discussing this early?

294
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,590
Hee Won and I investigated the Kim Soon Cheol case.

295
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,430
That's what this is about?

296
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,700
Why are you doing this now?

297
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,850
Who cares what a thug has been up to?

298
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,600
Right.

299
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,380
Ta-da.

300
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,860
If you look at this graph,

301
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,710
since Pi Han Wool joined the school last year,

302
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,040
murders committed by high schoolers

303
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,090
in Ancheon skyrocketed.

304
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,390
It's clearly much higher than in other regions.

305
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,380
Was this neighborhood cursed?

306
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,090
But to say that,

307
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,110
the overall crime rate isn't higher than others.

308
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,470
What does that mean? Help me understand.

309
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,310
The overall crime rate is the same,

310
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,000
but only the juvenile crime rate went up

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,650
which means the adult crime rate went down

312
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,900
and the juvenile crime rate is going up.

313
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Another words,

314
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,300
high school students are used in adult crimes.

315
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Don't you think that could be the case?

316
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,880
They use high schoolers?

317
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,110
Why?

318
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,530
What makes us better than the gangsters?

319
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,900
- Our looks? 
 - Bingo.

320
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,100
Hee Won.

321
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,540
Sorry. I thought he was right, too.

322
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,230
Okay.

323
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,000
Age?

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,900
Bingo.

325
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,340
When did you get here, Four-eyed Psycho?

326
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,970
I just got the chills.

327
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,310
That's right.

328
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,160
We're protected by the

329
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,020
juvenile law because we're minors.

330
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,720
A first-time offender and a minor?

331
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,790
You'd be on parole in a few years.

332
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,260
Seriously.

333
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,800
You only get a few years after killing someone?

334
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
What? Are you guys acting?

335
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,460
I thought you'd ask that.

336
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,460
But still. Would anyone go to prison for someone?

337
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,200
What if you serve just three years,

338
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
join the Yeonbaek Family and the YB Construction?

339
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,500
Whoa, sweet.

340
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,160
Sweet, my foot.

341
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,300
Okay, you have a point, but...

342
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,800
where's the evidence that the thug isn't the murderer?

343
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,700
Well...

344
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
There isn't any.

345
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,270
I need your help.

346
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,160
Huh? You're Soon Cheol's friend?

347
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,600
Soon Cheol isn't the culprit.

348
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,180
Give me a break, you f***er.

349
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,120
- Hey, Dae Cheol. 
 - Yes.

350
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,100
You're still talking bulls***.

351
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,700
You need to be trained more.

352
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,400
You don't mean studying, do you?

353
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,940
What's this crazy bastard saying?

354
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,600
Right.

355
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,100
Aren't you the ugly psycho from the hospital?

356
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm not.

357
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,540
Look at you, bastard.

358
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,390
Hey.

359
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,880
What are you looking at me like that for?

360
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,370
Just be on your way.

361
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,260
These f***ers are acting up together.

362
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,070
You asked for this. Okay?

363
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,770
You petty bastard.

364
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,700
A metal pipe? A metal ball...

365
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
What happened?

366
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,650
 I saw it clearly. 

367
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,850
 Choo Seong Woong... was cleaning a bloody knife. 

368
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,830
Actually,

369
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,380
it's an open secret among the backup fighters.

370
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,330
When a top Yeonbaek Gang kills someone,

371
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,230
a backup fighter serves time instead.

372
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,510
You believe what he said?

373
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,800
I always believe Ga Min, but...

374
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,390
I also think that's a bit...

375
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,700
Wake up, you naive bastard.

376
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,120
Those thugs are using you.

377
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,240
Well, is that so?

378
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,700
But Soon Cheol's...

379
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,980
eyes definitely said he wanted to study.

380
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,400
We should believe it, then.

381
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,870
Yes.

382
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,800
I will, too.

383
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,450
That silly eye talk...

384
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,530
Of course, I believe it, too.

385
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,860
I believed Soon Cheon from the beginning.

386
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,530
Since when you called him, "Hyung"?

387
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,300
You always called him "Kim Soon Cheol."

388
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
- I'm not like you. 
 - Hey.

389
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,390
You're all grown up now, huh?

390
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,020
By the way, what are we...

391
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,500
supposed to do now?

392
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,060
By the way, that knife...

393
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,180
He wouldn't have washed it if he meant to toss it.

394
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,580
   

395
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,700
Just find the murderer's knife from there, right?

396
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,400
Stay very alert.

397
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,500
 Be careful. 

398
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,220
 Thank you. 

399
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,370
 Looks like Seo Yoo Bi didn't learn her lesson yet. 

400
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,210
 Teach her a lesson when you see her. 

401
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,200
HQ. HQ.

402
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,730
Can you hear me? Over.

403
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,910
Give me a break.

404
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,350
Hey!

405
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,750
This is the HQ. This is the HQ.

406
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,000
I can hear well. Over.

407
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,800
We won't get caught at the entrance, right?

408
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,350
There are tons of backup fighters.

409
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,260
They don't know their faces.

410
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,640
Yes, don't worry.

411
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,180
We'll call the police if it seems dangerous.

412
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,740
Shall we?

413
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,560
Name.

414
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,660
Gook Gwan Woo from Heukchang High.

415
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,850
I'm Jang Bi Hwan!

416
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,700
I'm Seo Yoo Bi...

417
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,200
sir.

418
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
I've never seen you before.

419
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,190
Gook Gwan Woo. Jang Bi Hwan. Seo Yoo Bi.

420
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,360
Oh, Heukchang High?

421
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,720
Okay. Go in.

422
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,700
 Thank you. 

423
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,390
Yay!

424
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,500
Kim Se Hyeon, you say they don't know their faces?

425
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
Sorry.

426
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,040
What a relief.

427
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
I got so scared thinking we'd get caught.

428
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,600
We got scared for nothing. Stupid bastards.

429
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,300
Was there a girl among the backup fighters?

430
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,970
Probably.

431
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,690
Hold on! Stop!

432
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,780
Geez, we're screwed.

433
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,400
What?

434
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,300
The one with glasses.

435
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,470
- Yes? 
 - Your name is Gook Gwan Woo?

436
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,040
Yes.

437
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,030
Did we get caught?

438
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,730
I told you to take the glasses off.

439
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,110
Are you at an academy or something?

440
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,560
Why did you bring the backpack?

441
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,000
Get it together.

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,700
I was going to say that, too.

443
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
Go inside, you bastard.

444
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay.

445
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,500
Sorry.

446
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,800
It's the midterms.

447
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,410
Is something going on today?

448
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,810
Why?

449
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,270
Are we screwed?

450
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,110
   

451
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,300
 Wasn't there a backup fighters' meeting soon? 

452
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,130
 Right. 

453
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,490
 There's no way that's today. 

454
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,460
Gook Gwan Woo and Jang Bi Hwan. Those bastards.

455
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,590
Huh? This sounds too risky.

456
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,770
- Let's just leave. 
 - Yes, it's too dangerous.

457
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,750
No, we're already here.

458
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,480
Let's look quickly and leave.

459
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,810
- Sounds good. 
 - I don't want to come back.

460
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,770
Well, but...

461
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,840
Hee Won, can we check the left side, too?

462
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,970
Of course.

463
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,210
Looks like someone's there.

464
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,710
Yes.

465
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,170
Pi Han Wool and Choo Seong Woong on the fourth floor.

466
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,410
They're together.

467
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,540
 Pi Han Wool? Why is that bastard here? 

468
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,980
Let's wait a moment for now.

469
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,680
The knife is probably in there.

470
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,450
Wait until they leave.

471
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,210
We're on the fourth floor. Over.

472
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,720
 They're moving. 

473
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,380
Get ready.

474
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,800
Here they come. Here they come.

475
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,600
Once they take the elevator downstairs...

476
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,560
Huh?

477
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,400
What? What? What?

478
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
- What? 
 - What?

479
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,580
Why are they coming here?

480
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,230
Why come here instead of taking the elevator?

481
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,970
 What? 

482
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,160
Soon Cheol will turn himself in after the meeting.

483
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,800
Just so you know.

484
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
Yes, sir.

485
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,120
Fix the elevator quickly.

486
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,380
I'm sorry.

487
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,050
What?

488
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,590
I heard the door shutting near the rooftop.

489
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,550
No one's on the rooftop at this hour.

490
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,000
Hurry up.

491
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,030
I'll check just in case and meet you there.

492
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,100
It's the second floor, not the rooftop, you idiot.

493
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,160
We'll go upstairs as soon as they get to the first floor.

494
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,940
Okay?

495
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,360
Shit. What was that?

496
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,800
Shit.

497
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,500
Yoon Ga Min, where are you now?

498
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,420
   

499
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,730
Huh?

500
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,280
Geez, is it locked?

501
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,610
   

502
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,100
Hey, hey.

503
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,290
   

504
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,700
Wow.

505
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,790
Soon Cheol.

506
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,680
Soon Cheol joined our family.

507
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:32,050
   

508
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,950
This is to save your face.

509
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,330
Use it for your grandpa's hospital cost, right?

510
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,600
You should congratulate him instead of being jealous, right?

511
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,280
What's Ga Min doing there?

512
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,200
Yoon Ga Min, do something.

513
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,220
Well, the door just won't open.

514
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,070
Gosh, I think you need to go in now.

515
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,350
Why did you go up there and not follow us?

516
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,490
Sorry.

517
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,100
Don't worry, guys.

518
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,700
I can do Ga Min's part, too.

519
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,750
Shit. You've got to be kidding me.

520
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,700
We have no choice—

521
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,300
Huh?

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,150
Hold on.

523
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,370
What is it now?

524
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,670
The bastards with a backpack just now.

525
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,600
They're Gook Gwan Woo, Jang Bi Hwan, and Seo Yoo Bi?

526
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,300
Yes. Why do you ask?

527
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,110
Didn't she go in alone earlier?

528
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,950
Seo Yoo Bi.

529
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,230
What's going on today?

530
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,950
Why the f*** would he show up now?

531
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,900
Don't worry, Ji Woo.

532
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,200
You know what I'd say, right?

533
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,660
I'll forgive you for acting cool today.

534
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,400
Hang in there as much as possible.

535
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,030
Don't worry, I said.

536
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,400
Lee Ji Woo.

537
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,040
 Be careful, Joon. 

538
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,350
You're surprised to see me.

539
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,980
And you're wearing our school uniform.

540
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,940
You pretended to be No. 1 last time.

541
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,610
Pretending to be a backup fighter now?

542
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,810
You're so f***ing quick.

543
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,650
You didn't learn your lesson after getting crushed?

544
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,130
You can't say that when I fought three people.

545
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,190
And you should've learned your lesson, not me.

546
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,590
Are you crazy, Strawberry Head?

547
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,230
I feel like doing you a favor today.

548
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,160
I'll turn you into that thing.

549
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
What was it called?

550
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,200
Yes, yes.

551
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Go, go! New person!

552
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,630
- Hey. 
 - Gosh. What?

553
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,690
- Look at that. 
 - What?

554
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,270
- Over there. 
 - What?

555
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,850
That.

556
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,700
Detective Na Tae Man is here.

557
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,350
 Hurry up before he arrests Soon Cheol. 

558
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,820
 Did you find it, Lee Ji Woo? 

559
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,210
Shit. No, not yet.

560
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
I found it.

561
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,030
 Did you find it? 

562
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,200
 Get out of there then. 

563
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,770
 Yes, Ji Woo. Hurry. 

564
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,300
 Lee Ji Woo. Lee Ji Woo. 

565
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,200
 Ji Woo, why are you suddenly silent? 

566
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,610
 Is it a girl? 

567
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,310
You're a cutie.

568
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,590
I killed a man.

569
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,010


570
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,370
What's this now?

571
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,690
   

572
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,220
   

573
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,410
♫  My name on top  ♫

574
