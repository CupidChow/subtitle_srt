1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,930
What is Soon Cheol up to?

2
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,260
He's studying, of course.

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,700
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,950
It's the midterms.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,340
He studies hard to prove himself to you.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,780
Yes.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,200
So, why are you punks loafing around here?

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,250
Why don't you study together?

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,450
We were going to go now, anyway.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,700
Let's go.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,430
G-Grandpa,

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,440
if Soon Cheol is too busy to come,

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,740
we'll keep coming.

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,290
Huh?

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,080
Let's go.

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,480
You little bastards.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,360
Have you...

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,770
been at least eating well?

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,480


20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,780
Hey, I can't do this.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,010
Why? What do you mean?

22
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,070
They said they'd call us when they got the knife,

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,420
but we haven't heard from them.

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,190
It's Yoon Ga Min. He'll figure it out.

25
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,600
We let some juniors

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,200
we don't know take care of a friend of 10 years.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,610
Aren't you embarrassed we're just waiting?

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,180
I feel like shit, for one.

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,850
Don't act like you're the only loyal one.

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,050
Didn't you ask them, knowing this would happen?

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,410
Don't go if you don't want to.

32
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,520
I'll go alone.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
You can't just say that, you bastard!

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
You heard from the doctor, too!

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,690
Grandpa can pass away anytime now.

36
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,380
At least, his last image of Soon Cheol

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,960
might not be someone f***ing great,

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,440
but he shouldn't be scum. Right?

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,570
You f***er sure know how to talk.

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,380
Let's go and reclaim...

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,540
Grandpa's hospital fee.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,900
Yes, that's right.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,720
And Chae Seon Ho, that f***er.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's get back the money from the car sale, too.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,210
Idiot.

46
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,600
Bastard.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Son of a b****.

48

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,360
Let go, Strawberry Head!

70
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,850
Go ahead and say it again.

71
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,550
Was it "Go, go. New person"?

72
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,290
I'm different than Jang Bi Hwan, and

73
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,460
Gook Gwan Woo, those idiots. Okay?

74
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,280
They got scared because a detective threatened them a bit.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,380
Juvenile detention center?

76
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,690
So what if you get a criminal record?

77
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,920
It gets you a badge.

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,490
So, tell me now. Okay?

79
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,150
Tell me why you guys came in here.

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,080
Hey.

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,650
Your school uniform looks like Heukchang High.

82
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,930
But I've never seen you before.

83
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,370
I haven't played tag with a girl in a while.

84
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,580
What you're holding isn't something a girl should want.

85
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,190
I think she knows something.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
Let go, you pervert!

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,230
Shit. How embarrassing.

88
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,450
Wow, you have a pretty face,

89
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,210
but you can't stand losing, can you?

90
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,980
F***. Let go of me, I said.

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,680
Keep doing that.

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,290
Seeing that look of hatred

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,340
turning into a look of fear is the most thrilling.

94
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,230
You piece of trash.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,090
You're going to pass out.

96
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,250
They must've locked it securely inside.

97
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,090
How about Joon and Ji Woo?

98
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,290
You can't reach them yet?

99
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,920
No. We lost them almost at the same time.

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,900
Everything should be fine, right?

101
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,280
I can't hear his reply.

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,390
Hey, Yoon Ga Min. Yoon Ga Min?

103
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,960
He's answering.

104
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,980
Ga Min?

105
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,560
Se Hyeon, what's wrong with this?

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
 Hello? Ga Min. 

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
Huh?

108
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,600
 Hello? 

109
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,480
Ga Min? 
    

110
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,700
- Ms. Lee? 
 - Yes.

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,120
Is the exam preparation going well?

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
 The thing is, 

113
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,140
there's an error in the practice sheet

114
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,960
I gave you earlier today.

115
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,450
 Can you have a look right now? 

116
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,570
Well, right now?

117
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,350
Why? Are you out?

118
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,100
 No. Of course, I'm home. 

119
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,930
Just one second.

120
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,920
   

121
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,530
 Hello? Hello? 

122
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,620
 What's wrong with the phone? 

123
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,980
Where did they go?

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,380
 Huh? What did you say? 

125
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,460
 Ga Min. 

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,860
Ji Woo?

127
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,110
Ji Woo?

128
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,630
What about her?

129
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,420
No, Ms. Lee.

130
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,960
I'll call you back in a bit.

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,100
 Okay. 

132
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,750
Yoon Ga Min, are you there yet?

133
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,520
Geez. Hee Won, go to the rooftop.

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,300
Okay.

135
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,980
What? What?

136
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,450
What? Did it hit something?

137
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,080
What? This isn't right.

138
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,660
"Hee Won's"?

139
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,810
What do we do?

140
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,400
We'll get caught, won't we?

141
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,140
What do we do? What about them?

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,950
We can't even reach them right now.

143
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,030
What do we do?

144
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,280
Hee Won, we should go there.

145
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,610
- Where? 
 - To save them.

146
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,660
Pack your things, Hee Won.

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,140
Hey.

148
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,270
Send the backup fighters back home.

149
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,060
Okay.

150
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,050
Why are you here now?

151
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,450
Tell me. Why did you kill him?

152
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,710
We got into a fight. So, I did it on impulse.

153
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,520
You really killed him, then?

154
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,780
 You don't have to worry. 

155
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,590
 Just say, "I'm the culprit." That's it. 

156
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,340
 The company will get you an attorney. 

157
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,070
 We'll take care of the rest. 

158
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,680
 You serve three years like that and join our family. 

159
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,030
 Everyone would be happy, right? 

160
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,860
 Put this away... 
     

161
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,420
 and take out what's in there. 

162
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,820
 In your inner pocket. 

163
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,250
 We're not forcing you at all. 

164
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,390
 The decision is up to you. 

165
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,530
Yes, I killed him.

166
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,920
On impulse during a fight?

167
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,540
Yes.

168
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,000
You stabbed him three times on impulse, correct?

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,650
Yes.

170
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,530
You've got to be kidding me.

171
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,770
Where's the knife, then?

172
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,870
I threw it away.

173
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,580
Where?

174
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,140
My attorney will talk to you.

175
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,590
So, you're saying you got into a fight

176
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,040
and you stabbed him three times to kill him on impulse

177
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,310
and your attorney will tell me about the knife?

178
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,720
Yes. I'm sorry.

179
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,740
No need to apologize to me.

180
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,470
By the way, can it be this easy?

181
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,390
- Pardon? 
 - Can you give up on your life this easily?

182
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,580
I'm sorry, but there was only one stab wound.

183
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,440
H-Hold on.

184
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,010
I think I was mistaken.

185
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,200
- At that moment— 
 - Okay. I hear you.

186
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,860
I'll ask you one last time.

187
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,830
You'll make the decision.

188
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,500
Think carefully and answer.

189
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,320
Did you really kill someone?

190
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,220
 I'll die in peace if I saw my grandson 

191
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,680
 become a great man. 

192
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,990
 Won't you study? 

193
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,770
Hey.

194
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,650
You can't be here right now, can you?

195
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,310
Let the girl go.

196
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,890
Was that an order?

197
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,860
For me?

198
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,830
If you decided to act up,

199
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,390
you should've at least brought your underlings.

200
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,740
You thought you could fight me one on one?

201
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,430
His underlings are here, you son of a bitch!

202
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,770
Don't laugh, you bastard.

203
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,560
You're dead after this, too.

204
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,390
The knife.

205
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,040
The knife!

206
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,520
Stupid bastards.

207
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,920
They don't know what matters.

208
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,010
You're totally f***ed now.

209
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,790
 It would've been nice if you went to jail 

210
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,980
 as you were told to. 

211
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,290
Hey, why did you try to be clever...

212
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,970
and give up on an easy fortune?

213
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,080
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

214
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,400
Why is everyone from the Yeonbaek Gang the same?

215
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,880
I didn't want to lose my cool over some kids.

216
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,450
You f***ing bitch and bastards.

217
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,480
Why don't you do as you're told?

218
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,330
Why won't you? Huh?

219
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,270
That crazy bastard.

220
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,100
Who are you?

221
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,600
You're that four-eyed loser.

222
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,580
Four-eyed Psycho!

223
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,650
He's holding the evidence.

224
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,510
Give me a break. What are you, Bruce Lee?

225
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,010
What age do you live in?

226
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,580
Don't insult Bruce Lee in front of me.

227
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,150
Four-eyed Psycho, look at you go.

228
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,580
Yoon Ga Min!

229
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,670
You don't use a nunchaku in an actual fight.

230
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,830
And it's so heavy too.

231
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,110
What's this?

232
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,500
That?

233
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,880
It's an aluminum nunchaku that costs 5,000 won.

234
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,510
It wasn't a lie that you destroyed the scouter.

235
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,250
Brace yourself.

236
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,940
You're next.

237
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,650
Okay.

238
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,990
Let's go.

239
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,760
Shit. Four-eyed Psycho.

240
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,590
Hey! Bruce Lee, are you shocked?

241
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,980
You wanted to show up like a savior

242
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,380
and destroy everyone.

243
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,690
But it didn't go as planned, right?

244
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,900
Soon Cheol.

245
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,240
So...

246
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,570
did you think you just needed the evidence?

247
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,100
You should've turned yourself in

248
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,780
and gratefully taken the reduced sentence.

249
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,800
No way.

250
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,340
I even brought my nunchaku

251
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,360
because I heard you were very strong.

252
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,490
But you're too weak.

253
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,070
What?

254
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,100
You tried to ruin someone's life with that strength?

255
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,820
You asshole.

256
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,770
 Fist stabbing methods 

257
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,170
 comes in three kinds. 

258
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,590
 One is Cheokgyeok, 

259
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,440
 where you attack from a 10-inch distance. 

260
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
 And there's Chonggyeon, 

261
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,350
 which is often called a "1-inch punch." 

262
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,090
 And... 

263
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,680
 a punch within a less than 1-inch distance. 

264
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,660
   

265
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,270
 The ultimate punch. 

266
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,860
   

267
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,340
   

268
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,390
Hyung.

269
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,380
Are you okay?

270
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,330
Hyung, let's go back to school and study together.

271
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,570
- Study? 
 - I know you want to study, too.

272
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,280
Can I do that?

273
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,160
Can I pretend... to be an ordinary student now?

274
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,100
That bastard.

275
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,980
I knew it, you son of a bitch!

276
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,630
I wish I could kill him, but I can't.

277
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,640
Live a long, painful life, idiot.

278
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,690
Hey, ear piercing.

279
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,370
It's just studying. Why make such a big deal about it?

280
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,090
No one's that interested in you, okay?

281
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,570
Hesitating is for when you're doing something bad.

282
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,370
Got it?

283
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,360
Right.

284
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,800
Who the hell is the crazy bastard?

285
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,850
Look who's here.

286
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,920
Mr. Na Tae Man?

287
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,210
You f***er.

288
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,590
It's not Mr. Na Tae Man. Detective Na to you.

289
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,440
I got scared by a cop for no reason.

290
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,290
Are you alone?

291
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,730
- What is it? 
 - Your confession. What else?

292
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,240
Mr. Choo Seong Woong, the culprit of the Ancheon Port murder.

293
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,870
What the hell are you saying?

294
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,370
Kim Soon Cheol is the killer of the Ancheon Port murder.

295
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,610
Didn't he turn himself in yet?

296
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,550
Don't blame the wrong person and—

297
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,930
You won't let me speak nicely to you.

298
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,430
Fess up while I'm being nasty to you.

299
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,560
Shit. You son of a bitch.

300
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,300
I came to get my notebook back, but I detected a chance.

301
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,600

I chose No. 5.

333
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,330
- No. 5 for Question 9— 
 - No. 3.

334
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,590
 I chose No. 3. 

335
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,340
 I chose No. 3. 

336
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,750
- No. 3. 
 - I told you, you crazy bastard!

337
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,700
No, it's No. 1.

338
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,130
Is it? Is it No. 3?

339
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,850
No. 3 for Question 9.

340
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,290
- Whoa. 
 - Geez. 
    

341
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,250
- Give me that. 
 - Why No. 1?

342
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,680
Not all of my answers are right—

343
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,520
I got one, at least.

345
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,890
We got the same thing! 
    

346
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,740
We can all check later.

347
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,610
 - But why? 
 - I chose No. 3. 

348
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,610
"Here we go"?

349
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,230
Was it, "Come on now"?

350
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,810
It's "Go, go."

351
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,770
"Go, go! New Person!"

352
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,600
Stop the young bloods from joining Yeonbaek Gang.

353
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,660
A rehabilitation project for the youth.

354
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,400
Give me a break.

355
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,570
Were you influenced by Na Tae Man?

356
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,910
Gwang Hyeon, get your act together.

357
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,570
You know what I mean, right?

358
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,540
- Pardon? 
 - Has anyone volunteered to join?

359
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,250
It's still at an early stage.

360
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,810
See?

361
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,570
I'm telling you.

362
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,860
I guarantee no one will participate.

363
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,960
 Hello. 

364
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,290
I'm here to change.

365
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,530
 Senior. 

366
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,380
Ms. Jeon, I heard you were discharged today.

367
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,070
 How are you feeling? 

368
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,980
I feel even better because I finally got to rest.

369
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,230
You must be tired from caring for the kids, too.

370
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,920
It's very difficult, but it's fun.

371
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,930
By the way, don't the exams end today?

372
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,340
Yes, they ended today.

373
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,870
Is everything okay?

374
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,910
 By chance, has Ga Min... 

375
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,500
told you that he was going somewhere?

376
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,710
He's not home and he won't pick up.

377
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,110
He was going out with his friends because the exams had ended.

378
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,050
He's going out?

379
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,120
It'd be better if he didn't go anywhere today.

380
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,180
 Right now! Right now! 

381
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,460
I'm bored. Should we play a round, too?

382
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,870
The lowest scorer buys ice cream.

383
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,030
The three of us?

384
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,990
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hurry.

385
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,540
 Whoa. Not bad at all. 

386
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,780
 He's pretty good. 

387
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,960
 He's good. 

388
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,370
 Is it my turn, then? 

389
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,180
Here comes Lee Joon!

390
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,440
 - What the heck? 
 - I did... 

391
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,400
 100 pushups daily for a year. 

392
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,750
 We can't just let him do this... 

393
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,700
 No! That's our study group's money! 

394
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,820
Pardon?

395
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,600
It'd be better if he doesn't go anywhere today?

396
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,350
Why?

397
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,650
Every year,

398
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,460
there are four days I don't bother Ga Min.

399
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,200
It's when the midterms and finals end in each semester.

400
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,900
He acts strangely after checking the scores.

401
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,860
He can't focus on anything and he's a bit...

402
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,530
Yoon Ga Min, score lower than 300 and pretend the machine is broken.

403
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,470
So, he'd believe it. Okay?

404
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,610
Let go!

405
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,610
My hard work won't betray me!

406
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,270
I guess he can't control his strength.

407
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,230
We'd be having endless meat at a buffet if we went with the plan.

408
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,990
- Sorry. 
 - It's okay. It's okay.

409
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,980
The owner said he planned to get a new machine.

410
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,060
Gochujang, you're actually the one to blame.

411
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Why did you have to be so stubborn?

412
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,400
I'll open this for you. Don't be angry, okay?

413
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,900
Eat, eat. It's my treat.

414
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,610
We already paid. What do you mean?

415
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,860
Are you worried it'd be lower than you thought?

416
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,860
- Huh? 
 - Aren't you worried about the exam results?

417
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:52,570
Yes, I thought it'd be different this time.

418
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,800
By the way, I don't understand it.

419
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
You get at least 20 points from guessing the multiple choices.

420
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,840
How's your average score 10 points?

421
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,540
He doesn't guess when he doesn't know the answer.

422
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,550
- Are you joking? 
 - Why not?

423
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,170
He doesn't think he deserves the score by guessing.

424
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,390
Ga Min is the best.

425
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,960
Guys, I have a quiz for you.

426
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,490
Okay.

427
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,180
What happens when you boil water?

428
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,500
Yes, Yoon Ga Min. You answer.

429
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,080
Me?

430
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,000
You can eat ramen.

431
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,560
- Wrong. 
 - Really?

432
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,710
The answer is, "Nothing happens."

433
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,430
Huh?

434
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,520
Water starts bubbling and creates opportunities

435
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,300
when it reaches the boiling point.

436
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,200
But nothing appears to be happening until then.

437
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,960
So what?

438
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,180
- Huh? 
 - What?

439
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,420
So, what I'm saying is...

440
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,610
Until you reach the boiling point,

441
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,250
you might think nothing is changing at all.

442
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,360
But...

443
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,280
if you put energy into something steadily,

444
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,610
a big change has to happen eventually.

445
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,350
Whether that's water or studying.

446
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,200
It's from a text I read yesterday.

447
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,970
   

448
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,670
Is it tasty?

449
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,700
Hello?

450
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,990
Dae Cheol?

451
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,990
Soon Cheol isn't with me right now.

452
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,500
 Why don't you answer, you bastard? 

453
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,490
 Hurry up. Grandpa is in a critical condition. 

454
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,590
I need to take the exam!

455
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,630
It's about to start soon.

456
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,490
Please wait a moment, sir.

457
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,850
We'll take you there once Soon Cheol comes.

458
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,990
 Grandpa. 

459
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,630
I said I can go on my own.

460
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,740
Kim Soon Cheol, you f***er.

461
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,860
Where are you going after taking our jobs away?

462
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,900
You agreed to cover for Choo Seong Woong.

463
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,800
You should've said you killed them, no matter what.

464
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,400
I was about to join the family. What will you do?

465
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,000
I have no time.

466
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Shut up and come at me.

467
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,370
Grandpa!

468
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,760
Grandpa, you're ready. Right?

469
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,510
You...

470
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,180
Hurry up and get up. It's time.

471
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,540
Kim Soon Cheol, that bastard.

472
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,300
Hey, what took you so long?

473
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,500
Don't open the door.

474
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,550
Move.

475
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,550
Grandpa... is taking an exam right now.

476
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,910
Ms. Lee got him

477
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,190
the TOEIC exam sheet from last month.

478
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,550
  It's always very choppy, it sprays into the boat.  

479
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,070
  Number 53: Who is the woman... 

480
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:31,360
  Number 54: Why is the man's team waiting until August to visit the island? 

481
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,750
 Number 55. 

482
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,980
Thank you.

483
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,000
 That's how our first exams in high school ended. 

484
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,140
 And... 

485
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,340
♫  On these narrow streets,  ♫

486
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,060
 Grandpa's last exam ended, too. 

487
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,600
♫  Filled with my dried-up dreams  ♫

488
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,340
♫  If I look at you silently  ♫

489
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,140
 Hey. 

490
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,620
 If you meet Soon Cheol, 

491
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,600
 teach him how fun it is to study. 

492
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,570
 I think you could do it. 

493
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,600
♫  Some days pass by as if they're mocking me  ♫

494
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,210
♫  I sit blanking out and shed tears  ♫

495
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
♫  Painful memories  ♫

496
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,480
 Grandpa, Soon Cheol already knows... 

497
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,900
 that studying is fun. 

498
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,300
♫  After walking around for a while, I fall asleep  ♫

499
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,560
♫  All by myself  ♫

500
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,550
♫  As long as someone could hear it  ♫

501
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,920
♫  All by myself  ♫

502
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:27,660
♫  Is there anyone by my side?  ♫

503
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,680
♫  Maybe I already knew  ♫

504
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,410
 The moment a person stops learning, 

505
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,980
 their life stops, too. 

506
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,010
♫  Even the warmth is gone  ♫

507
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,920
♫  I stayed up alone that night  ♫

508
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,100
♫  Some days pass by  ♫

509
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,240
♫  As if they're mocking me  ♫

510
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,560
Thank you,

511
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Ga Min.

512
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,470
♫  I close my eyes while standing  ♫

513
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,890
♫  In a painful memory  ♫

514
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,580
♫  I fall asleep after wandering a while  ♫

515
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,600
♫  All by myself  ♫

516
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,590
♫  As long as someone could hear it  ♫

517
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,990
♫  All by myself  ♫

518
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:55,000
♫  Is there anyone by my side?  ♫

519
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,120
 One, two... 

520
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,410
three!

521
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,250
Gosh, this is amazing!

522
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,380
Mine is too!

523
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,770
Gochujang Head, why are you better than me?

524
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,630
I'm smarter than you.

525
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,110
Wow.

526
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,530
That's what a top scorer's report card looks like.

527
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm a joint No. 1 with Ho Min.

528
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,010
 Wow. 

529
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,290
Stop acting modest.

530
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,750
You're so annoying.

531
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,610
Amazing! Yoon Ga Min is No. 209 out of 220.

532
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,210
His ranking went up by 10!

533
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,830
- Wow, really? 
 - Wow!

534
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,550
Ga Min!

535
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,550
Congrats!

536
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,430
Wow, he did it!

537
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,500
Good job!

538
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,470
   

539
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,290
 If I improved all of their rankings by 10, 

540
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,000
you promised to help me to hold

541
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,100
a disciplinary committee for Pi Han Wool. Right?

542
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,910
   

543
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,100
   

544
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,660
 What's this? 
   

545
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,050
 - Pi Han Wool? 
 - What's this? 

546
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,540
 Pi Han Wool? 

547
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,170
 Who is it? 

548
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,150
Look. Whoa...

549
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,540
Students' vehicles stop at the gate.

550
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,610
Get off and walk.

551
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,370
I'll study the whole time.

552
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,010
- What? 
 - What's this?

553
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,670
- What? 
 - It's Pi Han Wool. Pi Han Wool.

554
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,700
He's walking?

555
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,000
Is he crazy?

556
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,410
Hey, Pi Han Wool!

557
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,990
What will you do now?

558
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,780
They're going to hold a disciplinary hearing for you.

559
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,170
Keep your neck clean until then.

560
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,960


561
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,650
   

562
