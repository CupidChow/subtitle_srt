1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,970


2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,180
I'll do it.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,850
- What? 
 - I said I'll do it.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,100
I said I'll join your study group.

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,000
Really?

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,820
What are you guys doing?

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,180
Wait, Inspector...

8
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,180
Assault and arson.

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,580
What's your name?

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,460
Pardon? Me?

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
Why are you here?

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,200
What if you get blamed for being with me?

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Well...

14
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,800
The team leader of the study group was captured, so—

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,100
What?

16
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,970
What leader?

17
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,650
You're so easy.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, here. I found them while cleaning the classroom.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,050
Thank you.

20
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,730
Okay.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,300
Well, then.

22
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,330
Well, I...

23
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,760
- What? 
 - What you did in the training room yesterday...

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,020
and in the classroom just now...

25
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,970
I want to thank you for it.

26
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,400
No need to thank me. We're friends.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,550
I gave you jellies and vitamins and...

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,430
when you fell asleep in the library, I waited for you so you wouldn't be late for class.

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,890
But no need to thank me for those.

30
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,010
I didn't thank you for those things.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,800
I told you to think about what you did, and you're laughing?

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,540
Go, go. Go forward. Go.

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,380
Go.

36
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,320
There are problem students like him at every school.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,790
Don't worry so much.

38
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,690
We'll hold a campus violence committee quickly and get him expelled.

39
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,740
- Expelled? 
 - Vice Principal.

40
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,100
A wrongdoing should be followed by a punishment.

41
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,590
But getting him expelled is a bit—

42
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,280
Be quiet.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,510
Summon his parents and prepare for the campus violence committee.

44
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,500
Do you understand?

45
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,200
Let's check out the Training Building since we didn't go there earlier.

46
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,670
Isn't it the school that's actually at fault?

47
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,050
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong.

48
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,800
Did I hear you wrong just now?

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,300
This school cares more about one inspector than its 600 students.

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,970
Seriously. I can't believe this...

51
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,800
You're making me look like a terrible person.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
He's the one who's bad. Him.

53
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,620
He's like a thug who's violent in school.

54
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,950
He had no choice because he was bullied and assaulted first.

55
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,720
He used violence to stop the violence? Violence can't—

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,550
Violence can't be justified. I agree with you.

57
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,900
But as for what I have seen here for the last couple of days,

58
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm not so sure.

59
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,600
Can students...

60
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,470
even defend themselves without violence?

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,240
You haven't changed, Ms. Lee Han Kyeong.

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,180
You weren't the top scorer on the Teacher Certification Exam out of luck.

63
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,690
Top scorer?

64
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,970
Yes. I remember now.

65
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,390
The top scorer on the Teacher Certification Exam last year, Lee Han Kyeong.

66
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,900
But she didn't register for some reason, and the certification was canceled.

67
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,500
That's you, Ms. Lee, right?

68
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,780
 I'll become a school teacher. 

69
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,970
 Someone who has a good influence on students. 

70
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,570
 That kind of a teacher. 

71
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,650
So, how are you planning to fix this school's problem?

72
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,810
Even though she was the top scorer,

73
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,050
what could a rookie substitute teacher do—

74
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,680
A study group.

75
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,030
A study group?

76
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,770
Yes, a study group.

77
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,000
Forming a study group was his idea.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,700
I'll work hard on creating it with him.

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Inspector, let's stop this meaningless conversation and—

80
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,340
It's a good idea. A study group.

81
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,300
Inspector.

82
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,400
Vice Principal,

83
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,140
the student wants to study. Is that a problem?

84
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,370
I just noticed faulty fire alarms and cigarette butts on the floor...

85
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,190
♫  Yeah we the backpacker, inside my backpack is firm determination  ♫

Ga Min,

102
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,500
it's 6:34.

103
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,600
Thank you.

104
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,100
 Ga Min, 

105
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,200
 wake up. Time to get ready for school. 

106
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,970
Today's another day to study hard.

107
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,240
Se Hyeon.

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,470
What?

109
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,290
It's our first time running into each other here, right?

110
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,130
I suppose.

111
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,320
You look a mess.

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Did you see a doctor?

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,880
Don't overreact.

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Why not? We're in a study group together.

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,930
Come on.

116
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,190
Be quiet.

117
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,900
By the way, did the inspector really approve it?

118
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,600
Yes.

119
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,440
It's a study group acknowledged by the Education Department.

120
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,790
That's not hard for you, right?

121
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,100
That's why you were so confident, right?

122
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,450
Yes, I can do it.

123
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,820
I wish you good luck, then.

124
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,760
The moment the study group gets canceled,

125
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,300
your contract will be terminated, too.

126
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Thank you, Vice Principal.

127
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,220
I'm curious.

128
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,240
Would you be able to say naive things like a study group

129
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,790
even after experiencing this school more?

130
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,470
Five students in two weeks?

131
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,620
Yes. Only then will he acknowledge it as an official club.

132
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,250
We're screwed.

133
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,400
Why? You don't think we could?

134
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,370
Well, you want us to find three more students who want to study, not just one.

135
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,860
Guys, there's a saying that goes...

136
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,250
What was it? The quote by Napoleon.

137
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,490
"My unhappiness today is the revenge of time once..."

138
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,450
No, not that one. The other one.

139
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,790
"The best way to keep a promise

140
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,300
- is to promise nothing." 
 - No, no.

141
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,200
- "My height is the shortest on the ground, but—" 
 - Yes.

142
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,310
"The word 'impossible' is not in my dictionary."

143
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,530
I was expecting something special.

144
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,310
Yoon Ga Min. Kim Se Hyeon.

145
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,160
Don't you want to prove the Vice Principal wrong for not believing in us?

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,180
Yes, I do, but is it realistically—

147
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,730
We can do it.

148
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,440
We can find the study group members.

149
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,600
    
 - Study? 
 - Study?

150
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,130
Who's this crazy person?

151
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,300
F***. I want to crack my head and skip a class. Agree?

152
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,550
- Agree. 
 - Agree.

153
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,950
♫  Guess who's back? Tell him I'm back. Bring a lot  ♫

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,260
What if more than 10 students apply?

161
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,720
Should it be first come, first served?

162
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,810
Or the ones with higher grades?

163
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,880
Shouldn't you get removed first by that rule?

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,200
Hello? This is Yoon Ga Min, the leader of Yuseong Technical High's study group.

167
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
You want to join the study group?

168
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,870
What grade and what class are you in?

169
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,550
 This is Chu Ho Jin, Class 7, 12th Grade. 

170
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,800
Class 7, 12th Grade. Chu...

171
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
 I want to confess my love to a girl from a school nearby. 

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,600
 I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone. 

173
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,990
 Would you be able to give me advice? 

174
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,500
It's been less than three hours since we put up the poster.

175
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,940
Are you Yoon Ga Min?

176
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,520
I heard the rumor.

177
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,230
   

178
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,220
It's dangerous.

179
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,590
Cut the bullshit. Did he eat the devil's fruit?

180
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,060
Why would flame come out of his foot?

181
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,150
I saw it myself. He's f***ing strong.

182
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,750
 Lee Hyeon Woo was swinging a piece of metal. 

183
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,070
 But Yoon Ga Min or whatever was shooting flame out of his foot. 

184
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,010
 Anyway, it was f***ing crazy. 

185
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,390
You'll get f***ed at this rate.

186
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,100
Cut the bullshit. I can smell that loser from here.

187
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,420
Move. Whatever.

188
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,100
Are you Yoon Ga Min?

189
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
I heard the rumor.

190
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,290
Someone finally heard the rumor.

191
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,380
Nice to meet you.

192
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,270
Hold on.

193
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,520
The application forms were...

194
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,670
They were here.

195
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,510
It was here...

196
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,560
Just one moment.

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,650
Wow, he won't even get up.

198
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,210
Huh?

199
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,260
   

200
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,940
He's getting up now.

201
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll get you a new one from the locker.

202
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,100
 Did he pass out? 

203
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,790
Did you see him hitting his head with the door?

204
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,930
 Wow, what a crazy bastard. 

205
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,160
Huh?

206
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,130
Why...

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,580
His nose is bleeding.

208
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,750
Are you okay? Wake up.

209
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,140
Wow, he's slapping someone who passed out.

210
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,200
Isn't that too much?

211
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,530
The guy who beat up Lee Hyeon Woo. That bastard is f***ing evil.

212
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,970
Why? Did something happen again?

213
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,070
Hey.

214
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,760
 No. 3 was dragged into the library like a dog 

215
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,940
 and got beat up with "The Rules of Mathematics." 

216
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,100
 And he hit his head with a plant pot. 

217
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,410
 And with a second plant pot, too. 

218
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,920
- He was hospitalized. 
 - Hospitalized?

219
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,530
He was hospitalized.

220
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,160
By the way, did our school have a library?

221
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,910
That kid from yesterday didn't contact you, either. Right?

222
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,620
I don't think he came to school today.

223
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,500
The first applicant is suddenly sick? How sad.

224
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,000
I said he wasn't an applicant.

225
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,390
- What? 
 - I need to do things differently.

226
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,620
- How? 
 - If waiting doesn't get us anyone,

227
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,460
we should look ourselves.

228
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,060
Look for what?

229
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,150
The eyes that yearn to study.

230
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,530
My question is,

231
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,410
why does he beat someone up in the library, not the rooftop?

232
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,700
The rooftop is classic.

233
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
The library is huge and the sound echos.

234
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,690
Right.

235
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,520
So what, you idiot?

236
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,800
Gosh, you dumbass.

237
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,870
I can't stand you.

238
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,240
He wants to hear the opponent's moaning with a surround system.

239
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,590
Wow, what a f***ing monster.

240
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,160
 He really is a psycho. 

241
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,880
 He's out of his mind. 

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,830
Hey, hey, hey.

243
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,810
The ramen is...

244
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,370
 The clear-eyed ones are always the craziest ones. 

245
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,510
 Who does he want for his study group or whatever? 

246
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,880
 Someone who wants to study, I'm sure. It's a study group. 

247
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,760
 No one wants to study at this school. 

248
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,730
- I know, you f***er. 
 - You son of a bitch.

249
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,040
He wants bastards who refuse to study

250
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,250
so he could torture them by making them study.

251
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,310
- People who refuse to study? 
 - That makes sense.

252
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,370
- You get it, right? 
 - I'm screwed. I should pat my hair down.

253
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,320
Take your stupid clothes off first.

254
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Let's go. There's no one here.

255
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,130
F***.

256
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,860
That f***er.

257
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,030
- You almost got screwed. 
 - Are you okay?

258
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,950
He's asking for help, isn't he?

259
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,540
Doesn't he look f***ing tortured?

260
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,330
- I know. 
 - F***.

261
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,660
I almost was forced to join his study group.

262
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,770
- Hey. 
 - What? What? What?

263
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,650
How strange.

264
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,210
It's obvious.

265
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,170
You can't find anyone who wants to study at this school.

266
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
It's not that.

267
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,900
I don't see anyone at all.

268
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,770
Huh? Park Geon Yeop?

269
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,160
Do you know him?

270
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,040
Yes, we're middle school classmates.

271
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,400
He left for the US to study in 7th grade. When did he come back?

272
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
He studied in the US?

273
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,760
Hey, hey, hey! Don't mess with him!

274
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,370
I heard you came from the US.

275
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,500
You must speak English well.

276
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,400
Do you want to join our study group?

277
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
Study group?

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,580
Yes.

279
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,700
You look confident.

280
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,130
Or do you not care about people around you getting hurt?

281
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,700
Good job.

282
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,650
See you tomorrow.

283
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,150
 The call is not going through. 

284
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,460
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

285
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,520
   

286
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,810
   

287
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,260
   

288
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,860
Must we form a study group?

289
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,900
Why don't you just go to academies?

290
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,700
Daechi-dong, Mok-dong, and Noryangjin. I've been everywhere.

291
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,060
There are online lectures, too.

292
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
Jeon Seung Jae, Choi Chi Yeol, Jeon Jong Ryeol...

293
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,430
Okay.

294
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,350
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,240
By the way, shouldn't you play sports instead of studying with your physique?

296
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,370
Sports?

297
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,120
I only workout to build stamina for studying.

298
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,070
I know. That's why you started,

299
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,300
but you could do that instead if you're gifted.

300
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,240
But I prefer studying.

301
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,900
What? Aren't you too obviously disappointed?

302
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,570
We don't have a single applicant.

303
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's go out.

304
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,700
- Pardon? 
 - You need to switch things up sometimes.

305
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,500
Let's go.

306
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,960
 Ga Min. 

307
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
How about this one?

308
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,750
I have this book at home.

309
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,580
- Really? 
 - Yes.

310
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,160
- How about this one? 
- That, too.

311
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,260
Ga Min, how about this?

312
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,300
♫  Bad girls make 'em say wow  ♫

313
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,720
♫  Bad girls make 'em say wow  ♫

314
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,770
Se Hyeon, how about this one?

315
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,380
I like all of them.

316
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,870
Wow.

317
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,110
What are you doing there?

318
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,000
♫  Bad girls make 'em say wow  ♫

319
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,810
No, it's nothing.

320
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,190
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

321
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,960
Thank you for this food.

322
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,100
- Let's eat. 
 - Bon appetit.

323
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,780
♫  Feel it, how you feeling now?  ♫

324
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,330
It's so tasty.

325
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,000
It's good.

326
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,470
Can I pick three?

327
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,500
Yes. They look tasty. Pick some.

328
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Are there usually this many types?

329
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,410
I'll have the rice and chocolate...

330
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,430
By the way, Ga Min, I have a question.

331
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,580
Why do you buy so many pens?

332
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,160
This pen has nice cornering. It's for math since it's good for numbers.

333
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,580
This is for dictating teachers since it doesn't bleed.

334
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,790
This blue one is good for your memories because it boosts serotonin.

335
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,810
And this is a new one.

336
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,380
It has a nice balance. I want to try it.

337
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,220
What are you, a pen expert?

338
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,680
What kind of pen do you use?

339
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,410
Me?

340
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
I use the Monami pen that cost 300 won.

341
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,340
 Monami pen that costs 300 won. 

342
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,200
That was the secret.

343
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,190
It feels sincere and grounded somehow.

344
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,300
It's like the Gungseo font.

345
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,600
I should've gotten that, too.

346
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,660
What a shame.

347
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,850
By the way, why did you come to Yuseong when you were the top scorer?

348
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,880
I know. You could've gone to a better school.

349
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,840
The thing is...

350
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,850
A lot of crazy things happened to me, then.

351
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,980
So, I forgot to register.

352
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,140
How cool.

353
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,270
Yes, totally.

354
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,410
Anyway, since we switched things up today,

355
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,130
let's not give up on the study group and work harder.

356
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,150
Okay.

357
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,090
Fighting.

358
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,160
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

359
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,730
What's this doing here?

360
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
What?

361
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,170
It's gone.

362
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,660
What? What is?

363
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,100
My book must've gotten into Ms. Lee's bag.

364
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,700
You can get it back tomorrow.

365
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,600
What? What book was it?

366
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,640
I heard you have a curfew.

367
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,610
Right.

368
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,050
Here it is.

369
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,790
   

370
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,960
You came, Ms. Lee.

371
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,710
Hyeon Woo.

372
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,270
   

373
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,300
Hyeon Woo, what are you doing right now?

374
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,100
We want to join the study group, too.

375
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,600
You told me to visit anytime.

376
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
This isn't what I meant.

377
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,700
Maybe not?

378
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,350
I don't...

379
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,580
want to report you to the police. Leave.

380
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,180
Let's talk at school tomorrow.

381
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,410
By the way, Ms. Lee,

382
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,620
I'll die if I just leave like this.

383
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,900
Hyeon Woo,

384
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,850
I'm starting to get angry right now.

385
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,230
- So— 
 - Ms. Lee,

386
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,560
you came to our school a few days ago.

387
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,670
What did you do that you already got a target on your back?

388
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,240
I got a target on my back?

389
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,550
Who else?

390
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,630
No way. You really don't know.

391
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,230
What do I not know?

392
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,140
- I'm talking about Brother Han Wool. 
 - Han Wool?

393
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,250
Brother Han Wool told me to stop you from teaching.

394
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,270
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

395
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,580
Could you tell me?

396
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,600
   

397
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,340
 The call is not going through. 

398
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,070
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

399
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,810
 Once you're connected, there will be... 

400
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,500
Ms. Lee,

401
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,500
do you know why people are scared even though the police are around?

402
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,300
Because the police come when everything is over.

403
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,000
What? Who

404
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,480
What the hell!

405
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,890
Hey, you bastard!

406
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,590
Son of a bitch!

407
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,200
You're the one by the drum, right?

408
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,100
Geon Yeop.

409
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,670
How did you know to come here?

410
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
There he is.

411
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,280
Hey.

412
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,340
Give me your phone.

413
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,280
Hey, I found them!

414
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,530
Hey, guys!

415
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,010
Let's calm down and—

416
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,900
 I'm sorry, Ms. Lee. 

417
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,400
 I should've told you sooner. 

418
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,580
He's a ruthless bastard who beats his teachers and women.

419
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,100
Come at me.

420
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,400
Instead, be ready to die.

421
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,260
   

422
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,590
 Hey, they got them! 

423
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,380
Who's this bastard?

424
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,340
I think I've seen him somewhere.

425
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,790
I remember that bastard.

426
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,390
You're Park Geon Yeop from Segyeong Middle School, right?

427
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,180
Do you know him?

428
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,790
You know him, too. He was all over the news.

429
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,400
When he was in middle school?

430
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't you remember the random murder?

431
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,910
Oh my gosh!

432
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,980
I remembered when he squirmed after getting punched in the left abdomen.

433
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,910
He was stabbed there.

434
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,250
 Kick him. 

435
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,660
Stop!

436
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,400
What's this?

437
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,720
Ms. Lee, are you okay?

438
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,490
Let go.

439
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,200
Hey, don't get scared.

440
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
He can't fight all of us—

441
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,710
Where did he go this time?

442
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,930
   

443
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,330
Nunchuck?

444
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,740
♫  We the backpackers  ♫

445
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,240
♫  Strong resolutions packed in our backpacks  ♫

446
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,560
♫  We the backpackers  ♫

447
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,790

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,090
♫  We start out fearlessly  ♫

451
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,700
♫  Start barefeet, everyone's basic in my eyes  ♫

453
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,570

♫  We're the backpackers, yeah  ♫

462
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,300
It's hard to train with them because they're poorly made.

463
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,110
Are you okay, Ms. Lee?

464
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,520
Did you get injured—

465
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,560
I heard you know about that case.

466
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,960
We can't end things this way, then.

467
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,500
What are you saying, you f***er?

468
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,240
Geon Yeop, please. Stop.

469
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,510
Try to remember.

470
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,110
You must've heard something because you're Pi Han Wool's underling.

471
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,220
I don't know! F***.

472
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,350
You opened Ms. Lee's door with this, huh?

473
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,380
I'm thinking of opening your mouth with this.

474
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,730
Hey! Stop him!

475
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,020
Watch your teeth.

476
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,620
- That's enough. 
 - Let go.

477
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,870
I don't know why you're so angry, but you're going too far.

478
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,660
That's enough, you said?

479
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,980
How could I? My mom died.

480
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,170
So, don't interfere and leave.

481
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,750
Don't let go! F***!

482
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,050
- Let go! 
 - Don't!

483
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,360
Ms. Lee,

484
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,300
do whatever you want to do with those guys who ran away.

485
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,000
Fair punishment?

486
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,670
Don't believe in that kind of stuff.

487
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,790
I'm telling you this because you remind me of my mom.

488
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,000
You wanted me in your study group, right?

489
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Huh?

490
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,400
- Yeah. 
 - Wake up.

491
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,660
This is Yuseong Technical High.

492
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,010
Hey, Ga Min.

493
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,960
Here.

494
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,360
Ms. Lee, are you sure you'll be okay?

495
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,200
Yes.

496
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,500
Don't worry about me. Go home and study.

497
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
And...

498
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,810
you know we still have plenty of time. Right?

499
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,780
   

500
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,320
   
 (Number for police in Korea) 

501
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,620
 Ms. Lee, 

502
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,810
 it's Hun Jae. 

503
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,460
 Please open the door. 

504
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,010
 I need to tell you something. 

505
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,930
Ms. Lee, could you forgive me just once?

506
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,170
I'm sorry.

507
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,680
Brother Han Wool made me do it.

508
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,480
He'd kill me if I didn't listen to him.

509
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,620
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me just once.

510
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,420
Please.

511
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,380
I'm sorry.

512
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Fine.

513
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,800
But I want to ask you something.

514
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,560
   

515
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,080
   

516
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,100
There are only a few days left now.

517
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,170
Don't give up. We can do it.

518
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,000
Geez, you scared me.

519
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,550
What do we do?

520
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,970


521
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,040
- This is it, right? 
 - Yes.

522
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,290
You're sure, right?

523
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,090
I'm telling you.

524
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,420
Do you want to do it?

525
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,890
It obviously has to be you.

526
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,310
No, you can go, too.

527
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,100
It's okay. Go before I change my mind.

528
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,300
Right. Before you change your mind.

529
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,250
By the way, what was the name again?

530
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,050
Ji Woo. Lee Ji Woo.

531
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,500
 Oh, didn't I tell you? 

532
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,750
 Yuseong Technical High is... 

533
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,210
 co-ed. 

534
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,680
   

535
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,290
♫  Bring it on, whoever you are, do your best, my name on top  ♫
