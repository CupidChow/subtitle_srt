1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,930
Pi Han Wool needs to be

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,510
sent to the disciplinary committee.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,010
So will we, then.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,290
You might get expelled, too.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm okay.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,760
We're okay, too, then.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,940
Right.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,160
By the way,

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,750
the teacher who tried to

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,890
punish Pi Han Wool a year ago

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,670
was murdered the night before the meeting.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,160
Pardon?

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,540
The police said it was a random killing,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,350
but Yuseong kids secretly believe it was Pi Han Wool.

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,360
What? Just to prevent the meeting?

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,290
That makes no sense.

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,600
Would Pi Han Wool really go that far?

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,870
Because it would've gotten him expelled.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,800
Yuseong isn't just a school to him.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,940
It's a kingdom he created.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,750
But he gets kicked out of it?

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,320
Not only would it hurt his ego,

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,850
the succession plan at Yeonbaek

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,060
would be affected, too.

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,380
No one would fear him anymore, then.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,560
He'd risk his life for it.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,600
Anyway, he'll do anything to cancel the meeting.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,840
What are we considering?

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,700
We just need to attack him first.

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,670
- I agree. 
 - No.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,650
- Why not? 
 - What if we fail?

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,140
Why are you thinking about failing first?

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,460
Ms. Lee's safety is on the line.

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,540
We have to be absolutely careful.

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
No, but—

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,080
Se Hyeon is right.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,020
We can't let her get hurt even a bit.

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:07,140


39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,800
What do we do, then?

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,890
Until the meeting happens,

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,200
we'll have to protect Ms. Lee.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
♫  Yeah, we the backpacker  ♫

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,200
♫  Inside my backpack is firm determination, we are the backpackers  ♫

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,310

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,910
   

49
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,650
   

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,950
   

51

53

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,360
   

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,430
   

56
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,590
   

57
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,120
♫   Yeah we the backpackers  ♫

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,570

00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,430

60
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,770
   

61
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,120
The investigation regarding the children...

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,030
has there been any progress?

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,580
Yeonbaek Gang must've silenced everyone.

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,040
It's not easy to find the witness.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,870
By the way, Ms. Lee,

66
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,320
how about you stay away from the school for a while?

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,470
We don't know what Pi Han Wool will do.

68
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,130
I'll try to protect you as much as possible,

69
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,880
but there's a limit to that, too.

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,260
Are you telling me to run away?

71
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,790
Come back after the meeting.

72
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,440
If a teacher runs away in fear,

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,610
it'd set a bad example for the students.

74
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,720
They even spread fake news.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,140
We don't know what they'd do.

76
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,320
I should protect them with the disciplinary meeting.

77
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,710
   

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,680
   

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,310
 It's me, Ms. Lee. 

80
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,850
What made you call at this hour?

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,390
Are you sure you won't give up on the meeting?

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,600
I'll pretend I didn't hear it and hang up.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,790
 Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. 

84
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,440
 If that's what you really want, 

85
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,430
 I need to tell you something. 

86
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,350
Regarding Yuseong Tech High

87
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,590
and Yeonbaek Foundation's corruption.

88
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,210
Why are you... telling me this tonight?

89
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,620
From the way it's going,

90
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,610
the meeting might actually happen tomorrow.

91
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,800
Ms. Lee, will you really go to school now?

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,860
Will you be okay?

93
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,770
The vice principal wants to make a confession.

94
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,240
I should hear him out.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,910
It's the night before the meeting.

96
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,020
If...

97
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,460
they're up to something...

98
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,420
Even so, this would be a chance.

99
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,380
 As you already know, 

100
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,090
Yuseong isn't normal.

101
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,440
Chairman Pi laundered money using the

102
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,810
Yeonbaek Foundation to fund his political career.

103
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,300
It's a known secret.

104
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,270
His father is the king of Yuseong.

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,310
Of course, no one could touch Pi Han Wool.

106
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,130
In the end,

107
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,630
the school has been raising a monster.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,110
You prepared well for the meeting. Right?

109
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,130
Yes, don't worry.

110
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,240
I have written testimonies from the victims

111
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,370
and testimonies from the teachers, too.

112
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,810
How impressive you are, Ms. Lee.

113
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,570
I'm truly touched.

114
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,050
I appreciate you working up your courage, too.

115
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,100
Vice Principal!

116
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,600
Vice Principal.

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,810
Where did he go?

118
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,600
   

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
   

120
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,710
Surprise.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,390
This is giving me major deja vu.

122
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,120
I think something similar happened before.

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,550
What did I say then?

124
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,180
"To steal someone's time, you don't threaten them.

125
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,810
You ask for understanding."

126
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,450
Wow, seriously.

127
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,890
I was so moved then.

128
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,760
That's why...

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,330
I'll ask you to understand first.

130
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,820
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong,

131
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,940
give it to me while I'm asking nicely.

132
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,480
Ask nicely? F*** it.

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,390
Give it to us, you f***ing bitch.

134
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,100
Geez, this is so much work.

135
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
Please give it to me.

136
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,990
Please give it to me.

137
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,990
Please give it to me.

138
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,930
You were recording?

139
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,270
I'm taking this.

140
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,780
Here.

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,500
Will you really hurt me?

142
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,970
Why?

143
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,450
You thought what happened to the teacher was just a rumor?

144
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,730
Even if I disappear and the meeting gets canceled,

145
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,140
your wrongdoings won't disappear.

146
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,540
So, please stop now, Pi Han Wool.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,770
I'll give you a last chance.

148
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,410
I think you're mistaken about something.

149
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,250
I'm the one who's been...

150
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,050
giving you a chance,

151
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,450
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong.

152
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:20,900
Soon, the police will come.

153
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,740
 It records well. Right? 

154
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,400
 Yes. 

155
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,610
 By the way, do you really have to do this? 

156
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,560
 I want to be the evidence myself. 

157
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,810
 Just 30 minutes. 

158
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,440
 I'll go in if I don't hear from you after that. 

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,750
   

160
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,510
Oh, Detective Na Tae Man?

161
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,050
 Mic check. One, two. 

162
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,450
 Can you hear me, you idiots? 

163
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,250
You're all dead,

164
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,570
you f***ing sons of bitches!

165
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,090
♫  A'right. This is my world  ♫

166
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,410
♫  I have a question. What about this hood?  ♫

167
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,680
♫  Guess who's back? Tell 'em I'm back. Bring a lot  ♫

168
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,230
♫  Bring anyone. Do your best  ♫

169
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,290
♫  My name on top  ♫

170
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,360
♫  Parking lot, backyard, rooftop  ♫

171
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,950
♫  I turn them into my stages by standing there I'm yawning  ♫

172
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,450
♫  I'll let you sleep soundly as if you're on vacation  ♫

173
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,640
♫  I go after my goal with a pure look  ♫

174
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,870
♫  I don't want to see a loser in the mirror  ♫

175
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,300
♫  Make more plans  ♫

176
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,020
♫  I have no doubts  ♫

177
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,190
♫  It's pretty funny...  ♫

178
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,150
 The meeting will happen at 10:00 a.m. in four days. 

179
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,370
 In four days? 

180
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,750
 We need to watch Ms. Lee closely until then. Right? 

181
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,820
 - Yes. 
 - Three days is 72 hours. 

182
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,980
 - 72 hours. 
 - We can totally do it full-time. 

183
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,770
 Guys, 

184
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,870
 you need to be careful. 

185
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,230
 If a teacher runs away in fear, 

186
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,340
 it'd set a bad example to the students. 

187
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,590
 Done, right? 

188
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,660
 Ms. Lee, I don't get this question, either. 

189
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,290
 Oh, that one? 

190
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,250
 I'm confused by this one, too. 

191
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,330
 I think this would take some time. 

192
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,500
 This one, too. 

193
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,730
 Will you really go to school now? 

194
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,050
 It's the night before the meeting. 

195
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,190
 If they're up to something... 

196
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,760
 Even so... 

197
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,050
 this would be a chance. 

198
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,960
Guys.

199
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,970
How did you know I was here?

200
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,530
F***. Damn it.

201
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,580
You're the cheeky 10th graders.

202
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,600
Could you move?

203
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Ms. Lee needs to sleep well tonight.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,120
There's a f***ing important event tomorrow.

205
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,170
- A disciplinary meeting. 
 - Wow.

206
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,020
The babies came to save the teacher?

207
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,250
How scary.

208
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,300
That f***ing...

209
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,370
You chose the wrong side, Soon Cheol.

210
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,030
Give me a f***ing break.

211
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,070
Come at us, assholes—

212
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,930
Joon, leave with Ms. Lee.

213
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,560
What? Why should I leave?

214
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,250
Because I trust you the most.

215
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,150
You mean that, right?

216
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,440
He loves it.

217
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,230
Go, Ms. Lee.

218
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,640
- Hurry up, Ms. Lee. 
 - Guys.

219
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,550
Hurry! Hurry!

220
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,090
You came faster than I thought.

221
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,930
Joon, you go first.

222
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,920
- What? 
 - Se Hyeon.

223
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,630
Hurry, Ms. Lee.

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,760
 Lee Joon! 

225
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,530
Long time no see, Joon.

226
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,370
Anti.

227
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,330
 I'm in the Yeonbaek Family now. 

228
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,020
 So, don't look for me anymore. 

229
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,580
Ms. Lee, leave now.

230
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,490
Joon.

231
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,170
They'll cuss me out if I don't get you out.

232
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,590
Hurry up and leave now.

233
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,600
Hurry.

234
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,160
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong...

235
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,710
I could've followed her and finished her off.

236
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,800
But I've been wanting to fight you.

237
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,160
- What are you doing here? 
 - Well...

238
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,450
Han Wool said the scouter position for

239
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,980
Yuseong was available.

240
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,540
By joining the family, you meant...

241
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,080
becoming Pi Han Wool's underling?

242
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,610
Pi Han Wool?

243
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,220
You used to get beat up and bleed like a loser.

244
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,840
How dare you utter his name?

245
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,640
Thankfully, Han Wool... let me have a revenge match.

246
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,110
 Move, move! 

247
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,730
 What was the motive for murder? 

248
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,970
 Move! 

249
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,200
You screwed my dad.

250
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,630
Should I start by removing an arm?

251
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,840
What happened to your spirit, loser?

252
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,610
This f***er is high maintenance.

253
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,400
♫  Come out, come out  ♫

254
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,620
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

255
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,910
Bingo.

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,360
How fun.

257
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,660
I haven't had such a tight fight before.

258
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,270
Why are you taking things so far?

259
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,690
 They've been tortured, 

260
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,560
 bullied, 

261
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,460
 and forced to take the wrong path. 

262
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,390
 They wanted to, but they couldn't study. 

263
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,140
School shouldn't be a place like that.

264
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,160
Why are you taking it so far?

265
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,600
- What? 
 - If you canceled the meeting quietly,

266
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,270
Lee Han Kyeong or your friends wouldn't get hurt.

267
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,080
Shut up!

268
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,600
Gosh, what do I do?

269
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,780
What's with those eyes?

270
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,120
What's the point of staring like that?

271
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,170
Should I remove them for you?

272
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,360
Anti, why?

273
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,950
 Color it red to look tough, so no one picks on you. 

274
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,100
 Haven't you seen "Slam Dunk"? 

275
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,410
What ruined you like this?

276
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,250
If I became strong,

277
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,940
I thought I could stay with you.

278
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,730
Give me a break.

279
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,080
F***!

280
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,460
Idiot.

281
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,050
It's easier to fight you one on one.

282
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,560
Bang. I'm done here.

283
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,680
Shit.

284
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,190
Who says it's one on one?

285
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,980
You little bitch.

286
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,210
You fight two at a time in 2:2.

287
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,130
The bullies versus the study group.

288
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,710
Let's see which team works better together.

289
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,290
You're out of luck.

290
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,180
You're out of ammunition.

291
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,420
I'll teach you... a real lesson now.

292
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,320
F***. You f***er!

293
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,800
Let go!

294
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,050
- Joon. 
 - Let go!

295
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,810
Wake up, Lee Ji Woo!

296
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,180
Focus on the basics!

297
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,250
 Why try to cover everything? 

298
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,990
 Just focus on the basics. 

299
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,990
 What, you bastard? 

300
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,130
 Look at the ones who get the perfect score. 

301
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,120
 They say they only study the textbook. 

302
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,860
 Stop being greedy and... 

303
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,120
 just focus on the basics. 

304
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,400
 You want to learn martial arts? 

305
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,140
 I want to support Ga Min, too. 

306
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,580
 I'll do anything. 

307
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,860
 Violence isn't allowed. 

308
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,210
 But... 

309
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,990
 to protect what's precious, 

310
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,560
 you sometimes need to fight. 

311
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,780
 So, what did you learn from Ga Min's mother? 

312
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,740
 I've never hit anyone and... 

313
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,610
 I was afraid to get hit, too. 

314
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,530
 She said there are only three things I can do. 

315
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,980
 What's the first one? 

316
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,370
 Endurance. 

317
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,340
 To be exact, 

318
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,410
 the courage to keep my eyes open while being hit. 

319
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,090
Hey. Wow, what a strong punching bag.

320
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,220
You must've trained at Yuseong.

321
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,810
Right?

322
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,490
 What's the second one, then? 

323
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,720
 Memorizing the vital spots. 

324
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,600
   

325
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,560
 The last is the hand skills. 

326
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,820
It's the knuckle punch for a fight.

327
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,600
A loser like him...

328
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,110
Why don't you study, too, then?

329
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,370
This isn't your 100%, right?

330
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,700
By chance,

331
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,220
did you think buying time with me

332
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,680
would get Lee Han Kyeong out of here?

333
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,170
What?

334
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,350
You underestimated me.

335
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm disappointed.

336
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,330
What did you do with Ms. Lee?

337
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,590
So?

338
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,010
You want to use your full power now?

339
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,120
   

340
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,200
   

341
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,060
I'll crush you properly.

342
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,230
So, bastards like you don't get false hopes.

343
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,530
I said working hard doesn't do anything.

344
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,440
You think Yuseong would change if I'm not there?

345
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,220
Even if I disappeared,

346
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,530
Yuseong wouldn't change.

347
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,250
Never.

348
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,150
   

349
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,390
Everything changes.

350
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,750
I'll...

351
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,870
I mean...

352
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,150
we'll show you.

353
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,270
Ms. Lee.

354
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,190
- Come here. 
 - She's alone.

355
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,860
- What will you do? 
 - Come here.

356
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,130
Give me a break.

357
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,010
What will you do?

358
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,720
You want to fight?

359
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,990
What are you doing?

360
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,010
Come here.

361
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,950
 Ms. Lee! 

362
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,300
What?

363
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,010
 What are you? 

364
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,790
 Come here! 

365
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,160
 You should return the favor to Ms. Lee. 

366
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,680
 It's none of your business. 

367
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,220
 Look. Getting pinched hurts. 

368
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,000
 But Ms. Lee... 

369
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,780
 got stabbed for you. 

370
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,920
I can't stand owing someone. F***.

371
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,980
We're doing this because of that psycho?

372
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,660
Why am I on the frontline?

373
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,850
♫  We the backpackers  ♫

374
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,240
♫  Inside my backpack is firm determination  ♫

Grow up, you sons of bitches.

♫  Even if my shoes get stained, backpackers  ♫

379
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,480
♫  I always start barefoot without fear  ♫

380
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,820
♫  You're all basic to me, but I always step high  ♫

381
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,500
♫  My black top got dirty, I loosen my necktie  ♫

382
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,750
♫  You don't get the basics, stupid  ♫

383
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,130
♫  I'm ready to fight right  ♫

384
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,690
Come at us!

385
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:44,230
You F***ERS!

386
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,790
♫  We're the backpackers  ♫

00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,020
   

394
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,690
 Here's the disciplinary committee's verdict. 

395
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,780
More than half of the committee members agreed

396
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,370
to have Pi Han Wool, the 11th grader...

397
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,970
expelled.

398
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,540
If Pi Han Wool doesn't agree with the decision,

399
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,150
he can request the provincial office of education

400
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,760
disciplinary committee to review—

401
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,530
You had good teachers and friends, too.

402
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,370
You weren't grateful for them and

403
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,350
you decided to hit rock bottom like this.

404
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,080
Take responsibility for that and reflect on it.

405
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,780
 Then, you'll get another chance to 

406
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,740
 change your life. 

407
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,170
Pi Han Wool, would you like to come with me?

408
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,340
What's this about?

409
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,970
 Will you really hurt me? 

410
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,400
 Why? 

411
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,050
 You thought what happened to the teacher was a lie? 

412
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,750
It won't be easy for you this time.

413
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,020
 Why are the cops here? 

414

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,420
 Fine! 

420
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,190
 I said I'll go. Hold on, hold on. 

421
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,380
Let me smoke a cigarette first.

422
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,980
Please?

423
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,860
There's no smoking at school.

424
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,540
Ex-Vice Principal.

425
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,910
 - Take care! 
 - Bye-bye. 

426
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,190
   

427
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,860
 People change every day. 

428
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,300
 You little! 

429
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,790
   

430
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,320
 - I caught you! 
 - You didn't! 

431
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,310
 Even so, they say you can't fix a person. 

432
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,710
   

433
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,170
 This is a case that went viral recently. 

434
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,970
 The group fight at a high school in Ancheon 

435
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,080
 turned out to be fabricated. 

436
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,710
 The students who fought the security guards 

437
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,380
 weren't troubled teens who tried to steal. 

438
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,640
 Because rather than change positively, 

439
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,840
 more tend to go the opposite direction. 

440
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,140
Yes.

441
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,960
Attorney Hwang is here regarding Han Wool.

442
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,600
Tell him to just take care of it.

443
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,710
 For that reason, 

444
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,220
 we try even harder. 

445
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,400
   

446
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,790
 To become a better person than yesterday. 

447
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,400
- Come here. 
 - What? What? What?

448
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,910
When did you get out?

449
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,720
What are you doing?

450
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,390
 To create opportunities... 

451
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,910
 even in hellish situations. 

452
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,470
   

453
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,970
   

454
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,930
 Fiery firefighter? 

455
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,160
Isn't that amazing?

456
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,090
Someone who saves people in danger.

457
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,810
Shit, it's so f***ing cool.

458
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,450
- Totally. 
 - You really suck.

459
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,170
What did you say, Hee Won?

460
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,030
Developer.

461
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,540
It suits you.

462
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,980
It sounds perfect.

463
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,820
How about you, Ji Woo?

464
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,860
Ji Woo wants to be a teacher, of course.

465
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,150
Will you beat up your students?

466
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,640
Hey. Why would I beat up students?

467
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,970
How about you?

468
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,760
Me?

469
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,810
I haven't decided yet.

470
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,860
Ga Min, how about you?

471
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,400
- Huh? 
 - What's your dream?

472
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,650
Oh, my dream?

473
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,490
Mine is to go to college.

474
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,430
Why?

475
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,080
Well, because...

476
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,400
becoming a college student isn't anyone's dream.

477
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,590
Is that so?

478
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,170
By the way,

479
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,230
is it always decided?

480
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,440
- Huh? 
 - It might sound difficult now,

481
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,930
but you can achieve it if you try until the end.

482
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,330
Isn't that what dreams are about?

483
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,940
So, studying hard and

484
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,500
going to college is my dream now.

485
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:24,320


486
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,440
Okay, the study group members,

487
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,990
finally,

488
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,230
we have the finals schedule.

489
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,520
Geez...

490
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,350
Seriously...

491
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,620
Gosh.

492
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,100
Until when?

493
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,680
I'll beat Lee Joon this time.

494
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,450
- I don't think so. 
 - I think so.

495
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,790
- I don't think so. 
 - I think so.

496
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,160
- I don't think so. 
 - I'll poke your eyes out.

497
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,350
- I don't think so. 
 - Quiet.

498
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,230
I don't think so.

♫  My name on top  ♫

506
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,560
♫  Like you're on vacation 
 Chasing after my goals with a pure expression  ♫

507
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,070
♫  When I look in the mirror, I don't want to see a failure 
 I make more plans  ♫

♫  Why is such a funny question  ♫

511
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,130
♫  You're throwing an egg at a rock, like you don't understand  ♫

512
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,430
♫  You're throwing an egg at a rock, like you don't understand  ♫

513

♫  Yeah, I'm a rider  ♫

517
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,770
♫  When I go low, drop your eyes  ♫

518
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,840
♫  Or keep quiet  ♫

519
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,330

534
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,130
♫  Just don't take it serious though  ♫

535
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,390
♫  Uh, take a stab, mess with me, it's your losing move  ♫

536
