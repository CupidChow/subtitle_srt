00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,110
Pardon?

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,630
Pi Han Wool?

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,340
Yes.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
You don't seem to know yet.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,850
You should never try to know more about him.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,380
You might die.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,300
- Pardon? 
 - When I say, "die,"

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,820
it's not figurative. It's literal.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,800
Be careful.

10
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,550
Why did you want to see me?

11
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,930

Yes, I'm sure.

No, you can go, too.

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,870
It's okay. Go before I change my mind.

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,880
Right. Before you change your mind.

35
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,990
What did you say their name was?

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,790

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,310
I don't know what Lee Ji Woo looks like.

42
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,360
You can ask.

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,650
- Hurry. Go. 
 - Hold on. Hold on.

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,250
- A little later. 
 - That's enough.

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,140
 Hey, Lee Ji Woo! 

46
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,630
There. Someone called her.

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,540
Hey, let's give up on Lee Ji Woo.

48
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,910
Why?

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,610
She's Lee Hyeon Woo's twin sister.

50
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,280
 F*** you. 

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,880
There's no way she signed up for the study group.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,170
Crazy bitch. You're so brave.

53
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,710
Didn't I tell you to put the lunch menu on my desk?

54
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,190
Why the f*** do you ignore me and ruin my mood?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
What's this?

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,300
You printed the menu and didn't put it on my desk?

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,550
No, that's...

58
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,410
Midterm preparation plan?

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,150
You idiots are trying so f***ing hard.

60
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,320
How dare you f***ing look at me like that?

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,320
I said you can only hit me.

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,100
Let go.

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,560
Let go.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,060
Let go, you f***ing bitch.

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,780
Let go.

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,560
Let go, you bitch!

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,760
F***! You're pissing me off.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,400
Hey.

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,170
I'll kill you if you don't put the lunch menu on my desk by the next period.

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,110
   

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,160
Why would you bitches bother studying?

72
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,260
What the heck?

73
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,490
When did he leave?

74
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,550
- What's with you? 
 - Wow, nicely planned.

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,710
I'm asking you a question.

76
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,860
She highlighted each subject.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,400
- I should try that, too. 
 - What are you, you loser?

78
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,250
Why is it so noisy here?

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,110
Gyu Jin,

80
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,860
the thing is...

81
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,870
You're the prettiest when your mouth is kept shut, Mi Hee.

82
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,090
Aren't you Yoon Ga Min, who knocked down Lee Hyeon Woo?

83
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,720
What are you doing with my girlfriend?

84
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,040
Is she your girlfriend?

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,950
- I wanted to talk to her. 
 - I know.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,050
She's my girlfriend.

87
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,320
- Let's go. 
 - Why?

89
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,770
This is about a study group—

90
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,680
- Let's go right now. 
 - Why?

91
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,120
Did you talk to another man, Ji Woo?

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,710
You should be scolded, then.

93
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,200
- Put your hands out. 
 - Get lost.

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,490
Why?

95
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,910
Are you embarrassed in front of the others?

96
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,930
Crazy bastard.

97
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,670
I told you not to stand out.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,760
Just take three hits, Ji Woo.

99
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,990
Or do you want to do something cute?

100
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,060
I'll forgive you, then.

101
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,650
Just hit me.

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
Gum?

103
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,970
You said she's your girlfriend.

104
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,890
Cocky bastard.

105
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,740
You think you're somebody since you beat Lee Hyeon Woo?

106
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,580
♫    ♫

107
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,650
Your neck will get snapped unless you duck.

108
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,700
Hey, Kim Gyu Jin!

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,990
What are you doing?

110
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,890
Didn't you hear the Disciplinary Committee is assembling?

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,660
Why don't you get your butt over here?

112
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,480
I'll see you again soon, 10th grader.

113
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,590
Do you even want to have a quiet school life?

114
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,670
Of course, I do.

115
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,770
Yet you threw gum at the disciplinary committee member's face?

116
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,180
Are you crazy?

117
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,870
I didn't know he was on the disciplinary committee.

118
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,790
He's in front of the gate every morning.

119
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,570
You didn't know that?

120
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,390
And I couldn't just let a study group member get beaten.

121
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,690
Is she already a member?

122
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,390
I don't know. Anyway, we're in trouble.

123
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,110
Our lives will be difficult since we messed with the disciplinary committee.

124
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,510
The application for the study group...

125
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,020
I submitted it under Ji Woo's name.

126
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,650
- Why? 
 - The thing is...

127
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,900
Ji Woo is being bullied.

128
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,690
 Hey, isn't Gyu Jin so f***ing handsome? 

129
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,970
 F***! He's so my type. 

130
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,360
 Handsome, my foot. 

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,370
 He looks just like the MacArthur statue in the park. 

132
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,230
 That's how I became a target within my first week at this school. 

133
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,090
 I'll pay you back soon. 

134
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,420
 - Hey, what do you want to do? 
 - Karaoke. Let's go to a karaoke. 

135
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,570
 Karaoke? 

136
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,540
 Shit, let go! 

137
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,850
 Geez, it f***ing hurts. Shit. 

138
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,770
 Hey, Lee Ji Woo! 

139
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,940
 Is Ji Woo being bullied because she defended me? 

140
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,570
 Huh? 

141
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,630
I didn't ask that yet.

142
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,880
Could you ask me?

143
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,710
Yes.

144
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,440
Is Ji Woo being bullied because she defended you?

145
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,300
No.

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,430
Isn't that unexpected?

147
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,610
Y-Yes.

148
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,920
No one could challenge Ji Woo.

149
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,830
Thanks to that, I stopped being bullied, too. Yes.

150
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,780
Is that it?

151
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,720
Something happened soon after.

152
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,080
 I don't know the details. 

153
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,990
 Ji Woo's brother, Hyeon Woo, was on the job delivering something important. 

154
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,450
 But I guess there was an accident. 

155
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,570
 You want to borrow money? 

156
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,740
 Yes. 

157
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,590
 Okay. 

158
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,350
 Under one condition. 

159
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,050
 Okay. 

160
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,730
 Kim Gyu Jin started threatening Ji Woo using that video of Hyeon Woo. 

161
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,460
 She normally hates her brother, 

162
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,030
 but he's still the only family member she has left. 

163
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,100
 That's when she started getting bullied, too. 

164
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,460
And I've been receiving help from Ji Woo all this time.

165
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,160
So, I want to be helpful to her this time.

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,890
Before I transfer.

167
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,300
- Transfer? 
 - Yes.

168
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,970
I couldn't tell Ji Woo yet.

169
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm moving because of my dad's job.

170
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,420
Oh, okay.

171
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,810
So, I know I'm shameless, but let me ask you just one favor.

172
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,680
Please delete that video.

173
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,430
And study with Ji Woo instead of me from now on.

174
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,200
Would that be okay?

175
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,070
You said our lives would get difficult.

176
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,320
What? Why are you pushing responsibility to me now?

177
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,370
Excuse me.

178
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,130
I beg you.

179
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,450
I beg you.

180
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,130
Okay. Our lives are already difficult.

181
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,020
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

182
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's help Ji Woo only focus on studying.

183
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,650
- Really? 
 - Yes.

184
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,590
By the way, where's that video?

185
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,620
What video is it that Lee Ji Woo became powerless?

186
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,360
It must be something big since it made Lee Ji Woo submit.

187
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,850
Huh?

188
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,470
- Isn't this it? 
 - Hey, let me see.

189
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,810
Let me see. Let me see.

190
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,340
This is it.

191
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,130
I saw them waving this in front of Lee Ji Woo.

192
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,320
Play it now!

193
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,550
Hurry up and play it.

194
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,040
Hold on. What is it, anyway?

195
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,210
   

196
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,470
Look at you, bastards.

197
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,900
Not the Disciplinary Committee room.

198
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,870
Why not?

199
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,940
Because it's the Disciplinary Committee room.

200
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,660
So, what about it?

201
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,240
Right.

202
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,840
The Disciplinary Committee room is a bit...

203
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,930
Right?

204
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,900
Why?

205
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,200
Because the Disciplinary Committee is a gang approved by the school.

206
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,040
A gang approved by the school?

207
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,770
 They're officially allowed to act like thugs 

208
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,910
 while controlling the bad kids. 

209
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,290
 That's why most kids don't even go near the Disciplinary Committee room. 

210
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,100
Gosh, bastards.

211
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,490
Are you that curious about this?

212
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,570
Do you want to watch it?

213
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,650
The thing is...

214
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,840
I do, but...

215
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,530
- Go ahead. 
 - Really?

216
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,410
Watch it yourselves, you bastards.

217
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,170
I'll upload it on GoTube.

218
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,150
GoTube? I thought you promised not to release it.

219
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,200
Why don't you pay back the money you borrowed from losers?

220
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,550
Why would I pay them back?

221
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,500
Right. Only losers keep promises.

222
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,950
And think about it, you bastard.

223
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,640
If Ji Woo's last family member goes to juvenile hall,

224
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,020
she'd be so sad.

225
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,150
You'll strike her while she's vulnerable?

226
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,080
Her boyfriend would be the only one to rely on.

227
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,590
The money I lent him wasn't even mine.

228
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,880
Whose is it, then?

229
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,900
It's his own.

230
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,400
What do you mean by that?

231
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,570
You don't have to know.

232
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,060
Seriously, Han Wool is a genius.

233
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,660
Why are you asking me where Hyeon Woo is?

234
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,470
I heard you were close to him.

235
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm not.

236
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,230
I'm not close to anyone.

237
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,720
I heard he borrowed money from Kim Gyu Jin and never paid him back.

238
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,710
- Maybe he ran away? 
 - He borrowed that money because of you.

239
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,680
Because of me?

240
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,460
Who says that?

241
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,250
Didn't he end up that way because he got into an accident

242
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,590
while running an errand for you?

243
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,130
What would I get by doing that?

244
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,450
If you tell him to,

245
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,340
he even breaks into his homeroom teacher's house, destroys things, and threatens me.

246
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,500
He became that desperate.

247
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,000
Han Wool, you used him enough.

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,120
Let Hyeon Woo go now.

249
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,470
Is that all?

250
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,820
Is that the only reason you wanted to see me?

251
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,820
I heard you were starting a study group at a school like this.

252
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,660
I thought you'd be a very interesting person.

253
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,290
But you aren't.

254
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,230
Ms. Lee, if Lee Hyeon Woo doesn't come to school,

255
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,370
just ignore it.

256
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,650
It's much easier to give up on low lives.

257
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,610
Han Wool.

258
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,260
It's f***ing stupid that she's doing that for her brother.

259
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,870
She should give up on a piece of trash like him.

260
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,630
Some people might seem hopeless,

261
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,590
but that doesn't mean you can give up on them.

262
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,250
What's that?

263
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,530
What was that noise?

264
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,320
Shit, you scared me. What's this psycho doing?

265
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,530
Wow, were you hiding in there?

266
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,710
Oh, I see.

267
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,220
Lee Ji Woo told you to steal the USB drive, right?

268
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,600
That f***ing cunning thing used a man?

269
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,180
Wait...

270
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,600
By chance, do you have a crush on her?

271
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,360
How dare you ambush like a coward?

272
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,270
Why does this loser keep getting in the way?

273
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,370
You got hit on purpose to get the USB?

274
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,690
You don't know how scary the disciplinary committee is.

275
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,290
How will you deal with the aftermath?

276
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,310
What the f***?

277
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,170
Senior!

278
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,950
Shit, he's in trouble. Three more went in.

279
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,070
My gosh.

280
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,190
This is no good. Let's fight.

281
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,540
- What? 
 - The two of us will fight.

282
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,200
The disciplinary committee comes in whenever there's a commotion.

283
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,680
We'll pretend to be fighting so Yoon Ga Min gets to escape.

284
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,040
Oh, okay.

285
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,890
If I go there,

286
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,140
yell at me, saying, "Hey, you f***er."

287
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,780
What? Me?

288
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,580
Why? What's wrong?

289
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,630
Well, the thing is...

290
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,670
By chance, you've never cursed?

291
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,670
- No. 
 - Well,

292
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,720
but you should do that so it looks like we're fighting.

293
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,600
- Right. 
 - Choi Hee Won?

294
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,720
Okay, done. It's yours, bastard.

295
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,040
I already saved it on the computer. It was ready to be uploaded on GoTube.

296
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,410
Lee Hyeon Woo's life will be over after a click.

297
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,540
Lee Ji Woo will be doomed, too.

298
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,810
Don't!

299
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,430
   

300
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,050
You f***ers went too far.

301
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,470
How embarrassing.

302
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,650
Well, the thing is—

303
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,390
I'm sorry, Ji Woo.

304
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,210
I wasn't trying to keep it a secret—

305
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,880
No, it's not that.

306
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,170
I should've f***ed them up sooner.

307
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,010
It's annoying that I put you guys through this.

308
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,120
It's nothing...

309
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,730
Ji Woo, are you going to the Disciplinary Committee room?

310
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,890
Watch closely.

311
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,290
I might get hurt later, but I can at least throw a punch.

312
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,000
But you shouldn't do that now, Ji Woo.

313
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,090
You're dead.

314
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,990
What?

315
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,110
Hey! You crazy bastard!

316
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,990
♫    ♫

317
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,260
Why is he taking all that?

318
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,780
Why is it so noisy?

319
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,580
That bastard...

320
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,760
Hey, what's that?

321
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,180
I'll destroy it.

322
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,310
If this is destroyed, you'd no longer—

323
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,260
♫    ♫

324
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,390

Did I need help from a loser like that?

330
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,480
Se Hyeon, the video is on there. The video.

331
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,430
You bastard! Wait right there.

332
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,950

Hey, you f***er!

I'm so f***ing tired. You f***er.

You know I'm in the Disciplinary Committee, right?

Bring it here while I'm being nice, you f***er.

There are no pedestrians here.

I can kill you once that thing is destroyed.

It doesn't mean you can give up on them?

372
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,820
I haven't met someone so interesting in a while.

373
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,940
You say that after what you went through?

374
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,190
I'll take it as a compliment.

375
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,330
It wasn't a compliment.

You'll be disappointed soon.

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,740
Follow me, you bastard.

00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,330

It's that thing Gyu Jin is obsessed with.

384
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,820
Hey, loser, did something happen here?

385
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,150
No, the thing is...

386
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,860
I suppose you know nothing.

387
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,140
Gyu Jin would be thrilled if I brought this to him.

388
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,960
Thank you.

389
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,990
 Watch closely. 

390
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,310
 I might get hurt later, but I can at least throw a punch. 

391
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,580
Hey, you f***ing bitch!

392
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,580
Did you just call me...

393
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,240
You crazy bitch.

394
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,610
You crazy bitch!

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,440
Wow.

396
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,940
What did I just see?

397
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,400
Ji Woo, I just...

398
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Hee Won,

399
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,980
you're finally a Yuseong Tech High student.

400
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,290
That idiot.

401
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,190
Hey, Lee Hyeon Woo.

402
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,950
 Hyeon Woo, 

403
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,430
 I heard you've been robbed. 

404
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,620
 The thing is, I... 

405
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,990
 You should've told me. 

406
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,970
 I found out that the robber... 

407
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,290
 was Kim Gyu Jin. 

408
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,260
 He gave you a loan with that money. 

409
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,800
 Using the video you took as a collateral, 

410
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,750
 he threatened your sister, too. 

411
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,110
Die!

412
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,350
 Hyeon Woo? I know. 

413
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,390
 The siblings have no parents, but they rely on each other. 

414
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,440
 I'm proud of them. 

415
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,360
   

416
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,080
   

417
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,870
 What will you do once you quit the sport? 

418
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,420
 I don't know. 

419
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,170
 Study? 

420
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,980
 You can't study with your brain. 

421
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,010
 What did you say? Huh? 

422
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,050
 I'm your older sister. 

423
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,510
 I'm telling you to keep playing sports. 

424
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,140
 No thanks. 

425
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,060
 It's tough and costly. 

426
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,520
 I can try making money. 

427
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,020
 You're too little. You can't make money. 

428
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,610
 Just focus on your studies. 

429
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,050
 You called me little? 

430
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,520
 You're much smaller than me. 

431
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,860
 You keep picking a fight with your older sister. 

432
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,540
 Do you want to be pinned on the ground? 

433
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,080
 Go ahead if you can. 

434
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,990
 Hey! 

435
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,830
 Hyeon Woo. 

436
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,560
Hyeon Woo.

437
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,720
Look at me, Lee Hyeon Woo.

438
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,970
Don't give up.

439
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,850
I'll help you.

440
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,480
Ms. Lee, please...

441
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,070
- Ms. Lee! 
 - My gosh.

442
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,850
Ms. Lee.

443
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,450
Ms. Lee.

444
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,170
Ms. Lee.

445
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:27,320
   

446
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,230
   

447
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,800
I peel fruits at home often.

448
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,780
Hee Won.

449
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,840
Ji Woo!

450
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,670
You must be Ji Woo.

451
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,090
Pardon?

452
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,620
Welcome.

453
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,490
Ms. Lee, how are you feeling...

454
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,080
Me? As you can see, I'm totally fine.

455
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,900
She was amazingly lucky.

456
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,450
She just needs to be hospitalized for two weeks.

457
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I'm so sorry, Ms. Lee.

458
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,930
 Lee Hyeon Woo, that bastard. I'll make him pay for this. 

459
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,200
 As for the treatment fee, give me some time... 

460
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,440
- I'll try my best to— 
 - You're joining us, right?

461
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,570
- Pardon? 
 - Well...

462
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,710
Hee Won is joining our study group, too.

463
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,940
Study group?

464
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,490
Yes. I'm moving, but I won't transfer.

465
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,320
It turns out it's an hour-and-a-half bus ride.

466
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,380
I think I could commute.

467
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,350
I want to study with you guys here.

468
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,640
Ji Woo, you'll join us, right?

469
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,630
Join us.

470
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,580
Okay?

471
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,510
Well, I'm so sorry, but...

472
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,200
I...

473
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,950
want to join the study group.

474
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,010
Great.

475
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,870
   

476
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,770
 We're studying here for now. 

477
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,280
What's he doing?

478
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,410
Why is he doing this? 
    

479
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,380
He gets poor grades, doesn't he?

480
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,400
You prepared all this?

481
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,610
It's so cool.

482
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,370
It's nothing. It's the study group leader's job.

483
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,680
He only hears what he wants to hear, right?

484
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,010
Yes. I think you're right.

485
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,210
I'm nervous.

486
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,120
What is it now?

487
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,160
It will be filled soon, too.

488
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
Yes. Me, too.

489
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,540
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting.

490
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,340
- Did you buy this, too? 
 - Yes.

491
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,210
When did you take that photo?

492
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,350
Isn't it cute?

493
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,980
By the way, did you guys hear?

494
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,570
Pi Han Wool got arrested, too.

495
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,430
 Hey. 

496
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,670
 You're Pi Han Wool, right? 

497
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,350
 Can we talk for a second? 

498
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,410
 - I am— 
 - Detective Na Tae Man, right? 

499
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,140
 Let's go. 

500
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,930
 Yes, everyone's talking about it. 

501
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,440
Why did he get arrested?

502
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,910
If Lee Hyeon Woo was being investigated and Pi Han Wool got arrested,

503
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,360
he might go to the juvenile hall like Lee Hyeon Woo...

504
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,730
Of course, they should. They're thugs.

505
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,910
By the way, Pi Han Wool came to school today.

506
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,880
- What? 
 - What?

507
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,770
Yoon Ga Min!

508
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,240
Come down immediately!

509
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,710
- Why? 
 - Why?

510
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,590
Why? F***. He asks why. What do we do?

511
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,790
Shit. I knew it.

512
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,780
What do you mean?

513
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,550
You might not be interested,

514
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,510
but you're at the center of attention at Yuseong Tech High right now, Yoon Ga Min.

515
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,670
What's wrong, Gyu Jin?

516
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,050
Are you okay? Who did this to you?

517
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,690
Was it Yoon Ga Min again?

518
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,000
Yoon Ga Min, that son of a bitch.

519
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,500
 Hey, Yoon Ga Min beat up Kim Gyu Jin, too. 

520
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,620
 - Really? 
 - Kim Gyu Jin? 

521
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,020
 That Disciplinary Committee member who does Judo? 

522
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,140
 Isn't he in the 11th grade? 

523
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,700
 That evil bastard. He skipped to the 11th grade. 

524
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,360
 What will happen to Kang Tae Oh, then? 

525
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,740
What are those bastards saying?

526
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,070
I know Yuseong Tech High is a mess,

527
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,060
but different grades don't fight each other by a rule.

528
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,660
But you broke that rule.

529
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,170
I think he's scared.

530
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,910
He can't do anything because he's scared.

531
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,640
So, who is he?

532
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,840
Kang Tae Oh. The No. 1 of the 11th grade.

533
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,970
Come down, you f***er!

534
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,140
Let's decide who's above whom!

535
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,310
Decide!

536
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,490
You can be above me.

537
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,740
Did you see that?

538
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,270
He's running away scared.

539
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,410
What?

540
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,540
Is he looking down on me, by chance?

541
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,960
Yes, he is. You've been looked down on, Tae Oh.

542
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,300
He looked down on you big time.

543
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,060
Not just big time. Big f***ing time.

544
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,720
Big f***ing time?

545
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,780
Hey, you son of a bitch!

546
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,700
You look down on me?

547
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,740
Yoon Ga Min, you won't come down?

548
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,690
Where's Joon?

549
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,600
Let go, you bastards!

550
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,330
There you are, you son of a bitch.

551
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,170
What's this now? Huh?

552
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,910
Stay put, you bastard.

553
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,060
You said you'd conquer Yuseong Tech High.

554
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,910
I thought you were an ambitious bastard.

555
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,880
But you were holding this disgusting thing.

556
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,020
What's this?

557
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,100
Study Group Application?

558
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,470
Study group...

559
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,340
Hey, Yoon Ga Min. You influenced him and turned him into a f***ing loser.

560
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,210
Give me that.

561
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,880
This?

562
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,160
F***!

563
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,570
Cute bastard.

564
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:52,520
I'll kill whoever is holding this from now on, okay?

565
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,680
F***. What the hell...

566
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,370
- Hey! 
 - Yoon Ga Min!

567
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,000
Wow. F***.

568
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:33,970


569
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,950
Wow.

570
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,920
