2
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,200
 You might not believe this, but I'm bad at fighting. 
    

3
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,800
 Why am I so bad at fighting? 

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,820
 Is it because I'm weak? 

5
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,110
 Or is it because I'm not trying hard enough? 

6
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,620
 When I was devastated that my fighting ability wasn't improving, 

7
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,500
 I discovered a new method. 

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,420
 I want to become f***ing strong. 

9
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,080
 If you want to become so strong, 

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,510
 go to Yuseong Technical High 

11
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,390
 go to Yuseong Technical High 

12
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,310
 and fight against the best fighters of Ancheon. 

13
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,900
 What are you saying? 

14

21

 No matter how much I tried, I couldn't go above No. 17. 

22
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,750
 But it's too early to give up. 

23

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,390

 - Hey, Yoon Ga Min!  
 - "Conquer Yuseong Tech High"?

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,410
Did he mean conquer by fighting?

46
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,090
 - Hey! Hey!  
 - Wouldn't it be weird to think he meant studying?

47
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,360
I know.

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,350
He must be really good at studying. I'm jealous.

49
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,290
Yoon Ga Min, hear me out for a second.

50
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,140
I'm sorry, but I started the study group to study.

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,060
Not to help you go up in ranking in fighting.

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,050
This is studying, too.

53
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,430
Fighting study.

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,110
Fight with me just once, then.

55
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,170
 If you don't want to, teach me how you normally train. 

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,350
Otherwise, I'll study, too—

57
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,690
Will you really?

58
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,050
- Huh? 
 - Will you really study?

59
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,830
Yes. I will.

60
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,690
I have to.

61
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,130
We'll visit Ms. Lee at the hospital.

62
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,810
Solve all the problems while we're gone.

63
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,490
Is it a test?

64
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,150
Yes.

65
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,560
Hold on. I'm almost done.

66
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,090
   

67
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,590
Are you Yoon Ga Min?

68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,480
Pardon?

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,930
Follow me. It's for a test.

70
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,320
T-Test?

71
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,020
Aren't you Yoon Ga Min, the No. 1 in the 10th grade?

72
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,050
Yes.

73
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,020
I am Yoon Ga Min.

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,450
Long time no see, Detective.

76
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,810
I know.

77
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,880
I haven't seen you since that case last year.

78
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,510
By the way, why are you at Yuseong Tech High, of all places?

79
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,270
 Hey, stop. 

80
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,750
 Stop it, I said. 

81
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,530
 Are you okay? 

82
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,560
 Anti, why am I so weak? 

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
 What are you talking about? 

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,290
 You aren't weak. You haven't become strong yet. 

85
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,220
 I believe you'll become powerful and protect me someday. 

86
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,670
 I'll be in your care then, Lee Joon. 

87
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,350
 I passed the test. 

88
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,130
 I'm in Yeonbaek Gang now. 

89
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,910
 So, don't look for me anymore. 

90
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,920
Get off.

91
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm Oh Jang Ho, the scouter of the YB Family.

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,170
This is a test to scout a reserve soldier,

93
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,960
a backup fighter for the Yeonbaek Gang.

94
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,560
The Top 3 students of each school can take a test and they only get one chance.

95
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,050
Shit, I'm so good at saying these lines because I say them all the time.

96
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,520
Listen carefully. The goal is simple.

97
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,210
You see that car over there, right?

98
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,030
If you grab the car key on the hood,

99
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,310
not only will you become a reserve soldier of the Yeonbaek Gang,

100
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,340
but you'll own that car, too.

101
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,080
What do you say?

102
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,570
The goal is simple,

103
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,660
but it won't be as easy as it sounds.

104
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,910
This isn't a f***ing kid's play or something, right?

105
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,380
Some people will stop you from doing that.

106
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,330
They're your seniors who passed the reserve soldier test recently.

107
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,860
   

108
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,010
   

109
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,310
   

110
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,090
There are no rules.

111
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,480
Get the car key, no matter what it takes.

112
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,610
If so, you'll take the first step into a successful life.

113
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,090
Are you ready?

114
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,540
 Did you get tricked by that bullshit? 

115
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,200
Start.

116
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,540
Come at me, sons of b****es!

117
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,420
I bet he ran away.

118
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,880
- Where did he go? 
 - What?

119
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,810
See? I said he wouldn't be here.

120
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,560
His eyes said otherwise.

121
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,450
Give me a break.

122
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,790
He dyed his hair red like gochujang.

123
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,710
He's obviously a thug.

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,940
What do we do?

125
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,850
We told Ms. Lee that we got all five members.

126
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm hungry. Let's just go get some food.

127
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,390
I even got him a brain supplement, too.

128
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,970
Yuseong High kids are high quality.

129
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,550
They don't just call them a thug academy for no reason.

130
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,510
But this strawberry-head bastard...

131
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,130
No. 1, Yoon Ga Min,

132
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,380
I thought you were the monster of Yuseong Tech High.

Was that just a hoax?

By the way, are you really Yoon Ga Min?

135

I don't know how you had the audacity to do this,

But it's not over yet.

140
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,110
You should pay for wasting our time.

Aren't you embarrassed for doing that at your age?

These babies are fearless.

Are you acting cheeky because you think

153

you can tell a police officer?

♫    ♫

164
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,710
By the way, Pi Han Wool left as soon as he came to the station that day.

165
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,020
He even knew my name even though I was newly appointed.

166
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,580
Isn't that kind of strange?

167
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,940
I don't know. Is it really strange?

168
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,260
Are you sure the job is getting done?

169
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,390
This police station, I mean.

170
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,410
Don't overreact.

171
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,010
He's just a high schooler.

172
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,050
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

173
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,860
Don't try too hard. Just go home.

174
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,990
Yes, that's how normal kids behave at a police station.

175
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,980
By the way, what do we say inside?

176
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,620
Not sure.

177
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,130
Let's go inside first. It'll work out somehow.

178
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,770
Aren't you scared, Se Hyeon?

179
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,570
Of course I am.

180
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,740
I came here because I was too scared to go with those guys.

181
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,610
But the police station isn't as scary as the thugs' hideout.

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,620
- Let's go in. 
 - Okay.

183
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,400
   

184
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,100
Are you sure you'll be okay?

185
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,010
Four-eyed Psycho, guard your glasses well.

186
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,660
Your mom will be worried.

187
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,620
I don't know what makes you so cocky,

188
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,730
but in the end, the one with a knife is stronger.

189
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,390
You f***er.

190
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,240
Knowledge is stronger than a knife.

191
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,100
You f***ing bitch.

192
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,650
I've never seen anyone block the Four-eyed Psycho's punch.

193
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,610
No. 1, Yoon Ga Min.

194
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,870
The rumor was true.

195
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,470
Because I'm doing this with high schoolers here,

196
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,330
you must've underestimated me.

197
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,540
What?

198
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,260
Did you get punched on purpose?

199
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,690
He must be in pain from being beaten.

200
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,380
- Don't step on him. 
 - Was it to make me move my foot?

201
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,140
Give me a f***ing break.

202
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,260
Wow, what a cool club.

203
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,900
It's not a club.

204
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,210
It's a study group, okay?

205
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,980
♫  We go ♫

206
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,750
F***, I need to stop smoking.

207
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,710
Hey, High Schooler.

208
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,040
By the way, he pretended to be you to take the test.

209
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,260
He can't even fight.

210
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,270
He'll obviously get in your way.

211
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,570
Why are you defending him so much?

212
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,850
 You can't use that technique any more. 

213
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,550
 That's not fair. 

214
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,250
 Anyway, your kicks are more powerful than usual. Is something wrong? 

215
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,650
   

216
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,950
 Eight points? 

217
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,440
 Why won't my grades go up, no matter how hard I study? 

218
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,870
 I wish you had one of those. 
   

219
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,950
 - A reference book? 
 - No, it's better than a reference book. 

220
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,070
 What is that? 

221
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,640
 It makes you work harder, 

222
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,280
 it makes you do your best passionately, 

223
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,500
 and it makes you change. 

224
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,710
 I'm asking you what that is. 

225
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,520
   

226
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,740
 Twenty-four points? 

227
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,510
 Not bad, right? 

228
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,300
 He's a serious contender. 

229
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,740
 What's important is that... 

230
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,510
 he actually solved them without guessing. 

231
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,540
 I finally found one. 

232
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,650
Joon isn't in my way.

233
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,630
He's more of a rival.

234
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,670
 Joon, don't get the wrong idea. 

235
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,260
 I've never thought of you as a rival. 

236
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,330
It's okay to use that on you, right?

237
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,490
- What? 
 - My uncle told me to never...

238
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,820
use this technique because it's too dangerous.

239
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,750
Kid, don't do anything dangerous.

240
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,140
No. You'd be in danger, not me.

241
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,480
   

242
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,870
   

243
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,060
Hey, the scouter of the Yeonbaek Gang.

244
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,020
Can we talk for a second?

245
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,630
Hey!

246
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,090
That's crazy!

247
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,980
I thought the car was empty.

248
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,080
He almost got hit.

249
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,940
No, they were actually trying to hit him.

250
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,380
Bingo.

251
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,420
Hey, Yoon Ga Min,

252
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,240
are you interested in joining us?

253
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,120
You'd make a perfect reserve army manager.

254
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,420
Reserve army manager?

255
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,880
How would the losers of Yuseong Tech High make a living?

256
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,150
- Don't you agree? 
 - No.

257
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,690
Wow, how loyal.

258
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,520
We'll go to college.

259
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,160
What? College?

260
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,580
Hey, are you out of your mind?

261
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,420
Geez, he's so my type.

262
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,950
Hey, do you go to their school, too?

263
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,140
Do you go there to pay condolences?

264
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,790
Or was it in the will?

265
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,720
Open it!

266
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,430
Open it!

267
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,350
Park Geon Yeop?

268
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,500
Huh? What was that?

269
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,180
Shit, sons of bitches.

270
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,250
F***.

271
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,160
Get in. Get in.

272
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,480
Okay.

273
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,630
Okay. Get their testimonies.

274
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,220
Okay, okay.

275
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,260
That kid is safe, too.

276
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,240
Gosh, what a relief.

277
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,780
Wow. That evil bastard.

278
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,110
A high schooler caught a member of the Yeonbaek Gang?

279
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,170
Hey, what's wrong?

280
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,450
We didn't do anything wrong.

281
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,330
The police should give us a medal or something.

282
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,250
Right, right.

283
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,690
We did nothing wrong.

284
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,400
We reported them, too.

285
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,090
That's enough. Stop.

286
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,340
What? You never know.

287
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,430
That could help our college admission.

288
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,520
- Really? 
 - Medal, my foot.

289
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,710
"The law regarding assaults and their punishments."

290
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,010
- Be grateful you aren't being arrested right now. 
 - Pardon?

291
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,120
You should've reported immediately if something was happening.

292
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,780
Don't you see that ambulance over there?

293
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,680
He was getting beaten to death. How would we report?

294
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,940
You mean violence can't be justified in any way, right?

295
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,770
Y-Yes, he's smart. He gets it.

296
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,960
What a ridiculous man.

297
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,350
But that only applies when the authority is operating properly.

298
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,320
The system is very diseased right now.

299
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,980
Well...

300
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,420
I can't praise you as a detective,

301
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,570
but it's not like I can tell you off either.

302
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,670
Anyway, I'm sorry...

303
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,390
that a thug came to your school.

304
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,660
Call me immediately if anything happens.

305
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,530
I'll even stop pooping and run to you.

306
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,270
He's not a piece of trash, at least.

307
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,280
Right, Four-eyed Psycho?

308
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,650
Where did he go now?

309
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,980
What?

310
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm on my way right now.

311
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,330
I'm on a bus.

312
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,890
 Did you forget to come back by 10? 

313
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,120
The thing is, a friend was in danger.

314
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,960
 So? 

315
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,580
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never be late again.

316
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,530
 You remember you went to Yuseong after promising me, right? 

317
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,950
Of course, I remember.

318
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,660
 Oh, really? 

319
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,870
This really will be the last time. I promise. I mean it.

320
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,560
 Thankfully, it ended well. 

321
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,860
 We gained an advantage thanks to the study group kids. 

322
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,800
 Using the Yeonbaek Gang members' testimonies, 

323
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,060
 we could find out more about Pi Han Wool. 

324
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,460
Okay.

325
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,150
 Anyway, it looks like you and the kids 

326
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,280
 are bringing a new change to Yuseong Technical High. 

327
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,000
We're in your care.

328
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,620
 No, I'm in your care. 

329
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,260
 Be safe. 

330
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,770
 You'll be in danger from now on. 

331
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,980
   

332
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,460
 Yoon Ga Min even beat up the scouter. 
   

333
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,510
He's definitely above average.

334
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,130
Shit! Shit, I died.

335
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,670
Whoa, four stars?

336
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,380
It's been a while since you gave four stars, right?

337
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,720
Things will get interesting.

338
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,060
 Yoon Ga Min, shouldn't you be doing this? 
   

339
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,320
 - Wow. 
 - Why isn't Gochujang joining, by the way? 

340
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,640
 Did he run away? 

341
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,050
 That can't be. 

342
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,930
 Someone just read. 

343
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,070
 Are you feeling okay? 
   

344
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,360
 Don't you worry about me. 

345
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,480
 Thank you for today, everyone. 

346
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,020
 Idiot. 

347
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,290
   

348
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,010
 Is the study group finally complete with us, five members? 

349
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,400
 What are we supposed to do now? 

350
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,070
 Yoon Ga Min, say something. 

351
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,930
 Study 14 hours a day? 

352
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,990
 Do you want to die? 

353
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,530
   

354
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,550
Let's watch this one.

355
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,290
- This? 
 - Yes.

356
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,870
Guys, guys. Look.

357
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,990
I think it's highlighted.

358
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,720
   

359
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,150
   

360
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,010
 - Gochujang, you've been fined. 
 - You're right. 

361
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,080
 Four-eyed Psycho, how much will it be? 

362
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,930
♫    ♫

363
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,150
The five of you.

364
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,960
Come here. Come here.

365
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,560
What's this now?

366
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,440
Who said you don't have to wear a jacket?

367
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,570
It's still winter dressing season, you brats.

368
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,370
I'm wearing a jacket.

369
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,730
Go back home.

370
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,230
Are you kidding me right now?

371
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,600
What? You don't want to? Do you want penalties, then?

372
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,240
Penalties?

373
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,830
I thought the jacket wasn't mandatory anymore.

374
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,590
- Ms. Lee! 
 - Ms. Lee.

375
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,440
It's the winter dressing season until May,

376
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,910
but the mixed dressing period starts on April 20.

377
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:29,410
The school rules say it's okay to wear the spring uniform.

378
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,560
The disciplinary committee should know the rules, at least.

379
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,810
Go in.

380
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,360
Idiot.

381
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,210
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

382
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,840
By the way, were you already discharged?

383
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,180
Yes, I'm fully recovered.

384
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,240
- What a relief. 
 - That's such a relief.

385
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,670
Thank you, guys.

386
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,240
Hey, is she the legendary Ms. Lee, who got stabbed to protect a student?

387
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,500
Yes, she's in charge of the study group.

388
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,290
Wow! The study group is the best!

389
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,960
Our teacher got stabbed, even.

390
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,370
You punk.

391
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,450
Don't talk about Ms. Lee like that.

392
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,010
I don't know what's wrong with Joon.

393
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,240
You must be Joon.

394
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,300
Yes, I'm Lee Joon, ma'am. I respect you.

395
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,900
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Likewise.

396
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,170
Guys, I'll go see the vice principal.

397
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,380
You go ahead.

398
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,820
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

399
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,680
See you.

400
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,780
   

401
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,470
   

402
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,020
You somehow got the members.

403
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,920
Thank you, Vice Principal.

404
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,940
What happened to the Lee Hyeon Woo case?

405
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,300
He was sent to juvenile hall last week.

406
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,220
- How about what I said? 
 - I rejected all the reporting requests.

407
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,300
Good job.

408
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,350
Everything was resolved.

409
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,140
And regarding that, there's a second page.

410
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,500
What kind of nonsense is this?

411
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
   

412
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,940
 Sir, will you just ignore Pi Han Wool like this? 

413
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,410
 Please schedule a disciplinary committee meeting. 

414
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Our study group was officially approved as a club.

415
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,300
We'll get our own room too, soon.

416
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,300
- A study group room? 
 - Yes.

417
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,780
We'll start our activities now.

418
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,680
The first one will be—

419
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,560
- Choosing the main member? 
 - Shut up.

420
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,550
A Study Group Exchange Meeting.

421
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,040
Exchange meeting?

422
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,820
You'll meet with students like you who are studying in study groups,

423
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,200
hear their experiences, and learn.

424
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,730
- Wow. 
 - Are we going to Seoul, then?

425
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,570
Hi.

426
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,630
Are you going on a trip somewhere?

427
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,870
- How about yourself? 
 - Shut up?

428
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,680
Hold on.

429
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,510
Is he out of his mind?

430
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,160
White rice and gochujang?

431
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,020
What?

432
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,150
Are you country bumpkins visiting Seoul?

433
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,750
Geez, what the f***?

434
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,310
Shit, what the f***?

435
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,770
Hey! High schoolers!

436
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,550
Why don't you respond when I'm talking to you?

437
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,670
Hey, cuties. Where are you from?

438
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,260
Do you want us to show you around Seoul—

439
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,040
We're from Gwangyeok.

440
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,610
Kneel.

441
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,040
We'll never look down on country bumpkins...

442
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,030
Oh, I mean, the residents of Gwangyeok.

443
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,380
We'll never look down on the residents of Gwangyeok.

444
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,360
Say it together.

445
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,400
 We'll never look down on the residents of Gwangyeok again! 

446
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,560
One more time.

447
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,910
 We'll never look down on the residents of... 

448
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,710
- Guys. 
  - Gwangyeok! 

449
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,140
Hey, Ms. Lee is coming.

450
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,920
Disappear on the count to three. One, two...

451
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,390
Thank you!

452
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,580
What? Were they Joon's friends?

453
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,170
No.

454
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,530
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

455
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,560
By the way, where's Ga Min?

456
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,290
Don't even get me started.

457
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,680
 He must've been nervous to meet smart students. 

458
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,030
 He stayed up all night and woke up late. 

459
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,370
 Isn't Four-eyed Psycho so extra? 

460
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,200
I know. We aren't going anywhere that impressive.

461
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,930
Ms. Lee, isn't this a university?

462
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,290
Can lowly people like us go in?

463
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,670
Guys, why are you intimidated already?

464
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,800
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong.

465
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,000
Hey, Senior.

466
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,940
- Who's that? 
 - Don't know.

467
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,850
Guys, say hello.

468
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,360
This is my college senior and...

469
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,880
a teacher at Manil High, Mr. Park Woo Yeol.

470
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,790
You must be Ms. Lee's students.

471
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,060
Nice to meet you.

472
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,100
- Hello. 
  - Hello. 

473
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,140
Senior, what's the plan today?

474
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,700
Wow, she sure is the legendary Ms. Lee.

475
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,650
Senior? He's clean-cut.

476
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,120
By chance, are they flirting?

477
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,030
T-They must've been that thing. A campus couple.

478
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,960
Guys, it's not like that.

479
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,480
Let's go now.

480
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,710
And text Ga Min to come straight to Manil High.

481
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,700
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

482
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,410
- Hey, come quickly. 
 - Okay, okay.

483
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,870
 At Manil High, most students are in at least one study group. 

484
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,600
The school supports them so they can study on their own.

485
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,090
And Manil High is an elite high school that's on the same level as

486
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,440
Hwamun High, Chaehwa Girls' High, and Kangwon National University High.

487
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,630
Do they send a handful of students to elite universities?

488
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,930
We send about 200 students a year.

489
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,830
- Wow. 
 - 200?

490
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,170
Not bad.

491
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,990
They sure are impressive.

492
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,260
   

493
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,830
   

494
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,180
These are our study group members.

495
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,030
And this is the group leader, Hong Jae Hee.

496
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,350
These are the Yuseong Tech High students I mentioned.

497
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,100
Hey, you can hear it, right?

498
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,900
I think I did.

499
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm not the only one who heard, "Who are these idiots," right?

500
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,780
Hey, what are you saying? No one said that.

501
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,440
Right. They didn't say, "idiots."

502
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,860
Guys.

503
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,250
Everyone is here, right?

504
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,710
Yoo Joon Min isn't here yet.

505
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,680
Really? Joon Min is often late these days.

506
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,880
It's okay. We're waiting for a student, too.

507
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,630
Really? How about you guys chat

508
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,380
to get to know each other?

509
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,680
What a nice study group room. I'm so jealous.

510
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,310
Right?

511
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,980
But we'll get a room soon, too.

512
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,520
They must take notes using tablets.

513
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,550
Look. The pencil case has a passcode, too.

514
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,830
They use unusual pens, too.

515
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,120
That has ink that vaporizes.

516
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,380
If you write down the answer with that, they disappear the next day.

517
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,820
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

518
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,110
Yoon Ga Min would lose his mind if he saw that.

519
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,660
Hey, you can hear it, right?

520
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,880
Of course.

521
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,450
They're disgusted by us.

522
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,340
Because they're smart.

523
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,060
Why isn't Ga Min here yet?

524
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,840
Are you sure you texted him?

525
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,320
I texted him in the group chat.

526
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,020
   

527
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,570
Hey. It'd be hilarious if he went to "Manik High."

528
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,290
There's no way that school exists.

529
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,300
   

530
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,450
   

531
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,010
   

532
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,700
   

533
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,120
If it's a school with a long history,

534
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,360
it must be this one. Right?

535
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:42,970
   

536
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:52,760


537
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,310
   

538
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,960
♫  Wherever you go, parking lot, back yard  ♫

539
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,100
♫  Rooftop, I make them all my stage

545
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,970

557
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,420
