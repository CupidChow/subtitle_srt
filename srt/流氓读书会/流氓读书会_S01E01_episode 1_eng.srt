1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,750
To add or subtract in polynomials,

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,660
you need to know what a monomial is first.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,660
A monomial is an expression consisting of one term.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,040
A polynomial is

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,850
an expression consisting of more than one term with the sum of several terms.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,490
A term is an expression consisting solely of multiplied numbers or characters...

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,270
These idiots. You don't even understand. What am I even doing?

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,110
Let's say...

9
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,230
there's an expression that goes like, "x squared plus 2x minus three."

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,900
What is the total number of terms here, then?

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,100
   

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,620
   

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,080
   

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,380
 You might find it hard to believe, 

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,070
 but I am a bad student. 
   

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,350


17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,800
 Mom! I want to join an academy. 

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,200
   

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,640
 Mom! I want a private tutor. 

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,920
 Teacher, I think I really get it now. 

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,960
   

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,970
 Ga Min, 

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,310
 you didn't skip a row and mark the answer sheet wrong, did you? 

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,630
 Is it because I'm not smart? 

25
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,260
 That can't be. 

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,070
 Is it because I'm not trying hard enough? 

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,290
   

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,820
 "Studying isn't everything in life." 

29
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,880
 I can't say that because I want to get good grades so badly. 

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,620
 So, I found a perfect solution. 

31
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,570
 Gosh, I want to go to college. 

32
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,540
 If you want to go to college so badly, go to Yuseong Technical High 

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,690
 and aim for special admission to specialized schools. 

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
 Are you crazy? 

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,930
 I'd rather die than go to Yuseong. 

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,610
 I agree. 

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,850
♫  One, two, three. Come on!  ♫

38
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,000
   

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,820
   

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,070
 Although it's a bit different than what I expected. 

41
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,270
What are you looking at? You f***er.

42
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,480
You son of a bitch.

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,400
- Look down, you loser. 
 - Hey, fight me.

44
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,510
 If I survive here and get good grades, I could go to college— 

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,010
   

46
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,450
 I put my guard down. 

47
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,340
 I judged them by their looks. 

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,080
 They pretend they weren't interested in grades at school, 

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,600
 but they all must study hard at home. 

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,790
 But it's too early to give up. 

51
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,300
 I have the last solution... 
   

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,070
 that I've never tried yet. 

53
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,050
   

54
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,660
♫  We are the backpackers, yeah we the backpacker  ♫

55
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,180
♫  Even if my shoes get stained, backpackers  ♫

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,800
♫  We are the backpackers, we start out fearlessly  ♫

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,900
     
 ♫  Start barefeet, Everyone's basic in my eyes  ♫

58
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,470
   

59
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,310
   

60
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,290
   

61
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,200
♫  Bad bish in this game, there are no rules in this game. Bad vision on my mind, we'll find a way to win  ♫

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,600
♫  It's all your fault, all I need is my backpack, the boss of this block, right  ♫

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
   

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,170
   

65
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,910
   

66
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,540
♫  Even if my shoes get stained, backpackers  ♫

67
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,860
♫  We are the backpackers, we are the backpackers  ♫

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,560
   

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,850
♫  We are the backpackers, yeah we the backpackers  ♫

70
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,870
 Not him. 

71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,440
 Not him. 

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,260
 Not him either. 

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,320
 Not him either. 

74
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,550
 It's him. He looks like he wants to study. 

75
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,060
Would you like to study with me?

76
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,020
 I knew it. He looks interested. 

77
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,420
Well—

78
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,260
   

79
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,590
You're No. 170, right?

80
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,430
Fight me, you f***er!

81
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,740
No. 173 and No. 170!

82
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,410
A battle of losers!

83
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,680
Get up! You idiot.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,690
No. 170.

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,820
If you don't fight properly, I'll report you to the disciplinary department.

86
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,270
What are you doing? Fight, you son of a bitch.

87
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,920
Come on!

88
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,980
This is no fun. F***ing hell.

89
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,220
No. 173 wins.

90
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,190
Here's the proof.

91
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,090
No, they can keep going.

92
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,710
Why did you fight at all?

93
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,120
   

94
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,210
Shit. What's this?

95
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,900
So annoying.

96
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,160
The bell rang a long time ago. Sit down, you bastards.

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,370
The discipline chief.

98
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,950
Are you okay?

99
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,610
Attention!

100
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,400
Mr. Park is on leave due to a personal situation.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,160
You have a new homeroom teacher starting today.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,060
Please introduce yourself.

103
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm Lee Han Kyeong and I'll be in charge of Class 4 of 10th Grade.

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,610
Nice to meet you.

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,670
 Huh? Ms. Lee? 

106
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,490
 Do you think I can be good at studying one day? 

107
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,510
 Of course. 

108
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,760
 You have a talent. 

109
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,370
 Me? 

110
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,580
 This is your talent. 

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,500
 This will end up... 

112
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,530
 defeating this. 

113
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,460
Let me check the attendance, then.

114
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,010
Shin Hyeong Wook.

115
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,330
He's out for a smoke.

116
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,460
Oh, really?

117
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,720
He's absent, then.

118
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,600
Yoo Seong Yeon?

119
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,320
F***. I'm sleepy. It's so noisy.

120
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,210
Which bastard was it?

121
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,690
Which bastard farted?

122
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,640
Hey, what are you doing?

123
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,620
You're spared because of her.

124
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,380
Hey, Lee Hyeon Woo.

125
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,300
You f***er. Did you just throw my coffee?

126
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,330
- F***er? 
 - Yes, you f***er.

127
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,850
Who are you betting on?

128
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,310
Lee Hyeon Woo. Who else? F***!

129
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,220
The distribution rate will be low, then.

130
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,530
Go back to your seats.

131
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Hey, didn't you hear her?

132
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,310
Ms. Lee.

133
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,140
Hey, you're...

134
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,260
Ga Min.

135
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,390
   

136
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,760
Gosh, you grew so much.

137
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,120
I almost didn't recognize you.

138
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,930
You must've been surprised that I quit without a word back then.

139
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,220
Yes, a little.

140
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,310
I'm sorry. I had a bit of a situation.

141
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,430
It's okay.

142
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,320
Ms. Lee, by the way...

143
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Yes?

144
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,560
Will you stay at this school?

145
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,580
Yes. Why?

146
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,730
The former homeroom teacher quit in less than a month.

147
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,040
Today is my first day, though.

148
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,780
- Pardon? 
 - It'd be embarrassing to quit on my first day.

149
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,450
Well, but still...

150
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,130
Thank you.

151
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,970
You're all grown up and you're worried about me now.

152
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,260
By the way, how are you studying these days?

153
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,420
There's something I'm working on.

154
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,560
   

155
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,630
Wow, our school had a nice place like this?

156
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,450
It'd be nice to have a friend to study with.

157
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,470
This person studied with his friend, too.

158
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm jealous.

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,400
But I don't have a friend to study with.

160
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,070
This awakens your brain.

161
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,450
I understood it yesterday. Why can't I now?

162
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,770
I wish someone could teach me this one thing.

163
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,980
Geez, please!

164
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,980
Sorry.

165
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Hey, I give up. Bring it over.

166
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,730
Don't bother me once I teach you.

167
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,480
Therefore, 0.9999 is 1.

168
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,710
Done, right?

169
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,720
No matter how close 0.9999 is, it's still not 1.

170
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,130
Look carefully.

171
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,820
There's a cake here.

172
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,450
You cut this in thirds.

173
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,130
How big is each slice?

174
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,400
- A third? 
 - That's right.

175
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,010
What is it in decimal? 0.3333, right?

176
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,580
You put the three back together. What happens, then?

177
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,910
It's one cake again, right?

178
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,980
If you combine 0.3333 pieces, it's 0.9999.

179
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,400
But it ended up becoming 1.

180
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,690
Why? What do you not understand now?

181
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,530
How about what's on this?

182
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,200
Huh?

183
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,710
So?

184
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,710
Pardon?

185
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,480
I mean, a school is a school.

186
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,990
We shouldn't put drums around to be used as ashtrays.

187
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,440
- You think that would be enough? 
 - Pardon?

188
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,680
Will they stop smoking because we put the drums away?

189
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,870
Even I can't quit after 40 years.

190
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,030
But still, Vice Principal,

191
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,690
the school is legally...

192
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,950
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong,

193
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,470
rather than putting the drums away,

194
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:56,730
you shouldn't upset your superiors to go full-time, don't you think?

195
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,880
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,560
You don't have to apologize.

197
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,810
Try putting them away yourself if you want.

198
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll stand back and cheer you on.

199
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,150
Fighting.

200
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,270
Hey, this is impressive.

201
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,970
How did you write down every word—

202
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,550
I take good notes—

203
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,370
But this is for math.

204
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,070
What about it?

205
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,870
You never know what will be on the test.

206
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,700
I didn't want to say this, but—

207
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,750
- What is it? 
 - I think...

208
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,320
Yes?

209
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,610
you're stupid.

210
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,820
But why do you want to be good at studying?

211
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,070
I just want to be good.

212
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,320
I see.

213
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,240
- You're the same way. 
 - Me?

214
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,850
I'm not.

215
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,780
- You're lying. 
 - I said I'm not. Why do you say I'm lying?

216
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,980
You have turtle neck syndrome from studying a lot.

217
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,980
You have calluses on the right middle finger because you write a lot.

218
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,040
Your bangs are short enough not to poke your eyes when you read.

219
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,270
And most importantly,

220
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,560
it's your eyes.

221
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,700
I know you want to study.

222
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,100
Let's form a study group together.

223
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,780
- What? 
 - A study group.

224
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,970
You weren't just a dummy, but a Grade-A stupid.

225
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,670
A study group? This is Yuseong Technical High.

226
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,590
You think Pi Han Wool would allow it?

227
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,390
Pi Han Wool?

228
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,570
He created this ranking app.

229
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,870
- What's this? 
 - You don't know this either?

230
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,390
I don't. What is it?

231
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,000
 The leader of Yeonbaek Gang, the infamously cruel gang of Jeonguk-gu, 

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
 Chairman Pi Yeon Baek's son. 

233
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,770
 And he's the No. 1 in our school. 

234
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,150
He created this ranking app and got the kids to obsess over the power ranking.

235
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,670
That's Pi Han Wool.

236
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,750
What does that have to do with us studying?

237
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,340
I'm saying it's impossible to study in this school—

238
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,980
   

239
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
   

240
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,330
Let's form a study group together.

241
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,060
Let's study together and go to college.

242
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,890
   

243
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,050
Get out of my face.

244
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,940
- Se Hyeon. 
 - Get the f*** out of my face.

245
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,830
I said I won't study.

246
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,370
Enough is enough. You know nothing.

247
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,820
- Se Hyeon, I just— 
 - You know f***ing nothing.

248
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,610
Don't you dare tell me to study.

249
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,810
 Class 8 of 11th Grade. Pi Han Wool. 

250
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,430
This student has excellent grades and he always sets examples for everyone.

251
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,800
Therefore, I give him this award.

252
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,900
   

253
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,990
Shit, that's enough, I said.

254
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,540
Well, I wasn't talking to you.

255
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,940
You're nothing but No. 171. Did you pick a fight with me just now?

256
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,870
No. I'm sorry.

257
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,170
You think saying sorry is enough?

258
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,170
No, it's not what you think—

259
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,450
You should prove you're sorry if you really mean it.

260
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,060
Bring me 200,000 won by tomorrow.

261
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,340
Well, I have no money—

262
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,100
You keep saying you're sorry,

263
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,580
but you keep doing the wrong thing.

264
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,880
Bring me a baseball bat. He still doesn't get it.

265
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,550
Baseball bat?

266
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,240
 Does it hurt? 

267
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,740
 I think he's crying! 

268
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,790
Excuse me. Sir.

269
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,420
I'll go.

270
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,280
Se Hyeon is the future member of my study group.

271
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
Get up.

272
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,590
You're trying to be clever.

273
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,580
♫   What about this hood?  ♫

274
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,060
♫   Uh, guess who's back, tell 'em I'm back, bring a lot   ♫

275
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,690
♫   Bring it on, whoever you are, do your best, my name on top  ♫

276
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,470
♫  Wherever you go, parking lot, back yard  ♫

277
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,450
♫  Rooftop, I make them all my stage 
 Let you meet the line, 
   ♫

278
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,960
♫  My two feet, yawn 
 I’ll put you to sleep  ♫

279
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,090
♫  Like you're on vacation 
 Chasing after my goals with a pure expression  ♫

280
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,370
♫  When I look in the mirror, I don't want to see a failure 
 I make more plans   ♫

281
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,090
♫  I believe this, no doubt  ♫

282
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:45,420
♫  Uh, yeah
I'm on my whole lifе
I got my hoodie on  ♫

283
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,510
♫   Just don't take it serious though  ♫

284
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,410
Are you okay?

285
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,310
Why are you doing this to me?

286
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,130
- What? 
 - I told you to leave me alone.

287
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,070
Why do you keep doing this?

288
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,580
I just wanted to help you.

289
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm sure you feel good about helping me once and that's it.

290
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,340
What do you mean—

291
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,840
Don't you get it?

292
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,070
I was almost done getting beaten.

293
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,620
But I ran away like this. Then, what?

294
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,340
Now I've become a target and I"ll keep getting bullied.

295
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,810
Studying? It sounds nice.

296
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:46,060
I wish I could leisurely worry about studying, too.

297
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,330
But this...

298
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,840
is a matter of life and death to me. More crucial than studying.

299
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,490
Where's that bastard?

300
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,240
Who?

301
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,570
Are you kidding me?

302
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,740
The bastard who sprayed the fire extinguisher. He's in our class, right?

303
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,010
I didn't get a good look.

304
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,420
Get up, you f***er!

305
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,040
Let me ask you one last time.

306
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,210
Where's that bastard?

307
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,010
I'm sorry, but I really don't know.

308
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,670
 They say, "Strong body, strong mind." 

309
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,120
 Because I wanted to become good at studying, I've never 

310
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,760
 skipped working out for a day since third grade. 

311
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,150
 Ga Min, all of your talents are physical. 

312
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,580
 So, instead of studying, 

313
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,540
why don't you become a martial artist like me? 
    

314
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,640
Look at you. Not a bad punch.

315
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,550
Hey, are you okay?

316
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,890
What a relief.

317
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,020
Don't worry about anything...

318
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,660
and join my study group.

319
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,430
I don't want to.

320
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,990
What?

321
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,950
I don't want to. I'm not going to.

322
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,640
- Why not? 
 - Be honest. You're not confident.

323
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,840
- What? 
 - Stop playing ignorant.

324
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,450
Isn't that why you put on the mask, too?

325
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,350
You're afraid kids would pick on you.

326
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,010
You'd better learn welding well.

327
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,420
Why don't you answer?

328
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,440
Okay.

329
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,910
Going to college is useless.

330
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,310
Our new youngest employee has a bachelor's degree, too.

331
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,660
You need to have skills to be treated well.

332
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,400
You know that?

333
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,920
That's enough. Can't you just stop?

334
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,550
I'm not studying anymore.

335
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,230
I won't go to college and I'll learn welding.

336
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,260
That's why I'm at Yuseong Technical High, too.

337
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,060
How dare you, you little...

338
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:17,200
♫  On these narrow streets, my days are filled with my dried-up dreams  ♫

339
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,860
   

340
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,120
♫  If I look at you silently  ♫

341
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,520
♫  Will you embrace me?  ♫

342
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,250
♫  Some days pass by as if they're mocking me  ♫

343
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,480
 Isn't Ga Min in a study group? 

344
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,560
 My son formed a study group with his classmates 

345
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,090
 and his ranking went up by 10 for the midterm. 

346
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,420
 Really? 

347
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,700
 Tell Ga Min to join one, too. 

348
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,760
 You can't join our study group. 

349
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,320
 Why not? 

350
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,640
 You're at the bottom of our class. 

351
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,800
 I'm sorry. Our moms make the decisions. 

352
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,050
 We can't just let anyone join. 

353
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,020
 Our study group is full. 

354
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,460
 Hey, don't make eye contact with him. 

355
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,660
 He has no conscience. How dare he try to use us? 

356
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,250
 He'd have better luck to be reborn than joining a study group. 

357
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:31,220
 Ga Min, something suddenly came up with Ms. Lee— 

358
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,390
 Are you crying? What's wrong? 

359
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,420
 Is something wrong? 

360
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,460
   

361
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,810
 It's okay. It's okay if you're not good at studying. 

362
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,830
 No. 

363
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,950
 It's not that. 

364
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,480
♫  Even the warmth is gone  ♫

365
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,360
♫  I stayed up secretly that night  ♫

366
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,100
♫  Some days pass by as if they're mocking me  ♫

367
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,600
♫  I sit blanking out and shed tears  ♫

368
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,040
I don't want to go to school.

369
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,620
No, I still need to go.

370
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,110
I'm a teacher.

371
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,920
Hey, put out the cigarettes. Hurry and go inside!

372
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,600
Go inside! Put them out right now!

373
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,460
You bastards. Hurry up!

374
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,850
- You, go in quickly! 
 - The discipline chief is here. Let's go.

375
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,430
Discipline Chief, hello.

376
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,890
Hello, my foot.

377
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,200
- Get rid of all these drums. 
 - Sorry?

378
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,110
A school inspector is suddenly coming. The vice principal is freaking out.

379
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,900
Get rid of all of these, okay?

380
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,720
Wait...

381
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,410
   

382
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,180
Thank you.

383
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,490
By the way, what's your name?

384
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,250
Um, I'm Park Geon Yeop.

385
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,230
Geon Yeop.

386
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
But these ashtrays...

387
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,960
Isn't it better to let the inspector see it?

388
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,710
To be honest, I wish I could, too.

389
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,260
But it's still our school.

390
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,740
This school won't change from your efforts alone.

391
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,420
It probably won't, but...

392
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,580
But it's embarrassing to give up like this.

393
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,700
Anyway, I'll take care of the rest.

394
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,960
Go to your class, Geon Yeop.

395
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,510
See you.

396
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,270
Okay.

397
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,790
   

398
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,310
   

399
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,250
This...

400
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,320
I threw it away.

401
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Thank you.

402
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,870
Give me a break.

403
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,320
It was this bastard, right?

404
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,400
The welding mask.

405
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,940
Wow, what the f***.

406
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,740
Give it back.

407
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,870
Yuseong Technical High failed to meet the enrollment quota this year again.

408
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,980
Inspector, even during the unemployment crisis of late,

409
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,230
we're very proud of our high employment rate.

410
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:31,080
Anyway, keep in mind that we're always watching Yuseong Technical High.

411
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,000
We're grateful for that.

412
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,150
As a response to your attention,

413
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,600
we're working hard to manage the students strictly.

414
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,300
You still haven't put them all away?

415
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,410
- I-Inspector, the Training Building is this way. 
 - H-Hey...

416
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,250
I-Inspector.

417
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,410
Stop right there.

418
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
M-Me?

419
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,240
Me?

420
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,290
Teacher, have we met before by chance?

421
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,490
You couldn't have.

422
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,300
She's a substitute teacher who just joined us.

423
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,530
I-I'm sorry. I don't remember...

424
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,790
Really? You look familiar.

425
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,580
Inspector, let's go to the Training Building.

426
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,140
We switched to equipment that meets the industry standards.

427
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,790
Ah, yes...

428
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,510
I-Inspector.

429
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,420
Inspector.

430
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,140
Everyone, leave except for this bastard.

431
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,400
Come out!

432
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,660
What are you doing?

433
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,850
Do you want to get beat up again?

434
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,720
I'm okay.

435
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,320
Give me that first.

436
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,130
F*** off.

437
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,440
Look at me. What are you looking at?

438
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,660
Did that guy just pushed Hyeon Woo?

439
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,960
It must've been a fluke.

440
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,300
Did we have a bastard like that in our class?

441
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Yoon Ga Min. No. 220?

442
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,690
No. 220. He's a total loser!

443
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,400
You son of a bitch.

444
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,640
No.

445
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,910
Apologize.

446
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,780
What?

447
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,370
Apologize to Se Hyeon.

448
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,120
Se Hyeon?

449
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,350
Who's that now?

450
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,790
Do you want to die, you bastard?

451
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,830
Don't pass out.

452
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,230
Apologize to Se Hyeon first.

453
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,220
Wake up.

454
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,460
Who's Se Hyeon?

455
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,240
I don't know.

456
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,020
 I want to study liberal arts. 

457
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,720
 You've got to be kidding me. 

458
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,890
 What would you do that for? 

459
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,400
 Will you... go to college or something? 

460
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,220
 He dozed off while studying. 

461
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:47,340
 I've never seen a Yuseong Tech student at the library. Seriously. 

462
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,270
 Ma'am. 
   

463
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,510
 Just a moment, please. 

464
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,810
 I'm sorry. This shouldn't have been thrown out. 

465
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,920
 It's my friend's. 

466
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,910
I'm sorry, Se Hyeon.

467
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,340
Your notebook...

468
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,070
Why are you doing this for this stupid thing?

469
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,990
You worked hard on keeping those notes.

470
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,000
It was so well-organized that it made me want to study.

471
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,300
- All your efforts were wasted. 
 - I'll do it.

472
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,760
- What? 
 - I said I'll join your study group.

473
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,420


474
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,050
Really?

475
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,190
   

476
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,780

♫  Just bring me closer and closer  ♫

490

♫  Run it off, I got my hoodie on me  ♫

491
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,390
♫  Let me go, let me go, let me go  ♫

492
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,830
♫  Cut it off, please, (Come ride with me) set me, oh, free  ♫

493
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,250
♫  Just bring me closer and closer  ♫

494
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,730
♫  Run it up, I got my hoodie on me  ♫

495
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,750
♫  And I'ma make it up from this hood   ♫

496
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,710
♫  From this hood  ♫

497
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,110
♫  Oh, yeah  ♫

498
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,950
♫  ln my whole life, I got my hoodie on  ♫

499
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,400
♫  Just don't take it serious though   ♫

500
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,980
♫  Uh, take a stab, mess with me, it's your losing move  ♫

501
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,500
♫  Let it out, inhale, nothing to exhale, just pass out  ♫

502
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,050
♫  I'm not interested in your childish gang fight  ♫

503
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,450
♫  But if you mess with me, you better calculate it right  ♫
