2
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,960
It's so tiring to achieve justice.

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,550
Assaulting for money, you mean.

4
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,580
Assaulting for money?

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,750
We're "No Reason" who help the weak and suffering people.

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,770
 If you bully the weak ones again, 

7
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,950
 I'll actually kill you. 

8
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,560
I don't like that name either.

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,290
Hey.

10
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,310
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

11
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,450
It's f***ing cool. "No Reason."

12
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,660
Not at all.

13
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,900
Hey.

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,970
Hey, by the way, do you know what the client sent

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,100
asking us to beat up his bully? 
    

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,120
What is it?

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,600
The client's dad is a college professor.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,330
He's having an affair with his student.

19
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,150
Geez, what a piece of trash.

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,540
I know he's furious,

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,390
but how could he sell his dad to beat up his bully?

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,000
He doesn't know what I'll do.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,410
What will you do?

24
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,210
- I'll send it. 
 - To whom?

25
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,480
The bastard who bullied him.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,330
You motherf***er. You're screwed.

27
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,630
You're so pathetic.

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,060
I can't get over how good the name is.

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,040
"No Reason."

30
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,910
There's no reason.

It's nothing.

51
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,960
Mom.

52
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,950
The thing is... I'm late because...

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,870
Hello.

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,620
Hi.

55
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,020
You weren't only late but kept your phone off, too?

56
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,910
Well, the battery—

57
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,460
You know what you promised, right?

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,410
Mom.

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,930
Get ready to be transferred tomorrow.

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,640
   

61
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,310
Your house is so nice.

62
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,880
Se Hyeon.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,410
Yes.

64
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,920
Take good care of the study group when I'm gone.

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,310
What are you talking about?

66
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,490
Is this because she said she'd get you transferred?

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,380
She won't actually do it.

68
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,170
She will.

69
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,110
If she said it, it will happen.

70
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,200
But still. It's easy to talk about it, but she won't just decide it like this.

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,410
She told me to prepare for it... because she'd actually do it.

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,810
She suddenly said to go to Gobi Desert mid-semester back in middle school.

73
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,170
She told me to prepare to travel to Mongolia, too.

74
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,020
It was the same when she said to cut ties with

75
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,720
the man who taught me Jeet Kune Do, too.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,890
And...

77
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,000
 Ga Min, 

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,770
 Mom and Dad will get divorced. 

79
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,910
 You should prepare for it. 

80
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,420
 - What? 
 - It's okay to be bad at studying. 

81
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,570
 I just... 

82
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,920
 want you to grow up to be a good person 

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,350
 without getting involved in anything bad. 

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,420
You're in this mess because of me.

85
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,320
It's not like that. I—

86
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,830
Stop chatting and go to sleep.

87
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,150
Okay. I'm sorry.

88
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,170
Here's a list of schools to transfer to. Look at it in the morning

89
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,450
and pick one you want.

90
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,980
It's too tight. I told you to sleep on the bed.

91
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,550
That's why I told you to sleep on the bed.

92
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,400
I find beds uncomfortable, I said.

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,110
I've never even slept on a bed before.

94
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,500
Hey, why didn't you say our homeroom teacher was your tutor?

95
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,970
Does it matter?

96
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,520
It's fascinating.

97
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,940
So, no one knows?

98
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,440
Probably.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,810
My mom doesn't know either.

100
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,220
I still don't understand you, by the way.

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,880
Your mother doesn't care about your grades.

102
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,040
It's not like you have to worry about money like me either.

103
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,340
Why are you so obsessed with studying?

104
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,510
Let's go to sleep.

105
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,230
What?

106
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,980
What is it?

107
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,580
Hey, what is it?

108
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,730
 Ga Min, 

109
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,640
 do you know how great of an achievement your father made? 

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,470
 Are you planning to follow his path? 

111
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,860
   

112
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,680
 Stop giving him false hope. 

113
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,580
 Only geniuses like you can do things easily. 

114
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,510
 Ga Min can't. 

115
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,590
It's a very sad thing when people...

116
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,970
have no hopes for you.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,740
 Welcome home— 

118
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,200
 You bastard. Won't you make money? 

119
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,130
 I told you to come to the site and learn the job. 

120
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,360
 Is that really that hard? 

121
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,880
Yes.

122
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,640
You're right.

123
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,630
It's very sad that I can't be in the study group anymore,

124
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,040
but I don't regret going back to you today.

125
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,520
Okay.

126
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,230
Thank you.

127
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,780
   

128
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,480
Is he really leaving?

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,810
No way.

130
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,140
That's why he should've joined us for tteokbokki yesterday.

131
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,690
We don't know what will happen yet.

132
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,600
They're even talking to the principal.

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,610
- Where are we? 
 - The principal's office.

134
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,060
It's Yuseong Tech High, where the kids with the lowest grades are.

135
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,520
So?

136
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,660
Would any school in Ancheon welcome a student from Yuseong Tech High?

137
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,510
General high schools have a curriculum different from ours.

138
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,020
It's not easy to process the transfer.

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,120
For specialized schools, technical schools, and seafood and shipping schools

140
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,280
have different training. So, it's the same.

141
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,880
The only option is another technical high school.

142
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,070
Seongdo High-tech High. That's the only one.

143
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,900
It'd be over if he transferred there.

144
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,750
Did you forget? His grades.

145
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,800
Yoon Ga Min does it again.

146
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,880
He made a plan for a situation like this.

147
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,370
I've never been relieved that he gets poor grades.

148
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,200
I know. He's actually smart.

149
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,500
Huh?

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,320
Huh?

151
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,300
Gosh, his mother looks pissed off.

152
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,500
I said it won't be easy.

153
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,900
We can move to Seoul if there's no school in Ancheon.

154
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,540
- Seoul? 
  - Yes, I'm looking for an apartment. 

155
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,010
Isn't she calling a realtor?

156
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,500
- I didn't expect this. 
 - You guys, do something.

157
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,100
Shouldn't we go persuade her?

158
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,050
We need to prove that we aren't bad kids first.

159
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,780
I hate math proofs.

160
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,360
How about this? I'll fall from the third floor by accident

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,810
and you guys will save me.

162
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,240
- Crazy bastard. 
 - You do that alone.

163
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,780
Lee Ji Woo, you can't swear like that in front of her.

164
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,690
Crazy bastard. Who do you think I am?

165
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,680
- Don't swear like that. 
 - When did I do that?

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,590
Guys!

167
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,220
Shit. Stop him.

168
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,000
They don't replace the windows that broke from a fight.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,550
They toss cigarette butts on the floor,

170
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,370
but no teacher says anything. This is...

171
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,910
no longer a school.

172
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,000
Where did Ms. Lee go? She won't answer her phone either.

173
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,590
Hello.

174
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Do you have something to say?

175
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,830
Yes, ma'am. Well...

176
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Se Hyeon, this kid gets excellent grades.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,390
Second highest in the school.

178
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,200
He's so smart that he explains difficult questions so easily.

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,580
What does that have to do with this?

180
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,490
- Pardon? 
 - School grades aren't so meaningful to me.

181
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,540
Oh, I see.

182
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,060
We need Ga Min!

183
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,800
Hello, I'm Lee Joon, Ga Min's rival.

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,530
I'll learn a lot from him and become the strongest man in Yuseong Tech High—

185
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,350
Guys, Ms. Lee is almost here.

186
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,800
- Let's buy more time. 
 - Okay.

187
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Ji Woo, you...

188
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,100
To be honest, I have Ga Min's baby—

189
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,900
Just leave, Mom.

190
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,600
Baby?

191
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,660
Is that true?

192
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,070
You told me to buy time.

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,400
 She's here. 

194
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,080
- Thank you. 
 - Ms. Lee.

195
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,460
They just left, Ms. Lee.

196
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,060
- Already? 
 - She called a realtor.

197
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,920
If she signs a contract for a place...

198
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,650
Is there anything we could do?

199
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,340
You know her well.

200
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,900
I do.

201
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,320
- She knows his mom well? 
 - That's why it's even more hopeless.

202
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,300
She used to tutor him.

203
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,000
She's not like anyone else.

204
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,330
But... it doesn't mean we should give up.

205
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
What's this?

206
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,800
Ms. Lee wanted to give you that earlier.

207
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
Ms. Lee Han Kyeong?

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,920
Yes, Ms. Lee.

209
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,020
Is she insane?

210
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,900
Where's she?

211
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,690
I'll sign the contract now.

212
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,060
 You don't want to see the place? 

213
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,500
No, I don't need to see it.

214
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,900
I'll see you later.

215
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,910
   

216
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,010
 Four-eyed Psycho, we're behind you. 

217
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,990
What?

218
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,200
Huh?

219
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, it's nothing.

220
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,000

Geez, why is he flipping out now?

Get out of the way!

F***. Be quiet, okay?

248
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,530
- Kang Tae Oh? 
 - It's K-Kang Tae Oh.

I'm sorry, but you can't go any further than this.

How dare he do this to Ms. Lee?

Gosh, you're f***ing hilarious. Seriously.

252
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,250
What? Do you want Yoon Ga Min, the current No. 1, to get transferred quickly?

253
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,900
Because you can't fight him properly?

254
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,300
Shut up, you f***er.

255
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,640
Hey, Yoon Ga Min has inhuman abilities, you son of a bitch.

Nice excuse.

257
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,400
By the way,

258
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,600
you can't be No. 1 even if he transferred.

259

What the f*** are you saying?

260

Because I'm the second strongest.

You can't get out of this place like that.

Huh? What about you?

280

I'm okay. Don't worry about me and go.

Crazy bastard. Don't act cool.

you're trying to do something on your own.

You think you can?

 S***. 

318
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,860
 What? 

319
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,330
 You tried to join the backup fighters, too. 

320
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,710
 Why do you obsess over the fighting ranking so much? 

321
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,050
 To be honest, 

322
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,670
 I'm not obsessing over the ranking. 

323
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,050
 I just want to reunite with a friend I can only meet 

324
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,570
 by becoming stronger. 

325
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,830
 Come to the playground tomorrow.

 "Uncle's forbidden techniques"? 

328

 Even the title makes my heart pound. 

329
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,190
 - Go ahead and pick one. 
 - I pick all 10. 

330
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,150
 No. Pick just one for self-defense. 

331
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,820
 I'll choose this one. 

332
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,900
 - Why? 
 - It has all the cool words in it. 

333
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,360
Come back,

334
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,540
my friend, Yoon Ga Min.

335
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,240
The Big Boss Dragon...

336
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,050
 I'll choose this one. 
   

337
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,420
   

338
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,320
   

339
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,580
Kick!

340
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,320
Geez, seriously.

341
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,860
What the heck, you idiot?

342
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,760
Yes. 
    

343
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,360
They're almost here.

344
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,180
- Welcome. 
 - Ma'am!

345
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,900
I'm not pregnant.

346
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,610
You're mistaken.

347
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,650
Ma'am, please don't transfer Ga Min.

348
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,310
Did you follow us all the way here?

349
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,920
Yes.

350
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,180
I don't know what you think of them,

351
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,050
but they're my friends I'm grateful for.

352
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,800
Long time no see, Ma'am.

353
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm sorry I never introduced myself.

354
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,700
I'm Lee Han Kyeong, the homeroom teacher of Class 4, 10th Grade.

355
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,530
Han Kyeong?

356
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,480
You became Ga Min's homeroom teacher. Congratulations.

357
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,980
Thank you, Ms. Jeon.

358
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Looks like it's going pretty well.

359
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,630
It might go better than we expected.

360
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,170
I hope that's true.

361
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,420
By the way, we'll say goodbye as soon as we reunite.

362
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,580
Pardon?

363
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,210
Even though you became Ga Min's homeroom teacher,

364
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,380
I want him to avoid a violent environment as his parent.

365
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,530
You can call me a tiger mom.

366
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,680
If being called that lets Ga Min avoid danger,

367
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,520
I'd prefer that.

368
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,440
So...

369
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,130
please leave.

370
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,530
It was nice to see you again.

371
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,860
Why do you have to avoid it?

372
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,930
You told me to fight injustice and change things.

373
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,980
   

374
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,910
 Isn't the... 

375
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,090
 Teacher Certification Exam interview happening today? 

376
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,660
 Are you giving up? 

377
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,210
 I wanted to be like Ms. Woo Jeong Hwa. 

378
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,540
 But nothing matters anymore. 

379
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,740
 We can't see her anymore, 

380
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,470
 but we can see what she used to see. 

381
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,420
 How about you become a teacher like that on her behalf? 

382
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,240
I came to this school because of what you said then.

383
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
You're right. Yuseong Tech High isn't a good school.

384
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,500
I know I shouldn't stop Ga Min from studying in a better environment, too.

385
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,800
But... the kids want it so badly.

386
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,080
Can't you trust them just this once?

387
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,210
Ga Min and the kids created a study group on their own, too.

388
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,610
It will become a good school one day because of kids like them.

389
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,410
I'll make sure of it, too.

390
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,490
 I'll go to Yuseong Technical High School. 

391
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,760
 I'll improve my grades there and go to college. 

392
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,840
 I said you don't have to go to college. 

393
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,670
 Isn't Ga Min in a study group? 

394
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,010
 You know how shy he is. 

395
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,770
 Ga Min and the kids created... 

396
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,040
 a study group on their own, too. 

397
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,740
 We need Ga Min! 

398
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,550
 Please don't transfer Ga Min. 

399
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,590
If so—

400
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,550
Hey, have you seen this?

401
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,730
It's amazing. The vice principal is terrified.

402
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,060
Isn't that teacher acting out too much? 
    

403
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,180
How about you let No Reason take care of it?

404
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,290
I'll give you...

405
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,310
Will you... do it again?

406
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,600
Like that teacher last year?

407
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,750
Get out, everyone! We're closed!

408
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,580
Get out!

409
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,120
Get out!

410
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,750
Lock the door.

411
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,960
Hey, my friends from the study group.

412
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,730
I don't need you guys.

413
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,840
Okay.

414
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,740
Hey, Lee Han Kyeong? Let's talk.

415
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,300
"Hey, Lee Han Kyeong"?

416
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,510
How dare you talk to her like that?

417
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,380
Ga Min's mother. She's still here.

418
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,160
I don't know who you guys are,

419
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,220
but I'm talking to a parent now.

420
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,420
Wait outside.

421
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,860
Should we continue our conversation, Ms. Jeon?

422
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,760
Okay.

423
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,850
F***ing hell!

424
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,810
I almost left because you scared me.

425
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,770
Is it because of Pi Han Wool?

426
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,810
Because I filed a petition with the Education Department?

427
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,230
That's probably why.

428
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,410
Guys, if you want to steal someone's time urgently,

429
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,770
you ask for understanding.

430
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,830
You don't threaten them.

431
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,440
Okay?

432
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,400
You aren't willing to come with us, right?

433
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,630
Yeonbaek Gang will cover you for everything that's about to happen here.

434
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,400
Let's go, guys.

435
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,810
What's with that lady?

436
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,670
I'm a very unhappy parent, you bastards.

437
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,820
   

438
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,380
His mother is that good?

439
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,500
I knew it.

440
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Ms. Lee, you matured a lot.

441
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,350
Jeong Hwa would be happy.

442
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,740
I called you "Han Kyeong" like I used to.

443
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,660
I need to teach you kids a thing or two.

445
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,690
Don't go home and tell your moms.

446
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,600
It'd be a headache to have moms fight each other.

447
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,920
Stand back, Hee Won.

448
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,880
 Mom, she's Lee Ji Woo from our study group. 

449
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,540
 She never fights for fun. 

450
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,570
 She dreams of becoming a teacher like Ms. Lee. 

451
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,090
 She must do Judo. 

452
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,170
 Yes, just as a hobby. 

453
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,370
Hold still! Hold still!

454
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,840
 That's Kim Se Hyeon, as you know. 

455
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,830
 He might look irritable, but he's actually friendly. 

456
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,880
 He's a top student, too. 

457
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,390
 The other one is Choi Hee Won, who's shy but odd at times. 

458
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,930
 She's affectionate and loyal, too. 

459
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,700
 She did seem kind of odd. 

460
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,440
 And there's a kid named Lee Joon, who's surprisingly diligent. 

461
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,310
 You managed to get a lot of members at that school. 

462
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,560
 Yes. I'm so grateful to all of them. 

463
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,430
So close.

464
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,910
 Hello? Hello? Ms. Lee! 
   

465
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,520
Ms. Jeon.

466
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,920
Ms. Jeon!

467
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,800
Ga Min!

468
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,960
Hey, Yoon Ga Min. Come here.

469
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,540
This is something new.

470
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,760
I get you're angry because your mom got injured yesterday,

471
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,750
but don't overdo it.

472
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,100
This is a sacred school.

473
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,330
 This is an announcement from the broadcasting station. 

474
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,300
 All students must assemble in the gymnasium. 

475
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,790
Beat him moderately so he can visit his mom at the hospital.

476
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,850
Is he that bastard who acts cheeky at school these days?

477
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,730
You can go downstairs.

478
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,440
Why would we gang up on him?

479
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,550
We aren't some lowly thugs.

480
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,050
Okay, then. Don't kill him.

481
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,620
Where are you going?

482
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,210
Come here.

483
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,540
I'll end you all at once.

484
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,370
 Isn't it obvious? 

485
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,070
 Pi Han Wool must've told them to. 

486
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,010
 Him again? 

487
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,010
 It must be because Ms. Lee filed a petition to the Education Department. 

488
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,550
 I don't know what it was about, but didn't she do that for the school? 

489
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,270
 So? Will you attack him or something? 

490
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,230
 I can't just let this slide. 

491
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,900
 Even you can't get to him. 

492
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,350
 Pi Han Wool's three security guards, the Three Choels of Yeonseo. 

493
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,240
   

494
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,800
 When they block a blow, they hit twice. 

495
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,260
 When they block two blows, they hit three times. That's what they do. 

496
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,310
 Out of the three, Kim Soon Cheol is the special one. 

497
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,620
 He was brought in by Pi Han Wool because of his fighting skills. 

498
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,230
I expected more because I heard you destroyed the scouter.

499
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,580
But I'm disappointed.

500
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,290
Did you think you were good enough to fight the three of us?

501
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,490
Don't try to challenge Han Wool and behave yourself.

502
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,440
 It's hard to focus because your heart beats, right? 

503
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,760
 How did you know? 

504
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,810
 You call that "agitated." 

505
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,890
 Agitated? 

506
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,830
 You get affected by something... 
   

507
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:59,620
 and you become a fool with a beating heart. 

508
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,380
 But feeling agitated alone won't let you beat anyone. 

509
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,520
Huh? That bastard is getting up again.

510
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,620
He wants more?

511
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,880
F***. You can't even fight us individually, you punk.

512
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,430
 A third-class person's water glass overflows. 

513
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,190
 A second-class person's water glass is still. 

514
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,950
 And... 

515
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,990
 a first-class person empties their water glass. 

516
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,680
I told you to come because I can beat you all.

517

♫  These stupid ones have no basics, I'm ready to fight right  ♫

521
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
He calmed down.

522

 the backpacker   ♫

540

The secret to winning is actually simple.

541
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,710
It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

542
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,560
Wait!

543
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,370
It's not over yet!

544
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,830
   

545
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,340

547
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,880
 Is it my fault? 

548
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,490
 If I left Se Hyeon alone that day 

549
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,890
 and made it home before the curfew... 

550
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,890
 Hello. 

551
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,300
 - Hey, what's that? 
 - If this is destroyed, you'll no longer— 

552
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,510
 If only I didn't want to start a study group at this school... 

553
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,800
 I'll go to Yuseong Technical High School. 

554
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,480
 If I didn't come to this school at all, 

555
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,020
 these things wouldn't have happened. Right? 

556
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,570
 We'll protect the students who fall victim to them first. 

557
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,460
 Regardless of who they might be. 

558
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,610
 But there's nothing wrong with helping a friend and studying at school. 

559

560
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,980
