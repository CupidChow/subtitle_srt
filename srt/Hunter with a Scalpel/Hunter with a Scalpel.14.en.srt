SUPERVISION OF GUARDIANS AND EXPERTS

7
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:04,093
I am a strong suspect
Yongcheon serial murder case...

8
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:07,664
as well as people who know the original
perpetrator of six mutilation cases...

9
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:12,940
which has been happening since
1999 until 2004 and remains a mystery.

10
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,139
I am the daughter of Yoon Jo-kyun.

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,865
Then I for five years since
I'm five to ten years old...

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,080
I became an assistant who tidied up
the body of murder victim Yoon Jo-kyun.

13
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,518
As my birth which was never recorded...

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,092
as long as I live together
Yoon Jo-kyun in Haryong...

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,100
I didn't get a proper education
and only live in box cars or containers.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,052
Cleaning and re-stitching the corpse
that had been mutilated by him...

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,569
and live everyday
life as an abandoned child.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,405
Then during those five years, Yoon Jo-kyun
has committed five cases of mutilation...

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
which does not include the Tong mutilation
case Cheongun Harbor Blue September 1999.

20
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:59,206
He is the perpetrator of the dumping
case Ancheon City Garbage September 2000...

21
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:03,120
the White Tiger Amusement Park
case Haeryeong in February 2001...

22
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:07,200
Cheonhae Island Pier case,
Jinyang, in September 2003...

23
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:11,842
the case of Mount Seoram is
near Taean City in February 2004...

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,120
and the case of Unseo Valley
Hamyeong City in February 2004.

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Here are five cases
resulting from his actions.

26
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:25,655
He also did a number of unsolved murders...

27
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:29,998
and throw away the seven his
body on the Seohaean Expressway.

28
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,880
My desire to capture
Yoon Jo-kyun immediately...

29
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:38,760
made me falsify that report
should not be done by a forensic doctor.

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,672
Because of this, the attack incident occurred
towards the responsible investigator.

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,648
From where I stand...

32
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:53,840
I convey my apologies to the
investigation team and other victims.

33
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:09,920
Final.

34
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:14,920
There is a girl who was
captured by Yoon Jo-kyun.

35
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,160
He's not even as tall as my
shoulder. and uses the name Se-eun.

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,570
His exact age is unknown.

37
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,890
But it is estimated to be ten years old.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
That boy...

39
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:32,200
must be saved.

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,800
Just like me at that time,
he never went to school...

41
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,789
and don't know what a friend is.

42
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,039
He just knows...

43
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:48,888
Older brother.

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,906
His father is a murderer
is everything in his life.

45
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:56,982
Please help.

46
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:03,055
If anyone sees a girl with messy
hair and riding in a white box car...

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,922
please report immediately.

48
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:09,963
HUNTER WITH A SCALPEL

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,533
I'm grateful.

50
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,287
EPISODE 14

51
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm afraid you can't wake
up again, Chairman Jung.

52
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Chang-jin is also very confused.

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,652
It's my first time too
see Chang-jin like that.

54
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:26,546
His hands were shaking as he called out to
you, "Chairman Jung, Chairman Jung", like this.

55
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,075
When did I start shaking like that?

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,976
You are too much.

57
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,138
You even cried, right?

58
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:35,163
You're such a jerk.

59
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:39,672
By the way, did you see
Doctor Seo's press conference?

60
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes.

61
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:46,724
But, because of Yoon Jo-kyun's existence
it's still unclear at this point...

62
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:50,133
this is not necessarily a
confession which benefits Doctor Seo.

63
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,090
In fact, this can be considered as
concrete evidence that they are conspiring.

64
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:55,881
Correct.

65
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:59,812
As he has admitted before helped
Yoon Jo-kyun's crimes in the past...

66
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,614
there will be many who think
they were in cahoots from the start.

67
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,144
What if Jo-kyun's kidnapping
was show to disperse attention?

68
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:10,078
Such a possibility cannot be ignored.

69
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,541
We have to make sure
credibility in his confession.

70
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,922
There are many mean comments saying,
he seeks sympathy through the child.

71
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,664
Don't read.

72
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,321
The child must be saved.

73
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:27,523
If you see a girl with hair tangled
and riding in a white box car...

74
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:32,039
please report immediately.

75
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,259
But...

76
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:47,320
He was serious about the child.

77
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,482
That day...

78
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:55,765
Doctor Seo held on
tightly the child's hand.

79
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,348
Dad, the food is ready.

80
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:31,605
Where did Mr. Choi go? that is not healthy?

81
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,517
You're right.

82
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,092
The house and laundry
were completely empty.

83
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:41,336
A gentle and caring person for sure
so traumatized that I couldn't go home.

84
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:44,151
Oh my gosh, it's you.

85
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,715
Later he will also go home alone.

86
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:49,098
He also did not close his business.

87
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,832
This is not the time.

88
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,238
The weather is cold and
his body could get sicker.

89
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll make him some oxtail soup.

90
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,559
Oh my gosh, the boss of this shop.

91
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:06,637
Mr. Choi should know how caring he is.

92
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Base.

93
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Short news.

94
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:13,241
Seo Se-hyun, alleged murder
suspect Yongcheon chain lately...

95
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,785
gave shocking testimony
at a press conference...

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,479
which makes the murder case
This chain is entering a new stage.

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,723
Police determine Yoon Jo-kyun...

98
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,441
as Seo Se-hyun's accomplice
who is a suspect in this case...

99
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,378
and is being publicly searched.

100
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:33,389
For 20 years Yoon Jo-kyun faked
his identity becomes someone else...

101
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:39,436
and is currently known to be opening a laundry
in Yongcheon under the name Choi Min-guk.

102
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,321
Yoon Jo-kyun stabs...

103
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,447
Oh my gosh, Boss Matna!

104
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,239
Oh my gosh, Boss Matna?

105
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,073
Geez.

106
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,576
Oh my gosh, wake up!

107
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:46,783
Boss Matna!

108
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,340
Oh my gosh, why is this?

109
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:49,251
Boss Matna!

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,241
Come here quickly when you're done.

111
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,795
Are you a detective? What
are you guarding there for?

112
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Pack.

113
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,975
There has never been a case as hot as this.

114
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:01,356
All the evidence is there and the
perpetrator's puzzle will be complete.

115
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:04,706
This is not bait anymore.

116
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,126
You can't feel it?

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
Just wait and see. Okay?

118
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,112
WANTED MURDER SUSPECTS
Instead of small news...

119
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:15,029
this one big news
will be very profitable.

120
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:18,129
I will contact you again later.

121
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,864
Okay, I'll hang up.

122
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,560
Basically, it's just frustrating.

123
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,902
Excuse me, I want to pass by.

124
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Yes, please come in.

125
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:54,630
If the statement you said
until now is the true evidence...

126
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,932
we need real evidence.

127
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:58,418
If you need proof...

128
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,543
look for a white box
car that he was driving.

129
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:06,464
All the corpses he destroyed
done in the cargo bed of the car.

130
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:07,964
We will refer to it.

131
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,770
Thank you for being so
long want to work together.

132
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:17,779
Chairman Hong.

133
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:21,624
What is Yoon Jo-kyun's whereabouts?
And the child is already known?

134
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:26,316
They are currently the target of an investigation.
I can't share the contents of the case.

135
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,502
But, we are doing it's
best to look for them.

136
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,691
Of course, because we also
prioritizing your safety...

137
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:37,771
No.

138
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,449
Please loosen the security around me.

139
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,309
I don't want security.

140
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,254
But it made Yoon Jo-kyun look for me.

141
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,685
It's not an ordinary watch.

142
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,160
It's a special hour...

143
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,324
who can call someone when you need help.

144
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,040
Who is coming?

145
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:30,377
Father?

146
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,574
The person you really want to meet.

147
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,263
CREAM BREAD, COLORED
PENCIL, STRAWBERRY MILK

148
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:33,640
Already up?

149
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,440
How is your body?

150
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,002
It can be moved now.

151
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,600
What is this? Have you started work?

152
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,760
Take a break when really need to rest.

153
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I go first.

154
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,433
JUNG X HYUN

155
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,341
Alright, the press conference is over.

156
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,592
I have already given permission to Doctor
Seo Se-hyun and Chairman Jung speaks.

157
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,040
You can wait.

158
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,692
How is your body condition?

159
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,873
I will recover soon.

160
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
About this?

161
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,640
I don't mind.

162
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:29,640
As long as I can catch him,
this is no problem for me.

163
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,630
The watch I gave...

164
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,960
you should use it.

165
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,285
That way we can save you faster.

166
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,360
I gave it to the child.

167
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,381
He might need it because he have
a lot of things in common with me.

168
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,480
I've seen this too.

169
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:03,778
Actually, I think You
were a genius since birth.

170
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:07,982
But after seeing this, your
writing is similar to mine...

171
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,133
Excuse me.

172
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,987
Sorry for what?

173
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,445
PLAYING WATER WITH BROTHER

174
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,554
The days written here...

175
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,820
is the happiest time.

176
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,175
Se-eun, Big Sis is home!

177
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:41,346
How to write, count,
and make a diary too...

178
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
I learned it from my brother.

179
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,600
For me who can't leave the house...

180
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:51,058
brother is the only one
friends and everything to me.

181
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,776
That's why I want to follow
everything that Brother does.

182
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,280
In my eyes, Sis Eun-seo...

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,089
is a person who always shining brightly.

184
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,214
Then slowly...

185
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm starting to hate
going out with that guy.

186
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,503
Of course he does too
feel myself changing...

187
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,972
and thought that it
was because of Big Brother.

188
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,120
Until one day...

189
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:27,894
On my tenth birthday...

190
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:30,706
he knows the meaning
of overseas service.

191
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:35,753
The older sister was shocked and
ran away with me without a plan.

192
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:40,042
But because I can't go far, in the end...

193
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,680
After burying my brother
on the hill near the house...

194
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,840
I collapsed beside him.

195
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,120
When I was almost dead...

196
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,520
I didn't mean to found by a climber.

197
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:04,972
Then I met my mother at the
orphanage where I was placed.

198
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,120
If you think about it...

199
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm a pretty lucky kid.

200
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:29,641
Jo-kyun won't let me go.

201
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:34,680
He will respond in various ways,
because I am known everywhere.

202
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,487
Instead of Yoon Jo-kyun...

203
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:41,540
you are more worrying
about the kid, right?

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,680
I have an older brother and a mother.

205
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,387
But he has no one.

206
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,472
This time, please don't
you finish it alone.

207
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:01,722
I will be with you.

208
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:44,602
Follow me.

209
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:52,913
This time, please don't
you finish it alone.

210
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
Doctor Seo.

211
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,327
Are you alright?

212
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Yes.

213
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,942
I want to see Chairman Jung for a moment.

214
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Where's Se-eun?

215
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:22,918
What's this?

216
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,609
What was your first word to Dad?
Braving danger, come to help you?

217
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:33,124
I asked where Se-eun was.

218
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,343
Press conference time...

219
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,421
Why do you keep on missed Jung-mi's case?

220
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,593
Why?

221
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:54,327
My daughter sent me a signal.

222
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,491
Asking for help.

223
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,507
Don't joke, I'm fed up.

224
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,624
Tell me where Se-eun is.

225
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,030
Downstairs, in the car.

226
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:18,507
Lie.

227
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,632
See for yourself with me.

228
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:25,883
Hey.

229
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,940
Even though this is an order
from the joint team leader...

230
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,718
can we do this?

231
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:32,710
No problem, right?

232
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,374
Please check if Seo Se-hyun already back.

233
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,851
Call Se-eun and tell her to come up here.

234
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,210
You really care to Se-eun apparently.

235
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,312
But, how, huh?

236
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,413
If you don't go with me now...

237
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,359
Se-eun will die...

238
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,710
with your mother.

239
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,054
You go to Chairman Jung's room.

240
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:08,913
I will go to the CCTV room.

241
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,994
This is the last chance.

242
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:19,586
Make up your mind.

243
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,327
What is it?

244
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:40,687
No...

245
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,874
Are you done with your business?

246
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:45,244
Yes.

247
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:54,874
Hurry back.

248
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:06,937
Base.

249
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:09,942
You think I can't get
in because it was blocked?

250
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,788
Nothing could be as great as this if
possible interviewing Seo Se-hyun now.

251
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,491
You guys are such a nuisance.

252
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:20,780
If I stay here...

253
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,077
I must have some big news.

254
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,912
Gosh, this is exhausting.

255
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Damn it.

256
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:39,382
YOON JO KYUN

257
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,601
I got a big fish.

258
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:54,960
YONGCHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

259
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,749
If you need proof...

260
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:24,004
look for a white box
car that he was driving.

261
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:28,760
All the corpses he destroyed
done in the cargo bed of the car.

262
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,768
From the results of the examination
based on Seo Se-hyun's testimony...

263
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,413
date and time of the incident...

264
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,952
serial murder case
one and two in Yongcheon...

265
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,437
it has been confirmed
according to his alibi.

266
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,820
He also passed a lie detector test.

267
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,878
Therefore, from now on you must
trying to find traces of Yoon Jo-kyun...

268
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:50,679
and the child along
with the white box car.

269
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,560
It's been several days since we
looking for the car via CCTV...

270
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:58,546
on escape routes and toll gates around
the pharmacy, but couldn't find anything.

271
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,249
If he uses a stolen car plate number...

272
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:03,880
then it's no use chase by plate number.

273
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,050
The scope of the
investigation has expanded.

274
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,734
Isn't there a possibility that
he move after dumping the car?

275
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,390
There's no way he's going
to throw his car away.

276
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,476
It's not an ordinary car.

277
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:18,000
But a private office for his actions.

278
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:23,538
These are the locations of the
six cold cases what Doctor Seo said.

279
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:27,484
These cases are all happened
between Mujin and Haryong.

280
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:30,640
In other words, it happened
along the Seohaean Expressway.

281
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,114
If Seohaean Expressway...

282
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,280
maybe he's going to run away
via passenger smuggling routes?

283
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,555
I think so too.

284
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:39,469
And if that's true...

285
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,309
There.
YEONGPO

286
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:45,164
Most likely he is planning
to escape to that area.

287
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:48,648
In that case, we should check
ship owners who have a history...

288
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:51,249
smuggling passengers around Yeongpo.

289
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:52,749
Yes.

290
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:56,199
Seo Se-hyun will be out from
the hospital in three days.

291
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,804
And because the detention will directly
handed over to the prosecutor's office...

292
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:03,960
we have to catch Yoon Jo-kyun or
got proof of murder within 72 hours.

293
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,054
Seventy two hours...

294
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:11,413
I say it again.

295
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,577
We don't have time.

296
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,491
We have to catch Yoon Jo-kyun.

297
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,560
Don't leave the house
without Dad's permission.

298
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:45,711
Unlucky.

299
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,120
Where is he going?

300
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,034
Could it be that he already realized it?

301
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,707
Unlucky.

302
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:01,510
Excuse me.

303
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,497
Did you see anyone get out of that car?

304
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:04,616
I don't see.

305
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,920
MINIMARKET OF LUCKY

306
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,839
Because of this, it
happened attack incident...

307
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:27,214
towards investigators responsible.

308
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,645
From where I stand...

309
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,253
I convey my apologies to the
investigation team and other victims.

310
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,202
Final.

311
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,167
There is a girl who was
captured by Yoon Jo-kyun.

312
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,721
He's not even as tall as my shoulder...

313
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,056
I want to pay.

314
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,000
And uses the name Se-eun.

315
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,971
His exact age is unknown.

316
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,160
But it is estimated to be ten years old.

317
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,596
If anyone sees a girl with messy
hair and riding in a white box car...

318
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,807
please report immediately.

319
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,042
That boy...

320
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,425
- Ten year old girl... - Damn, where is he?

321
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,191
Yoon Se-eun, tall about 120-130 cm...

322
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,853
He shouldn't be too far away.

323
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,635
And has a thin build.

324
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,487
If you see a girl with messy hair style...

325
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,577
Could that be the child in question?

326
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:28,087
Good.

327
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,003
I got the direction exactly right.

328
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:33,516
The heavens are helping me apparently.

329
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:35,989
I can get a billion.

330
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,061
If you don't go with me now...

331
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,573
Se-eun will die with your mother.

332
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,956
This is the last chance.

333
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Make up your mind.

334
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,284
Se-eun, let's go home.

335
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,573
Se-eun!

336
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:13,909
Se-eun, what's wrong with you?

337
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,533
Se-eun!

338
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:18,565
- Se-eun, come on quickly.
- Let us go home!

339
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,660
Se-eun, come here.

340
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,573
Se-eun, come on quickly.

341
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,182
Se-eun.

342
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,035
Come back to Father.

343
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,971
Dad said, don't go far.

344
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,120
Dad, don't be like this.

345
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:43,387
Father?

346
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,604
Where is your father?
