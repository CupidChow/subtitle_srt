YOON SE EUN

9
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,353
Right, that's how it does it.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,400
When it's finished...

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,191
put your hands together
like this and close your eyes.

12
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,503
Then say goodbye from the heart.

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,122
Goodbye.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,123
Goodbye.

LAST EPISODE

17
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Unlucky.

18
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:21,995
This is literally an autopsy room.

19
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,093
He brought his equipment too.

20
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,350
Call the joint team and
ask to check it directly.

21
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:33,632
Yes, I understand.

22
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Se-eun.

23
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,431
Father...

24
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,866
Dad loves you very much.

25
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,956
You've arrived.

26
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:56,194
Have you been waiting long?

27
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,194
This place hasn't changed.

28
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,733
Looks like it's there?

29
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,960
The place where we buried Jung-mi.

30
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:12,572
Yes.

31
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,514
Yoon Jo-kyun's box car has been found.

32
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,347
But there is no Se-eun here.

33
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,033
Save me.

34
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,765
Please save me.

35
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,572
It's not an ordinary clock.

36
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,958
But special hours...

37
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,004
who can call someone when you need it.

38
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,879
Se-eun...

39
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,847
you killed?

40
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,926
Is he that important?

41
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,240
The sea breeze felt very cold.

42
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,130
Let's go, Dad has prepared the
boat. and we start a new beginning.

43
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,333
Why should I come?

44
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,385
There are police everywhere because of you.

45
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,524
Not because of me, but you.

46
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:41,908
And you?

47
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,248
What's the difference with you?

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,153
Is it just because of you?
Talk on television broadcast...

49
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:54,392
you think they will believe
and understand what you say?

50
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:59,678
Who is with you? when you pry...

51
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,279
picking, sewing, and cutting it?

52
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,861
That damn detective?

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,591
Or your crazy mother?

54
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,438
I.

55
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Only me!

56
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,053
The one by your side.

57
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:17,558
You are special.

58
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,537
You are different from other humans.

59
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,733
Only Father can
understand your specialness.

60
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:25,483
Who loves you.

61
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,358
Who do you think is left by your side?

62
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,319
Eventually...

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,458
only me.

64
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:39,615
Understand me?

65
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:44,904
Love me?

66
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,356
More than that.

67
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,976
It hurts a lot, right?

68
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,336
Is Doctor Seo's location known?

69
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:03,243
We can only confirm he
exited the Mujin toll gate...

70
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,525
and got a report from a ship owner
around Mujin who was found murdered.

71
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,649
Estimated to have died an hour ago.

72
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,017
We got a recording of the call on his
phone. If Yoon Jo-kyun orders two seats...

73
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,556
and we are asking
Haean police assistance.

74
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,833
If so, from the start he
doesn't care about Se-eun.

75
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:22,420
Most likely so.

76
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,551
If there wasn't that kid in the box car...

77
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,756
Jo-kyun for sure throw it around there.

78
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,966
I leave the search to you your
team and you join here directly.

79
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,760
I have to go.

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,188
If I don't go, proof or...

81
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:37,179
Se-eun's body will never be found.

82
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,258
Chairman Jung, did you hear me?

83
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:48,961
There is a big button on the right, right?

84
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,135
Another button will appear if you press it.

85
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:56,480

Wait a moment.

Se-eun, where are you?

123
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,305

124
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520

00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,457
Se-eun!

132
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Yoon Se...

133
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,477
Se-eun!

134
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,426
No.

135
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Senior Chang Jin.

136
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,303
Senior Jeon!

137
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,961
He's still moving.

138
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,016
Se-eun?

139
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:00,808
Did you hear Uncle's voice?

140
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,344
I...

141
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,420
Brother Se-hyun's friend.

142
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,461
You know him, right?

143
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,349
Brother Se-hyun...

144
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,543
asking me to save you.

145
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,076
Therefore, you must not sleep.

146
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,458
Do you think...

147
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,461
I will die before you?

148
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,702
Don't worry.

149
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,461
I don't inject drugs with the dose you use.

150
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,704
Still many...

151
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,868
what I want to do.

152
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,462
From now on...

153
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:49,766
I will cut open your stomach
with the way you taught me.

154
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,260
Cut open your stomach and
take out all your organs.

155
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:59,547
Then the eyeballs, tongue,
and finally the skin membrane.

156
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,110
The order is correct, right?

157
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,368
Do you hear my voice?

158
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,230
Seo Se Hyun!

159
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,946
Seo Se-hyun, don't do that!

160
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,813
Seo Se Hyun!

161
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,192
Se-eun, congratulations!

162
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:46,807
Chairman Jung found it!

163
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Take it easy!

164
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:50,765
Se-eun is still alive.

165
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,681
Se-eun is still alive.

166
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,954
Thank you for having let Se-eun live.

167
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,586
If there's something I
want to be proud of...

168
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,711
I will meet you with Se-eun.

169
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,437
Because of that...

170
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:19,720
which made Father suffer the most.

171
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,998
It's a muscle relaxant.

172
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,571
It is not life threatening.

173
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,431
Known cases as The Tailor Case...

174
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,375
and had caused a stir
country for the last 24 days...

175
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,536
with Seo Se-hyun and
Yoon Jo-kyun as a suspect...

176
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,458
the Yongcheon serial murders
finally managed to be caught.

177
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:52,082
Suspect Yoon Jo-kyun was found
in injured state after a dispute...

178
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,557
with another suspect Seo Se-hyun
and immediately taken to the hospital.

179
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,602
A ten year old girl who become a victim
and be held hostage by the suspect...

180
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,537
He deceived everyone.

181
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,227
That woman is the real perpetrator.

182
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,674
This is the second time Mr. Choi
become the woman's target.

183
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,070
The woman who bestows all to Mr. Choi!

184
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:27,078
It's so nice to meet you again.

185
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,483
What's the matter...

186
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:38,688
didn't tell us if we could
message from Yoon Jo-kyun and go alone?

187
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:42,306
Even though we can discuss it together.

188
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,196
I have decided since
seeing Se-eun's uniform.

189
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:50,907
I will end the circle this
devil with my own hands.

190
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,719
In that case...

191
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,852
do you really want to kill him?

192
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,179
Yes.

193
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,883
Kill him and me too.

194
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,594
This time, I really...

195
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,617
want it all to end.

196
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:19,765
How is Se-eun?

197
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:23,736
He is fine?

198
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:27,844
Yes.

199
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,362
He recovered quickly.

200
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,660
He also ate with gusto.

201
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,920
From the results of the investigation...

202
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:43,971
all Yongcheon cases It is known
that it was Yoon Jo-kyun's doing.

203
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,266
But...

204
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:50,132
You should be tried for forgery
National Forensic Agency report results...

205
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:55,830
Kwon Hyung-jo's case, and left
without permission while in the hospital.

206
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,245
Not including attempted murder apparently.

207
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,569
About that...

208
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,546
actually because it can
considered as self-defense...

209
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,072
Even though...

210
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,690
the fact that I am very
want to kill that man...

211
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:15,627
is not lost.

212
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,674
Don't worry too much.

213
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,600
That could be considered self-defense.

214
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,932
Thank you, Chairman Jung.

215
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:42,080
Thanks to your consideration...

216
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:45,049
I can continue
investigation without detention.

217
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,764
It's not a big deal.

218
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:53,335
I got a recommendation from someone
a good lawyer who can help you.

219
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:54,472
Wait a moment.

220
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,080
My daughter is coming?

221
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,342
Mother?

222
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,922
Why is it so hard for me to meet you?

223
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,539
Are you busy?

224
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,390
Your face looks really bad.

225
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:28,858
Why?

226
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,659
Is something bothering you?

227
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,703
It doesn't matter.

228
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,726
Everything will be fine.

229
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
My daughter...

230
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:52,023
a very good boy.

231
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,133
Damn it!

232
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,246
- Over there. - Yes.

233
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:29,705
Stop!

234
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:31,255
Unlucky.

235
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:34,993
Oh my gosh, that guy!

236
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:41,224
Damn it.

237
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:45,992
I give up.

238
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,885
Okay.

239
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:49,431
Geez.

240
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Unlucky.

241
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:06,837
Go ahead, you guys.

242
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:15,876
Unlucky.

243
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,627
I told you I would catch you, didn't I?

244
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,816
I came to escort the thief.

245
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:32,841
Jung Hyun!

246
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,434
What's this?

247
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:37,678
What's this?

248
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:43,666
I caught him at the scene of the theft
and immediately get the stolen goods.

249
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,339
Additional checks I
leave it to the crime team.

250
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,456
Kwon Hyung-jo, you came again?

251
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,568
You're such a jerk!

252
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:52,203
This is the basis of human nature.

253
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:54,307
Please be kind to me.

254
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,280
Why are you silent?

255
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,154
- I... - You move aside first.

256
00:24:57,426 --> 00:25:01,041
You look great in that uniform.

257
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Are you comfortable at the police station?

258
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,319
Jung Jung Hyun.

259
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:08,584
If it's just theft, it should be taken to the
criminal investigation unit, not to the crime squad!

260
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:09,648
Good grief.

261
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:11,830
What is wrong with you?

262
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,616
In this way, I also
can see your face again.

263
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:16,600
You are like a normal human being.

264
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:20,049
What do you learn in out
there until it became like this?

265
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,544
He learned good things.

266
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,201
- You pushed me? - Geez.

267
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:25,604
Is there anything good happening?

268
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,047
Yes, you look in a good mood.

269
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:29,407
Good thing?

270
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:33,595
Of course there is.

271
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,354
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL

272
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:44,245
The size is just right.

273
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,057
The previous one was too big.

274
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,893
But next year, I will also grow taller.

275
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:53,235
Just use the right size.

276
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,541
No way, I prefer the previous one.

277
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:00,101
Se-eun.

278
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,166
Uncle!

279
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,049
What is it?

280
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,432
He looked annoyed.

281
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,478
I grew tall very fast. But Brother
told me to just buy the right size.

282
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:16,582
You're only that tall.

283
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,784
How did you know that?

284
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,603
Bet the names are really only three?

285
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,526
You really only need three name bets?

286
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:29,927
Yes, that's enough.

287
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,199
SEO SE EUN

288
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:51,236
Tada!

289
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:52,283
How?

290
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,368
It fits perfectly.
Very beautiful.

291
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
Please also calculate the large
size that the child liked earlier.

292
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,625
Yes.

293
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:02,739
Let me see.

294
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,049
You like?

295
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes.

296
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Base.

297
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Cool.

298
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,541
Number 9108, there is a visit.

299
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:49,093
I'm coming, Brother.

300
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:56,468
I'm very late, aren't I?

301
00:29:58,894 --> 00:29:59,894
Excuse me.

302
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,781
