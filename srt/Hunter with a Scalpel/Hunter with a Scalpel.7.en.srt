(Name)
Yoon Shi Eun

8
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,500
Here you go, this is yours

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,330
If there's anything you want to eat or have in the future

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,660
Write it in this notebook

11
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,360
I'll buy it for you

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,100
But you have to write a picture journal every day

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,800
What's a journal?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,730
It's writing down what you did that day

15
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,460
Happy or sad, just write it down

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,100
(Playing with Eun Soo)

17
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,860
(Playing with Eun Soo)

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,330
Yoon Shi Eun, why is the ground all red?

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,560
You're going to use up all the red

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,100
Use other colors

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,400
Give it to me, I need to finish this

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,300
Does it have to be red?

23
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,360
What's this?

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,500
The ocean

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,760
What?

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,530
Hey, who uses red to draw the ocean?

27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,160
Look, this looks more like the ocean than red

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,630
(The Hunter with a Scalpel)

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
(Episode 7)

30
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,230
(Yin Shi Eun)

31
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,360
I thought of something

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,760
I've always felt she looks like someone

33
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't you think her eyes

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,800
are a bit like Director Rui?

35
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,700
Even if the eyes are similar

36
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
the center of the face, the nose

37
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,430
the nose is completely different

38
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,000
How can a detective from the major crimes unit have such poor observation skills?

39
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
First, focus on women in their 30s

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,960
Look for people in Longchuan City who resemble her

41
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,330
We should start with the missing children

42
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,500
Chief

43
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,900
Yes, the photo was taken in 2003

44
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's start looking from that time

45
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,300
Will the composite sketch be released today?

46
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Yes, the support team has already set out

47
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,560
The old district is fully posted

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,700
The new district will complete posting today

49
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,060
Let's see if anyone contacts us after it's posted

50
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,000
Who knows, there might be a major clue

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,230
That would be great

52
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,900
Did you find anything during yesterday's investigation?

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,100
There's no connection between the victims

54
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,930
No common paths or acquaintances

55
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,830
The first and third victims

56
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,460
have one common point in their spending records

57
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,600
Where was that purchase?

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,130
At Brother Ming's laundry shop

59
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,200
You brat, come here, really!

60
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Hey, we're just taking the clothes to be cleaned.

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,500
If you put it that way, are all the cases in Longchuan by Ming Guo Ge?

62
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,430
Alright, let's get moving.

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,560
As soon as you see someone resembling the sketch...

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,900
Investigate their identity immediately. Got it?

65
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,600
-Okay
-Sure.

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,630
Chief, come with me to Ming Guo Ge's shop.

67
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,600
Maybe we can find some clues.

68
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,560
Yin Shien,

69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,630
You messed this up.

70
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,730
Need me to show you?

71
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,230
Fold the fabric and align it.

72
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,760
Thread the needle through the fabric. Repeat this a few times.

73
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,100
Finally, tie a bow to finish.

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Sew it like this, and the damage will be invisible, right?

75
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,030
It doesn't look like it's been patched, does it?

76
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,330
Take it to play with, but cherish it.

77
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,160
If you keep pulling at it, you'll get scolded by your sister.

78
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,960
Eun-soo, go to your room and study.

79
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,200
Alright, Dad.

80
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
I'll be back later.

81
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,030
Don't slack off. Keep practicing.

82
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,330
I'm heading out on a business trip soon.

83
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
So what happened to Eun-soo later?

84
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,559
Did you kill her?

85
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,630
When a dog bites, don't try to pull your hand away.

86
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,330
Push your hand deep into its throat.

87
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,030
That's when it'll let go.

88
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,830
Release your hand.

89
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,200
Yeah, here.

90
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,200
Building 203, Room 802

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,100
Pink chiffon top 20,000 yuan

92
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,760
Pick up in person on February 13

93
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,060
(2025.02.13 Choi Minguk [Longchuan Bank])

94
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,730
Really? Did she never come later?

95
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,230
Yeah, I didn't see her either

96
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,030
When she came to get the clothes

97
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,230
Was there anything suspicious?

98
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,200
Like a strange conversation

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,900
Or someone accompanying her behaving oddly

100
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,000
Let me think

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,060
She seemed to come alone both times

102
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Didn't say anything unusual

103
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,700
But Damin Apartments are in the new district

104
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,330
Do customers go there too?

105
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,960
Because our laundromat is quite...

106
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,500
Brother's shop is Longchuan's best laundromat

107
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
That's why there are many customers

108
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
Not that exaggerated

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,030
Earlier, He Gen brought pants for cleaning

110
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,530
They were so clean, it was surprising

111
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,400
I just saw you walking with a limp

112
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,360
You mean my foot?

113
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,230
Is it obvious?

114
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,730
Minguk got in a car accident before

115
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,430
Anyway, Minguk

116
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,000
Thanks for taking the time to help

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,400
No need to be formal

118
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,600
If there's any problem again, feel free to come to me

119
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
Thanks, Minguk

120
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,730
(Laundry room)
What's that place?

121
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,530
That's the laundry room.

122
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,530
Can I take a quick look?

123
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,430
What?

124
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,730
What's there to see?

125
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,530
-Let's go.
-It's okay.

126
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,500
The door isn't locked.

127
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,030
You can go in and take a look.

128
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,760
Really.

129
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,100
Sorry, Mingguo.

130
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,530
It's alright, it's understandable.

131
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,460
Longchuan Middle School…

132
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,160
Longchuan Middle School.

133
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,030
(Yin Shi'en, Longchuan Middle School)

134
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,960
(Request for your report
past photos, current estimated appearance)

135
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,060
Sorry, Mingguo.

136
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,830
That guy gets impulsive and charges ahead recklessly.

137
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,660
Sometimes I really want to punch him awake.

138
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,500
It's fine, he's just curious.

139
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,930
(Wife)

140
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,660
Mingguo, I'm taking a call.

141
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,830
Okay.

142
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,460
Hello, is it over?

143
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,030
You've worked hard.

144
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,130
Is everything alright?

145
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,960
No major issues, right?

146
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,500
This room is too old.

147
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
Sorry to show you it.

148
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,460
Just trying to make a living and getting by.

149
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,630
No way

150
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,230
Thank you for cooperating with our investigation

151
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,960
If there's anything else you need, you're always welcome

152
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,760
(Request your report
previous photo, current assumed appearance)

153
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,130
Why arrest me

154
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,200
What's going on

155
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,100
We're just here to visit and check

156
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,060
You turned the whole store upside down

157
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,330
This isn’t Seoul, news will spread quickly

158
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,300
You should take some drinks to the store next time

159
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,800
It's better to apologize in person

160
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,930
Senior

161
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,300
Investigate President Choi Minguk

162
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,600
Why suddenly bring this up

163
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,330
It could be a crime by an acquaintance

164
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,630
Plus, the laundromat often uses cleaning agents
needle and thread, that sort of tool

165
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,030
Lots of plastic items like basins and brushes too

166
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,630
I thought you were going to say something else

167
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,760
According to your logic

168
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,730
I should be investigated too

169
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,900
Our house is full of such items

170
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,960
So then

171
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
How about this

172
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,630
Looks a lot like him, right

173
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,860
But this person walks normally, doesn't he

174
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,300
That's true

175
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,800
-Chief Ryu
-Oh dear

176
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Now we're neighbors, bumping into each other again

177
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,560
Really

178
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,130
Where are you going...

179
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,800
Are you hurt?

180
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,930
Just a minor bump.

181
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,500
But what is this…

182
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,730
Is it blood?

183
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,100
Blood?

184
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm okay.

185
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,630
I thought you got hurt again.

186
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I'll be going then.

187
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,360
Wait, Chief Rui.

188
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,000
We have something to ask.

189
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,130
I almost forgot.

190
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,230
The drug analysis report for the two cases.

191
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,200
I've been too busy lately, just heard verbal reports.

192
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,400
Didn't get the written documents.

193
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Can you give me a copy?

194
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,500
The analysis report, huh.

195
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
Of course.

196
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,060
When do you need it by?

197
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,860
Here’s the thing.

198
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,660
I need to report to the director every day.

199
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,330
Could I have it by today?

200
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,230
I'll try to send it to you today.

201
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,260
Thanks for your hard work.

202
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,330
Goodbye.

203

(Drug analysis report of the body: detected a large amount of bufalin)

204
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,800

205

207
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,030
Did you get home safe?

208
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,530
What do you plan to do?

209
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,500
I should be asking you that.

210
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,930
You don't actually want to kill me, do you?

211
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,760
You're not in a position to say that.

212
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,960
Using dirty tricks like electric shocks against me.

213
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,260
Otherwise...

214
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,430
A daughter reunited after so long, wielding a knife at her dad.

215
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,260
As your father,

216
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Can't I teach you a lesson?

217
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,060
Did you see the composite sketch?

218
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,430
What composite sketch?

219
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,460
The gift you sent is all over Longchuan.

220
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,500
Oh, you mean that one?

221
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,800
Do you like it?

222
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Dad can send you something else.

223
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,760
Depending on your behavior.

224
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,829
I'm in a tricky situation because of you.

225
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,800
Let's stop hurting each other.

226
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,900
Find a scapegoat instead.

227
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,800
You're talking about Director Rui, right?

228
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,200
I thought this case was closed.

229
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,300
(Mystery of Nam Cheng-hye's death: Evidence can't be authenticated?)
Isn't he just a drug user?

230
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
(Where is National Forensic Service's credibility?)
What's the fuss about?

231
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,460
But didn't he indeed use drugs? Everyone heard.

232
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,630
What is this, can't authenticate?

233
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,960
I don't know who wrote the article.

234
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,060
Director Rui must have a headache now.

235
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,930
(Choi Min-guk = bowlegs)
Bowlegs.

236
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,930
-Have the sketches been posted? 
-Yes

237
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,000
Any leads or tips received?

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,260
Not yet.

239
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,600
We've been desperately investigating and interviewing witnesses.

240
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,500
Still no progress at all.

241
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Even the tiniest clue would be great.

242
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,530
So, about the Blue Barrel case I brought up yesterday...

243
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,360
You're really pushing your luck.

244
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,460
I told you not to mention cold cases again.

245
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,400
Yes, I know.

246
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
But please hear me out one more time.

247
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,760
I genuinely think it's worth investigating.

248
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,730
And it bears a strong resemblance to this case.

249
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,060
Honestly speaking,

250
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,700
Isn't it likely this perpetrator isn't a first-time offender?

251
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,330
Take a look at this.

252
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,060
(Autopsy Report)
"Dismembered into seventeen pieces, washed with detergent."

253
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,360
"Cause of death: Cervical fracture."

254
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,230
"Injection marks found, Pavulon detected."

255
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,860
Moreover, the suspect, Godsen, has a daughter similar in age to the photo.

256
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,030
Add the line and drug connections,

257
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,960
-It's practically a repeat of our case.
-Hey.

258
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,230
Whose side are you on, anyway?

259
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm here to investigate, not to take sides.

260
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,730
I think aside from tracing the girl in the photo,

261
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,060
Deeper probing into this case might yield...

262
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,900
Alright.

263
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,560
You're quite reasonable.

264
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,130
Let’s just say you're making a valid point.

265
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,500
You're fully in charge of this.

266
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,330
Investigate however you like.

267
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,430
Really?

268
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,960
Yes.

269
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,030
But to be clear, I can't assign anyone to help you.

270
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,400
We're already swamped.

271
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,530
We've been tasked with unsolved cases too, so there's bound to be pushback.

272
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,130
This is the case you wanted to investigate.

273
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,560
You'll have to find a way to handle it yourself.

274
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,860
Everyone, don't lose heart.

275
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,560
We need to show we're focused on solving cases.

276
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,300
So the 280,000 citizens of Longchuan can sleep peacefully.

277
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,430
Also, Chief Jung...

278
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,260
You're so dedicated to this case.

279
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,500
You need to deliver some results.

280
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,830
You must feel it too, Chief.

281
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,860
Our manpower is insufficient.

282
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,130
We should unify our search strategy.

283
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,700
If you act alone like this,

284
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,560
it just makes it harder for the team.

285
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
Frame the murderer?

286
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,900
You still have Woo Min-ho's body, right?

287
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,230
Give me the body and organs.

288
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,500
I'll get other people's DNA on them.

289
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,400
Frame the suspect.

290
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
I can clean up the crime you committed.

291
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,730
Make it spotless.

292
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,700
Do you want to help me do it?

293
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,600
But why would our Soeun suddenly change her mind?

294
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,330
If it weren't for you putting my photo in the body.

295
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,060
This wouldn't have happened.

296
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,500
So we need to wrap up these cases.

297
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,800
Treat them as if they never occurred, clean them up,

298
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,330
and start anew.

299
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,700
Alright.

300
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,030
I'll help you prepare the killer.

301
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,860
Luckily, someone has already caught the police's attention.

302
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,930
Go to their house and collect something that can be DNA tested.

303
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,030
I'll leave them on the dismembered body and dispose of them.

304
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,830
Then, once you perform the autopsy,

305
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,000
just confirm the killer's identity, and it's over.

306
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,830
With your daughter becoming a forensic scientist,

307
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,360
it makes things more interesting.

308
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,630
I'll also get a car ready for you.

309
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,460
