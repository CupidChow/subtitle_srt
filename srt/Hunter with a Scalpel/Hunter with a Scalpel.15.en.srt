00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,260
Stay here for a while.

9
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,605
You ruined Se-eun.

10
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,140
Because of you!

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,236
Forgive me.

12
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,641
Se-eun.

13
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,363
That's dangerous.

14
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Come to Father.

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
You're a good boy, right?

EPISODE 15

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Doctor Seo?

19
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,216
What do you need?

20
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,320
I wonder how the investigation is going.

21
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,380
Is there any information
about the child yet?

22
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,776
Not yet.

23
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:50,614
But because of the port and the
main toll road is being inspected...

24
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,410
they will have a hard time escaping.

25
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,445
Then, because of your
mother also tightly guarded...

26
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,180
You guys still don't know the
child's whereabouts apparently.

27
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,711
You really care to Se-eun apparently.

28
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,080
If you don't go with me now...

29
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,180
Se-eun will die with your mother.

30
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:15,980
Regarding the child, it has also
been I shared it with Chairman Hong.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,200
- Even though it's frustrating, trust in...
- Let me...

32
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,519
help out.

33
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,369
SENIOR JEON CHANG-JIN

34
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:31,806
Chairman Jung.

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,500
You've been quite helpful.

36
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:42,677
Yes, hello?

37
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:46,853
Chairman Jung, Mr. Office Chief
hold an emergency meeting now.

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,019
It seems like you should
know this situation.

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Emergency meeting?

40
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,533
Father.

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,923
Sorry for yesterday.

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,119
Even though Dad already
forbid me to go out.

43
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,551
Since when are we the police?
Influenced by the perpetrator's words?

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,580
His statement was deemed credible...

45
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,001
and he also passed
the lie detector test.

46
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,380
Isn't it Seo Se-hyun? can
be skilled enough to do that?

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,021
Doctor Seo's alibi from case one and
two have also been confirmed to be true.

48
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,966
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

49
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:47,056
We're still looking for Yoon Jo-kyun, but give him Seo
Se-hyun's file was sent to the prosecutor's office.

50
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
In that case, we...

51
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,748
will accuse people
who is not the perpetrator.

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,073
What are you doing?

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,636
You should still be in
the hospital. Why interfere?

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,459
Sir, can't you trust us?

55
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,943
We did miss Yoon Jo-kyun.

56
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,256
But during the process of getting here, we
never lose the direction of the investigation.

57
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,411
If you believe until the end, we
will definitely catch the real culprit.

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Okay.

59
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,474
Consider Yoon Jo-kyun as
the real culprit as you said.

60
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:20,295
So, do you have any proof? Seo
Se-hyun is not the real culprit?

61
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:21,965
There aren't any, right?

62
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:26,149
That's why I said, let's
sue Seo Se-hyun first.

63
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:27,905
Then, if Yoon later Jo-kyun gets caught...

64
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,255
There is no such thing as later.

65
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:33,640
If left like this,
wouldn't it just be buried...

66
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,248
like other cold cases?

67
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,304
Chairman Jung is right.

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,982
Shouldn't we catch it right now?

69
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,421
Base.

70
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,700
You are already a section
head, but let them...

71
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:53,021
Sir, I also think we should conduct
an investigation on Yoon Jo-kyun.

72
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:57,420
So, you are confident
can catch Yoon Jo-kyun?

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Yes, we are sure.

74
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Okay.

75
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,252
Do the best.

76
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,052
But, you know me won't wait, right?

77
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:16,080
Will you be discharged from the
hospital the day after tomorrow?

78
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,708
You clean it up right after you get out.

79
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,833
Know that.

80
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:27,568
Jung Hyun.

81
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,980
Are you really okay?

82
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,255
Yes.

83
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm fine.

84
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:38,290
I'm actually tortured
lying in the hospital.

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,620
Then you and the seniors
others have supported this.

86
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,900
We have to catch Yoon Jo-kyun.

87
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,940
Sorry, we should have been
like this from the start.

88
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,060
Are you apologizing?

89
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:58,420
Anyway, he won't let me let it
be if this time it gets caught.

90
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,660
How dare he attack
Yongcheon police officer.

91
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,457
Older brother?

92
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:34,844
Are you ok?

93
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,365
I'm fine.

94
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,800
Your uniform is beautiful.

95
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,780
Very suitable.

96
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,667
Later...

97
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:52,340
go and play with my brother at school.

98
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,820
You want to go to school, right?

99
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:58,289
Really?

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Yes.

101
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:05,798
Here!

102
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,265
Help us!

103
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,751
Don't let other people find out.

104
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:15,983
What?

105
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,255
Dad said so.

106
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,755
Don't trust anyone.

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,716
Se-eun!

108
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,010
Father...

109
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,029
calling me?

110
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,591
Se-eun, do you miss your brother?

111
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,030
He's looking for you.

112
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,175
During the investigation of the owner of the
smuggling ship around Seohaean expressway...

113
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,887
there have been unreported cases
which looks like Yoon Jo-kyun's doing.

114
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,075
Unreported cases?

115
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:29,272
We have checked the identity of the
body in the form of a framework that...

116
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:30,939
found on a hill near Yeongpo.

117
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,539
Her name is Park Sung-hee.

118
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:39,803
When he went missing eight years ago,
he said she has a two year old daughter.

119
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:45,114
We also got testimony that he had time lives
with a man who looks like Yoon Jo-kyun.

120
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,196
If the child is still
alive, now ten years old.

121
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,579
Yes, this is just an estimate.

122
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:55,433
But most likely, the child is
the child brought by Yoon Jo-kyun.

123
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,767
Regarding that, we can
make sure through lab test...

124
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:01,385
because we already
have the victim's DNA.

125
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Chairman.

126
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:25,260
YOON SE EUN

127
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,839
Se-eun?

128
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,241
YOON SE EUN

129
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,426
Senior Jeon.

130
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:42,783
Please submit identification
to the Forensic Agency first.

131
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,663
Yes.

132
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:46,406
Chairman Hong.

133
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,900
I will let you know about this Doctor
Seo and went straight to the scene.

134
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,357
Okay.

135
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,801
Joint team continues investigation
smuggling route handed over...

136
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,396
Yongcheon police and immediately
report if you find any strange movements.

137
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
- Yes. - Yes.

138
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:00,943
Do something.

139
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,603
YOON SE EUN

140
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,629
Please do it as soon as possible.

141
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,275
Yes.

142
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:25,480
We will test it as soon
as possible and contact you.

143
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,610
Yes.

144
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,639
Doctor Cheon.

145
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,233
Doctor Seo is fine.

146
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,300
I will convey it to him
if you are really worried.

147
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,167
This is from Yongcheon.

148
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
This is urgent.

149
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,460
I know, get out.

150
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,420
Can you put this first?

151
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:03,632
Su-yeon.

152
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:09,460
Everything sent to us is urgent
and there is much to be done.

153
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,480
We do it in order.

154
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,180
Did you slow it down on purpose?

155
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,380
What do you say?

156
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,542
If so, I'll do it.

157
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:22,220
Then I've returned to the beginning
information related to the Nam Seung-hyup case.

158
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,581
What?

159
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,387
Back to content You know, Doctor Yang.

160
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,416
You are crazy?

161
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,941
Even though it's late...

162
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,460
I also dare myself after
seeing Doctor Seo's conference.

163
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,985
We must not work with
ignoring any shred of truth.

164
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:53,473
Yes, of course, you are our junior.

165
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,237
You are very deserving.

166
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,552
Of course luck for our laboratory.

167
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,147
Yes of course.

168
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,660
We'll eat together later.

169
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:08,940
What's wrong, Doctor Yang?

170
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:13,820
Who is the lucky one? our laboratory?

171
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:19,060
You know Hyun-suk four
the class above you, right?

172
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:24,700
Hyun-seuk will be my replacement,
so he called to say hello.

173
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,460
What does it mean?

174
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,260
You said, I am the one will replace you.

175
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,300
If based on the order, of
course your seniors first.

176
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,229
Hyun-suk first.

177
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,566
Mr. Director.

178
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,611
How do you do this? after everything i did?

179
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,780
Yes I know.

180
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:48,275
But we have to accept it for what it is who
will take care of Nam Seung-hyup's case.

181
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:52,135
Hyun-suk also has very good relationship.

182
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:56,699
Therefore, it is also good for you make
connections first in Pyeongsang City, right?

183
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:58,906
He will also be very
help at times like this.

184
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:02,783
Are you going yet?

185
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
Didn't you come because
you had something to do?

186
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,229
Don't be too sad.

187
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,486
I will recommend you again.

188
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,440
It was found near pharmacy recently.

189
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,650
It is currently being
examined in the forensic lab.

190
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,908
Do you recognize this shirt?

191
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,095
What about the body?

192
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,841
We only found clothes at the scene.

193
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,699
Judging from the only clothes left
behind, the child must still be safe.

194
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,047
No.

195
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:42,807
He killed him.

196
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,411
He said he would kill Se-eun...

197
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,524
if I don't follow it.

198
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:48,632
Yes?

199
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,459
What does it mean?

200
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:56,346
Yoon Jo-kyun comes to the hospital.

201
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:57,916
Pick me up.

202
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,502
Yoon Jo-kyun came here?

203
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,385
But when?

204
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,533
Chairman Jung, help me out for a moment.

205
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,150
What?

206
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,533
I have to go.

207
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:18,364
If I don't go, proof or whatever
Se-eun's body will never be found.

208
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,814
You can't go.

209
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:22,135
You could be in danger.

210
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,502
Then we wouldn't have found Se-eun's body.

211
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,480
The police are
investigating, wait a minute...

212
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,671
How long should I wait?

213
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,440
Until the child's body was found?

214
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,818
And then after that?

215
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,986
What happened after that?

216
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Excuse me.

217
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,587
However, we cannot let you out.

218
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,107
As a replacement...

219
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,049
I will definitely find Se-eun.

220
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,807
Trust me for once.

221
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,600
From now on, guard 24 hours
with two people in one team.

222
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,799
Don't let your guard down for a second
and Security is also on guard in the room.

223
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:15,955
Doctor Seo at all can't leave the room.

224
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:23,471
Senior Jeon, join us. with me right now.

225
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:18,235
It's cold, right?

226
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:19,901
Come here.

227
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,775
It really hurts?

228
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,703
I am alright.

229
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,471
Do you remember?

230
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,424
When we...

231
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:41,322
first time coming to Haryong.

232
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:46,492
You brought a dead rat...

233
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,799
into the room.

234
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:56,606
I cried sobbing...

235
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,120
and go on a long rant at you.

236
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:06,334
At that time...

237
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,416
I'm afraid of you.

238
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't like being with you.

239
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:22,636
I'm sorry I did this to Dad.

240
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,658
Because of me...

241
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,565
you end up playing outside.

242
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,690
I always feel guilty.

243
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,440
You will forgive me, right?

244
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you alright?

245
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,853
Older brother?

246
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,349
Because of that...

247
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,710
you should obey when Dad asked you out.

248
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:41,995
Se-eun...

249
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,356
died because of you.

250
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Beautiful, right?

251
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,081
Someone dropped me off earlier.

252
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,393
I persuaded the police to be
able to bring it to cheer you up.

253
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:00,899
Thank You.

254
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:24,935
MAY YOU BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY.
- MUJIN TIDAL LAND -

255
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,237
Yes, thanks for the hard work.

256
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:36,550
There are the same fingerprints as
which were found in cases one and two.

257
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,675
That's right, that's the
kid's uniform. as Dr. Seo said.

258
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,448
But he said, the blood that was stuck
on the uniform not belonging to the child.

259
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,588
The results show that there
is adult white blood cells.

260
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:51,581
Does that mean he did it on
purpose? smearing other people's blood?

261
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,495
In that case...

262
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,596
Se-eun is still alive!

263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,915
The road where it was found the
uniform is on a one-way driveway.

264
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:05,479
But there is no footage of the box
car who passed by on CCTV came in.

265
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,214
Maybe he took transportation
public or on foot.

266
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,550
If so, it is likely big
he's still around here.

267
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,237
Let's go to the location too.

268
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,878
- Yes. - Come on, quickly.

269
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,962
Wait a minute.

270
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:32,326
I will take you again.

271
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,856
Have you seen this child?

272
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,230
No.

273
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:48,341
Good afternoon.

274
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:49,814
Have you seen it?

275
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,030
Good afternoon.

276
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,087
Have you ever seen this little boy?

277
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Girl.

278
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,095
No.

279
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,311
I don't see.

280
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Thank You.

281
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,739
Nobody saw.

282
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,315
We try to expand the area.

283
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Chairman Jung.

284
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,042
Let us do the moving.

285
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:18,690
You come back.

286
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
That's okay.

287
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We continue moving.

288
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,960
Look at your face.

289
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:26,054
- Looks bad. - No.

290
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:30,417
I will not be back before Se-eun met.

291
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Come on.

292
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,357
Why?

293
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:05,337
What?

294
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,170
What does that mean? Why? just saying now?

295
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
What's that?

296
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,003
What is it?

297
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,369
Something was thrown from outside.

298
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,509
- Try to make sure over there. - Good.

299
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,658
An incident occurred.

300
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,492
Please help to the fourth floor.

301
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,580
Doctor Seo, did you see any strange people?

302
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Doctor Seo!

303
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,165
We need the patient's
guardian's consent first.

304
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:16,153
Approximately when will we can get it?

305
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,530
VERY HARD DRUGS

306
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,116
What's this?

307
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:03,756
LADDER GO OUT

308
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,430
MINIMARKET OF LUCKY

309
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,880
It seems like this kid is right.

310
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,049
You are sure?
Yes.

311
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,094
Not long ago he came to buy bread.

312
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:18,908
But suddenly ran out like
something serious is going on.

313
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,871
It looks like he lives
alone in that empty house.

314
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:26,800
Where exactly?

315
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,542
Isn't that Journalist Kim?

316
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,831
Is this Yoon Jo-kyun's doing?

317
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Possible.

318
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:09,304
It is just...

319
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,050
The method of killing is very different.

320
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,068
This is proof that Yoon Jo-kyun
being cornered psychologically.

321
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,347
He really will do something if left alone.

322
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,902
Still, there was only one ship tonight.

323
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:37,831
Additional seats cannot be added
suddenly available if you come suddenly.

324
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:40,917
Sudden?

325
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:43,667
You should keep your promise.

326
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,683
I said there was a plan.

327
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,882
What plan do you mean?

328
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:51,608
I don't want to know.

329
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,515
If you want, there is one chair.
If you don't want to, that's fine.

330
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,616
Looks like you too in a
position where one cannot choose.

331
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:38,048
If there are no chairs,
just reduce the passengers.

332
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:40,069
Is not it?

333
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,350
While we were checking the perpetrator...

334
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:50,816
Excuse me.

335
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:58,505
How is the hospital entrance?
Didn't you see Seo Se-hyun run away?

336
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,779
He came out through the
place underground parking...

337
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,941
When is it coming out?

338
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:05,586
Parking CCTV?

339
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:06,872
We are checking it.

340
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,355
It must be from Yoon Jo-kyun.

341
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,339
Is the route known?

342
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,300
He was caught on CCTV stealing
car in parking lot and out...

343
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,472
heading to Yongcheon Line 1C.

344
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:44,464
We're leaving now. You guys join in too.

345
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes, we're going straight there.
After receiving the location.

346
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:49,886
Chairman Jung.

347
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,324
What is the problem?

348
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:54,206
Chairman Jung! Chang-jin!

349
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:57,456
The box car has been found.

350
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,177
Father.

351
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,940
Father!

352
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,693
Father!

353
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:39,335
Dad, I'm guilty.

354
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,364
I'm sorry, Dad!

355
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:45,036
Dad, I'm sorry!

356
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:48,488
I'm sorry, Dad!

357
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,539
Father, help me!

358
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,395
Father!

359
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,195
Sorry, Dad!

360
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,911
Dad, I'm sorry.

361
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,637
Father!
