Did you find anything?

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,061
If so, we won't sit here.

10
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,677
We do have to wait for the results. But somehow I have a bad feeling.

11
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,456
Oh my gosh, this is bad.

12
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,376
The kid is a regular at my place.

13
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:11,806
I know him well too.

14
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,642
He said the victim left his money in his possession her clothes were here right before the incident.

15
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:16,615
Correct.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,056
The house is always empty when I delivered the clothes.

17
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:20,494
I'm going home too with bare hands.

18
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:24,777
What have you been up to lately? don't see anyone suspicious?

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,627
Suspicious person?

20
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,527
Isn't this the place? gathering of old people?

21
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,602
- Must show the photo. - Yes, we have the photo.

22
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:32,260
Yes.

23
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,919
I don't know, if the photo is like this...

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,020
...I can't really recognize it because he's wearing a hat.

25
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,895
By the way, I heard Your wife has been discharged from the hospital.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,580
I didn't expect the news have arrived here.

27
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:54,305
The operation went smoothly and recently returned home.

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,408
I'm grateful.

29
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,205
Kidney transplant surgery is not an easy thing.

30
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,017
Correct.

31
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,148
You've tried.

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,820
I didn't try that hard.

33
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:08,060
- You got a call. - It's yours.

00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,343
THE NEW KIDS

35
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:17,349
Hello, Chairman Jung.

36
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:18,799
Now?

37
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:20,940
We are investigating.

38
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:24,420
I understand. Call me. if you have arrived.

39
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:26,300
Yes.

40
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,020
New team leader?

41
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:30,691
Shouldn't you guys go back?

42
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:31,633
No.

43
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,538
This morning he went to Seoul for autopsy.

44
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,220
What did he say?

45
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,917
Forensic doctor wants see the crime scene directly.

46
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,340
They will come here together and told us to wait.

47
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,592
Gosh, this is so troublesome.

48
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,049
Is he a detective?

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,498
Who will come, he said?

50
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:49,557
That, the lab center kid forensics, Seo Se-hyun.

51
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,100
His bad reputation for playing around so The chief investigators have been spread out.

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,760
This just gives me a headache.

53
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:57,268
I hate him so much.

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,090
He chose a forensic expert which is similar to him.

55
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,781
We are already cold because Wait and busy investigation!

56
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,700
Chang-jin, turn off your cell phone.

57
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,580
Bad habits must be fixed from the start.

58
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,047
Should it be so?

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,340
You can got scolded by your boss.

60
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:15,280
Wow.

61
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:26,336
A HUNTER WITH A SCALPEL

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,782
SCIENCE TO REVEAL THE TRUTH

63
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,136
PART TWO What is the case of Nam Seung-hyup...

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,296
...so difficult to conclude as regular assault instead of drugs?

65
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,660
If this is how it is...

66
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:36,046
...how is my reputation? in front of the old man?

67
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,335
Don't worry.

68
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:42,326
Doctor Oh said, today he will meet and consult with Doctor Seo.

69
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,547
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,660
How can you be so relaxed?

71
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,860
You're twisting the facts again.

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,820
When was I like that?

73
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:55,860
That's why I take care of it everything is directly like this, right?

74
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,580
When you wear the gold badge later, I make sure you are impeccably clean.

75
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,660
You're such a jerk.

76
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,700
By the way...

77
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:11,820
...don't hold on too strong. Do you know why?

78
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,724
He was already in trouble.

79
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,860
We could be affected if he reports.

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,844
Good grief.
Mr. Director.

81
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,940
Doctor Seo is a person who can't do anything but autopsy.

82
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,260
Then in a moment it will transferred to its origin.

83
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,620
He must be too realize it, right?

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,811
Please call Doctor Oh.

85
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,184
Doctor Oh and Doctor Seo leave to the Yongcheon case scene this morning.

86
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,199
Is he like that again?

87
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,100
I told you not to do it again!

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,730
Has the crime scene been cleaned up?

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,147
Not yet, still the same as when found.

90
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,480
But, if you look at the clean crime scene, It seems this is not the first murder.

91
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,540
The reason?

92
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:06,469
If this is his first murder, the perpetrator's emotions must be unstable...

93
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,700
...and the crime scene is bound to be a mess.

94
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,020
There.

95
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,140
The boots that abandoned by the perpetrator.

96
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,060
The perpetrator used it to put the body here.

97
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,260
Even if he plans throw it away...

98
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,180
...it is difficult to use the item found at the scene of the first murder.

99
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:24,860
You are very thorough.

100
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,926
Actually I'm studying criminal psychology...

101
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,420
But, what's the rush?

102
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:35,260
If you do not estimate the soil conditions muddy, the perpetrator definitely needs another pair of shoes.

103
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,460
If we think with prejudice, the truth can be ignored.

104
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,980
The dissected body of the victim full of traces of the perpetrator.

105
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,860
The body was deliberately left at the crime scene which is clean as if it wants to be shown off.

106
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:06,340
From how to handle and dispose of corpse, the perpetrator was very skilled.

107
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,460
This is not his first murder.

108
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,460
He can cover up his actions well if you want.

109
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:26,300
But, why did he put the body as if on display?

110
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:34,807
If...

111
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,340
...he did hope someone found...

112
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:47,527
If this is a message for someone...

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,220
Why take it?

114
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:55,667
I want to make sure if it's true This is the murder location with soil testing.

115
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,690
What is data collection? proof is complete?

116
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,100
Still under construction.

117
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:04,260
Please send the proof data to this email when the results are out.

118
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,570
How is the plan? future investigations?

119
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:23,636
Regarding that...

120
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:24,648
I know.

121
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:27,020
The detectives are fed up with this question.

122
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:30,100
- But this is my way... - According to the rules.

123
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:34,037
We will check the surrounding area Crime scene and investigate the victim's surroundings first.

124
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,685
Actually, recently there has been several reports of stalking.

125
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,517
And because of the victim is one of the reporters...

126
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:40,780
...we intend prioritize the perpetrator.

127
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,380
But, if you look at it from the side evidence found at the scene...

128
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:46,368
...this is closer to a crime planned rather than accidental.

129
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:49,047
I mean to do initial in-depth examination.

130
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:51,860
Put aside victim and back to the beginning?

131
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,980
About that...

132
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,340
It doesn't mean we didn't investigate it.

133
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:01,202
However, if the perpetrator is roaming around here and there before to find a target...

134
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,340
...that doesn't fit with conditions at the scene.

135
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,060
Must see evidence which were collected first.

136
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,733
Didn't you say that earlier?

137
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:11,580
The truth could be further away if establishing prejudice.

138
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:15,260
What about CCTV?

139
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:16,700
That is true.

140
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,540
Regarding CCTV...

141
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,140
As you can see, There is no CCTV on this road.

142
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,429
YONGCHEON WATERFALL

143
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:25,457
How about that?

144
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:29,641
The CCTV is pointing to the street, so the crime scene is...

145
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:34,145
There were no signs of the body being stabbed. corpse. He must have been taken in a big car.

146
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,940
The perpetrator came via another route because There were no specific tire marks around the scene.

147
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,341
That means, CCTV in the T-junction recorded it.

148
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:45,300
Yes.

149
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,180
You're right.

150
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:53,660
When we checked the CCTV, there was many kinds of vans passed by.

151
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,380
In that case, we have to monitor all including package delivery cars.

152
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:03,980
Do you want to go right away?

153
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,100
We will contact you once the autopsy report comes out.

154
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:09,300
Good.

155
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,700
Be careful on the way.

156
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,380
Should have gone home after having dinner together, right?

157
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:22,381
Hello, Senior Chang-jin?

158
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:23,414
Good grief.

159
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,700
I don't know my battery expired during the investigation.

160
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,226
Are you still on site?

161
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,489
Yes, that is so.

162
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:32,620
Where are you now?

163
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:39,905
YONGCHEON TERMINAL - MASEO STATION

164
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,060
Judging from the condition of the crime scene, it is not easy obtain additional DNA samples.

165
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,900
For now, we determine the former location of the crime.

166
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,220
Send us a sample of the soil we take that as an emergency request.

167
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:17,460
Are you listening to me?

168
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,500
Please approve.

169
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:26,895
Agree what?

170
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,260
Nam Seung-hyup's case.

171
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:31,468
You already know my answer.

172
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:32,540
If you are like that...

173
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,460
...Mr. Director will intervene directly.

174
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,780
That was my case that was submitted directly Mr. Director.

175
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:44,535
Why did the Director hand over that job is for you, Doctor Oh?

176
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:48,617
I am holding this case because Sir The director did not carry out his duties.

177
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,310
Not a task, but an opportunity.

178
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,820
Is it not allowed?

179
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,279
To be honest.

180
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,579
You know how many times I got slapped the police replace the Director?

181
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,220
All this time I patiently restrain yourself.

182
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,495
I try to be independent. If you help...

183
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,575
What if it becomes a problem later? the credibility of our institution too?

184
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:09,661
Honesty and trustworthiness of a doctor forensics. Such things are just excuses.

185
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,740
This is about promotion, right?

186
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:16,443
Is it true that you have to? to this point?

187
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:18,620
I have made up my mind.

188
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:23,020
Please think about it until tomorrow.

189
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:24,860
No.

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,180
I...

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,900
...will do it.

192
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:47,805
You stupid.

193
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,156
JOURNALIST KIM HYUNG-SOO

194
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:17,660
There are no signs of the body being bent. corpse. He must have been taken in a big car.

00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,720

198
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,205
You've worked hard.

00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,086

204
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:24,583
Thank you for the food.

208
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,460

Yes.

211
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,837
Have a good rest.

212
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:47,700
Yes.

213
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,660
Let go...

214
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,620
Who are you?

215
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:29,980
Mother's Daughter.

216
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,300
Seo Se Hyun.

217
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:34,820
Do you remember, Mom?

218
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,221
Mother even carved initials on my scalpel.

219
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,660
You are very beautiful.

220
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,181
You are a good person apparently.

221
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,300
Mother is also beautiful.

222
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,460
Oh my, you're a weirdo.

223
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,380
Why am I your mother?

224
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,301
Ouch.

225
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:05,340
Sick.

226
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,794
JOURNALIST KIM HYUNG-SOO

227
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,849
Yes, it's me Seo Se-hyun.

228
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:33,140
It's just right that I want to contact you because I didn't have time to pick up the phone earlier.

229
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,325
Early morning on the seventh in the city Yongcheon, Gyeonggi Province...

230
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,928
...a body has been found female victim in her 20s.

231
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,775
When found, corpse in condition...

232
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,890
...all internal organs missing except the stomach.

233
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,621
This is getting more and more surprising...

234
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:51,649
...with it being estimated that the victim's body Sewn back with regular sewing thread.

235
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,317
This case is dubbed as the Case The Tailor's Murder on Social Media...

236
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,164
...and spread rapidly.

237
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:03,061
Considering the victim's status as a reporter stalking before the deceased died...

238
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:08,656
...and the Yongcheon police in charge failed to catch stalking suspect...

239
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:10,440
...anxiety the community also grew.

240
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:15,024
Criticism of initial police handling which is considered less is increasing.

241
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:18,351
To date, the investigation not showing any progress...

242
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,534
Whose fault is this?

243
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,232
...if not caught soon...

244
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,535
Who leaked it? to the mass media?

245
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:24,486
Who?

246
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:25,655
Jung Jung Hyun.
Is this your doing?

247
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,211
Not me.

248
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,695
Whoever it is, watch out only if you get caught!

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,260
I'll rip your mouths apart!

250
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:34,790
Where's Chang-jin?

251
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,445
- Senior Chang-jin still hasn't... - He...

252
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,012
Today I took a leave because there is an urgent need.

253
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,860
Who told you to do whatever you want?

254
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,242
Do you agree?

255
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,170
Yes?

256
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,020
Forgive me.

257
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,534
The outside is just the team leader.

258
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,423
Correct.

259
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,039
Very cool.

260
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,340
Absolutely fantastic.

261
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,218
It sucks.

262
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,610
What is the police station? having bad luck?

263
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,757
There is no day its quiet here.

264
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:10,860
Chairman Jung.

265
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,096
Isn't it true that you leaked it?

266
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:14,224
It means?

267
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,438
Isn't a Journalist Kim contacted you?

268
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,022
He said everything had been confirmed.

269
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,021
We never discuss matters related to the case.

270
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,944
Yes, that's for sure.

271
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:25,340
But, attack the team itself...

272
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,420
...isn't it inelegant?

273
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,975
Does anyone feel attacked?

274
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,932
After you all do as you please yourself ignoring me?

275
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:34,960
As you please?

276
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,561
Chairman Jung, what the heck? your words and attitude?

277
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:38,692
So what?

278
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,244
What I said what's wrong?

279
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:42,074
Senior Chang-jin also can't be like that.

280
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,410
If there is an urgent matter at the moment emergency, should report to...

281
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,268
Report to you?

282
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,815
You really are looking for trouble apparently.

283
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,020
While we're at it, let's talk just be open now.

284
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,825
Do you deserve to feel that way? taller than Chang-jin?

285
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,180
- Hyukgeum. - Don't interfere. Just keep quiet.

286
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,892
You became the team leader because Police Academy graduate.

287
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,749
You're already acting great, you too don't want to listen to other people.

288
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:02,988
- Stop. - Are you the only police officer?

289
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,136
Are you the only one who is good?

290
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,331
- Damn, you're just doing whatever you want! - That's enough.

291
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,191
- You bastard, let go of me. - It's enough.

292
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,050
I understand, let me go!

293
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,512
Oh my, what a jerk.

294
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,704
Damn it.

295
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:24,540
Basic new kid already pretending to fight.

296
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:28,596
Just wait and see. I will. make him give up first.

297
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:30,043
This is also your fault.

298
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,398
You made it first become a traitor, right?

299
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:36,660
This one child, you who's side are you on?

300
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:40,127
Hyuk-geum, this is not about whose side to take.

301
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,618
This stinky brat!

302
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:42,751
Wait a minute.

303
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,539
Hyuk-geum, Chang-jin called.

304
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:45,811
Yes, hello?

305
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:46,970
Give it to me.

306
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,554
Hello, Chang-jin.

307
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,980
What is your wife's re-operation? goes well?

308
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:59,324
CHAIRMAN JUNG JUNG-HYUN

309
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,500
It's me Jung Jung-hyun. Are you busy?

310
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,015
It seems like you are the one is busier.

311
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,781
You've seen the news, right?

312
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,844
Of course.

313
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,746
Our director was very excited to ask is this leaked from our side.

314
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,318
The atmosphere here too messed up because of that.

315
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,645
I was also scolded a lot.

316
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:18,149
If it leaks to the mass media, the investigation should have been faster.

317
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,294
Not like that.

318
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,143
In fact, if it's crowded in the mass media...

319
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:25,140
...it will lure the perpetrator to cause trouble again, right?

320
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,140
In that case...

321
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:30,340
...you can catch it when he appeared.

322
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,940
It's not as easy as saying it.

323
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,320
By the way, why are you calling?

324
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:38,980
I...

325
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:41,700
Want to know if you find something.

326
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:46,220
No significant results found from samples, boots, and plastic.

327
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:48,340
As well as stomach contents...

328
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,260
Horizontal two times, vertically three times.

329
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:12,300
The contents of the stomach too still no results.

330
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,740
Yes.

331
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,700
Regarding the drugs also definitely not yet.

332
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:22,731
Yes.

333
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,199
You must be busy because lots to check.

334
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,739
But please help.

335
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:30,875
It feels like a million years of waiting because there are no instructions to follow.

336
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm afraid I can't catch the perpetrator...

337
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,100
I'll hang up the phone first.

338
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,784
Good grief!

339
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,580
What about the time? I ask you to check it?

340
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,220
You mean the mushrooms?

341
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,540
The mushroom is right comes from a corpse.

342
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,040
NAME: LEE YEON-JU REQUEST AUTOPSY: CAUSE OF DEATH

343
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,620
Other?

344
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,741
You guessed it, I guess.

345
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,229
Not guessing.

346
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,065
But rational suspicion.

347
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,220
That's what I mean.

348
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,260
You have to share rational suspicion is...

349
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,255
...so that in the future I can focus on you.

350
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,400
SMALL EVIDENCE EXAMINATION REPORT

351
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:25,532
When I was in college, I practiced anatomy. during the first semester summer vacation.

352
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,391
At that time, our group's cadavers looks like it wasn't preserved properly...

353
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:31,976
...so that mushrooms appear.

354
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:35,751
Once the practice starts, we have to work with the cadaver for several weeks.

355
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,485
But as the day changed, the fungus is spreading more and more.

356
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:40,020
Because of that...

357
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,008
Every time before out of anatomy room...

358
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:46,485
...I sprayed disinfectant and scrubbed vigorously with a brush until it makes a sound.

359
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:48,980
In that case...

360
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,734
...maybe the perpetrator is someone who has medical knowledge.

361
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,660
Or even the opposite.

362
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,013
That's a stupid way.

363
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,935
He probably used the same brush for washing dishes, even cleaning.

364
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,460
For him, the corpse might not be more than just an object.

365
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,780
I got goosebumps hearing that.

366
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:17,540
Actually, the mushroom is indeed detected to be from plastic pieces.

367
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,896
It's hard to say exactly what plastic it is. what type because plastic is very common.

368
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:28,358
But from the shape and thickness of the plastic, seems to be true from the cleaning brush.

369
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:31,620
In the future, please let me know if you have a point of view. Don't keep it to yourself.

370
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,660
Thanks for checking results quickly.

371
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,260
Wait, what is Doctor Oh today? This guy said he didn't go to work?

372
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:42,884
Why?

373
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:45,420
You guys fought?

374
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:48,860
It was true that they were fighting, apparently.

375
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,124
What is the problem?

376
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,620
It seems you expecting trouble.

377
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:57,246
What?

378
00:24:57,271 --> 00:24:58,740
Is this really kindergarten?

379
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:01,100
Absent from work just because of a fight.

380
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,180
So, just get cleaning brush?

381
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:13,055
We have no clue.

382
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:16,031
Still haven't got anything from this stalker case?

383
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:16,820
Yes.

384
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:18,780
So far, there is still no...

385
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:25,409
Not only the suspects, you guys even have no clue to go after him.

386
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:26,267
Good grief.
Excuse me.

387
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,020
So what?

388
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:31,732
How the investigation you guys in the future?

389
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:32,340
Yes.

390
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:36,582
Because there was no indication that the body was bent, It is suspected that the victim was transported in a large car.

391
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:38,695
I am analyzing CCTV intersection.

392
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,740
We plan to focus on investigating the driver. suspicious box car or van.

393
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,451
The idea of checking CCTV in that T-junction isn't bad either.

394
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,697
Of course it has to be checked.

395
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:49,500
Correct.

396
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,286
There is no good case this was left for a long time.

397
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,753
Prioritize arrest the suspect!

398
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:55,460
Yes.

399
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,790
Where are you going?

400
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:09,764
Yes?

401
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:11,340
Not analyzing CCTV at the intersection?

402
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:14,126
Of course.

403
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,156
But...

404
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:17,161
We will do it tomorrow when the mind is bright.

405
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,058
See you tomorrow.

406
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,220
You've worked hard.

407
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:25,540
Come on, quickly.

408
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,060
Yes.

409
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:41,638
CLEANING BRUSH

410
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:48,660
That's not possible.

411
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,657
CLEANING BRUSH

412
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,384
I'm sure time he's dead.

413
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,613
PEOPLE SEARCH SERVICE

414
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,004
FAMILY PROBLEMS, EVIDENCE COLLECTION, PERSONAL PROBLEMS, COMPANY PROBLEMS

415
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,111
WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE SHINE ACTING FROM THE LATE ACTRESS KANG MYUNG-JOO
