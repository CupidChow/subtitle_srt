00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,462
Eun-seo, why don't you
sleep? and is it outside?

9
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Father.

10
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:38,940
Something like this shouldn't happen.

EPISODE 13

14
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,850
There is a stab wound in the left
abdomen patients and severe bleeding.

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,761
How is the condition?

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,872
In the ambulance can only maintain
blood pressure by administering volume.

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,080
- You can just come in, right? - Yes, can.

18
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,264
- Have you called another doctor? - Yes.

19
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,917
- Where is the patient's guardian?
- Yes, it is me!

20
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,621
What happened?

21
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,820
Yes, female patients experience
beatings and his fingers were cut off.

22
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,700
The male patient was stabbed twice.

23
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:13,783
We brought him here right
away. Will they be okay?

24
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,194
We have to see it.

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:20,219
I don't know much about the condition of the female patient,
but the condition of the male patient is difficult to ascertain.

26
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,681
What happened? What does it
mean? Chairman Jung is a victim?

27
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,536
Then who is the perpetrator?

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,266
Escape while holding hostages small
children who were at the location.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,759
Off again?

30
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,620
Did you just say "again"?

31
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,976
Why use informal language?

32
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,345
That's right, right?

33
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,393
You've failed to catch me twice.
Perpetrators because they acted alone.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,548
Acting alone?

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,220
This jerk is really annoying.

36
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,075
What were you doing at that time?

37
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,896
- What do you know about the situation...
- Stop.

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
You just stay at home!

39
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:47,257
- Why are you still... - Good grief!

40
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,367
It's only natural.

41
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:48,949
Unlucky.

42
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,729
Chairman Jung is like that...

43
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,594
was Choi Min-guk's doing.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,840
When Chairman Jung and Senior Jeon
proposes Choi Min-guk's examination...

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,211
what did you say then?

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,481
If only you had allowed
that time we move together...

47
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,040
he won't be like that.

48
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:14,316
Unlucky.

49
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:27,640
Why can't you be contacted?

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,478
You received a message
from Chairman Jung or not?

51
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,541
That's enough.

52
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,856
You still have scribbled documents while
investigating the Blue Tong case, right?

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,329
Send it all to me.

54
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:37,642
Photos, memos, everything.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
We can't get on the boat?

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Se-eun.

57
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,514
This is because of Brother.

58
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,377
We missed the boat because of you.

59
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:59,160
I told you Dad was late,
but brother said it hurts...

60
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,085
Look at this.

61
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,760
This is also because of
Brother pulling me hard.

62
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,612
Do you know your brother? bring that spray?

63
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:14,713
It seems like Dad told
me to you carry the stuff.

64
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,670
Right?

65
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,363
OPERATING TIME 47 MINUTES

66
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,094
He dared to stab a detective?

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,120
This can't be allowed to continue
any longer and let's catch him.

68
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:03,285
Please return our team immediately
and we have to catch him.

69
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,993
So, I mean...

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,680
What about the evidence? he
is the perpetrator of our case?

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,242
Still nothing.

72
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:14,161
Because until now, Seo Se-hyun still has
the status of the original perpetrator...

73
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:16,418
what if we catch him...

74
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,280
as an identity forger or
attempted murder, Chairman Hong?

75
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,046
This will be very troublesome...

76
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,903
if the victim of the case The fifth
was accused of kidnapping the suspect.

77
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:25,927
Can't.

78
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,680
We have to check on Choi Min-guk.
As an accomplice of the perpetrator.

79
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,120
Haven't we said it many times?

80
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,982
Choi Min-guk is weird!

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
What are you doing?

82
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:42,433
So, do you think it is a good idea to
put the body of the victim he killed...

83
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:46,440
in the bathroom of
his own house is it normal?

84
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,779
Yes?

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Even the most psychopathic person
burying his victims in the ground!

86
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,200
Jong-su, you...

87
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't you take care of them? Do you?
Know they do independent investigations?

88
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,651
Don't know.

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,011
Your boss doesn't know?

90
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:06,200
Isn't this happening because of the children?
Who was suspended for acting without permission?

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,976
And you're chasing the same person has
nothing to do with the direction of this case!

92
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,504
If you really want to rebel, at
least take a little responsibility.

93
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,600
But what is this?

94
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:22,440
Anyway, we investigate
this case separately.

95
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,965
Let go of Choi Min-guk's hand first.

96
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Chairman Hong.

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,440
Since Seo Se-hyun has been caught, interrogate
him first when he regains consciousness.

98
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,541
Our team members!

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,000
Stabbed by that bastard.

100
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:40,115
This situation was enough to make
him suspected of being his accomplice.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,880
Who says you can't catch it?

102
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:45,772
We got a report serial killer case.

103
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:48,839
Show that we is focusing on that case.

104
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:52,975
Choi Min-guk is handled by the
department crime also seems better.

105
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,054
Looks good?

106
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,786
Do you know what the
most make me regret now?

107
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,402
When Chairman Hong
talking about the gang...

108
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:05,920
I forbid them if I
dare dig up that cold case!

109
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,853
Because we are sure treated like this!

110
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,244
Cold case?

111
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,752
What nonsense is this?

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,838
Mr. Head of Office, you have to see this.

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Please turn it on.

114
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:22,996
Isn't that Choi Min-guk?

115
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:24,052
Correct.

116
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,283
It's Choi Min-guk.

117
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:29,760
But in the case of the Blue Harbor
Barrel Cheongun 1999, he is Go Doo-sam.

118
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,244
Oh my gosh, why? the
problem becomes like this?

119
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:39,999
What does it mean that
Doctor Seo was kidnapped?

120
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:42,376
Doesn't that mean there
are other perpetrators?

121
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,242
You don't need to worry.

122
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,252
Doctor Seo is not the culprit either...

123
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,960
he has dropped the good
name of the Forensic Agency.

124
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,704
But, since he has been arrested
police and will start investigating...

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
we also have to prepare.

126
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,121
Even though we have passed
through a period of crisis.

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
This is really giving me a headache.

128
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:06,600
What does it mean?

129
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,517
Nothing has changed, Doctor Cheon.

130
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:14,720
Therefore, do not interfere
and shut your mouth.

131
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:20,296
Doctor Seo is still proven to have falsified
evidence Nam Seung-hyup's case to The Tailor.

132
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,947
Isn't he not involved?
With the Nam Seung-hyup case?

133
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,033
What?

134
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:29,574
I know you're thinking about it because
have been working with him for a long time.

135
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:34,203
Doctor Seo keeps asking for
retests Nam Seung-hyup case sample.

136
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,554
- But that day you... - What?

137
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,440
Who signed the report Nam
Seung-hyup's autopsy results?

138
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,556
Who changed the evidence
in the Yongcheon case?

139
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,655
These are the cases I have handled together
Doctor Seo for the past three years.

140
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:51,960
INTRODUCTION OF THE
INCIDENT MAKGEOLLI CYANIDE

141
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,720
I have checked and double check everything.

142
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,744
Everything is clean.

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,630
Doctor Cheon.

144
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:02,560
So far Doctor Seo has never
tried falsifying or hiding results.

145
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,666
He must have a reason
regarding the Yongcheon case.

146
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:08,160
Therefore, we also have
to step in and help...

147
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,382
Wake up!

148
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:12,341
He is a murderer.

149
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,815
We must side with those
who deserve to be defended.

150
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:16,920
What is this nonsense?

151
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,855
Come on, run!

152
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,160
Se-eun!

153
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,303
Se-eun!

154
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:41,889
Se-eun!

155
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:43,572
Se-eun!

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,561
I have to know where he was taken.

157
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:04,856
SEO SE-HYUN THE PERPETRATOR OF
MURDER CASE, FAKE AUTOPSY REPORT?!

158
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,057
Why is there no news?

159
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:15,712
Sit properly.

160
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:24,025
Do that until you
understand what you did wrong.

161
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Understand?

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,164
Look carefully don't
until something is missed.

163
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,423
Yes I understand.

164
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:33,697
How much longer?

165
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,150
Still a long time.

166
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,310
We only search via facial recognition.

167
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,620
We should check at least 800
thousand men over 50 years old.

168
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,658
This will just be a waste of
time if there is no comparison.

169
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,494
Ensuring his identity is a priority
us. Please do it as soon as possible.

170
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:49,572
Yes.

171
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:51,503
Chairman Hong.

172
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:54,167
Laundry searches and Choi
Min-guk's house is finished.

173
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,508
We got nothing because it has been cleaned.

174
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,697
But we found something
strange on Seo Se-hyun's route.

175
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,158
After putting a book on the
shelf, he immediately left.

176
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,713
Why did he look for the camera first?

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,517
The thing he hid also a little strange.

178
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,016
When is the date of this CCTV?

179
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,713
Just before the incident occurred
attempted murder at the laundry.

180
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,024
He hides things here before
going to see Choi Min-guk?

181
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:22,800
He put all the other evidence
in his house except this one...

182
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,320
and like to be seen?

183
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:42,424
YOON SE EUN

184
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,680
Se-eun.

185
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:51,146
Se-eun.

186
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Se-eun.

187
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,300
Come to Father.

188
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,246
Se-eun!

189
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:03,376
Se-eun.

190
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:08,480
Se-eun, come here!

191
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,163
Se-eun, what's wrong with you?

192
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,910
You can't get away from me.

193
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:15,656
Se-eun, hurry!

194
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:16,681
Se-eun.

195
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,616
Father will forgive you.

196
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,002
Se-eun!

197
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,000
Miss Seo, are you awake?

198
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,040
The operation is complete.

199
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,600
Is there anything uncomfortable?

200
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:40,712
Chairman Jung...

201
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:42,897
Yes?

202
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,600
What about people? brought with me?

203
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:52,642
Even though it has passed a critical
period, the wound is very deep.

204
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:55,080
We have to monitor his recovery condition.

205
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,198
That means, Cho Min-guk...

206
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:21,972
pretending to be a laundry
owner to get around Yoncheon City?

207
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:23,053
That's right.

208
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:25,055
But what is more surprising is...

209
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:28,881
he deliberately limped to deceive other
people so as not to be considered suspects.

210
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,080
He is absolutely amazing.

211
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,517
Damn, what do you mean he's amazing?

212
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,320
He's a psychopathic killer.

213
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:38,855
Wait a minute.

214
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:40,640
The address is correct here.

215
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,120
- Here? - Yes.

216
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,480
How about now?

217
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,760
It seems like there's nothing we can get.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,200
Because it's been more than 20 years.

219
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:56,680
I will try to meet the residents.

220
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes, let's try asking.

221
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:01,805
Wait a moment.
Pack!

222
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,343
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a question.

223
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,985
How about this?

224
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,625
That day...

225
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:32,440
When I said can't believe you...

226
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,067
Excuse me.

227
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,309
I am better?

228
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,039
Yes.

229
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:56,457
You already know you are
wanted publicly as a suspect?

230
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,106
Yes.

231
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,871
As there is a lot of direct
evidence found in your home...

232
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,337
we have absolutely nothing
another obstacle to accusing you.

233
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:07,379
It is just...

234
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:08,986
There is something bothering me.

235
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,325
We need your explanation regarding
this your relationship with Choi Min-guk.

236
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:17,480
Has Chairman Jung regained consciousness?

237
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:19,817
Answer my question.

238
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,614
Please introduce me to him.

239
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,295
I ask again.

240
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
What is your relationship
with Choi Min-guk?

241
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,774
YOON SE EUN

242
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:35,798
So what is this?

243
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,599
We found it today on your route.

244
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,623
YOON SE EUN

245
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,648
Yoon Se-eun.

246
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,960
What is your real name?

247
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:58,192
The guy said it was around here.

248
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,575
FORGET-ME-NOT FLOWERS

249
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,201
Right there.

250
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,493
I know Jung-mi very well.

251
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,880
Right next to here there is
a drinking shop owned by him.

252
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:11,610
He struggled to live alone with
his daughter by doing business...

253
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,101
but she met the wrong man.

254
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,356
What's wrong with him?

255
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,378
We are finding out about Go Doo-sam...

256
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:22,067
who is Lee Jung-mi's husband.

257
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,400
This person.

258
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,680
He's not the one.

259
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,165
What?

260
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:30,520
Then who is he?

261
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,291
His name is...

262
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,067
Wait a minute, if I'm not
mistaken His surname is Yoon.

263
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,440
Yoon Jo Kyun!

264
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,559
I don't forget the name
the man is a jerk apparently.

265
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,877
Gosh, we didn't know that either.

266
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,817
We know he is Lee Jung-mi's husband.

267
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:47,871
Yes, please identify.

268
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:48,909
Yes, man.

269
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,281
Yoon Jo Kyun.

270
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,699
That's because before meeting Go Doo-sam...

271
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,051
they live together with
the status of a secret marriage.

272
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,840
They lived together for quite a long
time their respective biological daughters.

273
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,080
That is how it is.

274
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
So?

275
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:10,939
The man made Jung-mi
life is very miserable...

276
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:13,471
like a parasite.

277
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:18,075
That's why Jung-mi recorded it
first. her marriage to Go Doo-sam...

278
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,400
who often helps out at the shop.

279
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:23,197
To get away from that bastard Yoon.

280
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:27,665
Well then, the news is very good. It's
a big deal in this neighborhood, right?

281
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:31,864
A mother goes to throw her daughter
away to run away with another man.

282
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,154
Of course Jung-mi was insulted like that.

283
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,852
They ran away at night just the two of us.

284
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,450
Is that true? When did that happen?

285
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:45,428
Let me remember. 1998 or 1999?

286
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,508
I don't remember clearly.

287
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,760
But, that's still the
case the mystery now is...

288
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,960
he is not the one who
will throw away his own child.

289
00:18:56,412 --> 00:19:00,120
I don't know what made
him so sick of that guy.

290
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,373
By the way...

291
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Is that damn Yoon causing trouble
now? by claiming to be Go Doo-sam?

292
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:09,360
- Chang Jin. - Yes?

293
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:13,129
Why?

294
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:18,675
IDENTITY CONFIRMATION
DOCUMENT NAME: YOON JO-KYUN

295
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,710
Geez.

296
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:26,680
Even though Eun-seo is
very beautiful and kind.

297
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,004
He also takes good care of it The
boy's daughter is like his own sister.

298
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,774
You stare at the CCTV camera for a
long time before hiding this book.

299
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,924
Why?

300
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,440
Do you remember Go Eun-seo?

301
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:55,418
He has no history since 2004, the
same year you entered the orphanage.

302
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,736
Then in 2006...

303
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,957
she reportedly died
along with her mother.

304
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,903
Go Eun-seo's father is Go Doo-sam.

305
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:07,278
You know the Blue Tong
case Cheongun Port, right?

306
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:11,957
He is a suspect in the case, but
also the same person as Choi Min-guk.

307
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:15,760
This photo was taken in Haryong
place Go Doo-sam is or rather...

308
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,832
in Choi Min-guk's yard.

309
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:21,643
Then in this place, we found your
and Choi Min-guk's footprints...

310
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:24,205
which we just assumed come there.

311
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,303
You still deny not knowing him?

312
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:35,720
Seo Se Hyun.

313
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,989
Refusing to testify like this now...

314
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,215
there is absolutely no benefit.

315
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:45,902
We don't know what your relationship is
with Choi Min-guk or why he kidnapped you...

316
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:49,728
you have to tell the truth so
that we can can investigate properly.

317
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:52,600
We have no evidence that Choi
Min-guk is the perpetrator.

318
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:54,163
Do you want to cover it yourself?

319
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,282
Doctor Seo.

320
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,135
I will say everything.

321
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:08,794
But...

322
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,709
Please hold a press conference.

323
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,337
Your bleeding is severe.

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Do not talk.

325
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:21,899
Help...

326
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:24,575
Someone help us!

327
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,880
Here...

328
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:30,452
Please call 119!

329
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,560
Please call 119...

330
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:35,960
Help...

331
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,006
Seo Se-hyun, the Agency's renowned forensic
doctor The National Forensics recently...

332
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,046
named as the main suspect
Yongcheon serial murder case...

333
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,410
volunteer to do Press conference.

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,076
Through this press conference,
attention will focus on developments on...

335
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,240
possible confession from Seo Se-hyun
or the emergence of other suspects...

336
00:21:56,265 --> 00:22:00,367
and is it Seo Se-hyun who
also is the doctor in charge...

337
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:05,118
the autopsy process of the late Nam's
case Seung-hyup related to drug delivery...

338
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,185
A little to the left.

339
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Okay.

340
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,998
Go back a little.

341
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,219
CASE PRESS CONFERENCE
YONGCHEON CITY SERIAL MURDERS

342
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:16,254
Chairman Hong.

343
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,582
Is this going to be okay?

344
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:20,448
It would be a sensation
if he say something strange.

345
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,520
Do you have a reason why? have
to speak at a press conference?

346
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:29,021
A famous person like you asks
something impossible like this...

347
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,415
That person will move...

348
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,950
if you see me.

349
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,303
What do you mean?

350
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,724
I will be the bait.

351
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,439
Please.

352
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:10,755
