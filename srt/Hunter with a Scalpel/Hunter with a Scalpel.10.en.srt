00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:02,340
This is a mother and her two daughters.

00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:03,410
Like us.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,779
Like us...

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Snow White is the older sister...

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,540
...Mawar Merah is the younger sister.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,784
Then this is the scary bear.

13
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:15,903
Listen carefully, I will read it.

14
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:20,181
On a cold night when white snow fell heavily,

15
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,060
Snow White and Rose Red who lives in a hut in the forest...

16
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,211
...sit by the fire and play in front of her mother who was knitting.

17
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,151
At that moment someone knocked on the door.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,540
"It's a wanderer looking for a place shelter. Please open the door."

19
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:36,100
The girls ran opened the door because of his mother's words.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,380
However, the figure who looked inside their home is a big bear.

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,540
Dad told me not to see Se-eun.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,100
That's dangerous.

23
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,860
Dad, wait a minute.

24
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,933
This is my fault.

25
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,825
Don't lock Se-eun up.

26
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,900
I won't see Se-eun again.

Go Eun Seo.

30
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,380
You know who he is, right?

31
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:56,380
Please answer.

32
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,020
Do you know him?

33
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,262
Se-eun.

34
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:26,860
Older brother.

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,220
"Older brother"?

36
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:45,980
Let's go.

37
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,820
The homeowner said, haven't seen him for two days.

38
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,260
Status of the Scientific Investigation Team?

39
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:19,420
It will be here soon.

40
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:21,660
Have you arrived?

41
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,100
How is the body?

42
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,500
There isn't any.

43
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:28,900
I think you guys should check this out.

44
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:30,260
What's that?

45
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,246
Pancuronium again.

46
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,160
Could this be the Tailor's doing?

47
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,380
Damn, why him? targeting Kwon Hyung-jo?

48
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,332
Hello?

49
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,011
What's up calling at this hour?

50
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,972
Your mother suddenly in hypotensive shock condition.

51
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:18,940
You should go to the hospital immediately.

52
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm coming.

53
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,260
Mr. Choi, is he coming to eat?

54
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,940
No, I just returned the bowl.

55
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:32,980
Are you crying?

56
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:35,023
I'm not crying.

57
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,500
But your eyes are so red.

58
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:39,615
Why?

59
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:41,180
Yes?

60
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,740
What is it?

61
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,909
My son said...

62
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:48,317
...can't come because there is urgent business.

63
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,780
Even though you've been waiting.

64
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,660
What can be done because there is indeed work.

65
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,460
Having a talented child is also a problem.

66
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,460
You must be very sad.

67
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,820
It's okay, still can meet another time.

68
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,820
Mrs. Matna.

69
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,420
Your son will definitely come.

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,420
At this time he must be determine another day.

71
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,220
Is that so?

72
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,518
Of course.

73
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,707
Just like parents think his son. The child is the same.

74
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,420
Children also miss their parents.

75
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,112
They miss their childhood so much when held by his parents.

76
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,956
- Hello. - WELCOME.

77
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,784
- For how many people? - Three people.

78
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,659
Please sit down first.

79
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,799
Yes.

80
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,340
What a disobedient child.

81
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,780
One's own child is the enemy.

82
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,300
In any family...

83
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,380
...the children are like that.

84
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:09,300
Just scold them if you have to be scolded.

85
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,292
Then love with all your heart.

86
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:19,026
Gosh, it's heavy.

87
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,420
Is it getting better?

88
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,900
His condition has become much more stable.

89
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,020
But because of his physical condition recently weakened...

90
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,460
...still far from stable stage.

91
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,900
You like?

92
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,340
Yes.

93
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,300
With this...

94
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,975
...save it...

95
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,020
...many people were injured.

96
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,300
Do not forget.

97
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:16,740
You...

98
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,380
...is a good person.

99
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:22,540
Yes.

100
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:41,221
So, why is it Kwon Hyung-jo that we chase as the perpetrator but disappears?

101
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,935
Why also...

102
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,820
...pancuronium was found which Seo Se-hyun removed from the test results?

103
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,487
So what is this video about?

104
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,020
This alley...

105
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,745
...is near the place leaving Kwon Hyung-jo.

106
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,534
Then it also seems to fit very well estimated time of the crime.

107
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,253
Is Seo Se-hyun a The Tailor we're after?

108
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,846
The results of the examination are still not out.

109
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,792
But there seems to be some overlap in the evidence...

110
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,540
Why do you keep saying 'it seems'? There is a possibility of a fourth case occurring.

111
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,340
You have to say something for sure.

112
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,100
Jung-hyun, speak up.

113
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:15,980
Chairman Jung.

114
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:19,540
You sleep?

115
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,580
Even daydreaming.

116
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,740
What do you think about How is this video related to the case?

117
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,100
Yes.

118
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:31,554
The sender of this video is also still unclear.

119
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:35,100
Doctor Seo was also only recorded was around the time of the incident.

120
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:39,046
We need to make further inquiries regarding this the contents of the suitcase and whether Doctor Seo...

121
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:40,823
...was actually at the scene.

122
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,900
Then what is Kwon Hyung-jo's status? disappear, run away,...

123
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,020
...become a victim, a persecutor, and and so on are also still unclear.

124
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,079
But pancuronium was found there.

125
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,020
It's not an easy drug to get.

126
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:57,300
We think there might be something to this.

127
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,140
So, what is the investigation plan?

128
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,660
Kwon Hyung-jo and Doctor...

129
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,540
Looks like we have to find out their activity route on the day of the incident.

130
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,077
If successful in obtaining evidence from the crime scene...

131
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,860
...we plan conduct an investigation...

132
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,047
...based on suspect identification.

133
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,229
The crime scene evidence results are out.

134
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,442
We have asked the Forensic Agency to speed it up.

135
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,580
Tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

136
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,283
DOCTOR CHEON SU-YEON

137
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,500
Call from them.

138
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,860
Hello, Doctor Cheon? Are the results out yet?

139
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:33,060
Yes.

140
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,114
The blood test results came out first.

141
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:40,393
Blood stains on the scalpel all of which are known to belong to Kwon Hyung-jo.

142
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,999
But, Chairman Jung.

143
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,940
Is this really a scalpel? found at the scene?

144
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,020
Yes, right.

145
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,140
Why?

146
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,940
I don't know how to say it...

147
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,479
But this...

148
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,260
Engraved initials on this scalpel...

149
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,323
...very similar to Doctor Seo's.

150
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm in a meeting right now.

151
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,420
I will contact you again.

152
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,660
What is this?

153
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,620
Doctor Seo is the culprit?

154
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,900
The doctor said his blood pressure it's stable. You can feel at ease.

155
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,198
I'm grateful.

156
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:25,620
Yes.

157
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,539
Do you want to use a nurse again?

158
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,540
- Do you want me to call you? - No...

159
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,380
...I'll be here longer.

160
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,060
Se-eun.

161
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,660
Do not like that.

162
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,180
Excuse me.

163
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,992
Because I was caught by Dad...

164
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:12,780
...you become like this.

165
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,940
"Do not be afraid."

166
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:24,980
"Let him warm up his body. because the weather is very cold."

167
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,820
The mother speaks to her children.

168
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,380
"It's okay, kids."

169
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,020
"He just came to our house to avoid the cold air."

170
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,340
"Quickly help clean it up snow from his fur."

171
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,467
Girls even those who feel safe...

172
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,220
...start with caution brushing the snow off his fur.

173
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,980
The bear lay down next to him the furnace and snore comfortably.

174
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:53,061
The long winter passed, spring is coming.

175
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,617
The bears have to go and said to the girls...

176
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,860
The bear said to the girls.

177
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,060
So far...

178
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:05,504

Have found?

199
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,700
The nurse said he was still here.

200
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,900
Senior Jeon and I will ask the hospital.

201
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:20,349
Yes.

202
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,710
Senior Jang and Senior Park go to Yongcheon.

203
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,519
Please start searching the room. Seo Se-hyun and investigate around.

204
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,540
- Yes. - We understand.

205
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,780
Let's go.

206
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,781
THIS SHOP IS UNDER CCTV

207
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:55,281
SISTER EUN-SEO'S PROMISE

208
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm sorry, Se-eun.

209
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,180
As a replacement...

210
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:06,340
...this time I will throw a birthday party years for you without Father's knowledge.

211
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,300
He always comes alone.

212
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,300
We never saw the other family.

213
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,940
It's been five years since Mother Seo is being treated here.

214
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:33,484
Even though I came late at night, he always massages her...

215
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,220
...invite him to chat, and read the book.

216
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,632
During that time he was consistent do it as a child.

217
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,468
Even though it is not an easy thing.

218
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:50,140
Mother Seo always said like this when conscious.

219
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,580
He is a gift from God.

220
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,780
Where are we going now?

221
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,180
He is not in the hospital or a forensic lab.

222
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,140
Let's go back to Yongcheon first.

223
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,359
Let's go to Haryong.

224
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:13,140
Yes?

225
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:14,420
Now?

226
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,180
He can't possibly come back to Yongcheon now.

227
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,740
He must have gone home the perpetrator of the Blue Tong case.

228
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,039
There must be a reason for him hiding pancuronium.

229
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:28,060
The substance is also exactly the same as substance content in the Blue Tong case.

230
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:31,980
You're right.

231
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:37,180
Seo Se-hyun's existence is also unknown. known. Let's just look for everything.

232
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,660
Come on.

233
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,140
The forensic doctor in charge in this case is the perpetrator.

234
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,500
Does this situation make sense?

235
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,540
Isn't the room too empty? even if it's only temporarily occupied?

236
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:54,620
Let's just check it out quickly.

237
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,580
Yes.

238
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:10,980
What's this?

239
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,540
This is totally inappropriate with him, right?

240
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,265
What's that?

241
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,109
Unlucky.

242
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,100
What's this?

243
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,781
Damn it!

244
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,220
Where do we want to go?

245
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:51,020
Yes?

246
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:52,220
How?

247
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,580
What?

248
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,500
Found what?

249
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:05,620
Miss.

250
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:08,700
Miss!

251
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,020
Follow him.

252
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,340
Wait, Miss!

253
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,020
Miss.

254
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:29,340
Miss.

255
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,835
Forgive us.

256
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,420
I feel really bad.

257
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,780
The situation in Yongcheon is also odd.

258
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,340
Are we going to be okay?

259
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,500
It looks like no one lives here.

260
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,700
But isn't this crazy?

261
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,380
How could he openly...

262
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,800
...put his partner's body in a bucket like equipment?

263
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:16,700
It's obviously his, right?

264
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,900
Let's try to get in first.

265
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:47,780
Chairman Jung.

266
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:50,460
Here.

267
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,500
What's this?

268
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:31,340
This is paint.

269
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,940
It doesn't seem like long ago.

270
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,900
The shoes I see at Doctor Seo's house...

271
00:24:57,587 --> 00:25:00,620
The back is swept away so that the shape of the shoe is not clear.

272
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:03,820
Does it look clear?

273
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:06,620
Choi Min-guk!

274
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:33,799
LAUNDRY

275
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,300
You're late.

276
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:00,660
Already eaten?

277
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,100
Around your house...

278
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,220
...there are many police.

279
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,620
This would not have happened if you listen to what Dad said.

280
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:45,500
You!

281
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:48,758
Feed me? How dare!

282
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,780
With your dirty hands...

283
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:57,180
...you touched my mother's bed.

284
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,580
Where is your box car?

285
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:27,422
Where?

286
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:09,220
How dare you...

287
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,780
...you bared your fangs at Father.

288
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,660
That's not allowed.

289
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,580
Relax so you don't get hurt.

290
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,712
Welcome home.

291
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:06,481
My daughter.
