1
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,630
HUNTER WITH A SCALPEL

2
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,670
Get out, get out, damn it!

3
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,330
What the hell, move!

4
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,620
Chief

5
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,500
We need to collect the evidence now

6
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
So I think you’ll need to return the knife

7
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,670
It was wrapped with something anyway

8
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,750
so nothing will come out from it

9
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,210
Um, Chief, the knife...

10
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,170
Oh dear

11
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,380
I told you we’re sending the body for autopsy

12
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,010
You came in person?

13
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,600
Just dropped by on the way

14
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,220
Wow, in any case

15
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,390
Your passion is something else…

16
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,810
The victim is Nam Seung Hyup

17
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,360
29 years old, professional baseball player

18
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,690
He was attacked at 2AM today while off guard

19
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,240
An open space with a large crowd

20
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,910
A knife swung without hesitation

21
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,700
The culprit acted impulsively

22
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,790
but felt no fear at all

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,830
Was it really necessary to stab the neck?

24
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,210
Pardon?

25
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,790
They must’ve already known he’d die anyway

26
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,340
Hmm, then it could be a crime driven by grudge

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,340
Did they enjoy it?

28
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,600
The knife went in slowly

29
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,390
There’s a certain resonance when a person is dying

30
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,520
In this case,

31
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,110
that feeling would’ve transferred through the hand

32
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,030
They must’ve enjoyed that sensation

33
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,490
Mm, that’s brutal

34
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,620
But how do you know all that?

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,910
I heard it from someone long ago

36
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
Anyway, in this case

37
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,790
They were either on drugs

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,670
Or a psychopath

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Mm, we’re actually investigating

40
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,930
some junkies in that room over there

41
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,720
Let go! Ah!

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,930
- Do you know who my dad is? - Uh, yes

43
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,220
Hey, he touched me!

44
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,520
My leg hurts, damn it!

45
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,730
Get up, you bastard

46
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,270
- Let go, damn it! - Hey, hey, hey

47
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,850
Damn it

48
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,150
Excessive self-defense and aggression

49
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,860
Uh, this is dangerous, okay? Please step outside

50
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,320
- He’s not someone who’d kill - Let go, damn it!

51
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,030
- Don’t come closer - Hey, drop the knife, man

52
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,830
- Drop it! Damn it, hey! - Don’t come near me!

53
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,410
Try holding it again

54
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,330
Shit...

55
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,910
No, that’s not it

56
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,670
You have to hold it like this

57
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,960
If you hold it like that, you couldn't even kill a bug

58
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,050
You bastard!

59
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,780
Wanna give it a try?

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,830
He’s definitely high on drugs

61
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,500
Yet he’s not shaken at all in this situation

62
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,750
A knife stained with blood

63
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,550
And those eyes that seem pleased by it

64
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,680
This yours, huh?

65
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,050
You son of a bitch!

66
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,940
Bloodstained clothes were found in the restroom

67
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,570
- Check it - Yes, sir

68
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,740
This belongs to that bastard

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,700
- Take him in! - Yes!

70
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,740
Ah, damn it...

71
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,270
Huh, that’s weird

72
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,850
It’s definitely on

73
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,850
- Then why isn’t there any heat…

74
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,070
It’s broken

75
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,320
Sitting in a car with no heater… What are we doing?

76
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,070
I mean, it’s just a simple stalking case reported by Women & Youth Unit

77
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,870
Why do we have to do a stakeout?

78
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,160
It’s not just stalking It’s already the third time

79
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,370
The descriptions all match He’s definitely targeting someone

80
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,880
Scum like that needs to be caught early If we miss the timing…

81
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Ugh, it’s way too cold I can’t take it anymore

82
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,260
I’m gonna go buy something warm What about you, Team Leader?

83
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,880
You stay in the car, no need…

84
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,850
Ahh, that’s nice

85
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,650
Ugh

86
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,770
How did trash like that end up here?

87
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,440
What a frustrating bastard, geez

88
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,000
- Hey, stay still - Damn it!

89
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,050
Hey, come here Hey! Over here, hey, hey! Come here!

90
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,220
- Let go! - Stay still, stay still

91
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,760
Hey!

92
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,550
What do you think you’re doing?

93
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Come here

94
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,260
Get inside

95
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,600
This kid was stealing chocolate

96
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,600
Chocolate? What are you going to do?

97
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,980
What else? Take him to the station and contact his parents

98
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,440
We’re on a stakeout right now

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,820
Stakeout, my ass

100
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,990
Oh please, just because you

101
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,780
studied a bit of criminal psychology at the police academy

102
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,160
doesn’t mean you know the field

103
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,410
That guy’s not coming

104
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,330
Let me go!

105
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,210
So you're staging a protest now?

106
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,080
You really talk out of line

107
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,420
They say a needle thief becomes a cow thief, you know?

108
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,710
These kinds of kids become criminals later

109
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,550
Violent crimes, stabbing people and all that

110
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,470
- Let him go! - Stay still, damn it!

111
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,510
Don’t jump to conclusions

112
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,050
- He’s still a kid, a warning would be enough— - Team leader!

113
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,770
Have you raised any kids? I’m raising two boys this small

114
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,810
I know talking doesn’t work, so step aside

115
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,600
I handle things my own way

116
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,400
- Stay still! Ugh… - Sir!

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,150
Ah…

118
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,610
Sigh…

119
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,690
Hey, stay still

120
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,030
Sit down, sit down

121
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,910
Sigh…

122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,390
Move!

123
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,860
Move, move! Out of the way, damn it!

124
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,230
Move, damn it!

125
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,880
Damn it!

126
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,200
Tell Director Hong

127
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,120
The driver who turned himself in for the hit-and-run isn’t the culprit

128
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,620
Mr. Lee Sang-jun’s cause of death

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,330
has been confirmed as strangulation due to neck compression

130
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,770
Mr. Lee Sang-jun

131
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,100
- You said there was an inheritance issue with his brother? - Yes

132
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,980
Tell them to start the investigation from there

133
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,230
Make sure to get the time and place of their interviews

134
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,610
Sir, are you going again?

135
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,740
The detectives really hate it when you show up…

136
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, Dr. Chun

137
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,710
That dead skin sample is likely the suspect’s

138
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,170
So get it to DNA analysis today—

139
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm already on my way

140
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,050
I'll be back!

141
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,370
Nam Seung-hyub

142
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,200
You didn’t get retested for drugs?

143
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,660
Uh, no, not yet

144
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Why not?

145
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,800
Request the retest today and get the results by tomorrow

146
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,720
If they say no, camp out in front of the toxicology department

147
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,390
Yes, Writer

148
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
Yes, I’m actually on my way right now

149
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,530
Ugh, this is so f***ing annoying

150
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,070
Hey

151
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,570
Hey!

152
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,530
Didn’t the chief tell us to keep a low profile?

153
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,200
Didn't he? You bastard!

154
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,570
I’m sorry

155
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,870
We’ve tracked the escape route and—

156
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,910
Do you have *any* proof that bastard’s the culprit?

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,910
We're still in the early investigation stage, but—

158
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,830
Male, mid-170cm, about 70kg

159
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,750
He matches the general description from witnesses

160
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,300
You think guys who are 170cm and 70kg are rare around here?

161
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,630
He ran as soon as he saw us

162
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,840
We’ll identify him and secure evidence as quickly as possible—

163
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,840
Secure what?

164
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,590
Yes, we’ll definitely catch him

165
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Wow, this guy…

166
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,520
Are you dense or just not listening?

167
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,390
Get out. If you stay here, I swear—

168
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm gonna cause an incident. Take this guy out

169
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,270
Get out, you punk!

170
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Damn it, seriously…

171
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,900
Jeez

172
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,530
Tsk…

173
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,320
Ugh…

174
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,160
Damn it…

175
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,950
Is it badly bruised?

176
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,250
Sir, did everything go well?

177
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,830
Ugh, that temper of his—acting up again, damn it. Tsk.

178
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,340
You're just fanning the flames of a burning house

179
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,840
In situations like that, you should just say you'll hand the case over again

180
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
When someone’s that worked up, just say you’ll give it back and deal with it later

181
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,390
Isn’t that obvious?

182
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,720
If you start something, you should see it through

183
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,350
Excuse me, Team Leader. You said it yourself earlier

184
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,180
We're still in the early investigation stage

185
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,140
Then why go so far—

186
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,700
Why make enemies with the Chief?

187
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,990
Don't be in such a rush

188
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,830
Try to be more realistic, more flexible, okay?

189
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,210
You can totally handle things more smoothly, without conflict

190
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,040
Mister, please let me go home. My little brother’s all alone

191
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,380
Did you contact her parents?

192
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Yes. Uh, she said she doesn’t have any

193
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,630
Then any guardians?

194
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,090
Well, she has a grandmother

195
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,640
But she recently had a fall and is hospitalized

196
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,970
So, currently, she has no one

197
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,510
We checked, and it's true

198
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,220
Looks like welfare services missed her case

199
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,730
So for now, we’ve requested temporary protection at the child welfare center

200
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,440
Ha… seriously…

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,700
Now, this person has been drawing a lot of attention lately

202
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,790
In the case of the recent acid attacks targeting children,

203
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,960
they played a key role in identifying the real culprit

204
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,670
From the National Forensic Service, Seoul Institute of Forensic Science,

205
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,510
we welcome Chief Seo Se-hyun

206
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,260
Welcome, Chief Seo

207
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,090
Hello, I'm Seo Se-hyun

208
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,600
Thank you for having me

209
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,970
Mr. Choi, what are you doing?

210
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,640
Oh? Chairman, you're here?

211
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,480
I already delivered your laundry this morning

212
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,860
I know, I’m just bored

213
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,690
And I was wondering if Mr. Choi had eaten

214
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,740
You really are the only one who takes care of me, Chairman

215
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,660
Glad you know it

216
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
But hey

217
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,330
What happened with Ms. Park from that hair salon by the river?

218
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,870
Why did she turn you down again?

219
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,870
Ah…

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,290
Don't tell me it’s because she wasn’t a young lady?

221
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,130
Should I maybe shave a few years off my age?

222
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,420
Oh, don’t say things like that

223
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,130
She’s way out of my league

224
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,220
Who am I to say whether I like her or not?

225
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,140
What’s wrong with Mr. Choi?

226
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,720
They say he even got the nickname “Ghost”

227
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
Hard-working, good-looking…

228
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,440
I think they called me that because I liked anatomy class

229
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,810
You have no idea how many women

230
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,400
in Yongcheon are after Mr. Choi

231
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,320
You're probably the only one who thinks that, Chairman

232
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,110
It’s called invisible stitching

233
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,450
Oh my

234
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,580
So even when sewing up corpses, you do invisible stitching?

235
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,740
Colleagues say that this unique stitching method

236
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,290
is your personal way of expressing mourning

237
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,710
That’s what they testified

238
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,330
Would you say that’s true?

239
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,300
I think they exaggerated a little

240
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,130
You were accepted into Seoul Med School

241
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,760
At 17 years old, right?

242
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,220
Yes, that’s right

243
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,140
I started school a bit earlier than most

244
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,270
And you passed the national medical exam at 21, the youngest ever

245
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,100
Then worked as a forensic pathologist

246
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,440
Helping uncover the truth behind numerous cases—

247
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,700
Here, take this

248
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,290
It’s fine

249
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,300
If you don’t want it, give it to your brother

250
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,810
Relax your eyes, kid

251
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,730
I’m not giving this to you out of pity

252
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,900
And also

253
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,230
This is my number

254
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,240
Call me if you need anything

255
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,410
Hyung!

256
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,080
Why are you out here?

257
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,290
I told you not to go outside, it's dangerous

258
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,000
You said you'd be back soon. What took so long?

259
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,340
I was really scared all by myself

260
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,550
Ah, sorry

261
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,680
Here, take this

262
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,140
Wow, it looks yummy!

263
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,390
Thanks for the food!

264
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,440
Thank you

265
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,980
Let's go.

266
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,060
I knew it.

267
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,490
Miss.

268
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,910
How many times do I have to tell you?

269
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,660
I told you not to feed them.

270
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,450
If you keep doing that, stray cats will gather,

271
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,710
and it'll interfere

272
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,380
with my business.

273
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,880
I’ve told you countless times…

274
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,640
What the heck?

275
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,680
Is that guy nuts?

276
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,530
So you wanna go at it, huh?

277
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,450
As the forensic examiner, how did you feel at the time?

278
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
You must’ve looked every day

279
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,920
at the face of the young victim, so disfigured it was unrecognizable,

280
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,750
just to find evidence.

281
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,250
I think fear was the biggest emotion.

282
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,760
Fear that we wouldn’t catch the culprit.

283
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,470
And that there would be another child victim.

284
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,890
I think fear was the biggest emotion.

285
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,190
Fear that we wouldn’t catch the culprit.

286
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,110
"Medical treatment"

287
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,240
And that there would be another child victim.

288
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,740
– Here, this way, this way. – Where?

289
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,670
Oh dear...

290
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,220
Are you sure she’s the one who filed that stalking report last time?

291
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,310
I’m sure.

292
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,480
Damn it. This is going to be a headache.

293
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,060
We should’ve handed it over when we could. Uselessly held onto it. Damn it.

294
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,230
Order an autopsy.

295
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,490
– Understood. – Yes, Chief.

296
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,490
Hey, take Seok-woo

297
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,450
and collect the nearby CCTV footage. Track the suspect’s movements.

298
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes, sir.

299
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,500
– Sir. – Yes?

300
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,920
Please apply for the autopsy warrant immediately.

301
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,840
Got it.

302
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,630
Yes, hyung, it’s me.

303
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,220
I need a favor.

304
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,480
Thank you for your hard work.

305
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,810
– You’re from Yongcheon, right? – Yes.

306
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,770
I’m Detective Jung Jung-hyun from Yongcheon’s Major Crimes Unit.

307
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,780
Your team leader came alone, without any subordinates?

308
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,320
You must be an outcast.

309
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,240
Sorry?

310
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,570
Just kidding. Have a seat.

311
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,240
Ah, okay.

312
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,120
What’s your relationship with Chief Hong Jin-woo from Southern HQ?

313
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,710
He personally called me.

314
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,120
He’s a senior from my school.

315
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,420
Anyway, it’s an honor to meet you in person.

316
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,630
I’ve followed all your cases closely.

317
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,420
The Yeopyeong mass burial case, the Gilchang dismemberment case...

318
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,050
Especially the recent series of acid attacks

319
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,090
in the Seoan area— That was truly legendary.

320
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,560
There was a 99% chance it would remain unsolved.

321
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,850
But you identified the murder weapon exactly…

322
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,100
That’s enough. Let’s stop there.

323
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,060
Ah…

324
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,150
The case file—

325
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,570
You brought it for me, right?

326
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,780
Ah, y-yes.

327
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,320
Here it is.

328
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,450
We received the report and dispatched the team at 4:47 this morning.

329
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,000
The crime scene was near a university,

330
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,040
so the area sees a lot of foot traffic.

331
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,750
And the condition of the body was severe…

332
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,540
Indeed. It says here that the decomposition was extensive.

333
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,760
Yes, but worse than that was the mutilation.

334
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,420
Even at first glance, it was apparent—

335
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,720
it was extremely severe.

336
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
Have you identified Lee Yeon-joo’s personal details?

337
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,810
She was 23, a third-year public administration major at Yongcheon University.

338
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,520
She was on a year-long leave of absence

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,480
to prepare for the police civil service exam.

340
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,730
Her family lives in Seoul, and she was living alone in Yongcheon.

341
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,070
An only child, no boyfriend, no especially close friends.

342
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,360
Estimated time of death: three days ago.

343
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,740
There were signs of external trauma and body exposure.

344
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,200
Due to insect damage, the exact cause of death is unclear.

345
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,780
Do you have anything more to add?

346
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,240
No, I don’t.

347
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,950
Ah, and also—

348
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,290
Near the area of exposure,

349
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,790
something unidentified seemed to be faintly attached.

350
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,540
I’ll confirm it myself and decide what it is.

351
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,090
You’ll wait here, right?

352
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,590
Yes.

353
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,220
Excuse me, Chief Seo.

354
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,470
Please do your best so we can catch the culprit.

355
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,440
The scene being unusually cleanly arranged is odd too.

356
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,020
And the fact that only the stomach was left

357
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,860
while all the organs were removed…

358
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,400
Anyway, that body—

359
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,360
There’s more than one strange thing about it.

360
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,120
If it weren’t strange, we wouldn’t call it a corpse.

361
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,650
Should we take photos first?

362
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,150
Yeah.

363
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,490
- Take a shot here too. - Yes.

364
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,780
Right eyeball removed.

365
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,200
Maggot infestation.

366
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,500
Visually, compared to the decomposition—

367
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,790
the maggots look a little too large.

368
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,170
Let’s determine time of death based on the maggots first.

369
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,250
Okay.

370
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,260
Did you get all the shots?

371
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,300
Yes, I got everything.

372
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,020
There’s petechial hemorrhage in the eyes and gums.

373
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,770
Injection mark.

374
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,030
Signs of drug administration.

375
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,780
Scalpel.

376
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,240
If the victim was subdued using drugs,

377
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,580
then the murderer’s intent wasn’t just to kill.

378
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,380
Something was definitely injected into the vein.

379
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,800
- Run a drug test. - Yes.

380
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,690
The neck was broken.

381
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,730
And in one swift motion.

382
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,740
Bleeding upon incision of the blister.

383
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,160
That’s strange.

384
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,450
Given the level of decomposition, there’s still bleeding…

385
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,170
Seems like the cervical vertebra was snapped very quickly and precisely.

386
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,050
Fracture of the fifth cervical vertebra occurred before death.

387
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,170
Yes.

388
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,310
Smell this.

389
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,070
This smells like bleach.

390
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,990
Yeah, I think it is bleach.

391
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,370
Who went out to the scene?

392
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,410
I did.

393
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,080
What was the condition of the body then?

394
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,040
It was completely sealed in agricultural plastic

395
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,420
and dumped just like that.

396
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,590
The plastic is already being analyzed by forensics.

397
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,840
Open the rest.

398
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,700
Chief.

399
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,820
You might want to take a look at this.

400
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,460
Why is this…

401
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,460
Is it thread?
