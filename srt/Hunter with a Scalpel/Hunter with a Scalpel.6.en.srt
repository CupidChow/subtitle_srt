00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,368
I don't want to.

00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,950
I also want long hair like a big brother.

9
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,330
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,097
You are so beautiful now.

11
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,842
Dad already told me.

12
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:16,527
Se-eun is different from ordinary kids.

13
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,103
If I go out on business with Dad...

14
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,429
...short hair is more comfortable, right?

00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:25,355

How?

18
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,706
It's beautiful, isn't it?

19
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:49,295
Eun-seo.

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,323
Come here.

21
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,636
It's been a long time since you guys took a photo together.

22
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,710
Se-eun, put your hand down.

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,957
Look at the camera.

24
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,394
Look at the camera over there.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,923
Okay, Dad, take a photo.

26
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:14,116

00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,625
You are crazy.

30
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:29,052
He really is insist on being invited to play.

31
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,056
What a bastard.

32
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:34,203
Guilty statement ink what was written today is not yet dry.

33
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:36,502
We were really silenced.

34
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:38,918
Right near the police station.

35
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,776
If the office head knows, he must be furious again.

36
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,470
Unlucky.

37
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:47,694
Watch out.

38
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,945
How is that person can you tell about tonight's case too?

39
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:51,574
- Kick him out. - Yes.

40
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:54,770
Hyung-soo, you're here again.

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,980
For now, please go first.

42
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:57,904
- Yes. - What's that?

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,580
Just one photo.

44
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,234
No photos allowed.

45
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,363
Yes, everyone please leave.

46
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:05,379
You are scared?

47
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:08,846
No.

48
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,862
Who came here first?

49
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:12,886
Yes.

50
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:14,836
We are the authorities.

51
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,320
At 2.24 we got first report of discovery of body.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
We limit the area after identifying this as a crime victim.

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,236
What is the identity of the first reporter? has it been noted?

54
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:24,302
About that...

55
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,129
Looks like he's there.

56
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,063
There.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,227
If you have checked the crime scene, please submit an autopsy letter.

58
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,850
I've finished observing it.

59
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:01,690
You suspect me?

60
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,326
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

61
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:08,283
No, we don't suspect you.

62
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,976
Even though it has been made temporary autopsy site...

63
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:15,565
...but you who don't always autopsy and busy immediately renting a room here.

64
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,364
We feel strange even if your team members become victims.

65
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,156
Is it permitted by the National Forensic Agency?

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,556
Participate in direct investigation and also found a body.

67
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,572
Is there any kind of special promotion?

68
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,995
Promotions that can move you up in position when solving big cases.

69
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,756
Are you guys going to pretend not to know? if your team member dies?

70
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,834
You guys looked at me strangely earlier.

71
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:42,922
But I think, your reactions are even weirder.

72
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:46,185
Oh Min-ho who became the second victim is the forensic expert on this case.

73
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:50,490
But still no one knows why he became a target.

74
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,215
Regarding that, we also...

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,861
That's why our forensic lab is very serious handle this case more than ever before.

76
00:04:55,988 --> 00:05:00,806
Creating a temporary autopsy room at RSU Yongcheon is a form of our commitment.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,517
The problem of job promotion what a surprise.

78
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,696
We were just talking nonsense.

79
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:11,575
Examination is usually done starting from checking the little things.

80
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,944
This is great news.

81
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:16,536
If Doctor Seo can observe directly at the scene like today,

82
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,308
it will be very helpful for the examination.

83
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:23,548
Yes, I'm Jung Jung-hyun.

84
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,427
Yes I understand.

85
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,241
The autopsy report is out.

86
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:31,196
Let's go.

87
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,610
He embarrassed us.

88
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,030
He's really cold.

89
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,838
Doesn't he give you the creeps?

90
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:53,176
That person never once blinking while talking.

91
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,821
Like a person who makes sure his lies will be believed.

92
00:05:58,454 --> 00:05:59,830
You're such a jerk.

93
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:04,701
You think people who work every day dissecting corpses will be cheerful?

94
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,290
What you say doesn't make sense.

95
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,284
Excuse me.

96
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:11,680
They didn't mean it that way.

97
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,053
But our situation is not good either.

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,313
Everything becomes sensitive because it has to be face it without any clue.

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,573
You're right.

100
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,846
This should have been fixed, but I don't have time.

101
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,246
It's cold, right?

102
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,251
It doesn't matter.

103
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:32,631
Excuse me.

104
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:36,804
You must be very surprised.

105
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,292
About the corpse.

106
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,005
Even though there are autopsies every day,

107
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,900
you must be shocked finding a body like that...

108
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,043
I am not afraid.

109
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,365
Because they are dead.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,870
Still, walking alone early morning like that...

111
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,870
...scary things could happen.

112
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,930
I know how you feel because this is your coworker's case.

113
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:06,008
But it can be dangerous to move alone.

114
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,960
We also have to move as a team.

115
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:12,439
But it seems, you always go alone.

116
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,333
Why always talk about that?

117
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:17,550
It's better now.

118
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,570
The main thing is...

119
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,383
...contact me directly if something happens.

120
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,416
Then just in case...

121
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:25,870
This.

122
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:28,559
What's that?

123
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:30,921
This...

124
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:33,582
He is a dangerous man.

125
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:36,208
I feel restless because Doctor Oh is also the target.

126
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,940
I'm just worried.

127
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,099
I'm not sure this will help.

128
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:45,527
After all, if you report it, that means have met the perpetrator.

129
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,233
It's no use.

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,745
Do you want to be monitored 24 hours a day?

131
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:54,866
This.

132
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:56,316
Or supervised.

133
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
Take your pick.

134
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,522
Better than nothing.

135
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,456
HELP 112

136
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,665
We start sampling.

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,463
JUNG MI-YEONG

138
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,343
Judging from the cut surface which is slightly dry towards the inside,

139
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,640
This is a post-mortem cut.

140
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:49,712
Signs of active defense were found and deep passivity throughout the left arm.

141
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,063
FORMER DEFENSE

142
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,577
From wrist to palm...

143
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,516
...it is confirmed that there is skin abrasion.

144
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,795
SKIN ABRASION

145
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,770
There is mucosal bleeding in the vein area.

146
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:04,528
Tweezers.

147
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,303
It looks like there will be something this time.

148
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,520
Look at the camera.

149
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:29,383
Approximately how old are you?

150
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,113
Seven years?

151
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:36,496
Who knows.

152
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,698
I'm not very good at guessing children's ages.

153
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,798
Inside his mouth cavity...

154
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:47,981
...there is a crumpled photo paper between the oropharynx.

155
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,836
Eight centimeters wide.

156
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:59,303
Ten centimeters long.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,480
TEMPORARILY CLOSED Geez...

158
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,012
You must be very surprised.

159
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,292
There is a pair of white legs of a woman...

160
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:48,327
...lying right in front of my house.

161
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:53,032
I can't get in or out. I could only fall and sit there.

162
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:54,230
Geez.

163
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,390
What is this actually about?

164
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,128
Why didn't you call the police? and tell them to get rid of it?

165
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,748
Already.

166
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,206
Eat it.

167
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:06,987
But the girl upstairs in my house...

168
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,297
...immediately restraining me from touching anything until the forensics team arrives.

169
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,172
I mean...

170
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:15,800
Isn't the person who was surprised need to be helped first?

171
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
What a cold woman.

172
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,285
- Come to think of it... - Yes.

173
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,356
- ...that woman brought bad luck here. - What?

174
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:25,643
I'm sure the woman came with a ghost.

175
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:30,076
I feel a strange and cold aura since he rented my house.

176
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,010
By the way...

177
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,215
Where is Mr. Choi at a time like this?

178
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,143
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

179
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,576
Today he said he would come too late.

180
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,195
He says, going to the graves of his wife and children.

181
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,818
- Oh my gosh, I'm so scared. - Oh, poor thing.

182
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,963
DANHYANG VILLAGE, HARYONG

183
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,823
There.

184
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:28,670
Place to live Your father and brother first.

185
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,376
Our house is nicer.

186
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,556
This must be the message the perpetrator sent.

187
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,054
Serial killer usually likes to show off.

188
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:41,120
This kid must have a close relationship with crime.

189
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,203
This is the sea, isn't it?

190
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:49,003
Land from Lee Yeon-ju case also found sodium content.

191
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,588
This means that the location of the incident is areas that contain a lot of salt.

192
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:54,016
Is there something wrong?

193
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,943
Who knows.

194
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,403
We get lax results and cleaning brush from Lee Yeon-ju's body.

195
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:02,403
Lax was also found on Doctor Oh's body.

196
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,382
That reminds me of something.

197
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,793
This is the case presented as a school assignment.

198
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:12,733
The Blue Tong case that occurred at Cheongun Harbor in 1999.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,572
Do you know why there are plastic containers? big blue one worn...

200
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,468
...to clean or make kimchi?

201
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,580
Inside were body parts which is cleaned with lax.

202
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:21,913
Cleaned with what?

203
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:23,983
Of course the cleaning brush.

204
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,553
What do you think?

205
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,850
It seems that's true.

206
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,636
But, isn't it a bit too random to match?

207
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,570
In that case too no thread found.

208
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,482
You're right.

209
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,437
Correct.

210
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,836
In that case there is also no use of the drug pancuronium.

211
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:56,356
If this time a cure is also found with similar content...

212
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,062
...we should be able to push the process.

213
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,535
Approximately when can we receive it? DNA photo and drug content?

214
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:08,703
Doctor Seo?
Yes?

215
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,410
From the photo, there are indeed signs of disappearance. foreign objects with a film cleaner.

216
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,516
But, even if DNA is found,

217
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,783
can be useless if there is no comparison.

218
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,570
It generally takes seven days...

219
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,969
...until you get definite results.

220
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,745
This is an urgent case. Please do it faster.

221
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,691
Even if accelerated, starting from the initial examination,

222
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:32,732
sample collection...

223
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,357
...pre-processing, to analysis, still takes about four days.

224
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:38,829
Yes.

225
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,449
But if possible, please do it as soon as possible.

226
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,830
In our situation we have no direct evidence like now,

227
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,291
the photo earlier maybe so that's the common thread.

228
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:00,619
Am I...

229
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,936
...already said there was no thread from the Blue Tong case?

230
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,616
I've looked into it.

231
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:13,823
I think too,

232
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:17,043
that case is similar to this case.

233
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:07,090
This is my creation.

234
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,033
You want to?

235
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,168
3D MONTAGE IMAGE RESTORATION SYSTEM

236
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,652
We got a clue.

237
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,071
The child in this photo is the key.

238
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,372
But does it make sense? to investigate missing children at this time?

239
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:27,160
How is this investigation? Just throw it all away?

240
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,739
This is an extension of the investigation.

241
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,205
There is a possibility of fingerprints unidentified from these two cases...

242
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:32,987
...belongs to the prodigal son.

243
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:33,987
But Chairman Jung.

244
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:38,470
Missing adult women or children, the investigation will be huge.

245
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,963
What can the four of us do?

246
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,497
First of all, we need to control group to investigate.

247
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:44,920
So I've been thinking about it.

248
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,800
How about we digging into unsolved cases?

249
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,100
The Blue Barrel Case,

250
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,130
mutilation cases that occurred at Cheonghun Harbor in 1999.

251
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:52,988
Jung Hyun!

252
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,555
Are you crazy?

253
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,910
The mass media is ready attack us.

254
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:01,615
You still want to add cases of missing children and cases that are still unsolved?

255
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:05,976
But, cleaning the corpse with lax or mutilation in the joints is very similar...

256
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,326
Noisy!

257
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,441
Regarding additional personnel,

258
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,581
we discuss again after the montage results come out.

259
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,974
Okay? The meeting is over.

260
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,984
Chief!

261
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,593
Without fear of wanting to explore unsolved case.

262
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,971
It's like we're entering an ant's nest.

263
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,310
Unlucky.

264
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,635
No, wait a minute.

265
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,910
Wait, I don't want to quarrel with him.

266
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,798
- Hyukgeun. - I want to persuade.

267
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:31,080
- Yes I know. - We'll be the ones in trouble later.

268
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,473
I know.

269
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,361
But later.
Come on, calm down.

270
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:36,027
Unlucky.

271
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,193
We used to be in Haryong...

272
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,466
...very happy if I think about it again.

273
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,216
Actually, if it wasn't for Eun-seo,

274
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,550
now we are still together.

275
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,730
YOON SE EUN

276
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,314
Father.

277
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,287
Have you come?

278
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,430
MUTILATION CASE CHEONGUN PORT 1999

279
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,749
1999.

280
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:11,184
The Blue Tong mutilation case Cheongun Port.

281
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,425
The only suspect, Go Doo-sam.

282
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,830
Based on the testimony of witnesses who saw,

283
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,676
he was with the victim until the end.

284
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,268
He was arrested at his home located...

285
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:24,147
...in Danhyang Village, Haryong, Chungcheongnam-do.

286
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,533
Released two days later due to weak evidence.

287
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,791
After that, it was removed from the list suspect thanks to citizen petition...

288
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,866
...and the witness who turned out to be is a schizophrenic.

289
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,010
Family relationship.

290
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,007
The wife's name is Lee Jung-mi.

291
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,225
One foster daughter named Go Eun-seo.

292
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,808
Age at that time, nine years old.

293
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,367
SEOKJIN-DONG 24-2 BODY FOUND

294
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,077
Chairman Jung.

295
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:57,751
The montage results are out.

296
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,507
How's it going inside?

297
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:15,363
Dad repainted because you will come.

298
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,723
You look normal...

299
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,137
...than I imagined.

300
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,912
Even though I've made sure with my two eyes...

301
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,780
...your body falling down the mountainside.

302
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:31,899
Father meets the herbal seeker.

303
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,365
By luck.

304
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,243
It seems like there's a bad relationship with me.

305
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,110
That person.

306
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,417
Say hello, she's your sister.

307
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:49,730
Yoo Se-eun.

308
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:51,883
You act too much.

309
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,776
Go and play there.

310
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,903
Yes, Dad.

311
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:04,856
Your face used to be better.

312
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:06,916
You had your nose done?

313
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,376
Why did it become so ugly?

314
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:13,536
In fact, my daughter Se-eun's round nose,

315
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,777
who used to be so cute.

316
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:17,276
Se Hyun.

317
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,220
Seo Se Hyun.

318
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:26,619
Okay, Dad will call you Seo Se-hyun.

319
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:31,401
Changing your name doesn't mean You're not Daddy's son anymore, are you?

320
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:33,701
Not a child, but an assistant.

321
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,038
Is he the child she gave birth to again?

322
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,123
He is the child I adopted.

323
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,225
He's a little fresh, right?

324
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,119
Dad once said that, right?

325
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:58,573
Sharing the same blood is a very special thing.

326
00:26:01,072 --> 00:26:02,096
How?

327
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:05,010
Don't you feel like working with Dad?

328
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:09,096
Don't you sew? what did you send?

329
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:23,316
Se-eun.

330
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:27,556
It tastes disgusting.

331
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:29,776
As long as you heal your heart...

332
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:32,810
...there will be lots of exciting things.

333
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,480
Things we can do.

334
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,493
Something that only we can do.

335
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:37,949
Have you forgotten?

336
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,536
It's only natural that you talk nonsense.

337
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,242
Don't talk carelessly.

338
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:47,748
Then nod when chatting with Dad.

339
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:50,028
Because in the end it's only Dad...

340
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:55,123
...someone who truly loves you.

341
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:10,234
If so, you can too do everything I want?

342
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:11,761
Of course.

343
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,275
There's only one thing I want.

344
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,261
What's that?

345
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:18,456
You...

346
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,322
...dead.

347
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,156
How dare you...

348
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,476
...draws a knife on Father.

349
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:35,385
Where?
Here.

350
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,790
His face looks very familiar.

351
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:00,496
Are your eyes wide open because Remember Eun-seo after seeing that photo?

352
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,513
Correct.

353
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,403
I sent him for that.

354
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,696
So that you feel how he broke you.

355
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,691
So what happened to Eun-seo?

356
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:21,423
You killed him?
