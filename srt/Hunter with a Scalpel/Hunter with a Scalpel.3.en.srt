You were just criticizing us harshly

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,270

24
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,829

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,030
Do you mean no one was around?

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes, no one was nearby

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,270
I worked alone

37

Yes

41

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,870

48
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,900

That's Dr. Wu's responsibility

53
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,370
I'll confirm it soon

54
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,970
No need, let him do it when he arrives

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,530
Um... he hasn't come to work yet

56
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,870
Absent again?

57
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,670
Call him quickly

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,430
I did, he didn't answer

59
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,030

64

Just received a report about the body and dispatched.

65
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,630
Hey, am I talking to you?

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,500
Answer me.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,200
Same person committed this crime, what does that mean?

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,470
According to the site investigation results.

69
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,500
The method is similar to previous bodies found.

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,030
How are you so sure?

71
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,870
There's also a thread found this time.

72
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,670
-A thread?
-Yes.

73
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,900
The similarity is so high, it's likely the same person.

74
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,970
It could be a copycat crime.

75
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,770
Yeah, can't rule out the possibility of a copycat.

And people are replicating the crime method.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,100
It's been less than a week since the first body was found.

80
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,670
Can someone imitate the crime in such a short time?

81
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,530
Hey, Jung Jeonghyun.

82
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,630
This is your first murder case, right?

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,170
Yes, that's correct.

84
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,570
But…

85
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,030
Can you really be sure it's the same person just with a thread?

86
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,370
Team leader.

87
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,130

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,830
-It's the examination request, right?
-Yes.

90
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,530

- Yes

93

I'm heading out.

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,770
Hey.

95
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,170
That kid is really...

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,730
Hey, I'll assign all the detectives to you.

97
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,170
You must find the stalker first.

98
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,370
Without a suspect, we're all doomed.

99
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,930
Got it.

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,470
Shouldn't someone go with the team leader?

101
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,630
This kid...

102
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,430
Pick your side wisely.

103
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,830
Yes.

104
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,230
Anything found in the Longchuan case?

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,200
Nothing special so far.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,230
Really? With your skills, nothing yet?

107
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,970
That means no leads.

108
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,170
In that case, once the Longchuan case drug results are out

109
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,270
handover to the detectives for closure.

110
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,030
What's going on with the forensic Wu Min-ho?

111
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,730
He didn't come to work today either, I heard.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,300
Yes.

113
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,530
Even as the team leader, arguing with subordinates?

114
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,870
What's that supposed to mean?

115
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,370
Enough, talking is pointless.

116
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,470
Are you just going to stand by and watch?

117
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,030
Maybe check his home

118
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,030
or call his emergency contact.

119
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,200
Yeah, you should take action, right?

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,130
Stop wasting time.

121
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,600
Handle Wu Minhao's case immediately today

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,970
Do you understand?

123
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,170
Yes

Another one?

128
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,900

131
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,730
We found traces this time too

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,700
It's like he left the evidence exposed

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,470
He also revealed a clue himself

134
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,900
Ready

138
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,930
Bring the specimen tray

139
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,270
Got it

142
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,630
Okay

143
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,530
This…

144
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,600
Looks like a child's palm print

145

(Identity verification system Name: Wu Minhao)

147
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,400
What's the verification result?

148
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
Fingerprints have been identified

149
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,270
But the perpetrator's identity can't be determined

150
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,830
What does this mean?

151
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,170
No suspect matches the fingerprints

152
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,170
Did you check carefully?

153
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,830
Are you saying my analysis was wrong?

154
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,230
No…

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,030
I'm just asking if that's possible

156
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,270
I'll re-analyze it

157
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,300
Though the result should be the same

158
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,470
Alright, I understand

159
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,270
What about the victim's identity?

160
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,530
We've found it

161
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Who is it?

162
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,470
Wu Min-ho

163
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
He's a member of our team

-This way\[N]-Wait a moment…

165
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,570
The wind is too strong

166
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,900
You should pull the banner up first

167
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Seems about right

168
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,300
-Be careful...\[N]-Hold on

169
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,370

You pull it up first

-Detective Park\[N]-Chaojun

171
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,300
-A bit higher\[N]-What did you say?

172
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,570
A bit higher, it's crooked here

173
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,670
That's it…

174
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,870
A little higher

175
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,230
Too high, lower it a bit

176
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,930
Like this?

177
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,530
That's it, OK

178
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,770
Thanks for your hard work

(Looking for witnesses)

181
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,070
I said it should be higher

182
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,000
Really?

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,030
Is it really Forensic Expert Wu?

184
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,830
Will we be investigated?

185
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,270
We should undergo an investigation as related parties

186
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,070
Related parties...

187
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,370
Everyone cooperate as much as possible with the police investigation

188
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,000
But even if we have to be investigated

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Don't mention the Nancheng Xie case

190
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,300
That was Forensic Expert Wu's first case

191
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,600
It will definitely be brought up and sensationalized again

192
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,230
Before things get out of hand, Director Rui should conclude the case quickly

193
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Alright, I'll have the Toxicology Department conduct a drug analysis today...

194
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Everything's become such a mess, no need to re-examine

195
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,570
Just hurry up and submit the case

196
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,770
I can't submit a report that doesn't match the autopsy results

197
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,530
Director

198
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,500
Director Rui is probably worried about being responsible if there's a problem later

199
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,270
So committed to taking responsibility

200
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,600
Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility

201
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Is that alright now?

202
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
I won't do it

203
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,470
This is a case I took over

204
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,400
Also the first case Forensic Expert Wu handled independently

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,900
It must be re-examined

206
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,870
Really?

207
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,100
Since you're insistent

208
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,700
Let's do it this way

209
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,500
Call Investigator Qian over

210
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,030
Okay

211
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,430
Detective Qian has arrived

212
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,870
Are you looking for me?

213
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,970
Yes, from now on

214
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,070
You’ll handle the autopsy cases under Chief Rui

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
What do you mean by this?

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Why? Haven't you refused to do what I said?

217
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,230
And anything needing approval, report directly to me

218
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,600
Director

219
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,070
I’m not a medical examiner, how can I…

220
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,030
You have a master's in anatomy and four years as an investigator

221
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,670
You should have learned quite a bit by now

222
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,070
Of course, with Detective Qian’s skills, it won’t be a problem

223
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,470
Complex cases will be transferred to other teams

224
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,030
Focus on simple cases

225
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,970
Handle them with external personnel

226
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,430
I will provide extensive support

227
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you really have to go this far?

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,400
Honestly

229
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,600
You’re praised everywhere and lifted high

230
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,170
Do you really think you’re some big shot?

231
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,430
Stop being so arrogant

232
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,830
There are many others besides you who can do this job

233
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,300
It’s an emergency where we should be working together

234
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,700
(Identity Verification System Name: Wu Minhao)
You’re stubbornly sticking to your ways, not fitting in at all

235
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,230
Chief Rui

236
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,870
I have to accept a related person investigation, right?

237
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,170
Where's the best place for it?

238
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,130
Here or back at the station…

239
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,530
More importantly...

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,330
Are you okay?

241
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,730
On the day of the incident

242
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,700
You and Wu Minhao went to Longchuan, to the crime scene

243
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,030
Then took public transport back together, right?

244
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,770
I checked the footage, it seemed you two had a disagreement

245
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,830
May I ask what you were talking about?

246
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,230
I don't really remember, it was probably work-related

247
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,170
Did you go straight home after parting ways with him?

248
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,230
No

249
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,100
I went to the hospital

250
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,130
The hospital?

251
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,900
Were you feeling unwell?

252
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,500
Do I have to tell you everything?

253
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,500
No, it's fine

254
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,600
We just need to confirm during the estimated time of Wu Minhao's death

255
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,030
You were at the hospital

256
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,570
I was at the hospital until late

257
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,130
You can verify that

258
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,170
Then may I ask

259
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Do you know if Wu Minhao had any workplace conflicts

260
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,099
Or anything unusual happened to him recently?

261
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,200
I don't know

262
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,369
I'm not familiar with his personal matters

263
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay, I understand

264
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,869
Then I'll ask one last question

265
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,700
Do you have any leads, Chief?

266
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,200
About why the culprit disposed of the body in Longchuan?

267
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Based on the estimated time of death

268
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,330
Based on the estimated time of death

269
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,670
Wu Min-ho was clearly in Seoul at that time

270
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,230
(Longchuan)
Dad, are we going to Longchuan today?

271
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,570
Chief Seo

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm not sure

273
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,230
Don't be too upset

274
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,330
I will definitely catch the criminal

275
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,130
(The scientific power to uncover the truth)

276
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,630
Yes, senior

277
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,030
I heard the deceased was Wu, the forensic expert from NFS

278
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,270
Is that true?

279
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,300
I just finished the interview with Chief Seo and I'm ready to return

280
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,570
The deceased's family includes a mother and brother

281
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,300
The mother fainted upon hearing the tragic news…

282
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,200
You should come back first

283
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,930
We've found a suspect

284
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,770
This is a surveillance camera from the logistics warehouse where Lee Yeon-joo works

285
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,330
A courier working at the same time

286
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,770
Has been harassing Lee Yeon-joo

287
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,770
She seemed to be deeply troubled by it

288
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,570
According to the forensic analysis

289
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,670
This person matches the attire of the stalker we lost track of last time

290
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,170
What's even more shocking

291
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,230
This person was imprisoned for seven years for murder in 2008

292
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,730
Released ten years ago

293
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,800
Really?

294
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,200
Then what are you standing around for? Hurry and apply for a warrant

295
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,270
Wait a minute

296
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,200
This is evidence of stalking, not evidence for the murder case, right?

297
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,970
Judging him as a suspect based on this…

298
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,130
What else?

299
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,330
Who do you think the culprit is?

300
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,430
About that...

301
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,600
We need to find him now.

302
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,870
How are we investigating?

303
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,670
Just with these wires and brushes as evidence?

304
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,770
We can't even identify the murderer, yet arguing all day long.

305
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,370
Chang Town, apply for a warrant first...

306
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,200
-So… -What do you want now?

307
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,630
I'm checking large vehicles on cameras.

308
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,470
The license plates have been matched.

309
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,800
Let's apply for the warrant after confirmation.

310
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,170
The investigation is nearing completion.

311
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,670
Focus, everyone. It won't take long.

312
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,630
What's everyone's opinion?

313
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,930
I just contacted Investigator Cheon.

314
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,030
And then you came in person.

315
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,130
Any progress?

316
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,230
Yes.

317
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
On the plastic sheet that wrapped Lee Won-joo's body,

318
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,770
Soil containing sodium was found.

319
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,270
Additionally,

320
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,300
Inside the body...

321
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,230
(Detected large amounts of Bafron)
Large amounts of Bafron were detected.

322
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,500
It's a paralytic muscle relaxant often used for poisoning.

323
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,630
The detected dose is enough to cause instant paralysis.

324
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,700
And leads to death.

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,130
Run quickly

373
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,600
Forensic examiner Choi

374
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Yes

375
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,170
Please bring over the plastic sheet covering the body

376
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,370
I want to check it for fingerprints

377
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,000
We've already examined that cloth

378
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,630
Because it's large, there's a fear of missing something

379
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,000
It's been cut into small pieces for examination

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,630
Forget about the plastic sheet then

381
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,130
Check the tape attached to it instead

382
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,230
(Agricultural plastic sheet and tape)

383
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Thoroughly examine this

384
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,630
See if we can find any fingerprints or DNA

385
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,230
This guy is really something

386
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,700
Get up

387
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,100
Team leader, are you okay?

388
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,330
Don't move…

389
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,230
Put it down

390
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,430
Come over here

391
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,370
Hey, don't move around

392
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,970
Damn it

393
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,200
Stay still

394
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,900
This guy is looking for trouble, huh?

395
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,630
You have the right to remain silent

396
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,470
Anything you say from now on

397
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,430
can be used against you as evidence

398
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,970
You also have the right to an attorney
Is everything clear?

399
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,470
Clear my ass, damn it

400
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,500
He understands

401
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,070
(Autopsy report on organic residue)

402
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,470
The results are out, but…

403
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,970
(DNA not found, fingerprints found)

404
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,830
Can't let dad scold me

405
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,070
Can't leave fingerprints

406
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,930
Can't leave any traces

407
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,600
Can't leave any fingerprints

408
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,870
It has to be spotless before dad gets back
