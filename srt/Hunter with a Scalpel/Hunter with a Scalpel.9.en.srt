00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,430
(Park Joo-hyun)

2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,500
(Park Yong-woo)

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,470
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,130
(The Hunter with a Scalpel)

5
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,000
(All locations, businesses, characters, groups, and background settings are purely fictional and unrelated to reality)

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,070
(Child actors are filmed under guardian supervision, animal scenes have experts present, abiding by animal protection laws)

7
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,930
Which color do you want to stick?

8
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,070
It looks pretty if you stick it like this.

9
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,670
The key is to stick more stickers.

10
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,870
There are tons over there.

11
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,470
(The Hunter with a Scalpel)

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
(Episode 9)

13
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,470
(Don't forget to wear a watch)

14
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,700
(Please help me!)

15
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,630
So I went to find him.

16
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,329
Asked why he's helping me.

17
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,770
Do you know what he replied?

18
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,670
"Didn't your eyes already say it?"

19
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,070
"That you want me to help you."

20
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,600
(Number not displayed)

21
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,430
Daughter

22
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,500
Did you sleep well?

23
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,830
I took the bucket over, you saw, right?

24
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,630
You need it now too, don't you?

25
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,430
Did what you took yesterday help?

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,570
Do you want to know?

27
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,230
We have to meet again.

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,500
There's still unfinished business.

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,870
Yes.

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,470
Things aren't settled yet.

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,800
But...

32
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,570
From now on I'll handle it myself, don't interfere.

33
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,770
Really?

34
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,670
You've grown up.

35
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,670
My daughter has truly grown up.

36
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,600
You can manage on your own without a father.

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,630
But without my help,

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,070
can you really achieve your goal smoothly?

39
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,930
Just wait and see.

40
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,400
Shi-en, I believe in you.

41
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,770
Eventually...

42
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,430
you'll come to me on your own.

43
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,300
Three victims have already appeared.

44
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,870
Can these things alone pinpoint the suspect?

45
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,070
What exactly is Chief Rui doing?

46
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,570
Didn't he confidently say he'd catch the killer?

47
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,130
Why did he just submit a report?

48
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,400
- Chief Cui - Yes.

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,670
What do you think should be done?

50
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,200
Reporters are waiting to hear the results.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,700
Yes.

52
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,230
We're currently waiting for citizen reports on the composite sketch.

53
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,170
The information provided by citizens has been useless.

54
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,800
Is this your first day as police officers?

55
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,300
Can't you see this effort is pointless?

56
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes, because the report has a statute of limitations.

57
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,100
Right now we're investigating illegal Bafron trafficking...

58
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,600
Excuse me, Chief.

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
I mean we're using bus surveillance to

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,130
track the suspect's movements.

61
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,730
It was found out yesterday

62
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,770
The photo found in the body

63
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,200
The background is Qingyun Port

64
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,530
(Digital Forensics Report)
Qingyun Port is heavily related to this case…

65
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,470
Yes, I just wanted to tell you this

66
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,130
We are planning to request assistance from the local police

67
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,770
To investigate the areas around Qingyun Port

68
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,070
If we can locate where the photo was taken

69
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,570
We should be able to find some clues

70
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,000
But Captain Zheng

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
What were you about to say? What's going on with Qingyun Port?

72
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,300
Yes, because…

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,030
Sodium was detected in the first case

74
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,170
So he thinks that may be the first crime scene

75
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,500
Is that right?

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,700
Yes, that's correct

77
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,130
Okay, make sure to capture the suspect within this week

78
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,330
Yes

79
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,630
Facing the director, some things can be said, others can't

80
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,230
You're being too informal

81
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,470
Why can't you report it?

82
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,600
You've already tracked Bafolong and Qingyun Port

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,230
I believe there's sufficient evidence to continue investigating

84
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,070
Okay, let's proceed this way then

85
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,830
Since you're determined to investigate the unresolved cases

86
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,530
Let's add an extra layer of security

87
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,870
What kind of security?

88
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,170
Chief Hong Jinwoo of the Southern Bureau's Major Crimes Unit is your senior, right?

89
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,600
You have a close relationship, don't you?

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,830
They have a brotherly bond.

91
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,070
Yes

92
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,830
Let's go ask them for support

93
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,670
What

94
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,900
I've made it very clear, just on our own

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,830
It's impossible to thoroughly investigate unresolved cases

96
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,730
Either involve the Southern Division

97
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,330
Or shut up

98
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,830
No way, the Southern Division wouldn’t take this on

99
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,870
This is like a buy one get one free, isn't it?

100
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,430
Unresolved explosive cases and unsolved cases

101
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,300
Just like the chief said

102
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,930
Try convincing the Serious Crime Squad first

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,100
Alright, got it

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,030
Chief Rui is hiding something

105
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,230
(More than 5.6 micrograms of Baflon detected per milliliter)

106
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,370
Baflon

107
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,530
Blue barrel

108
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,700
What did her expression mean yesterday

109
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,400
The team leader is a good person

110
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,170
So you can't lose

111
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,530
(Chief Rui Shixian)

112
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,270
(Team Leader Zheng Zhengxian)

113
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Wow, you're here so early today

114
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,470
Yes, I'm here

115
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,330
Did something good happen?

116
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,770
Oh, is it obvious?

117
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,169
Super obvious

118
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,100
It's about my son

119
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,230
He heard about a terrible case

120
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,500
And got mad at me, asking why I didn't tell him

121
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,770
He's insisting on coming back to visit

122
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,870
Even though he's super busy and it's far away

123
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,100
He's determined to come back to see me

124
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,670
That's wonderful

125
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,930
You can wear this outfit when you go to the airport

126
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,370
When I was doing laundry for you

127
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,030
I found this one to be so elegant and nice

128
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,500
Just like the president

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,530
Really

130
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,500
The president is really fortunate, so envious

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,100
I've been hearing compliments about my good fortune since I was a kid

132
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,900
I'm kind of tired of it

133
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,200
Oh dear, aging just brings forgetfulness

134
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,000
I keep forgetting things

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,470
I'm sorry

136
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,330
I shouldn't mention these things in front of President Choi

137
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,170
There you go again, I told you not to worry about it

138
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,170
You are the president, after all

139
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,330
Hearing you say that, I'm as happy as if my daughter was coming home

140
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,700
Hello

141
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,370
(Genetic Analysis Department)

142
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,730
Thank you for your hard work

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,030
Do you need anything, Chief?

144
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,570
Because the Yongchuan Police Department is constantly urging

145
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,730
I might need to take a closer look at the specimen list provided so far

146
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,470
No problem

147
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,630
That's strange, the list was supposed to have been uploaded

148
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,700
When did he leave?

149
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,430
The person responsible for compiling the list is not at their desk right now

150
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,530
I'll send you an email later

151
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,270
Can't you help me with this now?

152
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,730
Because it's urgent.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,700
It's not difficult.

154
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,200
Alright, I got it.

155
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,230
Ugh, why isn't he answering the phone?

156
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,130
What's the point of carrying a phone then?

157
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,870
Hey, why aren't you answering your phone?

158
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,170
Follow me.

159
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,700
Hurry, that lunatic is coming.

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
Chief Rui, sorry to keep you waiting.

161
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,730
I apologize.

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,700
I heard you are looking for the list of samples from the Longchuan case.

163
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,800
You need all from the first to the third case, right?

164
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
Yes, I need all of them.

165
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,800
Would you like something to drink?

166
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Sure.

167
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,170
(Sent by the Longchuan Police Department Major Crimes Unit)

168
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,230
Hello.

169
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,130
Officer Kim.

170
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,330
Is it for the Major Crimes Unit?

171
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,730
Yes.

172
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,000
They've been sleeping at the station quite often lately.

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,900
I've seen a mountain of laundry to wash.

174
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Oh dear, it's really a lot.

175
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Have they found any clues recently?

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't even mention it.

177
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,870
No informants coming forward, no phone reports either.

178
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,570
Detectives are running all over the place, working endlessly.

179
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh dear, it's really a mess...

180
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,330
Let's just hope there won't be any new cases...

181
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,530
This one

182
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,900
No need to distribute, just give it to Detective Park

183
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,830
I've briefed him

184
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,730
I'll give it to him myself

No, it's fine...

186
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,970
I'll handle it

187
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,670
Alright

188
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,130

189
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,530

Is everything handled?

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,330
Why do you look so serious?

193
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,470
Why do you need the specimen list?

194
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,770
It's nothing

195
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,330
Just checking if there's anything that needs re-examination

196
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,830
Re-examination?

197
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,330
Makes it sound like there were errors in our unit's analysis, I don't like hearing that

198
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,300
No, that's not what I meant

199
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,500
Your report to Ryungcheon Police was missing information on Bafron, right?

200
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,870
(Ryungcheon City Case Specimen List)

201
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,000
It seems there really was an omission

202
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,000
No wonder...

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,430
Because I couldn't reach you

204
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,100
I informed Captain Jeong at Ryungcheon Police

205
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,500
Told him that Bafron was found on the third case's body too

206
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,000
But his reaction was like it was the first time he heard it

207
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,370
I said, "It was found on the first two bodies as well"

208
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,430
Then he started stammering

209
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,030
Did you delete it on purpose?

210
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,100
Why would I do that?

211
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,500
I handed the report over to them.

212
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,170
Maybe they didn't pay attention.

213
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,400
How is that possible?

214
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,730
It's such an important report.

215
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,900
How could the detective in charge not have examined it carefully?

216
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,830
How should I know? I did pass it on.

217
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,570
Am I supposed to take the blame

218
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,500
for even a rookie team leader's mistakes?

219
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,070
Anyway, as long as it's resolved, that's fine.

222
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,830
That's good news.

223
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,430
Also, the temporary autopsy center in Longchuan City is going to be removed.

224
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,030
Have you heard?

225
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,570
Removed? But they haven't caught the criminal yet...

226
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,570
Leave catching the criminal to the police.

227
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,300
We handed over all the data. Higher-ups say this is as far as it goes.

228
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,330
The Nam case is really becoming quite a headache.

229
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,030
You need to step in to handle it.

Senior, we've found a clue in the Longchuan case

258
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,300
We also understand this request isn't easy

259
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,870
We must be pretty frustrated to be looking into unsolved cases

260
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,270
The similarity is extremely high based on various indirect evidence

261
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,500
When there's a possibility of another victim appearing

262
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,670
If we didn't know about this clue, it wouldn't matter

263
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,830
Now that we know, we can't just ignore it, senior

264
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,070
I understand what you mean

265
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,770
A serial killing case without suspects added to unsolved cases

266
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,830
It's too risky

267
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,500
Someone has to volunteer to take it on

268
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,870
But...

269
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,870

If you want them to take on this unpredictable situation with just a sense of duty...

272
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,870
That's right, senior.

273
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,230
Only if the suspect is clear.

274
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,470
Or if it's a case that causes public outrage, then it's possible.

275
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,500
The probability of failure in this case is too high.

276

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,400
What are you doing?

367
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,430
You can't go in right now.

368
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,700
Please leave immediately.

369
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,270
Put everything back where it belongs.

370
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,470
You're suspected of falsifying the test report.

371
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,670
If the investigation clears you, everything will be returned.

372
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,470
Please cooperate.

373
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,570
What if they find nothing?

374
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,100
How will you take responsibility then?

375
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,270
Not cooperating will be worse for you.

376
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,330
From the Nan Cheng case to this Longchuan case,

377
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,770
We have gathered all the evidence we need.

378
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,470
(Where is the credibility of National Forensic Service?)
Now we are just following procedures.

379
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,930
Is the evidence all in?

380
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,770
Then there's no need for this investigation, right?

381
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,770
Did you fabricate evidence in my son's case?

382
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,630
Aren't you my son's boss?

383
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,430
How could you do this? How could you bring yourself to do it?

384
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,000
You know deep down.

385
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,970
You know who killed my son, right?

386
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,130
Let go.

387
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,470
You're creating a fuss without confirming the facts.

388
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,070
You'll regret this.

389
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,200
Do you think Forensic Wu Minhao is any different from me?

390
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,630
Why

391
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,670
Your outstanding son

392
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,330
Didn't he tell you what he's done?

393
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,670
I'm also saddened by Medical Examiner Wu's passing

394
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,430
But stop blaming others recklessly

395
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,870
Wicked woman

396
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,430
Say it again, despicable woman

397
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,870
Say it again

398
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,870
If you dare, say it again…

399
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,270
-Please calm down -Say it again

400
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,700
How can you say such things

401
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,330
(Where's the credibility of the National Forensic Service?)
How dare she, this wicked woman

402
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,000
Wicked woman…

403
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,370
Let go of me

404
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,970
Damn, how long do we have to wait for the results?

405
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,230
Is it out yet?

406
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,070
Okay, 124 Central Road, Street 1

407
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,430
Okay, thanks

408
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,570
Central Road, Street 1…

409
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,270
Have you been there recently, Changjin?

410
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,870
Why would you go there?

411
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,300
Running around everywhere, I'm all mixed up

412
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,070
Is it Kwon Hyung-jo's place?

413
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,370
Yes

414
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,430
Hey, contact the local police station and head to the scene immediately

415
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,830
-Hekeun, let's go -Alright

416
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,070
Hello, this is the Ryongchon Police Station Crime Unit

417
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,300
Hurry up

418
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,800
Must be a mistake by the inspection team, right?

419
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,700
The chief wouldn't do such a thing

420
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,070
Chief Jeong, you're here

421
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,670
Investigator Qian

422
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,530
Could you please step outside for a moment?

423
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
You're hiding something from me, right?

424
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,300
Why say that all of a sudden?

425
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,270
If it's about closing the temporary autopsy site

426
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,670
Please speak with the director

427
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,130
Don't you have anything you want to tell me?

428
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,600
Let go

429
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
The body tested positive for bufalon

430
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,970
Why did you hide it?

431
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,930
So the reason you suspect me

432
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,730
Is just because of that medication?

433
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,770
Honestly

434
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,800
Even if you know it tested positive for bufalon, what difference does it make?

435
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,470
With your poor skills, can you catch the killer?

436
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,370
Then I'll use my poor skills to ask you a few questions

437
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,100
This case

438
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,930
Is it really unrelated to you?

439
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,800
Wu the medical examiner became a target

440
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,600
The third body appeared right outside your home

441
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,770
The blue barrel in your house

442
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,070
Are all these just coincidences?

443
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,670
Then why were you so flustered when you saw the photos in the body?

444
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,530
I wasn't panicked

445
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,000
Do you really know nothing about the Qingyun Port case

446
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,570
and the child in the photo?

447
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,330
Yes

448
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,930
I don't know

449
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,130
Then

450
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,330
What about this?

451
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,170
Why did you go there?

452
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,630
Seems like you already have an answer.

453
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,200
Say whatever you want.

454
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Could you at least be honest with me?

455
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,570
I...

456
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,200
I believe you worked so hard to prevent more harm.

457
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,400
I admire your genuine heart for coming to Longchuan after your colleague's death.

458
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,230
Until now, I've never doubted your words.

459
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,030
But...

460
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,730
Now I'm really not sure.

461
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,870
Can I still trust you?

462
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,500
Then...

463
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,430
There's no need to say more.

464
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,700
Don't you not trust me?

465
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,200
What's there left to say?

466
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,830
I just hope...

467
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,030
You can tell the truth so I can believe you.

468
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,970
No matter what I say...

469
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,830
You won't believe it, right?

470
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,700
Isn't that so?

471
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,400
Kang Eun-soo.

472
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,730
You know who she is, right?

473
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,470
Please tell me.

474
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,830
You know clearly, don't you?

475
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,730
Good luck catching the culprit.

476
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,070
Let's not meet again.

477
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,530
"You look like devil"

478
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:07,770
"I don't know your traces"
