Oh my, isn't that Mr. Choi?

11
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,579
What happened?

12
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,472
Can only family members be guardians?

13
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,877
In this complex, I am Mr. Choi's guardian!

Seo Se-hyun's fingerprints found from injections and scissors at the crime scene.

20
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:52,755
Pancuronium medication too.

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,201
Mr. Choi's testimony is also the same that the person was Doctor Seo.

22
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,467
Is this possible?

23
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:04,646
His house was under heavy guard, but he do it again in a nearby place?

24
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,170
Footwear with back which has been eroded.

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,803
There are similarities with the tracks I saw.

26
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:32,935
What's this?

27
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,360
There is no record of his birth?

28
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,033
You're right.

29
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:41,443
Life history before entering the orphanage February 18, 2004 was not recorded.

30
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:44,432
Isn't this the child in the photo?

31
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,217
So, this kid is Seo Se-hyun?

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,014
Have you guys got one of each?

33
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:51,756
Yes.

34
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,121
Okay, please pay attention.

35
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:58,764
Child in photo evidence of third case It is known that Seo Se-hyun.

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,076
Then the injection case The fourth is pancuronium.

37
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:08,029
Evidence from the rented room shows the victim's earrings third, then the second victim's cell phone.

38
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:12,676
Then, the third piece of evidence in the form of a blue bucket has been confirmed to contain victims one and two.

39
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:16,139
Name Seo Se-hyun as a suspect and search for him publicly right now...

40
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,071
No.

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,037
It will be increasingly difficult for us to catch him. if looking openly.

42
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:23,370
Then, how?

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,988
Yes?

44
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:27,611
You can't even catch it though have gone to the hospital for treatment.

45
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,670
Yesterday we went to Go Doo-sam's house, suspect in the Blue Tong case.

46
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,732
These are footprints inside the container which is in his yard.

47
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,478
So...

48
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,631
...these are Seo Se-hyun's shoes. we found it in the rented room.

49
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:42,974
Look at this.

50
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:46,506
Shoe sole pattern and paint marks that stick together everything fits.

51
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:50,110
Well then, not long ago Seo Se-hyun at Go Doo-sam's house?

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,778
Then there are the unknown traces that are suspected has O-legs next to Seo Se-hyun's footsteps.

53
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,757
It is not clear who this belongs to.

54
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,064
But, it's certain that Seo Se-hyun with someone at that time.

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,989
You mean he has a gang?

56
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,067
Yes, right.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,566
I suspect Choi Min-guk is the person.

58
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:09,886
Yes?

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,117
Who is Choi Min-guk?

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,709
Yongcheon Laundry Owner.

61
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,857
The owner of the laundry?

62
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,067
Yes.

63
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:20,159
I see there are similarities with the man in the bus CCTV.

64
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,037
The similarities between cases one and three are also is in his laundry.

65
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:27,078
Then on the footwear he was wearing there are the same marks.

66
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,920
Wait a minute, in the call history Seo Se-hyun recently...

67
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:34,828
...found periodic calls from tin can phones since the second case occurred.

68
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,875
Then the signal from Yongcheon and Cheongun...

69
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,297
Are you sure about that?

70
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,916
Yes.

71
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,656
Why did you just say that now?

72
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,156
- I see... - Shut up.

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,732
Mr. Chief.

74
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:47,867
Now it is confirmed the gang is in our area...

75
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:48,788
Wait a minute.

76
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,129
In that case...

77
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,334
...is there any evidence that Mr. Choi is the gang?

78
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,586
For example, that tin can telephone belongs to Mr. Choi.

79
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,924
Why are you guys who have missed the meeting participants all this time?

80
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,778
From now on, the Yongcheon case...

81
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:11,610
...will be carried out together with the investigation team crimes from the Gyeonggi Southern Office.

...and with one heart work with him...

87
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,461
...to catch the suspect Seo Se-hyun.

88
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,776
YOON SE EUN

89
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,275
Why did you sleep so long?

90
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,093
Let me go.

91
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,853
I said let go.

92
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,108
He said Big Brother is good at doing this.

93
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,893
Father told me to learn from you.

94
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:35,930
I can teach you if my ties are untied.

95
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,865
You practice a lot, right?

96
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,383
How long will it take for me to master it?

97
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:41,977
You can never be like me.

98
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:43,650
Why?

99
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,203
I can do it.

100
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,684
Why do you want to master it so badly?

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,578
I have to be a great person.

102
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,683
That's why I have to practice and keep practicing said Dad.

103
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,961
You will not be great people with it.

104
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,114
Your father lied.

105
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,002
No.

106
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,016
Dad didn't lie!

107
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:03,235
You don't even go to school.

108
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,494
Can you read books?

109
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:07,629
I don't need school because school is not fun.

110
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,746
How do you know it's not fun?

111
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,480
If you go to school, you can read books, drawing, singing...

112
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,427
...and picnic with friends.

113
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,383
There are lots of fun things.

114
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,793
Not fun at all.

115
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,000
I can do it myself and there is no need for such a thing.

116
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,627
Your father said that?

117
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,926
Why do you always say bad things about my father?

118
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,324
What do you know, bro?

119
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,497
I also study and know everything.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,381
Chairman Hong, do you think that Seo Se-hyun is the real culprit?

121
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:46,879
It can be seen from the crime scene alone.

122
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,847
Cases one through three are very clean.

123
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,100
But after that, suddenly it just fell apart.

124
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,608
It was as if the perpetrator was shouting asking to be arrested.

125
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:59,287
Do you see Seo Se-hyun as people who would leave evidence at the crime scene?

126
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,512
Please be honest.

127
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:05,585
You also know how Seo Se-hyun's character.

128
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,776
Isn't this strange?

129
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:11,641
As a forensic doctor, Seo Se-hyun is the perpetrator who has also altered the test results.

130
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,543
That's what I mean.

131
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:15,739
Actually, because of what? he suddenly hid it?

132
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,583
I don't believe it. Something must be wrong.

133
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:23,198
Therefore, shouldn't we distinguish truth from evidence?

134
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,635
In my eyes...

135
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,199
...it seems like the one who's wrong is you.

136
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,033
Senior Hong.

137
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,486
You can't look this case objectively.

138
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,088
Could it be, because of Seo Se-hyun?

139
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,272
Yes?

140
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:38,740
What do you mean?

141
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,369
I heard from Yang Jun-kyung.

142
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:45,374
You already know he changed the report prior to notification from the Forensic Agency.

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,768
But why not report it?

144
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,532
About that...

145
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,618
I wanted to check with him first, then...

146
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,525
There are people who saw you come out Seo Se-hyun's rented room in the early hours of the morning.

147
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:58,704
Chairman Hong, that...

148
00:10:58,752 --> 00:10:59,585
Jung Hyun.

149
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:05,053
You better let go from this case.

150
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:06,641
Jinwoo!

151
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,854
Hand over your work ID and cell phone.

152
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,979
Then take a break.

153
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,239
Rearrange your thoughts.

154
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,416
That way, you will know how much You're way off track now.

155
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:20,751
I can't do it.

156
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:23,119
The perpetrator of this case until now unpredictable.

157
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,272
But suddenly just let go?

158
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,822
I'm sure there's a gang.

159
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,732
I also said that this was related with the Cheongun Port case.

160
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:32,588
Background photo evidence of case three and Also Go Doo-sam is the perpetrator of that case...

161
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:33,713
I'm done talking.

162
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,033
If you don't want to get more warnings tough, do what you're told.

163
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,299
Good grief!

164
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:47,322
Chairman Jung!
Stop!

165
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,426
Catch him!

166
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,305
Jung Hyun!

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,513
Damn it.

168
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:57,649
Are you okay?

169
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:08,515
Jung Jung Hyun!

170
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,073
Jung Hyun!

171
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,293
Geez.

172
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:17,887
Are you alright?

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,762
Yes, I am doing okay.

174
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,933
Even going to the hospital...

175
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,454
...he said I was allowed went home after today's checkup.

176
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,744
No.

177
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,549
You just take a rest first.

178
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,390
Even if your external wounds are very light, but that, what is it called?

179
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,880
Yes, you got it. huge trauma.

180
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,130

Me too.

182
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,515
I can't sleep well because of the recent newspapers.

183
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,477
Mr. Choi, what are you? not afraid at all?

184
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,079
Of course I'm scared.

185
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,273
That day...

186
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:55,103
...I made eye contact with the woman.

187
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,033
And he smiled.

188
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,822
Oh my gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

189
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,515
Really.

190
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,350
People like him...

191
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:09,334
...must be arrested and monitored so as not to do strange things again.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

207
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,764
He's not that kind of kid.

208
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:03,114
As the doctor in charge, do you Have you had it medically confirmed?

209
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,576
Mr. Detective, why do you think that? humans have demonic tendencies?

210
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,449
About that...

211
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:11,810
The desire to be recognized.

212
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,131
That's because of his desire to get it. love from others is not fulfilled.

213
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,963
Especially if it's from parents the closest to him.

214
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:21,970
The influence is enormous.

215
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:26,709
But Se-hyun is a child who got a lot of love from his mother.

216
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:29,264
I believe in the power of love.

217
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:32,834
One day, a nun came meet me...

218
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,087
...bringing a new child.

219
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:42,650
He always catches animals, then split and destroy the contents of his stomach.

220
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:45,003
The child said...

221
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,501
I wonder what's in there in her soft belly.

222
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:55,451
But I already return it neatly.

223
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,511
I also made a grave for him.

224
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:04,138
It's not easy.

225
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,897
The results showed him has severe sociopathic traits.

226
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,760
You can consider him a child who have a little guilt and empathy.

227
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:15,520
ANTI-SOCIAL DISORDER

228
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,397
But...

229
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:20,184
...she sewed it back together and rebury it.

230
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,252
There's no way he doesn't have empathy...

231
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,701
He did it without hesitation in living things.

232
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,329
That's because he was shocked...

233
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:33,626
Such a small child...

234
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,534
...found unconscious inside forest during the cold winter.

235
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:45,147
He might have died if he had not visible to mountain climbers.

236
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,967
Seeing him inside That fear, must have made him...

237
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:53,310
Even so, it would be dangerous if he lives with other children.

238
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:56,178
What about sending it to an institution?

239
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,803
You mean some kind of hospital?

240
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:01,725
Yes.

241
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:06,965
But, Doc...

242
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,951
That means no one...

243
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,297
...who will be by the child's side, right?

244
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,608
Then she stopped being a nun.

245
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,623
I have already forbidden it.

246
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,889
But there must be a reason why God sent the child to him.

247
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,514
After that, even though he didn't tell me...

248
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:34,800
...I can tell how big love is and his efforts to love the child.

249
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,553
In that case...

250
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,799
Have the symptoms improved?

251
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,342
Injuries received as a child can't be cured easily.

252
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,030
It could go on forever.

253
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:47,482
It's just that you have to try.

254
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,094
That Se-hyun...

255
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:54,686
...is a child who after the Nun Won-hee is sick and diagnosed with Alzheimer's...

256
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:58,451
...he lives with energy bar for the past five years.

257
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,901
While the murder kills a lot of energy.

258
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:06,186
He is a child who tries kept his promise to his mother.

259
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:09,765
Is it possible, that a child like that...

260
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,664
...do something heinous?

261
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:30,081
Here, eat it.

262
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Dad bought it for me, but I share it with you too.

263
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,007
You're not mad at me?

264
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:38,717
Dad said I have to get along with you.

265
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,199
Where is your father now?

266
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,451
Don't want to eat?

267
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:43,537
Where is he?

268
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,287
Okay, if you don't want to.

269
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,356
Did your father send you to school?

270
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,108
No.

271
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,537
Then how do you know? what do you do at school?

272
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,264
Drink it.

273
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,187
Rock, scissors, paper.

274
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:40,528
Pull one!

275
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,644
No, it can't be like that.

276
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,608
The azaleas are blooming!

277
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,912
The azaleas are blooming!

278
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,006
The azaleas are blooming!

279
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,139
- Azalea flowers... - Got it!

280
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,256
My brother told me.

281
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:22,828
You have an older sibling too?

282
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,350
Yes.

283
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,388
Where is he now?

284
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,760
Who knows.

285
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,413
I don't know.

286
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:42,646
Eat it.

287
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,115
I'll eat if you let me go.

288
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:49,178
It doesn't matter.

289
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,561
My feet are still tied anyway.

290
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,530
You can take it off for a while.

291
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,936
Does not seem.

292
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,756
I will feed you.

293
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,295
Open your mouth.

294
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,713
Chew it.

295
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,441
I'll come here again when Dad comes.

296
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:45,233
The suspect was identified on investigation of cases four and five...

297
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,361

I've been suspicious since the scalpel found. Why are you surprised now?

314
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,738

I said my opinion.

342
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:14,213
I'm sure he's not that kind of kid.

343
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:15,975

Is not it?

352

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,091
Dad, this thickness?

362
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:17,275
You sliced it so beautifully.

363
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,799
Want me to show you something interesting?

364
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,147
Look, this is very interesting.

365
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,861
He has a slightly scary side.

366
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,486
In particular, he is very obsessed with corpses.

367
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,603
He is very interested on police investigation.

368
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,329
He also intervened.

369
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:56,808
SEO SE-HYEUN'S CO-WORKER SUSPECT

370
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,582
The person most avoided by investigators.

371
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,174
Due to the case of athlete Nam Seung-hyup...

372
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,975
SEO SE-HYEUN'S CO-WORKER SUSPECT

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,635
...he often clashes with Doctor Oh.

374
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,857
I FIGHT A LOT WITH Mister OH BECAUSE OF THE NAM SEUNG-HYEOP INCIDENT

375
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:09,358
Seo Se-hyun keeps wanting to change the proof. That's why Doctor Oh...

376
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,291
From the results of a thorough investigation into the cases that Seo Se-hyun handles...

377
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:16,416
...it was revealed that the autopsy report Nam Seung-hyeop's case too...

378
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,041
...get individual manipulation that performed by the person in charge of the autopsy.

379
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,924
To prevent this from happening again...

380
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:31,431
All humans are like that.

381
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,697
In this world...

382
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:37,439
...only Dad can be trusted, right?

383
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,177
Do you understand?

384
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,289
Geez.

385
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,369
Now what are you going to do?

386
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,835
Running out of gas?

387
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,793
Se-eun.

388
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,158
Can you get some gas from Dad's car?

389
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:00,175
Yes.

390
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:09,630
What will I do?

391
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,392
We have to start again now.

392
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:18,856
As a family...

393
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:25,135
...we must live in harmony.

394
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:29,838
What about him?

395
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,470
I told you.

396
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,166
I don't like him at all.

397
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,799
But, it seems like the child really like you.

398
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,814
You're here, why do you need it?

399
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,455
We'll finish him off.

400
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:51,024
Then tomorrow we go by boat.

401
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,642
Don't worry.

402
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,892
After a few days...

403
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,150
...everything will return to calm as before.

404
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:10,947
Basically humans are not interested in other people.

405
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,946
All humans abandon their children.

406
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,760
I have warned you to don't show your fangs, right?

407
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,042
But you don't want to hear me?

408
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,580
If so, you should punished to wake up.
