(Child actors filmed with guardians present, animal scenes were supervised by experts and followed animal protection laws)

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,500
I didn't kill it

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,300
It's definitely this woman, why ask more

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,370
I see her almost every day

10
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,330
The cat was gutted, its insides spilling out...

11
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,900
It made my hair stand on end

12
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,130
Auntie, did you see me kill the cat

13
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,570
You're here feeding cats all the time

14
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,400
The person who can make stray cats feel safe enough to approach

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,570
Who else but you

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,000
Review all the surveillance footage

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,300
This is really interesting

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,430
What's going on

19
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,270
Look, this woman is just creepy

20
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,700
She actually said it's interesting

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
It's absurd for someone who wants stray cats dead

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,130
To accuse someone trying to save them

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,300
What

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,030
Since when did I want stray cats dead

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,030
Didn't you tell me not to feed them, to let them starve

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,130
No, that's because...

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,770
Do you have any evidence that I killed a cat

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,600
Not exactly

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,630
It's just that we have to respond to reports

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,100
If there's no evidence, can I go now

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,870
How could you leave?

32
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,000
Since we received a report, we should investigate properly.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Aren't we here to investigate?

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,100
Are you raising your voice at me?

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
You yelled at me first.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
When did I ever yell at you?

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,870
(Hunter holding a scalpel)

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,400
(Episode 4)

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,270
- Yes - Chief Rui

40
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,430
We've caught the suspect in the farmland case.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,900
So quickly... How did you catch them?

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,430
As you said, the criminal used a large vehicle.

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,300
It was that kind of truck with a container.

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,430
Thank you so much.

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,500
Thanks to your input, we were able to find the criminal quickly.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,970
Did he confess to the crime?

47
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,400
Not yet.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,070
So I wanted to ask

49
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,700
We're interrogating the suspect. Any useful clues?

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,930
Although we found a similar clue,

51
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,530
there are no other connections to Forensic Wu's case.

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,330
Leader Zheng, more importantly...

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,070
- Is that person... - Leader

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,500
I need to get back to work.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,930
I'll call you later.

56
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,670
Is the witness's testimony accurate?

57
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,329
Alright, I understand. Please send me the recording immediately.

58
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,530
Leader Zheng

59
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,600
Chief Rui

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,970
Where's the suspect?

61
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,400
In the interrogation room

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,170
But why are you here

63
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,030
This is for you

64
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,770
It's the soil analysis result

65
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,600
I figured you might be too busy to take calls

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,970
You might need it during interrogation

67
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,170
Right

68
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,030
Thank you very much

69
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,329
(Only Exhibit No. 1 tested for sodium)
which is different from the crime scene soil

70
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,100
The soil on the plastic sheet tested for sodium

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,170
This means the murder location differs from the body dump site

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,330
Wait a second

73
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,830
Qingyun Port

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,430
The suspect's warehouse is at Qingyun Port

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,230
The sodium content, salt, probably due to seawater

76
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,230
What about a confession? Did he admit to it?

77
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,830
Not yet, but he can't deny it

78
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,500
Three hours before the crime occurred

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,430
Li Yuanzhu was at the intersection, and the rice roll shop's camera also captured him

80
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,900
Currently analyzing if it's the same person

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,500
But the attire looks very similar

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,600
Plus, a witness just gave a statement

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,530
It seems quite credible

84
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,900
Can I...

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,130
See what he looks like

86
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,500
What

87
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,430
The suspect's appearance

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,530
I'm curious about what kind of person he is

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,430
That's a bit difficult...

90
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,600
Aren't we partners working together?

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,630
That's right.

92
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,830
But according to the rules, I can't disclose this to outsiders.

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm the forensic scientist in charge of this case.

94
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,830
And a relative of the victim.

95
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,900
You actually call me an outsider?

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm a bit upset to hear that.

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,070
That's not what I meant…

98
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,770
I put aside my other cases.

99
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,670
Came as soon as the results were out.

100
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,470
Just to solve this case.

101
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,870
Yes, I understand.

102
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,930
But this isn't a decision I can make alone.

103
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,070
You're implying you don't trust me, right?

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll let you have a quick look then.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
Don't worry.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,430
I don't want to stay long either.

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
(Restricted Area, Unauthorized Persons Prohibited)

108
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,570
Are you okay?

109
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,830
I'm fine.

110
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,670
How many times do I have to say it?

111
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,570
It's not me.

112
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,870
Are you sure?

113
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,370
Lying could lead to charges of perjury...

114
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,670
This cargo truck.

115
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,870
This cargo truck is yours, isn't it?

116
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,770
And this jacket and fisherman's hat.

117
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,270
They look a lot like what you're wearing now.

118
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,500
Yes, I did park the truck here and delivered goods.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
But that's not me.

120
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,770
And besides...

121
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,530
So what if their outfits are similar?

122
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,270
You can't even see their faces clearly.

123
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,570
You should provide concrete evidence.

124
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,270
Someone saw you moving the body from the car.

125
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,570
Are you still going to deny it?

126
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,500
Am I losing my mind?

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,930
Why transport a body in a car? It's so disgusting.

128
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,700
Hold on.

129
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,970
So that's what happened.

130
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,830
When I was delivering goods a while back,

131
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,970
there was once a cardboard box broke, so I used plastic wrap instead.

132
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,270
It was goods from Japan, superb quality.

133
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,670
It feels just like a real woman.

134
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,470
You all know exactly what I'm talking about.

135
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,570
It's a life-sized inflatable doll.

136
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,130
You're joking even at death's door?

137
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,230
(Jang Hyeok-geun senior)

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,970
Yes, Senior Jang.

139
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,800
Chief, we just got a message from the support team.

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,330
Kwon Hyeong-jo is at the warehouse in Cheongun Port.

141
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,400
They searched everywhere and only found a life-sized inflatable doll.

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,630
What should we do now?

143
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,000
They didn't say it was me, right?

144
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,970
You brought this on yourself.

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,370
That's the biggest problem with cops in South Korea.

146
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,900
Are they possessed by laziness?

147
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,070
Always looking for the easy way out.

148
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,170
Senior.

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,870
Is it okay for detectives to act like this?

150
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,770
It's not like it's the 1980s anymore.

151
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,370
Got it all recorded now, right?

152
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,430
Look at his brutality.

153
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,770
Five counts of fraud and theft in the past.

154
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,330
How could you possibly commit murder?

155
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,900
At most, it's accidental manslaughter.

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,300
You're just a shameless petty criminal.

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,230
Murder is too hard for you, right?

158
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,030
Probably happened after getting drunk.

159
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,970
Got into a fight with a friend and accidentally did it, right?

160
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,530
What did you say?

161
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,230
That's true, not everyone can commit murder.

162
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,600
A loser like you

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
doesn't even have the guts to act.

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,800
So you just follow girls around, right?

165
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,230
Who's following?

166
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,870
Those women were the ones who flirted with me first.

167
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,700
And then?

168
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,300
She probably hates someone as useless as you, right?

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,730
Were you so mad that you wanted to kill her?

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,830
No.

171
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,230
Your wife just adores you to death.

172
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,600
This bastard.

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,970
You're finished, damn it.

174
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,000
- Brother - Wait, stop…

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't be so impulsive.

176
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,000
(Ryuugawa Police Station)

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,870
Damn, I can't swallow this.

178
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
What do you want to do?

179
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,000
What's the right move here?

180
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Kneel down.

181
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,370
Kneel before me

182
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,670
This bastard...

183
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,000
What,

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,730
do you want to punch me too?

185
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,470
- Screw you - Come on, hit me

186
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,070
If you dare, try hitting me

187
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,800
Is kneeling enough?

188
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,470
Let me think

189
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,930
Maybe kneel down first

190
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,870
- Brother - Don't do it

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,730
Damn it, what are you doing

192
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,730
The mistreatment you faced during arrest and questioning

193
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,770
As the person in charge of this case

194
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,230
I formally apologize to you

195
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,100
Additionally, the mistakes made in our investigation

196
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,130
will be reported to higher-ups for appropriate action

197
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,900
But among my team

198
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,630
no one will kneel and apologize to you

199
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,670
Is that so?

200
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,870
Alright then

201
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,630
There's no other way

202
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,270
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

203
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,530
Let me return a punch to you

204
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll be gentle, don't worry

205
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,330
Don't push it too far

206
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,970
I'll soon catch you again

207
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,230
Even if you're not a murderer, you did stalk

208
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,830
Didn't you meet my eyes in front of the apartment that day?

209
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,730
I remember it clearly

210
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,530
The detectives from Longchuan police station

211
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,600
Without any evidence

212
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,530
arresting innocent citizens and making threats

213
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,470
being violent towards me

214
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,830
Are you saying the detective attacked you?

215
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,730
Yes, right here, I was hit by a detective

216
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,030
Wait

217
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,170
Please explain exactly what happened

218
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,500
I demand an official apology from Ryugawa Police Station

219
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,270
and compensation for my emotional distress

220
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,230
Come on, take pictures of my injuries

221
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,130
I want the public to know about this

222
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,030
Hey, arrange an urgent press conference today

223
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,070
and sort this out, got it?

224
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,330
You mean today?

225
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,700
Don't you see how big the scandal is?

226
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,570
You made a mess, so clean it up quickly, you punk

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,770
Chief

228
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,000
This isn't Chief Jung's fault

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,270
Then whose fault is it?

230
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,030
Tell me, whose fault is it?

231
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,970
Was it my mistake?

232
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,230
It's because that guy made brother Chang-jin kneel...

233
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,770
Are you going to take responsibility then?

234
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,800
Chief

235
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
Alright, let's do it this way

236
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,030
Chang-jin

237
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,530
You hold the press conference and then leave quietly

238
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,400
Okay, go ahead and do it

239
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,600
No, I'll hold the press conference

240
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,630
Alright

241
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,530
Explain yourself clearly to me

242
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,670
Clean up this mess thoroughly

243
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,170
Yes

244
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,970
Chief

245
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,730
Just leave it there

246
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,330
Aren't you supposed to go to Yongcheon?

247
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,800
I heard there's going to be an emergency press conference

248
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
It's to explain about the suspect

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,170
(The Yongcheon City Yeonsan murder case involving a female student)

250
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,630
(Emergency press conference materials for the Yongcheon City murder case)

251
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,470
(First, in February 2025)

252
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,370
Team leader

253
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
Please look at this

254
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,630
Hogen and Siwoo found this

255
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,170
This is on the day Chief Seo and Oh Min-ho went to Yongcheon

256
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,530
It's footage from the bus they took

257
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,900
There's a man here

258
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,470
He keeps watching them

259
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,530
We find him a bit suspicious

260
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,300
Also, the man in the surveillance at the snack shop

261
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,370
Seems to resemble him more than Kwab Hyungjo

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,230
Of course, we need further investigation to confirm

263
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,730
At least for today's emergency press conference

264
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,530
If journalists bring up serial murders

265
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,100
We could mention we have a potential suspect

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,270
Alright

267
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Mr. Kwab Hyungjo, who was mistakenly identified as the suspect, claims

268
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,070
The police used violence and conducted coercive interrogations

269
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,000
Is that true?

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,170
We admit that there were indeed mistakes in the investigation process

271
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,970
As the person in charge of this case, I must take full responsibility.

272
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,300
Once again, to Mr. Kwon Heungjo, who suffered,

273
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,030
I express my deepest apologies.

274
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,400
We have found two bodies.

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,230
Is there a connection between the two cases?

276
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,730
The second case is still in the preliminary investigation stage, so we cannot disclose details yet.

277
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,130
The second victim

278
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,200
is the forensic investigator responsible for the first case.

279
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,070
Are you sure the two cases are completely unrelated?

280
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,800
Yes, so far, there is no confirmed connection.

281
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,100
Have you identified a suspect in the dismemberment murder case?

282
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,970
Not yet.

283
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you have evidence that can lead to the suspect?

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,099
Yes.

285
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,000
(Is the potential suspect… the same person in the sushi shop and transit surveillance?)

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,329
If reporters mention serial murders,

287
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,869
we can also mention that we have a potential suspect.

288
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,329
We have obtained important evidence and are conducting a search.

289
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,030
Can you reveal what the evidence is?

290
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,130
This part…

291
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,730
We're still searching, so it's inconvenient to specify...

292
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,500
So, you haven't found any concrete evidence yet?

293
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
Is it likely to turn into a cold case in the end?

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,700
What is the main reason for the investigation's stagnation?

295
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,830
Please explain...

296
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,030
What exactly is the so-called important evidence?

297
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,800
It's a fingerprint.

298
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,130
A fingerprint?

299
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,970
Among the physical evidence in the murder case of the Ryukawa female student,

300
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,200
we found a new fingerprint.

301
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm Suh Shi-Hyun, chief of forensic medicine at the Seoul Scientific Investigation Institute.

302
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,270
I was responsible for the autopsies of the two bodies recently discovered.

303
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,730
Both were handled by me.

304
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,600
(Fingerprints discovered in two murder cases)
I'll address any questions regarding the National Forensic Service.

305
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,170
Have you identified the fingerprints mentioned earlier?

306
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,270
The fingerprint is not complete.

307
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,700
Identifying someone from it is very difficult.

308
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,930
We need more time.

309
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,430
Are the new fingerprints

310
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,170
the same as the unidentifiable ones from the dismemberment murder case?

311
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,230
Yes.

312
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,370
The fingerprints found in both cases

313
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,700
belong to the same person.

314
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,030
Are you saying

315
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,330
that the two recent murders in Yongcheon...

316
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,570
That's right.

317
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,200
It's a serial murder case.

318
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,770
Have you found out why the two victims were targeted by the killer?

319
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,730
Have you ever heard of the name "The Tailor"?

320
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,370
There was thread found on the bodies; could the killer be a medical professional?

321
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,770
To the journalist who mentioned "The Tailor,"

322
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,370
please stop using that term.

323
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,500
And refrain from speculating about the killer's profession.

324
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,430
Among all the cases I've autopsied, the mutilation in this one is the most severe.

325
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,330
The first victim was a student diligently preparing for the police exam.

326
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,070
The second victim

327
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,530
was my colleague.

328
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,330
Therefore, I urge you all

329
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,130
not to use inflammatory language

330
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,130
that gives meaning to such brutal acts.

331
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,700
The killer is just an overly narcissistic

332
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,830
ignorant and useless scumbag

333
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,630
It went bad after sitting for a while

334
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,570
It went bad

335
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,730
Shi En

336
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,900
I need to prepare a birthday gift

337
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,370
Finally, our forensic team will be dispatched to Longchuan City

338
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,830
We'll do our utmost to solve the case as soon as possible

339
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,900
(The killer is a twisted narcissistic "scumbag")

340
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,570
She's completely gone crazy

341
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,600
Have you lost your mind

342
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,230
Please help me set up a temporary morgue in Longchuan

343
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,800
You…

344
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,430
I'll immediately convene a disciplinary committee

345
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,530
The exchange condition is…

346
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,030
I'll sign the Nancheng Association's drug analysis report

347
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,330
What did you say

348
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,900
I'll meet the conditions you want

349
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,100
Then I'll assume you agree and hang up now

350
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,270
Chief Rui

351
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,700
Please stay

352
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,900
Is it true

353
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,670
Did the same fingerprints really appear

354
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,030
Yes, I only heard about it not long ago

355
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,830
Because it seemed like I could help, I hurried over

356
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,500
I hope I didn't interfere with you

357
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,500
No

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,530
We were quite troubled, thank you for your help

359
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,470
Thanks to you, it should be a big help in our investigation

360
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,530
Yes, that's great

361
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,630
Team Leader

362
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,870
Didn't even discuss a single word with me

363
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,970
and declared it a serial murder case? Who agreed to that?

364
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,830
A forensic scientist should act like one

365
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,030
Just find the evidence and hand it over to us

366
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,970
Why are you showing up at other people's press conferences for no reason

367
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,570
and stirring everything up?

368
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,470
And Jung Jung Hyun, why didn't you stop her?

369
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,200
-I'm sorry... -You shouldn't be angry at me

370
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
but thank me instead

371
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,500
What?

372
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,630
Please don't expect or trust what the organization says

373
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,700
that the case will cool off after delaying

374
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,470
If we don't catch the killer now, the chance of a third...

375
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,930
no, a fourth, fifth body appearing

376
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,770
is practically a hundred percent

377
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,700
What did you say?

378
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,770
What nonsense are you talking?

379
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,670
This case will bring a major disaster to Yongcheon Police Station

380
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,000
And it'll be a significant blunder

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,630
in the Chief's police career

382
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,300
Ryu Se Hyun

383
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,170
Who do you think you are to threaten me?

384
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,730
I will...

385
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,170
assist Team Leader Jung Jung Hyun

386
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,270
and deliver results for you, Chief

387
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,070
I will definitely...

388
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,300
catch the killer

389
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,300
Therefore

390
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,570
please give us a chance

391
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,470
May I ask your full name?

392
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,300
Hello

393
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,730
I'm Kim Woo-kyung, head of the Criminal Support Unit

394
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,800
What?

395
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,600
Did you say there's a dismembered body in the trash can?

396
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,030
Where is that?

397
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,370
Please tell me

398
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,530
Are you saying the body discovered this time is not your son?

399
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,630
Yes

400
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,800
Yes

401
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,800
For this kind of missing person report, you need to contact the local police station

402
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
We're starting the full meeting now

403
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,970
The first two cases that happened in Yongcheon

404
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,400
will be investigated as serial killings

405
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,670
What we know currently includes…

406
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,470
Unidentified fingerprints, household wire

407
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,670
Bleach and brushes

408
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,430
And only sodium

409
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,470
With just these, it's difficult to grasp…

410
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,400
What the killer means by using these

411
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,500
And what the objective is

412
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
What we do know is

413
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,630
The killer has a consistent pattern

414
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,300
But what's peculiar is his different methods of disposing of bodies

415
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,900
The first case discovered in the fields was an intact body

416
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,270
However, in the second case

417
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,900
(Shijingdong victim, Yanshan amusement park victim)
the bodies were dismembered at the joints

418
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,530
Why is there a difference?

419
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,800
And why were each of the chopped-off fingers

420
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,600
hidden back inside the body?

421
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,870
These are all things we must investigate thoroughly.

422
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,930
Even though all the dumping sites are open areas,

423
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,130
they just happen to have no surveillance.

424
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,270
So it's likely someone from Longchuan

425
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,770
or someone very familiar with Longchuan.

426
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,400
The dismembering technique is meticulous and clean.

427
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,870
Seeing how boldly the body was disposed,

428
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,470
the killer may likely be an egotistical,

429
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,530
power-hungry serial murderer.

430
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,230
The killer won't be caught easily,

431
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,500
and is not someone impulsive or sentimental.

432
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,770
They might even manipulate us sometimes.

433
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,770
(Longchuan City)

434
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,970
This case is a huge challenge for us.

435
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,500
Please remember,

436
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,570
we must work together.

437
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,930
Also, we can't jump to conclusions.

438
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,200
The moment we fall into the killer's trap,

439
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,470
we'll never catch them.

440
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,600
The killer is just an overly narcissistic,

441
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,370
ignorant, useless scumbag.

442
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
What should I give her for her to like it?

443
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,130
Miss, we've closed for the day.

444
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,600
Hey sir, did you see this?

445
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
I told you when I first saw it, it's hard to clean.

446
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,170
What are you talking about?

447
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,670
It wasn't dirty when I gave it to you.

448
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,670
Is this guy joking?

449
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,130
Are you trying to blame your mistake on the customer?

450
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
No, that's not it.

451
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
Of course, it’s my fault.

452
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,570
Alright, I'll help you with the dry cleaning again.

453
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,900
But it’s getting late today…

454
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,730
Why bother with dry cleaning?

455
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,700
It’s completely unwearable now.

456
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Forget it, just compensate directly.

457
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,070
Probably compensate me…

458
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,870
(Note: around 4,000 yuan)
80,000 would be enough.

459
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Tomorrow, after I wake up,

460
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I’ll come right over to help with the dry cleaning.

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,870
Can you compensate me or not?

462
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,970
Okay.

463
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Are you speaking half-phrases to me now?

464
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,830
I said I can pay you.

465
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,400
But since it’s cash, I have to get it from over there.

466
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,930
Wherever you need to go, just hurry up with the payment.

467
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,600
Is that okay?

468
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,270
I think it should be.

469
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,530
What are you doing right now?

470
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
I told you to hurry up and give me the money.

471
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,430
By the way,

472
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,100
Miss, what size clothes do you wear?

473
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,300
Well...

474
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,500
What are you doing now?

475
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,870
Size 55, right?

476
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,370
Shoes should be size 24, right?

477
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,770
Most of the clothes here

478
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,870
have been abandoned.

479
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,770
Clothing is like that,

480
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,500
easily forgotten.

481
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,670
Do you know why this happened?

482
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,900
It's because there's too much of it.

483
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,370
Just like people.

484
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,830
Where are you going?

485
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,700
I found the clothes I want to give you.

486
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,870
No...

487
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,930
It's not necessary.

488
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's pretend it never happened.

489
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,130
How is it?

490
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,770
It's beautiful, isn't it?

491
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,630
(Laundromat)

492
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,670
(Longchuan Clean Laundromat)
