On the day of the incident, Lee Yeon-joo was at the roll shop

at 6:42 PM

18
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,500
had her last meal

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
then walked home in about five minutes

31

I'll check Lee Yuen-joo's movements in Yongcheon.

35
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,230
And the situation at the scene.

36
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,130
Oh right.

37
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,130
Focus on the man with the cap from the roll shop and the bus station, right?

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,870
That's correct.

39
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,100
OK, got it.

40
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,070
Let's begin dividing the tasks.

41
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,600
Everyone, gather in the meeting room.

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
Yes, got it.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,230
Come in, please.

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,900
Oh dear.

46
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,730
Just press and it locks.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
There's a bed, TV, and washing machine.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,430
You just need to move in.

49
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,100
If you decide to move in, I'll tidy everything up here.

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,230
Can I move in today?

51
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,770
Today, immediately?

52
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,970
Well, it's not impossible.

53
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,870
But the wallpaper needs redoing and the curtains need replacing…

54
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,970
Forget the wallpaper and curtains.

55
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,300
Just change the door lock.

56
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,530
Alright.

57
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,900
(Yongcheon Police Station)
But is there something urgent?

58
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,200
Seo Si-hyun, that woman is really terrifying.

59
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,100
She'll do anything to get what she wants.

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,530
She worked with Min-ho for five years and changed just like that.

61
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,600
Why?

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,030
Of course, she's afraid Brother Minho will leave.

63
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,700
She only feels secure when she puts everyone beneath her.

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
Brother Minho worked tirelessly.

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,330
He fought hard to win a case.

66
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,670
What case is that?

67
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,200
The case involving player Nam Seong-hyeop.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
She obviously feels uneasy about it.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,070
But Brother Minho is determined to do his best for the victims' families.

70
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,970
I believe Brother Minho's death is all because of her.

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,570
Alright, I got it.

72
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,630
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,530
Goodbye.

74
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,230
What should we do?

75
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,330
Looks like we need to meet Officer Seo.

76
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,170
That's right.

77
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,500
But she mentioned in the press conference that it's a serial murder case.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Chief Jung's morale is high because of it.

79
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,670
This seems to be throwing cold water on him.

80
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,100
The chairman is the best.

81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,200
Seriously.

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,300
I heard you love this dish, so I made it myself.

83
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,270

Even if the sirens blared all day,

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,200
would the criminal jump out and say "I'm right here"?

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
At least with police patrols,

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,870
there's some peace of mind, right?

89
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,670
There are many dark corners around here.

90
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,170
And not many streetlights.

91
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,070
By the way, President Choi

92
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,570
I have something to ask you

93
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,830
Please go ahead, Chairman

94
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,470
Can you help change the lock on the third floor?

95
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,030
I've already bought the new locks

96
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,370
Is the house rented out?

97
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,030
Yes, someone just came to see it this morning

98
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,670
It's about to be leased

99
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,770
- Oh, really - Yes

100
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,300
I heard she's a famous forensic expert from Seoul

101
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,730
She said she's moving in today

102
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,970
But the lock is unfortunately broken

103
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,270
- I see - Yes

104
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,030
I happen to have some errands today

105
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,970
No matter how late, I'll replace it today

106
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,270
Please don't worry

107
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you so much

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,130

Is the memorial day for my wife and child

111

112
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,170
That's right

115

Must be happy in heaven

Didn't see Lee Yeon-joo anywhere but the kimbap shop

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,670

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,700
Do I need to go check it out?

Got it.

I'll check the coroner Oh's movements in Seoul.

128

Got off at the same place

But went in the opposite direction

179
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,600

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,430
In front of Wu's house.

186
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,500
This is a serial murder case.

187
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,370
It should also be related to the Li Yuanzhu case.

188
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,070
But we haven't found anything yet.

189
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,900
There haven't been any other results from the drugs or DNA, right?

190
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,470
From the body...

191
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,100
(Detected a large amount of bapron)
A large amount of bapron was detected.

192
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,130
Right, none.

193
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,070
The man from the rice roll shop we mentioned before.

194
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,730
He's still a suspect.

195
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,800
From his appearance, he looks quite similar to the man from the rice roll shop.

196
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,770
He looks a lot like the previous man from the rice roll shop.

197
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,000
But because of the previous experience with Quan Hengchao,

198
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,330
I plan to wait for the verification results before taking action.

199
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,570
When will the results be out?

200
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,670
If we're quick, today; at the latest, maybe tomorrow.

201
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,230
By the way,

202
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm pretty sure this guy has a connection to Longchuan.

203
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,170
How do you know?

204
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,000
Yesterday, I followed his route.

205
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,370
I checked surveillance near dozens of bus stops.

206
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,600
But he wasn't captured at all.

207
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,570
This means he knows Longchuan's geography very well.

208
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,170
So I'm considering issuing a wanted notice for him.

209
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,200
You mean issuing a wanted notice?

210
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
Yes, it’s quite effective.

211
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,970
Although we might not notice

212
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,730
those familiar with the suspect can recognize his features

213
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,400
In that case

214
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,770
he might hide even more before getting caught

215
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,070
That's true

216
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,830
but if necessary, it still has to be done

217
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,600
Yes, Chief Yin

218
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,700
The drug test results for the second forensic case are out

219
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes, are you referring to the Longchuan case?

220
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,900
It's the same as the first case

221
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,570
On the body from the second case

222
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,700
the same amount of Buflon was detected

223
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,470
Got it

224
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,400
Any developments?

225
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,370
Drug test results for both cases are out

226
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,330
Good

227
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
But is that possible?

228
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,430
There are obvious injection marks

229
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,500
It's indeed possible not to detect it

230
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,370
especially in Liyuan Zhu's case

231
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,870
It's been over seventy-two hours since death

232
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,070
In Dr. Wu's case, the neck tissue is missing

233
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,170
making it hard to confirm injection marks

234
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,400
Right

235
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Although that's true

236
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,670
Hold on a second

237
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,630
Hello, this is Jeong Jeonghyeon

238
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,730
Is it the same person?

239
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,930
Are you sure?

240
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,370
The glare in the rice roll shop video is severe, making it hard to confirm...

241
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,470
Okay

242
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,530
Alright

243
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,630
Got it

244
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,170
So I'm considering issuing a warrant for him

245
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,230
Is it the same person?

246
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,430
Are you sure?

247
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,900
I need to find him first

248
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,770
Absolutely need to be one step ahead

249
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,670
(Number not displayed)

250
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,470
(Number not displayed)

251
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,300
Shi En

252
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,600
Have you already forgotten your dad's voice?

253
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,730
That's really sad

254
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,870
In this world, it's just the two of us

255
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,470
Looking back

256
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,000
We were really happy in Helong

257
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,300
Right?

258
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,270
Actually, if it weren't for Eun-shu

259
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,700
We'd still be together now

260
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,630
Where are you?

261
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,430
My only daughter

262
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,470
Happy Birthday

263
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,670
What's going on?

264
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,930
Are you so busy you've forgotten your own birthday?

265
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,670
Do you remember?

266
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
When you were little

267
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,800
Every time someone died

268
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,230
You'd wait for a shooting star to streak across the night sky

269
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,630
At that time, I

270
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,730
Thought you were praying they'd rest in a good place

271
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,070
But one day

272
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,870
you said this

273
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,500
hope it's not just birthdays and business trips

274
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,370
it would be great to enjoy every day...

275
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,370
cream cakes and rice rolls

276
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,000
you were actually wishing for this

277
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,270
I didn't say it at the time

278
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,800
but Dad really felt sorry for you

279
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,900
then buy them for me now

280
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,270
is that what you want

281
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,900
come on, eat up

282
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,200
what are you trying to do by this

283
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,300
are you seeking revenge

284
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,700
revenge?

285
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,970
it's really sad

286
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,200
to not understand Dad's heart like this

287
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,470
Dad hasn't seen you for a long time, and he's really happy

288
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,270
when I was a kid

289
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,670
I came home covered in blood after being bitten by a stray dog in the neighborhood

290
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,330
you said this

291
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,000
the more you try to pull your hand back, the tighter the dog bites

292
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,930
instead, you should...

293
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,230
thrust your hand deep into the dog's throat

294
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,800
to make it unable to breathe

295
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,070
then it will loosen its grip and release my hand

296
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,870
you still remember what Dad said

297
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,570
since you bit me

298
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,030
from now, I'll thrust my hand deep into your throat

299
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,400
how about it

300
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,170
let's have some fun together then

301
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,030
Like before

302
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,200
Dad

303
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,900
Alright

304
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,970
We'll meet soon

305
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,300
My daughter
