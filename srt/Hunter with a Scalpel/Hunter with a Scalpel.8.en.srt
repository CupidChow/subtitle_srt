(The places, businesses, characters, groups, and background settings that appear in this drama are purely fictional and bear no relation to reality)

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,930
(Child actors were filmed with guardians present, and animal scenes were supervised by experts in accordance with animal protection laws)

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,730
What should I do

8
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,130
Does it hurt

9
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,600
I think this is better

10
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,130
I'm okay

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,060
What nonsense

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,030
What's good about it

13
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,760
You still have a fever

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,500
This way, you don't have to go on a business trip with Dad

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,530
Why

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,300
What will you do on a business trip with Dad

17
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,530
I don't want to say

18
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,860
Why

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,430
I just don't want to say

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,300
(Hunter with a scalpel)

21
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,700
"It's meaningless to me now"

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,030
"I never going back"

23
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,760
"Even if I regret it, I can't go back"

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,730
"Forever"

25
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,360

28
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,100
Is it Ga Doo Sun's daughter
(Skinny kid=accomplice?)

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
-Go Eun Soo? -Not her

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,560
-It's another kid -Go Eun Soo?

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,260
(Witness statement from the Blue Barrel Case in Qingyungang)
Her hair was cut very short

32
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,130
Sticking up all over like a hedgehog

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
Like a little devil

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,860
(Messy short hair = a head full of tangled hair)
Messy short hair

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
A head full of tangled hair

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,200
(After her husband Jin Shan-ho passed away suddenly, her depression worsened)

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,630
(Confirmed with paranoia and schizophrenia)

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,500
Oh my, there's so much information

39
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
This is what I was talking about in the Qingyungang case…

40
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,600
No, Leader, you go ahead and stay busy

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,960
I just came back to change my underwear

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Seriously

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,700
I haven't changed it for three days, so I'm really uncomfortable

44
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,060
Yes

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,760
Chang-jin has been like this for two weeks now

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,860
Yes

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,400
What

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,630
He hasn't visited his wife at the hospital for two weeks

49
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,500
Hospital?

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,760
You're the team leader, you should show some concern for your team members, too

51
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Is the senior's wife sick?

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,700
She was diagnosed with kidney cancer a while ago

53
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,230
She just had a transplant surgery earlier this year

54
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,330
But the outcome wasn't very promising

55
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,630
Now she has to undergo dialysis three to four times a week

56
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,830
Chang-jin has to look after the kids and take care of his wife

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,960
And also work in shifts around the clock, burning the candle at both ends

58
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,000
In your eyes, Leader

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,760
Maybe we seem like useless people just trying to keep our jobs

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,600
But we really want to catch the criminal too

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
We're doing it our way.

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
You always act recklessly.

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,630
If things go wrong, Chang-jin could lose his job.

64
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,100
Si-woo finally got promoted to patrol officer.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,830
Now he'll be demoted again.

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,760
I see.

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,830
I didn't know about this.

68
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,660
Sorry, I talked too much.

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,060
I'll get going.

70
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,900
Wait a moment, senior.

71
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,900
(146NA1408)

72
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,930
(146NA1408)

73
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,030
(Episode 8)

74
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,560
Hey, Si-woo.

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,530
Yes…

76
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,530
I need to go to the hospital.

77
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,530
You head back to the station, alright?

78
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,860
Hey, get up!

79
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,230
Yes.

80
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,530
Scared me to death.

81
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,500
What happened?

82
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,330
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,960
Jeez.

84
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not your fault my wife is sick, Chief.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
Why are you apologizing?

86
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
The more Heo-geun says that, the more foolish I feel.

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,660
No, I didn't think it through.

88
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,900
Being a detective isn't a job you can do alone.

89
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,860
Knowing cooperation is needed.

90
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,100
But in my haste, I...

91
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,960
I understand

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,930
I used to be like that when I was young

93
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,900
You might not believe it, even the section chief was once

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,159
before his partner was stabbed to death by a murderer

95
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,700
But honestly

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,860
It's not enough to rely on a sense of mission

97
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
You need some skills

98
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,030
You should know how to take detours when facing obstacles

99
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,100
If you face strong winds and insist on pushing forward

100
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,230
You'll end up being broken

101
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm afraid waiting for calm and ending up with a typhoon

102
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,060
might be what happens

103
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,630
If another victim appears

104
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,500
I would find it hard to bear

105
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,700
The Qingyun Port Blue Bucket case you mentioned

106
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
was the case that got my colleague dismissed

107
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,430
If you're not careful

108
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,200
Forget disciplinary action or suspension

109
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
With bad luck, you could be done for

110
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,430
Is that okay with you?

111
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,660
It's fine

112
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,860
I have no ambition for promotion

113
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,700
I don't care about those things

114
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,659
I just want to hold on until retirement

115
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,630
I have two kids to raise

116
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,830
Yes

117
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,260
This matter was caused by me

118
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,659
It won't affect the seniors and team members

119
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,860
I'll take full responsibility

120
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,800
But I won't be a scapegoat

121
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,930
Just like the senior said, I'll hold back a little.

122
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,630
First think of all the possible ways out.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,930
You should leave quickly.

124
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm going to meet my wife for a date.

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,660
(Number not displayed)

126
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Hello.

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Is everything taken care of?

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,130
Of course.

129
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,160
Spent more time because I helped clean up a mess.

130
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,060
Think about it.

131
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,300
The kid who wanted to kill me suddenly changed attitude.

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,800
I have to prepare a backup plan, right?

133
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,530
It's okay.

134
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,660
Evidence needed to be planted should be as fresh as possible.

135
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,200
Anyway, I originally planned to deal with him before he became a suspect and got arrested.

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,100
Yes, I thought the same.

137
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,360
Managed to make him a suspect with difficulty.

138
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,900
If he gets caught easily, it would be useless.

139
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,500
I'll tell you the address now, come over.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,360
No, I'll send you the address.

141
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,960
Bring Woo Min-ho's body here.

142
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,830
Does it really work just because I allowed it?

143
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,260
Now the team is busy with a 48-hour stakeout to catch the bus monitor suspect.

144
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,000
How about you?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,430
-Calling him a witness, that punk. -Wait.

146
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,260
Don't stop him, he deserves a few more hits.

147
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,160
Do you know how many police officers were dismissed because of the witness testimony?

148
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,900
-What do you mean, witness? You brat -Wait

149
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Don't stop him, he deserves a few more punches

150
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,830
Do you know how many officers lost their jobs because of that witness's testimony?

151
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,600
Did you know she has a history of mental illness?

152
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
I know.

153
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,960
And you're still willing to bring it up?

154
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,030
If your reckless enthusiasm costs us our jobs,

155
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,230
will you be able to take responsibility?

156
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,000
I understand what the director means.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,460
-That's why I said sorry... -Then why do you keep doing things you need to apologize for?

158
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,630
Why is that?

159
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,900
This guy seriously...

160
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,160
Chief Zheng,

161
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm begging you...

162
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,130
If this case goes wrong because you get involved,

163
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,530
it won't be just you who suffers.

164
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,230
We could all be ruined.

165
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,430
Chief,

166
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,730
I've sent you the phone numbers and addresses of colleagues investigating the case.

167
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,730
Give them a call.

168
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,660
If they don't answer, go find them at home.

169
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,800
What's going on with you now?

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,830
Director, just trust Chief to investigate.

171
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,700
The Blue Barrel case is very similar to ours.

172
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,200
At the time, the witness statements sounded a lot like the child in this current photo.

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,160
Cases with such high similarity are rare.

174
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,200
-Hello -What's up?

175
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,760
Why are you making a fuss? What's wrong with wanting to investigate? Stop nagging.

176
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,700
I wanted to respect you as a colleague,

177
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,760
but when did you start becoming so stubborn and old-fashioned?

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,360
Chungjin didn't mean any harm...

179
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,400
Sorry.

180
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,160
You little punk.

181
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,730
Damn it, shut up

182
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,900
How long are we going to read this

183
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,430
Just bear with it

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Yes, Chief Yang

185
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,330
How are you doing, Team Leader Zheng

186
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,260
I'm doing okay

187
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,730
You're working too hard

188
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,930
I don't know why there are always murders in Longchuan

189
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,830
We should catch the killer sooner

190
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,760
It's so embarrassing

191
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,060
It's not just your responsibility

192
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,230
Chief Rui has already set up a temporary autopsy lab

193
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,100
She should also do her part

194
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,900
No, just her being here helps us a lot

195
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,530
Really, she can't do much by herself

196
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,730
So why did you come to see me

197
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,160
Oh right

198
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,360
Chief Rui keeps saying that if test results are out

199
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,330
Contact her immediately, yet she's not answering the phone

200
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,530
Is there anything new

201
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,360
The drug results for the third case are out

202
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,400
It's also Bavron

203
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,330
What, Bavron?

204
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes, the drug that appeared in the previous two cases

205
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Did it appear in the previous two cases?

206
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,300
Don't you know?

207
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,530
Well…no…

208
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,160
Anyway, thank you

209
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,600
I have to go to a meeting now

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,630
I'll contact you later

211
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,930
Okay

212
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,000
Just call me

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
You're so busy, why come all the way here?

214
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,000
I happened to be in Seoul, so I dropped by for some investigation

215
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,060
I've been so busy lately

216
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,230
I accidentally deleted the letter Chief Choi sent me

217
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,530
I haven't organized the documents yet, so I felt embarrassed to tell her directly…

218
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,560
That's great

219
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,900
If you told her, you'd definitely get yelled at

220
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,760
After all, the chief is quite straightforward

221
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes

222
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
(Postmortem drug assessment report)
Here you go, chief

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,730
I'll send another copy to you

224
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,930
Okay

225
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,230
(Postmortem drug assessment report)

226
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,900
(High quantity of Barbulone detected)

227
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,360
Barbulone
More than 5.6 micrograms per milliliter detected

228
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,430
(Postmortem drug assessment report)

229
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,500
(Unable to determine)
Unable to determine…

230
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,300
You're here

231
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,030
(Chief Seo Hyun Rye)

232
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,400
The drug assessment report for two cases

233
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,860
The assessment report, huh

234
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,460
Of course

235
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,800
(Postmortem drug assessment report)

236
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,760
(Unable to determine)

237
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,099
"The number you dialed is unavailable and will be forwarded to voicemail"

238
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,960
Because of this, my daughter

239
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,360
Hit her dad?

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,230
You can't catch me with just this

241
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,660
I've declared myself dead long ago.

242
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,860
You want a dead person

243
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,730
to become a suspect?

244
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,400
It's okay, anyway you're still alive, right?

245
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
Just leave evidence

246
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,030
and once dead, make sure the body is found.

247
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,800
Along with your truck, which you consider your alter ego, buried together.

248
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,500
Wow, our Seun really has grown up.

249
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,230
Grown up.

250
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,860
I understand this expression.

251
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,430
When people are terrified in front of you,

252
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,130
they make exaggerated reactions to avoid detection.

253
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,200
That's your expression now.

254
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Don't you remember?

255
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,530
Of course I remember, how could I possibly forget?

256
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,400
Se-hyeon, Yoon Se-eun.

257
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
You really need to think this through.

258
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Doing this might cost you your job.

259
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
You actually called me Se-hyeon.

260
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,530
Looks like you're really flustered.

261
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,600
What nonsense are you saying?

262
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,130
I'm worried about you, okay?

263
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,630
Really?

264
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,030
Even if it's discovered,

265
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,530
I'll sleep more soundly than when you're found to be alive.

266
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,730
I've saved you countless times.

267
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,800
You also need to give me a chance.

268
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,660
Hey.

269
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,130
Are you really planning to kill me?

270
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,830
Aren't you doing this now because you're scared?

271
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,700
You're scared of me, that's why you hit me, isn't it?

272
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,100
You're scared of me, brat.

273
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,600
So noisy!

274
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Now really...

275
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,260
Let's finish this once and for all.

276
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,100
Where are the car keys?

277
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,460
Where are the car keys?

278
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,030
Don't think

279
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,530
it'll go as you wish.

280
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,700
Really?

281
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Even if I have to die

282
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,230
I never...

283
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,130
thought...

284
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,530
I'd die by my daughter's hand.

285
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,460
Today's trick is really novel.

286
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,360
But I won't kill you.

287
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,500
I love you so much.

288
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,830
But

289
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,760
you must be punished.

290
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,500
Who's there?

291
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,230
Sihyun.

292
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,130
Come to Daddy.

293
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,200
-Sihyun... -Left twice

294
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,660
Up twice.

295
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,360
I want to be a great person.

296
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,330
I don't want Dad to scold me.

297
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,330
How's today?

298
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,600
Be honest.

299
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,030
When Dad was choking you,

300
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,860
didn't it feel exhilarating?

301
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,530
You'll never escape my grasp.

302
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,000
Absolutely...

303
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,360
My child...

304
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Sih Eun, where are you going?

305
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,100
Sih Eun...

306
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,700
Come to Daddy's side.

307
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,030
Sih Eun, Yun Sih Eun.

308
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
Sih Eun.

309
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
You'll never escape my grasp.

310
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,900
Sih Eun, Daddy will forgive you.

311
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,060

312
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,860
Are you okay?

(Longcheon Police Station)

317
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,800
(Longcheon Middle School)

318
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,400
Grab some tissue for me.

319
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,760
You didn't answer your phone or come to work. I was worried about you.

320
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you busy?

321
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

322
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,330
I see.

323
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,600
To prevent the wound from worsening.

324
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,200
Take medicine three times a day.

325
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,600
You rest, I'll tidy up and leave.

326
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,730
You're making a lot of noise. Just sit still.

327
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,660
What?

328
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,430
You can just stay quiet.

329
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,030
Chief Ray.

330
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Why did you become a forensic pathologist?

331
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,200
To uncover the truth

332
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,500
To prevent more victims

333
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,660
To offer some help to the bereaved families

334
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,560
That's why I became a forensic scientist

335
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,560
Without holding onto this belief

336
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,130
Doing this work would be very difficult

337
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,600
It's a bit embarrassing to say

338
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,030
I often got into trouble in my teens

339
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,530
Felt like no one was on my side in the world

340
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,700
Always filled with anger

341
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,800
One day

342
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,400
A shop I often visited was robbed

343
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,930
The police arrested me

344
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,900
They didn't ask anything or listen to my explanation

345
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,260
They just insisted I was the criminal

346
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,060
There were no cameras around

347
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
I was really worried

348
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,930
Even if I said I didn't steal

349
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,430
No one believed me

350
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,760
I was so frustrated I almost went insane

351
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,860
But had no way to prove my innocence

352
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,130
I thought I was really going to jail

353
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,730
Then suddenly the police said they caught the culprit and told me to go home

354
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,660
I found out later

355
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,900
Because I seemed genuinely distressed

356
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,600
The police station captain who arrested me conducted a private investigation

357
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,460
So I went to find him

358
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,230
Asked him why he helped me

359
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,230
Do you know what he answered?

360
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,430
"Your eyes already said it"

361
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,200
"Do you want me to help you?"

362
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,300
He looked incredibly handsome then.

363
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,860
So I immediately made up my mind.

364
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,630
I want to become a police officer.

365
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,100
To ensure no one is treated unfairly.

366
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,460
I must become an investigator who arrests the real culprits.
