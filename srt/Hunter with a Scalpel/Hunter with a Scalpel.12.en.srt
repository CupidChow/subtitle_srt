ALL NAMES, LOCATIONS, BUSINESSES, PEOPLE, GROUPS,

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,762
ALL SCENES INVOLVING CHILDREN WERE FILMED WITH A GUARDIAN PRESENT.

7
00:00:57,786 --> 00:00:58,900
ANIMAL SCENES WERE SUPERVISED BY EXPERTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANIMAL PROTECTION LAWS.

00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,413
On your next birthday,

9
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,416
I’ll throw you a birthday party without Dad knowing.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,126
Just clean this part with bleach roughly.

11
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,753
I’ll do a full car wash tomorrow.

12
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,715
Change your clothes before that — if it splashes, the smell will stick.

13
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,467

HUNTER WITH A SCALPEL

18
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,986
So, you were attacked while sleeping,

19
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,280
and then some woman showed up and attacked again?

20
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,823
And then she treated you?

21
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,993
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, that’s what I said! Yes?

22
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,871
How many times do I have to tell you?

23
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,331
Look! Look at this, okay?

24
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,835
She stitched it up right here, see?

25
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,129
Hold on a sec

26
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,801
Is this the woman who attacked you?

27
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,094
Yes, that’s her

28
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,888
Yes, yes!

29
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,723
Then why didn’t you report it immediately?

30
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,724
How could I?

31
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,727
She told me to hide for a week if I didn’t want to die.

32
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,147
And she really looked like she would kill me if I didn’t listen.

33
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,654
“If you don’t want to die,

34
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,448
hide for a week.”

35
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,411
Do you remember the person who attacked you first?

36
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,288
No

37
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,291
It happened so fast… I couldn’t tell.

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,168
Ah

39
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,670
- The smell - What smell?

40
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,589
Bleach

41
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,299
Right

42
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,801
It was on their hands

43
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,969
While I was sleeping,

44
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,263
I smelled a strong bleach odor...

45
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,015
And then I was stabbed here

46
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,800
EPISODE 12

47
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,522
Detective, about Se Hyeon...

48
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,316
For the past five years, that kid survived on energy bars.

49
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,361
Because she said killing takes a lot of energy.

50
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,657
Do you really think a kid like that could have done something so horrific?

51
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,326
You said you couldn’t trust me,

52
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,245
Then, what’s the point in saying anything?

53
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,506
What did Kwon Hyung-jo say?

54
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,842
Ah, this turned out to be quite ridiculous.

55
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,552
Apparently, there was another attacker.

56
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,263
They say Seo Se Hyeon actually treated him.

57
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,806
Then...

58
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
That means Dr. Seo wasn’t the culprit to begin with.

59
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,351
That’s how it looks.

60
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,146
He didn’t see the face, but it was a man,

61
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,275
and he said there was a strong bleach smell on his hands.

62
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,695
- Bleach smell? - Yes.

63
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,453
- No way... - Just like you suspected,

64
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,247
it’s highly likely that it’s Choi Min-guk.

65
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,544
And Seo Se Hyeon, for whatever reason,

66
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,838
already knew about Choi Min-guk’s existence.

67
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,047
Could be an accomplice.

68
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,634
Or maybe not, considering Seo Se Hyeon attacked Choi Min-guk.

69
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,720
Ah, of course...

70
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,557
They could’ve staged the whole thing to mislead the investigation.

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,976
No, I don’t think that’s it.

72
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:38,189
Well, we’ll find out once we investigate.

73
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,817
The problem is this...

74
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,152
Getting approval from the Chief

75
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,738
is going to be really tough for the Team Leader.

76
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,949
With the public notice and Major Crimes Unit involved...

77
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,409
Jeez...

78
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,289
Unless Team Leader Hong supports it, right?

79
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,292
I’ll do it without needing approval.

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,209
What?

81
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,544
Sunbae-nim,

82
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,630
please help me.

83
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,133
Choi Min-guk, the owner of Yongcheon Clean Laundry...

84
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,344
We need to investigate him as a prime suspect.

85
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,720
So,

86
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:13,099
let’s do it after we catch Seo Se Hyeon, okay? Why don’t you get that?

87
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,020
Team Leader Hong, what do you think?

88
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,106
Just from the bleach smell alone,

89
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,984
we can’t definitively say that Choi Min-guk, the 5th victim,

90
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,904
is actually a suspect, can we?

91
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,156
And apparently, he has a leg injury...

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,241
But in the CCTV from incident 2 on the bus,

93
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,327
the suspect chasing the victim

94
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,245
was walking completely normally.

95
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,372
Really?

96
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,417
Well, yes, I suppose so...

97
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:44,339
And the fact that the victims from case 1 and 3 are connected to Choi Min-guk’s laundry...

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,174
Of course we have to investigate that.

99
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,135
I believe that investigation is already underway.

100
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,970
What? Ah, yes.

101
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,305
Ah, well...

102
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,766
It was a different situation back then.

103
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,810
Wait—are you saying that

104
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,396
you conduct witness interviews differently depending on the situation?

105
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,647
No, that’s not what I meant...

106
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,484
Seriously, Team Leader Hong, the way you talk is so weird.

107
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,028
So what, are you saying we’ve been doing sloppy investigations this whole time?

108
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,488
Enough!

109
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,990
Why are you yelling like you did something right?

110
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,619
Now that Team Leader Hong came and cleaned up everything,

111
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,579
you all are just sitting around doing nothing, huh?

112
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey, Chang-jin.

113
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,709
Starting today, you’re reassigned to the Traffic Division.

114
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,044
Chief, sir...

115
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,629
That’s a bit...

116
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,589
Crimes kept happening,

117
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,134
and you just let things spiral out of control.

118
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,219
Yet you had the nerve to bring up cold cases?

119
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,596
And even touched an innocent citizen who had nothing to do with it?

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,516
Before I make you take off that uniform, go reflect on your actions.

121
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,603
Sir!

122
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,897
You’re really going to leave just like that?

123
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,983
You should just hold your ground and fight!

124
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,528
Even if I fight, I’m the only one who’ll get hurt.

125
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,155
No, I’ll go instead...

126
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,322
Stop right there.

127
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,199
You really expect us to just stay quiet

128
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,617
in such an unfair situation?

129
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,161
Yes, stay quiet.

130
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,830
It’s okay. I’ll be back soon.

131
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,124
But Team Leader Jung isn’t here either...

132
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,044
If you leave too, our team will basically fall apart.

133
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,336
Damn it...

134
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,468
Hey—uh—about Min-guk... No,

135
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,011
are we just giving up on Choi Min-guk?

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,846
Why would we give up? We’re still investigating.

137
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,433
Wait, then… could this be part of your big picture plan?

138
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,518
Hey.

139
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,228
Knowing Team Leader Jung,

140
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,106
he’d definitely cling to the case, even alone.

141
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,358
So I should at least help him.

142
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,611
Then of course we’ll go too!

143
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,862
You guys stay out of it.

144
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,157
No way! Why should we stay out of it?

145
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,077
You barely joined the Major Crimes Unit,

146
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,369
and now you’re acting all bold?

147
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,705
I have enough investigative experience

148
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,333
to know how to survive emergency situations.

149
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,794
But you? You’d be out in one hit.

150
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,545
Come on...

151
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,340
hyung-nim, you're not really in a position to take that kind of risk, right?

152
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,259
Your wife’s not feeling well, so maybe you’re trying to take it easy,

153
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,054
but this time, it won’t be something you can just brush off.

154
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,932
This could affect your pension. You might lose it...

155
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,602
My wife won’t say anything.

156
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,522
She’s become a fan of Team Leader Jung.

157
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,025
That guy, even with everything going on,

158
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,695
he kept visiting my wife hospital room and taking care of her.

159
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,655
I’m going.

160
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,242
Hyung-nim, I don’t know what you’re planning,

161
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,620
but whatever it is, don’t even dream of leaving me behind, okay?

162
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,289
- Hey, what are you doing? Get out! - I’m not backing out, either.

163
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,126
- Get in, hyung-nim! - Let’s go!

164
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,293
Hey!

165
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,586
You little...

166
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:32,841
Yes, sunbae-nim.

167
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,676
Where are you?

168
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,095
Ah, I’m near the police station.

169
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,431
As of today, I’ve been reassigned to the Civil Complaints Office!

170
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,643
Sunbae-nim, is it because of me…?

171
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,146
Yes! It’s 100% because of you, Team Leader!

172
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,440
So from now on, you’ve got to do me a favor.

173
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,360
- Huh? - Before Choi Min-guk gets discharged,

174
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,445
we’re thinking of raiding the laundry shop.

175
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,239
You can come now, right?

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,533
- If you don’t, that’s betrayal! - Team Leader, please come!

177
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,450
We’re almost there!

178
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,911
If you don’t come, I’ll be really upset!

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,833

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,136
- You’ve completed your discharge, right? - Of course.

181
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,471
Please stop by our laundry shop sometime.

182
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,765
I’ll personally take care of it.

183
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,852
For our dear nurses, I’ll give a 30% discount no matter what.

184
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,228
Oh my, really?

185
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,023
Of course. Please spread the word!

186
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,625
But, sunbae-nim

187
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,044
Is it really okay to keep leaving the civil complaints desk empty?

188
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,879
Ah, come on, whatever.

189
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,298
Lunch break is a perfectly valid excuse.

190
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,509
I’m sorry.

191
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,885
It’s all because of me...

192
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,972
Ah, I told you to stop apologizing.

193
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,141
Hyung-nim, take a look at this.

194
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,734
Looks like a little girl’s room.

195
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,154
But didn’t they say Choi Min-guk’s daughter is dead?

196
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,240
Container.

197
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,492
Right?

198
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,172
What the—shit.

199
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,159
Hey.

200
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,828
Not a single fingerprint here.

201
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,748
Ah, how could there be no fingerprints unless they were deliberately wiped?

202
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,000
Team Leader.

203
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,251
Choi Min-guk just showed up, it's him!

204
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,295
He's here, he's here!

205
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,172
Please stall for a little bit.

206
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,604
- Hyung-nim. - Whoa, you scared me.

207
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,356
Y-you’ve already been discharged?

208
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,027
- Yes. - Ah...

209
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
Well...

210
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,489
I wasn’t injured anywhere serious.

211
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,875
Uh, hyung-nim.

212
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,253
Is it okay to return to the crime scene so soon?

213
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,089
Did the doctor approve?

214
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,340
- Sorry? - I mean...

215
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,301
PTSD? You know, that kind of thing?

216
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,762
You went through something traumatic here...

217
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,973
The memory of that day could come flooding back...

218
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,101
That’s painful, you know?

219
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,435
I’m fine.

220
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,396
Ah, I see...

221
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,153
Detective Park.

222
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,956
You're being rather long-winded today.

223
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,918
Ah...

224
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,214
Me?

225
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,681
Oh? Uh, hyung-nim, just a moment.

226
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,100
Yes, hyung-nim.

227
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,518
Ah, yes, I’m on my way now.

228
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,561
I’ll go ahead, hyung-nim.

229
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,564
Yes, hyung-nim. Ah, yes, yes, yes.

230
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,533
LAUNDRY ROOM

231
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,135
If you cut along the inside edge of the scissors, it cuts better.

232
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,522
No need to feel embarrassed.

233
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,359
When I was little,

234
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,778
my sister taught me everything.

235
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,280
I can do fine on my own.

236
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,915
But my dad said...

237
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,376
you were the one who killed her?

238
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,379
Your sister.

239
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,214
Was it Eun-seo unnie?

240
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,226
I think I need to go to the hospital.

241
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,855
No, you have to stay here until Dad comes.

242
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,484
I'm in bad shape.

243
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,738
If something happens to me, you think Dad’s going to let you off?

244
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,949
Wait a second.

245
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,630
Do you know what that is?

246
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,173
It’s a watch.

247
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,134
That’s not just any watch.

248
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,469
When you need help,

249
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,097
it lets you call someone— A very special kind of watch.

250
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,890
Tch, that’s ridiculous.

251
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,059
You don’t believe me?

252
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,563
Press and hold the big button next to it,

253
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,106
and a red button will appear.

254
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,858
Just press that one.

255
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,901
Then,

256
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,362
someone will come to save you.

257
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,157
Then who’s going to come? Dad?

258
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,908
At that time…

259
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,287
The person you want to see the most.

260
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,262
See? It’s not working.

261
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,057
It’s because the battery’s dead.

262
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,019
Just like charging Dad’s phone…

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,480
Ah, I know what that is.

264
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,148
You plug a cable in here.

265
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,232
That’s right.

266
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,902
You’re smart.

267
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,991
Unnie! unnie!

268
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,625
Yes, this is Choi Min-guk.

269
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,044
Hello, Mr. Choi. We're from Yongcheon’s joint investigation team.

270
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,921
Ah, yes. Hello.

271
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,963
Yes, what’s the matter?

272
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,590
Oh, it’s nothing serious.

273
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,258
We just want to do a reference interview

274
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,760
regarding the recent attack.

275
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,970
Sorry to trouble you while you’re still recovering,

276
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,555
but would you be able to visit today?

277
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,558
Ah, ah, yes.

278
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,851
Or we could come to you if needed...

279
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,478
No, no, I’ll come to you.

280
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,231
You’re all working so hard, day and night.

281
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,315
Then I’ll see you soon.

282
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,483
Yes, understood.

283
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,444
I’ll be there within the hour.

284
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,362
Yes.

285
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,738
Idiots.

286
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,700
Keep investigating for a hundred years, day and night.

287
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,133
POWER OFF

288
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,163
Unnie.

289
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,790
Are you okay?

290
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,418
Unnie?

291
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,671
Unnie, are you okay?

292
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,883
- Hey. - Ah...

293
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,093
It’s me, damn it.

294
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,679
Find anything?

295
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,431
Well, the thing is…

296
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,133
RENTAL VEHICLE 45,000

297
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,598
Yesterday,

298
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,101
he transferred money for a rental car.

299
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,185
A rental car?

300
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,481
Why would someone who was hospitalized need a rental car?

301
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,984
It’s suspicious, right?

302
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,155
Can you confirm the rental car number?

303
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
Send it over.

304
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,828
Chang Jin hyung-nim

305
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,414
You can pull CCTV footage from there, right?

306
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,585
The car rented by Choi Min-guk just exited Yongcheon Interchange.

307
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,544
We’re still tracking it,

308
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,463
and we’ll share the location as soon as it’s confirmed.

309
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,006
For now, get on the highway.

310
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,765
“72 Hours”

311
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,830
Dad.

312
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,958
How’s unnie doing?

313
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,753
She said she needs to go to the hospital.

314
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,515
If we want to make it to the boat by the appointment time,

315
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,350
we have to leave right now.

316
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
Where are we going?

317
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
You take care of unnie.

318
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,202
Dad.

319
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,423
Dad...

320
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,469
It really hurts.

321
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,467
87JU6890

322
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,879
"87JU 6890"

323
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,333
JEON CHANG JIN SUNBAE-NIM

324
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,302
Sir, please check "87JU 6890" for me.

325
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,048
Diazepam.

326
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,717
Amoxicillin.

327
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,386
Oxycodone.

328
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,600
DIAZEPAM, AMOXICILLIN, OXYCODONE

329
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,724
It has to be

330
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,726
exactly these medications.

331
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,645
Got it?

332
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,745
Did unnie tell you what meds to get?

333
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,414
Yes, I wrote everything down here.

334
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,086
You go get them.

335
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,381
I’ll stay and look after unnie.

336
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,732
Come here.

337
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,860
Just hold on a bit.

338
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:54,159
Daddy’s hands are healing hands.

339
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,288
Daddy’s hands are healing hands.

340
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:07,923
Yes, sunbae-nim.

341
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,552
Yes, I checked. 87JU 6890...

342
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,804
It’s a vehicle reported stolen.

343
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,598
We’ve found it. Sending location now.

344
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,933
We’re almost there too,

345
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,018
just hang tight.

346
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,185
Team Leader!

347
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,396
No matter what, do not go alone.

348
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,439
Okay?

349
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,801
Why’d you come in holding the money like that?

350
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,514
Well, unnie wrote it down for me...

351
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,060
but they said I need a prescription to buy it…

352
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,855
What kind of medicine is it?

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,694
Show me your hand.

354
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,073
Quickly!

355
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,090
Dad.

356
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,468
Can I show this wound,

357
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,471
and just get some emergency medicine?

358
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,800
SEOK-AN PHARMACY

359
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,749
Team Leader!

360
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,584
No matter what happens, don’t go alone.

361
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,585
Understood?

362
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
SEOK-AN PHARMACY

363
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,843
Yes, welcome.

364
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,386
Ah, yes, hello.

365
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,307
Ah, yes. What can I get for you?

366
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,517
Ah, yes.

367
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,812
- My daughter got a bit hurt— - Oh my,

368
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,481
Oh no, what happened...

369
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,691
Well...

370
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,777
But I don’t think you should be here.

371
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,113
You should really take her to the hospital.

372
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,240
My daughter is a doctor. A doctor.

373
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,200
Still,

374
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,036
I think it’s better to go to the hospital.

375
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,204
It’s okay.

376
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,958
We're just doing basic treatment before heading to the hospital.

377
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,961
Anti-inflammatory painkillers and wound ointment,

378
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,839
compression bandages, and some gauze, please.

379
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,091
Ah, okay.

380
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,551
Just a moment.

381
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,147
Here you go.

382
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
PAIN RELIEF SPRAY
How much is it?

383
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,443
That’ll be 18,000 won.

384
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,486
Here, here you go.

385
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,447
- Yes, just a moment. - Okay.

386
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,960
Dad! Dad!

387
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,337
Sae-eun! Sae-eun!

388
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,047
- Dad! - Call the police now!

389
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,716
- Dad! Dad! - Sae-eun! Sae-eun!

390
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,927
- Dad! Let me go! - Come here!

391
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,428
- Sae-eun, hurry! - Dad!

392
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,056
Dad! Dad!

393
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,893
Dad!

394
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,296
Chief Seo.

395
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,798
Are you all right?

396
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,883
- Team Leader Jung! - Dad!

397
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,426
Dad!

398
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,678
Can you get up?

399
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,938
Sae-eun, Sae-eun.

400
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,371
Wake up.

401
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,845
Ah, Team Leader.

402
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,641
Team Leader…

403
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,699
You...

404
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,076
dared to...

405
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,287
touch my daughter!

406
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,734
Don't move!

407
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,821
Stay still!

408
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,159
Drop your weapon!

409
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,495
Sae-eun, come here!

410
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,839
No!

411
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,884
No!

412
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,727
No!

413
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,481
Huh?

414
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,908
Requesting backup! Requesting backup!

415
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,752
Oh no…

416
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,844
That day...

417
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,763
when I said I couldn't trust you…

418
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,474
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,103
You're bleeding badly, don't talk.

420
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,192
Team Leader.

421
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,073
Team Leader.

422
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,950
Ah, Team Leader!

423
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,828
Team Leader…

424
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,997
Team Leader!

425
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,082
No, no, Team Leader!

426
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,209
Excuse me! Excuse me!

427
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,546
Someone help us, please! Over here! Here!

428
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,298
