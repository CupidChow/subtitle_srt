1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,546
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,552
Shut up!

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,221
As long as the leader of
our enemies is alive,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,224
as long as they are not made
to pay for their abuses,

5
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,268
their evilness will not stop.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,564
It's true, I knew
where Eduardo was hiding before.

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,691
I immediately went to see him,

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:29,863
so I could finally break the news
about what happened to his fiancée.

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,449
Don't pity me. I've become one of you.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
We're all forced to be sex slaves.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,244
Where is Teresita?

12
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,247
I know it was you who took her away.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,459
-You dare accuse me?
-Hiroshi!

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,212
I wrote a letter.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,425
I wrote down everything I knew.

16
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,596
That friend will make sure
my letter reaches General Homma

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,182
and our dear Emperor.

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,773
Where's the office of Colonel Yuta Saitoh?

19
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,151
It's in that building down there.

20
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,681
I'll release Adelina tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,434
But on one condition.

22
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,106
She must first regain my trust back

23
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,068
for the sake of her family.

24
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,321
Watanabe!

25
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,948
Sir.

26
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,172
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,884
What about Hiroshi?

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,806
He'll be taken to the province,
but not as a translator.

29
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,771
He'll work as a soldier there
to assist our troops.

30
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,568
Yamamoto.

31
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,194
Sir!

32
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,240
Take him to a camp
where he'll face great danger.

33
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,120
Let him die in an encounter.

34
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,298
Don't send them back to their cells.

35
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,845
We'll leave them here,
but stand guard outside.

36
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,146
Yes, sir!

37
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,448
Hiroshi.

38
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,785
You're smart, my friend.

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,874
But you're still a fool.

40
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,797
I'll come back for you tomorrow, miss.

41
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,360
Thank you.

42
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
Where's your master?

43
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,758
He left.

44
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,469
I don't know where he went.

45
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,226
What time will he be back?

46
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't know.

47
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,817
Would you like to have dinner?

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,368
I prepared some for you.
I was about to deliver it to your room.

49
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,040
I would like to take a bath

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,169
and change into clean clothes.

51
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:43,760
I was hoping
to wear something the Colonel would like.

52
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,264
All right.

53
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,391
I'll prepare it right away.

54
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,274
I never thought this would happen.

55
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm really, really sorry, my love.

56
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,407
You have nothing to apologize for.

57
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,332
You were so brave.

58
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,754
My love.

59
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,511
Because of you, we're safe.

60
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,601
But at dawn tomorrow,

61
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,021
I won't see you again.

62
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,860
I'll be sent to the province
to work as a soldier.

63
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,907
They'll hand me a gun
and have me fight against your people.

64
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,123
You don't have to obey.

65
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,000
Why not escape?

66
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,252
Find Eduardo.

67
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,879
Join the rebels.

68
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,050
I'll go with you if you want.

69
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,471
Let's help my brother fight the Japanese.

70
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,065
Hiroshi.

71
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,994
I'm glad you're getting better, Teresita.

72
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,164
You're doing the right thing.

73
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,167
There's nothing else you can do, anyway.

74
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:46,007
What's important
is we survive and stay alive

75
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,844
until the Americans defeat these invaders.

76
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,361
Wait here. I'll get you something to wear.

77
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,533
Forgive me, Eduardo.

78
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,081
But I am no longer worthy of you.

79
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,342
What I am about to do disgusts me.

80
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,433
But I'm left with no choice.

81
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,470
Lord, please forgive me.

82
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,038
Long time no see, foolish colonel.

83
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,838
You saw how evil your people are,

84
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,341
especially that damned colonel of yours.

85
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,178
Adelina, I'm ready
to go against our colonel

86
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,057
because I know he's a monster.

87
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,477
But to turn my back on my country?

88
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,480
I can't do that.

89
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,109
I can't betray my own people.

90
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,112
My love.

91
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,125
Why is everything so difficult?

92
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,090
There's such a high wall between us.

93
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,932
My love.

94
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,311
I hope you can forgive me one day

95
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,398
if…

96
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,984
I kill one of your own.

97
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,906
Adelina, I also need to survive.

98
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,077
I'm sure that the only reason our colonel
wants me to become a soldier

99
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,123
is because he wants me to die.

100
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,753
I don't want to die, Adelina.

101
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,090
I don't want to die in the war.

102
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,301
Adelina.

103
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,765
I still want to see you again.

104
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,608
I searched the country for you.

105
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,612
And now, you're here.

106
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,614
Where's my fiancée?

107
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,740
-I don't know.
-Liar!

108
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,204
I know you wanted to abduct her.
Now, where is she?

109
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:34,170
I also want to know
where our colonel took Teresita.

110
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,345
Colonel Saitoh took my sister?

111
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,348
He's the culprit, Adelina.

112
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
I caught him.

113
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,272
He let himself be caught.
That's when I knew I was right.

114
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,900
He was behind your sister's abduction.

115
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,328
Even if you search the entire camp,

116
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,956
you won't find her.

117
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,296
Where is she?

118
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,510
I won't hesitate to kill you
if you don't confess.

119
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,848
Even if you kill me,
you won't find out anything.

120
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:35,523
That's the reason why our colonel
didn't force you to confess.

121
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,736
He let us go because I threatened him.

122
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,987
I lied.

123
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:49,036
I made him believe I wrote a letter
containing all his misdeeds

124
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,205
in capturing your sister,

125
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,624
and that this letter

126
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,295
was in the hands of someone
ready to send it to General Homma.

127
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,465
So he can read it

128
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,719
and know how wicked he truly is.

129
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,973
And he believed it, Adelina.

130
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,849
Our colonel believed it.

131
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:18,232
Did that devil also tell you
where he took my sister?

132
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,158
But now I'm sure
he's the culprit, Adelina.

133
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,456
He's a monster, Hiroshi!

134
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,460
Your colonel is a monster!
I'll kill him for this!

135
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,381
Colonel Saitoh is a monster.

136
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,427
My God, my poor sister.

137
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,888
Hiroshi.

138
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,264
I'll kill him myself.

139
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,932
I'll kill him myself!

140
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,231
Adelina, my love.

141
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,698
You need to be smarter than that.

142
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,578
You must control your emotions

143
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,791
and not put yourself in danger, now that…

144
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:28,719
now that I won't be around to protect you
once they separate us.

145
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,475
Adelina, you need to be strong.

146
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,393
You need to be smarter,

147
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,774
so the Colonel won't suspect
and lock you up again.

148
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,236
You don't understand, Hiroshi.

149
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,741
I'm different from my sister.

150
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,912
My sister isn't as strong.

151
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,460
She's not used to hardship and suffering.

152
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,550
Your colonel is nothing but a monster.

153
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,302
He has no mercy for my sister.

154
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,013
-He's a monster!
-Adelina.

155
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,559
My love, enough about Teresita.
Think about yourself for now.

156
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,854
Adelina, our safety is our priority.

157
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,108
We need to keep pretending to obey,

158
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,154
so we can continue
looking for your sister.

159
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,534
Do you understand, my love?

160
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,424
Come here.

161
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
Embrace me.

162
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,068
Where is she?

163
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,452
You think I was bluffing?

164
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,995
Help--

165
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,001
I'll really kill you.

166
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,669
So answer me.

167
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,756
Where's Teresita? Where did you take her?

168
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,843
Where are you keeping her?

169
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,563
Teresita will be in even more danger
if you kill me.

170
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,865
Here are your clothes.

171
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,035
I'll get your bath ready.

172
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,714
Don't worry.

173
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,595
We'll treat your wounds,
and we'll cover them too.

174
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,878
My rabid soldiers will surely enjoy

175
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,256
her entire body.

176
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:08,355
I'm sure my men will line up to savor her.

177
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,442
So go ahead, Eduardo. Kill me.

178
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,488
Only misfortune will befall

179
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,658
the sweet Teresita.

180
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,995
Captain!

181
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:29,042
How did Hiroshi know that the Colonel
was behind Teresita's disappearance?

182
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,004
Did you tell him?

183
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,593
People are not useless and stupid.

184
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,930
That's why Colonel Saitoh

185
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:47,394
cannot hide his sins for long.

186
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,858
Not only to Teresita,

187
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,196
but also to Colonel Arata.

188
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,990
Colonel?

189
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,450
Are you in there?

190
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,915
Are you still awake?

191
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
Can the sun rise any faster?

192
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,082
Be patient, Adelina.

193
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,714
Once the sun rises,
we'll be separated again.

194
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,249
Let's forget everything
for the meantime, my love.

195
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,669
Just think about us.

196
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,297
Even just for tonight.

197
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,951
Colonel! Colonel?

198
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,703
What happened here?

199
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,164
Hey!

200
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,875
Yamamoto! Anyone!

201
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,044
Come here! Hurry!

202
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,421
Something bad happened to the Colonel!

203
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,053
Yamamoto!

204
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,377
Good morning, Colonel.

205
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,548
I'm glad you're awake now.

206
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,718
Who did this to you?

207
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,513
That Filipino rascal.

208
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:39,436
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

209
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,492
I need to know which camp Teresita is in.

210
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,953
Mr. Jorge, I need to find her.

211
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,623
"I am ordering Adelina
and the entire Borromeo Family

212
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,835
to go with Captain Akio Watanabe
to Plaza Santa Cruz

213
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,671
to speak to their fellow Filipinos.

214
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,964
No wonder she won't join us.

215
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,717
You're a traitor to our country, Adelina.

216
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,387
You didn't want to eat with me
because you poisoned our lunch.

217
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,472
Admit it!

218
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,266
-They're abducting our women…
-Dad.

219
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,518
…and they are stealing
our country from us!

220
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,978
COMING UP

221
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,647
Dad!

222
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,941
Dad! Dad!

223
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,739
