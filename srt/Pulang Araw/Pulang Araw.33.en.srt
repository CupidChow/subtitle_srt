1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,212
What secret are you
and your father hiding from us?

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,049
What is your relationship with your fellow
Japanese occupying our country?

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,844
Are you betraying the people
who are important to you?

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,805
-Hiroshi.
-Hiroshi and Mr. Tanaka are our enemies?

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,850
Then shouldn't you restrain
your feelings for Hiroshi?

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,728
Would you still want to love an enemy?

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,481
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:28,153
Can we push through with Hiroshi
and Teresita's wedding that was held off?

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,698
But you know why I don't want
to marry Teresita.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,366
Because of Adelina.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,161
You're already betrothed to another
so there's nothing you can do

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,455
but to keep our agreement
with the Borromeos.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,123
The Japanese have taken over Manila!

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,791
Come on, come with me.

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,752
Why? Where are we going?

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,836
The mountains. To fight!

17
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,379
We cannot let ourselves
be conquered by them.

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,423
You and Teresita must not go out.

19
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,674
It's better to be cautious.

20
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,593
You insolent man!

21
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,969
Mama!

22
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:58,141
I would die first before the man
I despise the most can take you away.

23
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,268
Manila Hotel.

24
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,896
Who would've thought
it would fall into our hands?

25
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,940
They'd probably not stop
until our country is in complete ruin.

26
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,693
My only prayer
is that we aren't hit by a bomb.

27
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,361
The Japanese are here!

28
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,863
They're inside.

29
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,989
Francisco,

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,324
please hide my daughters.

31
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,826
Where are your other companions?

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,578
My wife and I are the only occupants here.

33
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,622
Liar!

34
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,790
It's impossible

35
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,084
that you will let your daughters
leave this house in these times.

36
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,554
Search the whole house!

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,348
Find the woman!

38
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,808
Yes, sir!

39
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,862
If I find out that you two are lying,

40
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,616
I won't hesitate
to kill you both where you stand.

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,297
My God.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,209
What are you doing?

43
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,795
What do you want with the Borromeos?

44
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,630
Hiroshi?

45
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,219
We are under orders from Captain Watanabe
to find the young women in this house.

46
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,845
Why?

47
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,350
What does he want with them?

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,352
We don't know.

49
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,187
Where is he?

50
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,147
Can you take me to the Captain?

51
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,733
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,255
Thank God we're safe.

53
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,261
Adelina.

54
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,430
Was that really Hiroshi?

55
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,102
He was truly your savior.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,939
I'm glad he came here.

57
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,611
He was wearing their soldier's uniform.

58
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,077
Do you think Hiroshi is now an enemy too?

59
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,589
I never imagined
he'd become a soldier, Teresita.

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,509
Does this mean…

61
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,556
the man I love is now our enemy?

62
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,186
I know your daughter is here.

63
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,397
You're just hiding her from me.

64
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,899
Pardon me, sir,

65
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,778
but what do you want from our children?

66
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,075
I have the same question, Captain.

67
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,787
What exactly do you want
from the Borromeo sisters, Akio?

68
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,875
You know these people?

69
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,629
Yes, Officer.

70
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,926
Hiroshi is Teresita's fiancé.

71
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,804
They are soon to be wed.

72
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,059
Akio, why can't you answer me?

73
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,146
What do you really want
from Teresita and Adelina?

74
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,861
Adelina…

75
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,660
Adelina, don't think
about it right now, okay?

76
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,746
What's important is we're safe.

77
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,290
Safe from those searching for us.

78
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Because he came.

79
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,010
Señorita, I think
we should leave immediately.

80
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,888
They might return and find you next time.

81
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,686
Wait. Where will we go?

82
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,232
What about Dad and Señora?
Are we just going to leave them behind?

83
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,822
That's no longer important, Hiroshi.

84
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,659
What matters most is that this home

85
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,372
has been chosen by our army
to serve as a base.

86
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,251
So they must leave immediately!

87
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,963
Forgive me, Officer.

88
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,007
But Hiroshi…

89
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,303
where will we live
if you remove us from our home?

90
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,846
I'm begging you.

91
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:57,602
Our Japanese translator
can do nothing about my orders!

92
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,398
Even if you are soon to become his family.

93
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,609
But, sir…

94
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,569
Will you comply with the order?

95
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,529
Or would you rather be punished?

96
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
Exactly!

97
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:17,413
Because anyone who disobeys my orders
will face death!

98
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,421
Forgive me, sir,
but we will follow your orders.

99
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,759
We will leave.
We just need to pack our things.

100
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,720
-Come on, Carmela, let's pack--
-Julio, where will we live?

101
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,430
Mrs. Borromeo.

102
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,142
You may stay at our home for now.

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,895
You will surely be safer with us.

104
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,775
Thank you very much.

105
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,490
Please excuse us,
we'll pack our things now.

106
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,243
Come on.

107
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:07,964
I didn't expect
you'd have a connection with them.

108
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,593
But why would you marry someone
not of the same race?

109
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,220
Forgive me,

110
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,307
but I don't think
I need to answer your question.

111
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,914
Why did you send the servants
with Teresita?

112
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,457
Now we're the ones doing this!

113
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,750
Stop complaining.

114
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,382
We don't have a choice
but to live with the Tanakas.

115
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,260
By the tone of your voice,
it seems you're upset.

116
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,887
Did you notice…

117
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,223
Hiroshi's clothes?

118
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,645
What Eduardo told us might be true,

119
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,524
that Mr. Tanaka is a spy.

120
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,192
We have many friends.

121
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,653
Especially my father.

122
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
How did you know

123
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,783
your fellow Japanese
would invade and attack our country?

124
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,910
Was it because of
your father's so-called friends?

125
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,581
Are you betraying the people
who are important to you?

126
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,125
Did I hear that right, son?

127
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,421
I have my suspicions
that Hiroshi's father is a Japanese spy.

128
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,799
So Hiroshi has now sided with the enemy.

129
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,344
We're in a dire situation.

130
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,597
And what do you want to happen, Julio?

131
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,600
That we refuse to live with the Tanakas?

132
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,519
Now that we need them the most?

133
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,190
It's actually better if we live with them,

134
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,777
so that Eduardo
can't get close to Teresita anymore!

135
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,657
You're still worrying about that, Carmela?

136
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
We might need it,
it's better to be prepared.

137
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,511
Get inside, hurry!

138
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,221
Hurry!

139
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,305
Hurry up.

140
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,141
Eduardo!

141
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,185
Come in. Hurry.

142
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,067
Eduardo!

143
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:38,989
Teresita, Adelina.

144
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,326
What happened to you?

145
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
Why do you look pale?

146
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,747
Some Japanese came to our house
looking for us, Eduardo.

147
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,583
Luckily, Hiroshi arrived,
so we were able to escape.

148
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,438
Sorry if I disturbed you.

149
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,942
How about Teresita and Adelina,
where are they?

150
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,903
Where did you hide them?

151
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,460
Colonel, has the meeting ended?

152
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,044
Yes.

153
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,005
Any directives
from the Lieutenant General?

154
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,133
Let's have a seat and discuss it there.

155
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:56,025
So they have vaudeville in this city.

156
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,652
Vaudeville?

157
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,368
These Filipinos are copycats of the West.

158
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,751
One of these days,
we will enter and clean up their theater.

159
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,505
We will find out who their artists are,

160
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:24,762
so we can use them for the changes
we plan to make in this country.

161
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,653
I thank the Lord for ensuring your safety.

162
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,241
I don't know what I would have done
if something bad happened to you.

163
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,245
Eduardo, I'm sure something bad
would have happened to us

164
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,830
because there was one Japanese
who looked untrustworthy.

165
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,793
We've met him before, Eduardo.

166
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:00,422
He was the rude Japanese
we met at Mr. Tanaka's store way back.

167
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,717
Idiot! Watch where you're going.

168
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,678
You, Filipino. Call your master.

169
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,221
Tell him Watanabe is here.

170
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,640
Is he a soldier too?

171
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,686
So, the rumors are true,

172
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,482
that some of the Japanese living here
are just pretending to be civilians.

173
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,527
What they really want is to conquer us.

174
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
If so,

175
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,366
it's good that you came here
so we can look after you.

176
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,663
But is it true that Hiroshi
has sided with them?

177
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,001
I can't be mistaken, Eduardo.

178
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,298
Hiroshi has indeed
become a Japanese soldier.

179
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,135
I thought only his father
was among the enemies.

180
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,638
But then, so is he.

181
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,850
But I still want to believe
he's a good person.

182
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,064
We grew up with him,
so we know he is not a bad person.

183
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
Wait a minute, not a bad person?

184
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:39,313
Or is he just like other Japanese
who deceitfully pretend to be good to you?

185
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,190
I hope you're wrong, Tasyo,

186
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,487
because I don't want to think
of a childhood friend as an enemy.

187
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,963
Adelina?

188
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,506
Teresita!

189
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,466
-Dad?
-It's Papa.

190
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,093
Dad.

191
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,692
I knew it. You came here to hide.

192
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,198
Thank God you're safe.

193
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,577
Stand back.

194
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,999
Adelina is right.

195
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,585
You're one of our enemies now.

196
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,264
You don't need to call me that, Eduardo.

197
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,892
I didn't come here to hurt any of you.

198
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,193
Aren't I right, Eduardo?

199
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,989
He is still the Hiroshi we know
from our childhood.

200
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,535
So please, put this down.

201
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,667
Son, there's no need to doubt Hiroshi.

202
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,297
He protected us from his fellow Japanese.

203
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,508
So you have nothing to worry about.

204
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,181
Papa, where is Mama?

205
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,558
She's over there.

206
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,727
She didn't come up here.

207
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,772
I think you know why.

208
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,028
Pardon me, but we need to leave now.

209
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,488
Where are you going?

210
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,032
We'll be staying at Hiroshi's for now.

211
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,744
Especially since the Japanese
will be using our home as their base.

212
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,055
Colonel, are they going to assign us
to the troop

213
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,643
that will hunt the Americans
in Bataan and Corregidor?

214
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,687
That is actually what I wanted,

215
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,651
but our Lieutenant General

216
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,946
assigned us here in Manila.

217
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,949
And what will we do here?

218
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,977
But Papa, why would we stay at Hiroshi's?

219
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,437
We have money.

220
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,523
Adelina and I are earning money
from vaudeville.

221
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,693
-We could rent at the--
-Teresita.

222
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,362
Believe me.

223
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,781
I'm sure you'd be safer at our house.

224
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,784
My father and I could protect you.

225
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,911
My dears…

226
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,289
I didn't have a choice.

227
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,875
I don't want those Japanese
to come back and abduct you.

228
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,299
So you better come with us.

229
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,720
Francisco, Yolanda, Meding,

230
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,847
you better come with us too.

231
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,891
Help me with the luggage.

232
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,109
Eduardo.

233
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,534
Take care of yourselves there,
Adelina, Teresita.

234
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,914
Don't worry, I will visit you often.

235
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,961
Take care of yourselves, okay?

236
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,340
Don't worry.

237
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,593
I will honor our promise.

238
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,970
It's not the only thing I'm worried about.

239
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,020
Go on, you'd better leave now.

240
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,231
Take care.

241
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,315
I will say it again…

242
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,109
Take care.

243
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,112
Both of you.

244
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,784
Let's go, Teresita.

245
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,639
One moment, Hiroshi.

246
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,977
May I speak with you?

247
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,108
I really hope they will be safe
in your house.

248
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,153
Because the moment
something happens to them,

249
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,322
or one of them is put at risk,

250
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,243
you're going to pay.

251
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,788
Did I make you pay
for the death of my mother?

252
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,254
Don't worry, Eduardo.

253
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,340
I will look after them.

254
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,801
Especially Adelina.

255
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,398
Eduardo, why did you let Adelina
and Teresita go with Hiroshi?

256
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,651
Even if they're your friends,
you know they're the enemies.

257
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,236
He and Mr. Tanaka.

258
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,582
What's survival?

259
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,544
We all want to live.

260
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,757
We will do whatever means necessary

261
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:27,471
to escape the imminent death
this war will bring.

262
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,001
Did you just pretend
on the night you came to our house

263
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,545
and kissed me?

264
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,216
Are your heart and mouth
full of deceit as well?

265
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,259
COMING UP

266
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,346
-Bring them out, quickly!
-Mother!

267
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,431
Where are you taking me?

268
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,600
Have pity on me! Let me go!

269
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,562
Sister, help me!

270
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,189
Get out of here! Get out!

271
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,440
Help me!

272
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,399
Have pity!

273
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,695
My father lived here.

274
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,572
Do you know what happened?

275
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,324
They turned it to dust.

276
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,909
The Japanese bombarded it.

277
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,411
We will perform for our enemies?

278
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,959
Be careful.
Someone might hear you and report you.

279
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:39,876
Why, Marcel?

280
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,670
Is there a traitor in our group?

281
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,839
Is there anyone supporting the Japanese?

282
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,389
