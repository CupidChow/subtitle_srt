1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>I can't be pregnant.</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,966
<i>I don't want to bear and give birth
to the child of a devil.</i>

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>The Japanese are stricter now,
especially toward men.</i>

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>The Japanese soldiers might see you
as members of the guerrilla.</i>

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,727
Have you had breakfast?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,353
Why? Are you going to feed us?

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>We have new visitors downstairs.</i>

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>Sister Maria suspects
that they might be guerrillas.</i>

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,696
Where are they? I want to see them.

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>Teresita!</i>

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,073
Teresita!

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,909
<i>There's no news about him anywhere.</i>

13
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>Didn't I tell you I'd come back?</i>

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>Bless the Lord Almighty.</i>

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>You got away from those soldiers.</i>

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,254
<i>Colonel, your wife is not inside
the organizer's house.</i>

17
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>We will search the entire Metro Manila
if that's what it takes to find her!</i>

18
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,927
I'm carrying the child of the devil.

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>How can I be with you?</i>

20
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,558
How can I bear to show you

21
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,269
the growing life in my womb?

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,066
So the best thing for us
is to forget each other.

23
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,446
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>Who killed my father?</i>

25
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,326
<i>- Tell me!
- You're looking at him.</i>

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,455
This man is the one
who killed Julio Borromeo!

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,837
You said so yourself.

28
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,259
You never wanted
for any of this to happen.

29
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,722
Neither did I, Teresita.

30
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,435
I never wanted to become a guerilla.

31
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,272
I never desired to kill.

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,191
But I had to, so I can live.

33
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,864
I had to do it for our people.

34
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,742
I had to fight for our freedom.

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,788
I'm just like you.

36
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,876
You who surrendered yourself
to that devil,

37
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,628
so you can live

38
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,882
and save others.

39
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,386
This war may have tainted us for good.

40
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,016
It may have changed us for the worse.

41
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,898
But one thing will never change, Teresita.

42
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,529
And that is my love for you.

43
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,703
I still love you so deeply.

44
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,706
And whatever happens,

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,417
my love will never change.

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,969
Eduardo.

47
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,513
I love you with all my heart.

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,517
I love you very much.

49
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,191
- But I don't know if I can…
- We'll make it work.

50
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,069
As long as we're together, Teresita.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,489
I'm here now.

52
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,576
Please don't push me away.

53
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,414
We'll get through this.

54
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,210
I'll never leave your side.

55
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,047
I promise.

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,855
What?

57
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,025
Everything I told Adelina was the truth.

58
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
You killed Julio Borromeo!

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,328
Are you all right, my love?

60
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,375
Who is this man?

61
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,379
Was he telling the truth?
Did you kill my father?

62
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,068
Tasyo.

63
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,611
Follow me.

64
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,951
Wait, what about them?

65
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,495
Don't worry, they know what to do.

66
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,830
Just follow me.

67
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,249
Hurry.

68
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,340
<i>Who?</i>

69
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,801
Who shot him?

70
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,429
Was it the Japanese?

71
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,140
Did they kill my father?

72
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,811
Monsters!

73
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,648
<i>Anyone can die at war.</i>

74
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,817
Anyone can end up killing

75
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,071
their own comrade.

76
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,783
I can explain.

77
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,368
Is it true?

78
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,459
Is it true or not?

79
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,462
Is it true or not?

80
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,547
Is it true or not?

81
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,132
No…

82
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,887
Adelina.

83
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,389
Hiroshi, behind you!

84
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,189
You betrayed us!

85
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,537
Good day to you, sir.

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,332
- What's your purpose, sir?
- We're looking for a Filipina.

87
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,668
My wife.

88
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,212
Teresita Borromeo Saitoh.

89
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,800
Forgive me, sir.
But your wife is not here.

90
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:11,222
Search the entire church for Teresita!

91
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,181
Yes, Colonel!

92
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,741
Eduardo, you have such a kind heart.

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,455
I don't know why God

94
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,001
gave me someone like you.

95
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,717
You're a gift, my princess.

96
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,388
Never look down on yourself

97
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,226
because your kindness will always outweigh

98
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,855
everything you've been through.

99
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,696
Dry your tears.

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,907
Eduardo.

101
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,034
Eduardo, Colonel Saitoh is there.

102
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,244
He's looking for you, Teresita.

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,787
You need to leave now.

104
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,415
Wait, I know a way out of here.

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,167
Take these weapons with you.

106
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,591
You'll need those.

107
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,801
Let's go.

108
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,304
Follow me.

109
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,848
Hurry.

110
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,071
Is that why you killed him?

111
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,407
To mask me away from the truth?

112
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,327
- Is that it?
- I killed him

113
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,956
because he betrayed our group.

114
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,798
<i>We were in battle.</i>

115
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,299
<i>Many of us died.</i>

116
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,595
<i>The enemies were prepared.</i>

117
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,974
<i>Smoke filled the air.</i>

118
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,312
<i>It was hard to see anything.</i>

119
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>I was terrified for my life.</i>

120
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,576
I panicked, Adelina.

121
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,374
When I saw him,

122
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,420
I thought he was an enemy.

123
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,352
Over here!

124
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,730
He's not here!

125
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,621
Adelina, I didn't know…

126
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,250
I didn't know he was Mr. Borromeo.

127
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,506
I didn't realize that I shot…

128
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,593
and killed your father.

129
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,974
My God!

130
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,152
Are you sure my wife is not here?

131
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,696
Yes, sir. She's not here with us.

132
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,490
Liars!

133
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,243
- Men, find her this instant!
- Yes, sir!

134
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,459
Adelina.

135
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,175
Forgive me.

136
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,470
Adelina.

137
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,848
I'm sorry if I hid the truth.

138
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,643
My love.

139
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,814
But believe me when I say

140
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,067
that it was all an accident.

141
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,753
Why?

142
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,923
Why, why?

143
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,146
Hide, Teresita.

144
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,822
You had your chance, Hiroshi!

145
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,827
You had your chance
when you brought back my father's body!

146
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,663
<i>Why didn't you tell me then?</i>

147
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,457
<i>Why, why?</i>

148
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>I couldn't, Adelina.</i>

149
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,336
<i>Mr. Borromeo.</i>

150
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,466
<i>I don't want your daughter to hate me.</i>

151
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,342
Forgive me.

152
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,345
Adelina, I didn't want you to hate me.

153
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,475
I didn't want to lose you.

154
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,898
Forgive me, my love.

155
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,815
I…

156
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,949
Hiroshi.

157
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,622
Stay away from me.

158
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,668
Sister, let's leave this place.

159
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,170
Let's leave this place.

160
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,176
Adelina, Adelina…

161
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,167
I love you.

162
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,591
I don't know…

163
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,385
I don't know

164
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,388
if I can ever forgive you, Hiroshi.

165
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,559
Maybe only time will tell.

166
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,732
Sister, let's go!

167
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,985
Adelina.

168
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,293
Adelina.

169
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,129
I know you're upset
now that you know the truth.

170
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,799
I can't imagine how angry
you must be right now,

171
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,970
but I hope you find it in your heart
to understand Hiroshi's side.

172
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,643
You want me to understand and accept

173
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,355
that he killed my father?

174
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
It was an accident, Adelina.

175
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,234
He never wanted that to happen.

176
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,823
But it did happen, Sister.

177
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,953
Just like this war, Adelina…

178
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,460
the unexpected will happen.

179
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:08,467
And now that we've witnessed
what it has done to our lives…

180
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,429
- Are you okay, Tasyo?
- I'm fine.

181
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,598
- I think that's all of them.
- Teresita.

182
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,855
Teresita?

183
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,109
Teresita!

184
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,028
Adelina, our lives have stopped.

185
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:36,412
Only time can tell if we survive or not.

186
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:42,001
Think about the guerillas,
who risk their lives every day at war.

187
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,087
How terrified they must've been
for their lives,

188
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,383
knowing that every battle ground
requires them to sacrifice.

189
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,344
What if you put us

190
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,181
or yourself in Hiroshi's shoes?

191
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,646
What if it was you
who unintentionally killed his father?

192
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,611
Would you want him to forgive you or not?

193
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,923
<i>The war has been cruel to all of us.</i>

194
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,969
<i>It doesn't just bring death.</i>

195
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,222
<i>It also brings anger and dispute.</i>

196
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,268
Eduardo.

197
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
She was just here.
How could she disappear?

198
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,441
Let's just go.
Maybe she got scared and ran away.

199
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,444
Teresita!

200
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,872
Forgive me, Eduardo.

201
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,251
I don't want to be a burden to you.

202
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:15,511
<i>That was the last time
Teresita and Eduardo saw each other.</i>

203
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>Same goes for Hiroshi and me.</i>

204
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,227
<i>Until the year 1943 ended,</i>

205
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,229
<i>and comes a new year.</i>

206
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>The guerrillas continued fighting.</i>

207
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,360
Let's go, Eduardo.
There are too many of them.

208
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>They continued to fight our enemies,
who became more ruthless than before.</i>

209
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>It was as if there was no God.</i>

210
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,917
I found an infant!

211
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,005
<i>Like God had abandoned us all.</i>

212
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,055
<i>Then the Americans returned.</i>

213
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,808
<i>God finally gave in to our prayers.</i>

214
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,854
<i>At last, the Americans have came back</i>

215
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,942
<i>to help free the country
from the hands of our ruthless enemies.</i>

216
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,903
<i>They began to infiltrate
the province of Leyte,</i>

217
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>where they started to attack
the enemy's forces.</i>

218
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,037
<i>The American general has also returned</i>

219
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,582
<i>with his promise of freedom.</i>

220
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,104
This is Commander Liwayway.

221
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,150
<i>She's one of the most respected
commanders of the Hukbalahap.</i>

222
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,318
<i>Forgive me for intruding.</i>

223
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,779
It's just that I've never met
such a lady who fights

224
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,865
in such clothing…

225
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:05,120
I don't fight to entice fools like you!

226
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,688
<i>I never should've let her
leave without me.</i>

227
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,690
<i>We'd probably still be together by now.</i>

228
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
<i>What could've happened to them?</i>

229
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>Morena!</i>

230
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,694
<i>I mean, Sister.</i>

231
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,116
COMING UP

232
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,121
