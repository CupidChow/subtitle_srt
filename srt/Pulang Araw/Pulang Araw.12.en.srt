1
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,919
Colonel.

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,591
I found a house that we can use

3
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,388
as our headquarters
once we occupy this city.

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,474
Excellent!

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,934
You are truly reliable.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,853
See you later.

7
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,313
Yes, sir!

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,239
The house is ours.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,787
The beautiful woman there is mine.

10
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,349
Ma…

11
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,394
Ma, how are you?

12
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,239
Ma, we're at the hospital.

13
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,119
You lost consciousness
when you fell down the stairs earlier.

14
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,839
Do you see now, my dear…

15
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,426
what happens when you are being stubborn?

16
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,432
Do you want me to die?

17
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,519
No, Ma.

18
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,688
No, Ma.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,816
Forgive me, it's all my fault.

20
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm not angry with you.

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,452
Just promise me one thing from now on.

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,708
You will never leave me again.

23
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,045
Promise?

24
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,215
I promise.

25
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,440
You may be a hothead.

26
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,110
But you're a good person, Eduardo.

27
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,157
Stop flattering me, Adelina.

28
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,868
But thank you.

29
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,244
We really are siblings.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,759
How is the señora?

31
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,802
She is conscious now.

32
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,390
We are just waiting for the test results.

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,517
That's good.

34
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,315
All right, we'll go ahead.
Señora might see us if we stay.

35
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,609
Wait.

36
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,698
I want to thank you both.

37
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,162
Especially you, Eduardo.

38
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,459
There are not many people like you.

39
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,088
I know my mother treated you horribly,

40
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,174
but, despite everything,

41
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,721
her false accusations,
you still helped her.

42
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,974
You're welcome, Teresita.

43
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,644
What matters is that, you believe

44
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,230
I had nothing to do
with what happened to your mother.

45
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,523
I believe you.

46
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,319
Forgive me if I doubted you.

47
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,822
You have nothing to apologize for.

48
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,659
Let's go, Adelina.

49
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,621
Adelina.

50
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,547
Are we all right now?

51
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,719
Are you no longer angry with me?

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,726
I know the conditions my mother gave you.

53
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,939
Yolanda told me everything.

54
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,032
I don't want you two to avoid me.

55
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,786
Especially you.

56
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,877
You know I would never do that, Teresita.

57
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,944
All right.

58
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,987
You should go now.

59
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,335
I'm glad the señora survived that fall.

60
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,798
It would be a tragedy
if Teresita became an orphan.

61
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,220
I wish the señora would just pass away,
so no one would belittle us anymore.

62
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,013
Just kidding.

63
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,891
But, Eduardo, tell me the truth.

64
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,477
Do you like my sister?

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,563
Is that why you still
helped her evil mother?

66
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,775
Was it for Teresita's sake?

67
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,779
Why are you quiet all of a sudden?

68
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,447
I knew it!

69
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,325
That's the secret
you can't tell me, isn't it?

70
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,953
No wonder you always followed us around.

71
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,413
All this time, I thought
you just wanted to protect me.

72
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,958
If you tell Teresita,
you'll be in big trouble.

73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,419
So it's true?

74
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,421
You like my sister Teresita?

75
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,552
Don't you ever tell her, okay?

76
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,847
Or we're going to have a problem.

77
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,516
Okay, Eduardo. I won't tell Teresita.

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,520
Unless you tell her first.

79
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,398
-I don't want it to come from me.
-That's right.

80
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,236
But what now?

81
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,782
Isn't the señora planning to marry off
Teresita to another man?

82
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,077
Who is she marrying her off to?

83
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,996
Do you know?

84
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,832
No.

85
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,586
The señora didn't mention anyone.

86
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,255
Even Teresita doesn't know
who she's going to marry.

87
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,592
Why were we born poor?

88
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,469
Why, right?

89
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,932
Let it go, Eduardo.

90
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,019
I'm sure you're more handsome

91
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,606
than the rascal
the señora wants for Teresita.

92
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,193
This is why I love you, Adelina.

93
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,819
-Eduardo, my hair!
-Really? "Rascal"?

94
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,029
Forgive me.

95
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,072
-Buy me hopia.
-Hopia?

96
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,033
-We have no money.
-I know which store…

97
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,495
My goodness!

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,734
Forgive us, sir!

99
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,705
Adelina.

100
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
What's wrong with you?

101
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,833
Nothing.

102
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,713
I was just thinking about
the man in the car.

103
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,175
What do you think, Eduardo?

104
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,718
Is he Chinese or Japanese?

105
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,804
How would I know? Why should we care?

106
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,056
Nothing.

107
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,102
I just thought he was handsome.

108
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,645
What?

109
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,982
-"Handsome"?
-The passenger. Did you see him?

110
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,109
Wasn't he handsome? And he looks rich too.

111
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,653
What are you…
Adelina, were you ogling him?

112
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,282
I just said he looked handsome.
I wasn't ogling!

113
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,828
You better behave. No man will
respect you if you're like that.

114
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,539
Me? "Like that"?

115
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,458
Is that what you think of me?

116
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,419
You're the one who likes…

117
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,046
Your mouth, okay?

118
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
-Your mouth.
-Am I right or wrong?

119
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,767
Are you surprised I got out?

120
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,938
-Come here, let's talk.
-Eduardo, leave him alone.

121
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
There you go again.

122
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,569
-Liar!
-Enough!

123
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Come on, let's go home.

124
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,288
Hiroshi!

125
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,791
Hiroshi!

126
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,044
Look at you, you've grown so much.

127
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:14,090
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you, Mother.

128
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,556
Father.

129
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,727
Welcome home, my son.

130
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,815
Come inside.

131
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,375
Good evening, señora.

132
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,376
Francisco.

133
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,795
I brought food and clothes.

134
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,756
Please put them there.

135
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,301
Forgive me for visiting this late.

136
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,388
I just found out what happened to you.

137
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,809
What did you say?

138
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:15,359
If you didn't bring me here
to the hospital, then who did?

139
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,072
Ma…

140
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,411
Eduardo brought you here.

141
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,792
He and Adelina helped me
get you to the hospital.

142
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,588
Damn it.

143
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,674
Ma…

144
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,846
Instead of getting angry at them,
let's just be thankful.

145
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,390
If it weren't for them,

146
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,143
you wouldn't have made it here on time.

147
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,482
Stop being angry at them.

148
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,863
I also hope you withdraw
your case against Eduardo

149
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,284
since I know you and Francisco

150
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,412
are making up stories against them.

151
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,459
Please, Ma.

152
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,506
I hope you don't bother
Adelina and Eduardo anymore.

153
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,092
I promise, Mama. I will never leave you.

154
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,515
Dear, I'd rather not talk about them.

155
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,475
You should just go to the doctor.

156
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,896
Ask if my test results are ready.

157
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,482
Okay, Mama.

158
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,787
I saw the siblings earlier.

159
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,751
I was surprised the constabulary
released Eduardo so soon.

160
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,463
I'm sure Adelina told Teresita about it,

161
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,507
which made us argue in the first place.

162
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
What do you think she said, señora?

163
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,638
My goodness, Francisco. Don't ask.

164
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,557
You're giving me a headache.

165
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,562
Come here.

166
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,814
I have something for you to do.

167
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,024
So that…

168
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,737
I can get even for what happened to me.

169
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,407
What's that, señora?

170
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,628
It's been so long since I came here.

171
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,798
I've really missed your cooking, Mother.

172
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,510
That's why you should eat a lot.

173
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,762
Okay.

174
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,598
Father.

175
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,435
How are my Filipino childhood friends?

176
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,812
Do you still see them?

177
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:02,526
Teresita, Eduardo, and Adelina?

178
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,866
Did you think…

179
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:16,999
I brought you here just to reunite you
with your childhood friends?

180
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,754
Forgive me, Father.

181
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:29,637
Honey, our son has just returned
and you're already scolding him.

182
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,222
Hiroshi, don't mind your father.

183
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,682
Go ahead and eat.

184
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,610
Señor Tanaka, your awaited guest is here.

185
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,534
Mr. Arata, Mr. Watanabe, good evening!

186
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,873
I want to introduce you
to my son, Hiroshi,

187
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,209
who has just arrived from our homeland.

188
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,966
Welcome back to this country, Hiroshi.

189
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,177
Forgive me, but do we know each other?

190
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:16,016
I'm Akio, your playmate
from when we were kids.

191
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,771
Do you still remember me?

192
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,444
Hey, Akio! Why did you hurt her?

193
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,531
A mere girl shouldn't have beaten us.

194
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,327
I can never forget you.

195
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,707
Let's go there.

196
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,888
Mother, who is Father talking to?

197
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,768
I don't know them.
It's my first time seeing them too.

198
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,605
Please sit down. Let's eat.

199
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,922
Does your family know who you really are?

200
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,632
Mr. Arata.

201
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,218
No, they do not.

202
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,181
Colonel Arata.

203
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,100
That's what you should call

204
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,771
a high-ranking officer
of the Japanese Imperial Army

205
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,981
established in this country.

206
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,193
Especially when it's just us talking.

207
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,491
Forgive me, Colonel Arata.

208
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:01,830
No apologies necessary.
Is that the list, then?

209
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes.

210
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:11,381
Here is the list of names
of wealthy families here in Manila,

211
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,012
and the names of high-ranking soldiers.

212
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,568
This is a big deal for our mission.

213
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:38,992
Mr. Tanaka, get ready.
The attacks are about to happen.

214
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,577
When?

215
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:49,837
Our first attack in this country
will take place in December.

216
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,923
In December?

217
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,594
First, Pearl Harbor.

218
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,936
And then, the whole nation.

219
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,441
The defense camps of the Philippines
must be destroyed first.

220
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:21,827
So they can't do anything
once our troops enter Manila.

221
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,451
He still hasn't changed.

222
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,828
Akio is still annoying.

223
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,747
Let him be.

224
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,167
Get some rest.

225
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,757
Why did they come here, Father?

226
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,718
Who was with Akio?

227
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,263
What did they want from you?

228
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,808
And what were you talking about?

229
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,157
It's a good thing
you've saved up some money.

230
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,202
Otherwise, you'd still be in jail.

231
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,040
That was only temporary.

232
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:56,088
Until Teresita's mother withdraws
her complaint against me,

233
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,675
the constabulary
can still arrest me anytime.

234
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,634
What?

235
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,430
I'll be damned.
I thought your suffering had ended.

236
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,433
Guess I was wrong.

237
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,068
Adelina!

238
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,240
Teresita!

239
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,324
Eduardo!

240
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,246
I didn't know this is where you bathe!

241
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,998
Adelina!

242
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,166
Teresita is here!

243
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,381
Adelina!

244
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,134
Teresita!

245
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,178
I'm glad you got home safe.

246
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,888
I came alone.

247
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,933
-Mama won't be home until tomorrow.
-Until tomorrow?

248
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,019
Wait, I'll go down!

249
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,398
Teresita.

250
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,734
Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?

251
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,778
Maestro wants us back
to the theater tomorrow

252
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,448
because it'll be
our first performance on stage.

253
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,158
I know.

254
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,536
So by the time Mama comes home,
we're already out the door.

255
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:14,041
But what if she finds out we're together?

256
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,294
She'll get mad at me and Eduardo again.

257
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,051
The truth is, she told us
to leave here and stay away from you.

258
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,927
Those were her conditions.

259
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,097
She even threatened me
not to tell you about it.

260
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,390
I know that.

261
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,851
But don't listen to her.

262
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,396
Mama and I already agreed
that she won't bother you anymore.

263
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,778
And that she will drop
her complaint against you, Eduardo.

264
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,655
So you can relax now.

265
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,326
Thank God!

266
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,497
I'm glad your mother changed her mind.

267
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,000
You're welcome.

268
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,170
Well, Adelina?

269
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,130
Since Mama is not home,

270
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,257
I'll wait for you there
so we can practice.

271
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,136
We need to prepare
for our performance tomorrow.

272
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,429
That's right!

273
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,847
Okay, I'll be there.

274
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,474
All right.

275
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,935
I'll be going now.

276
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,780
I'll go with you tomorrow.

277
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,616
I want to watch your performance.

278
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,786
I'll go too. We don't have work tomorrow.

279
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,539
Fine!

280
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,291
But can you please fix yourselves first?

281
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,001
You both look like wet dogs.

282
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,130
You don't even have shirts on.
Just look at you, Tasyo.

283
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,215
You're not even ashamed of yourself!

284
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,804
You heard that, Tasyo?

285
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,850
People will finally watch
Adelina and Teresita tomorrow.

286
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,603
We can't miss it.

287
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,108
Yes, I heard.
That's why I'll be going with you.

288
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,527
Just don't be all shy tomorrow.

289
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,946
What if Teresita gets married
to someone else?

290
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,322
Can you handle that?

291
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,701
Can you bear seeing her
end up with someone else?

292
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,857
Look, Eduardo, our favorite comedians.

293
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,111
When do you think
it'll be Adelina's and Teresita's turn?

294
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,655
Don't be impatient. Just watch.

295
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,117
Ouch!

296
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,715
You are so stupid!

297
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,217
How dare you!

298
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,395
Hey, break a leg out there.
Make sure the audience won't get bored.

299
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,064
Especially with you, Adelina.

300
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,527
Because between you two,
your sister is the better singer.

301
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,114
You need to dance well
and make the audience laugh, okay?

302
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,492
That hurts.

303
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,205
Don't listen to him.

304
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,249
Daddy Johnny just talks that way.

305
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,627
Hey, Marcel is a great singer.

306
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,046
Not really.

307
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,256
This boy.

308
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,341
What are your names?

309
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,136
She is Chinita and she is Morena.

310
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,098
From now on, those are your stage names.

311
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,479
"Morena"?

312
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,401
Teresita, I don't think it's nice
to be known by those stage names.

313
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,279
Just follow along with it.

314
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,323
That way, Mama won't know
we're already performing.

315
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,204
I accept our new names, Maestro.

316
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
Just call me Daddy Johnny.

317
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,541
Listen here.

318
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:29,254
Pugo will call you
when it's your turn on stage.

319
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,216
Remember, the audience will decide

320
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,928
if I'll accept you in my company or not.

321
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,097
So do not fail me.

322
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,476
Especially since we have
an important guest

323
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,272
who wants to watch you two in particular.

324
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,818
Teresita.

325
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,987
I'm nervous.

326
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,073
Who is this special guest?

327
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,575
I don't know.

328
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,466
Hiroshi!

329
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,635
Where are Teresita and Adelina?

330
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,096
Wherever you are

331
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,766
Be it the city or the country

332
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,188
You will always bump into
The naughty clown

333
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,483
I will have him marry my Teresita.

334
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,486
My name is Juan. Remember my name, okay?

335
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,112
I won't forget you, Juan.

336
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,572
Did you buy those for Teresita?

337
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,157
For her and Adelina.

338
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,494
Don't even try to tease me.
Teresita might hear you.

339
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,663
I heard Teresita's father hasn't returned?

340
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,832
I'm no longer hoping for that, Hiroshi.

341
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,334
COMING UP

342
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:04,182
