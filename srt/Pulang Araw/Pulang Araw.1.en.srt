1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,842
In the late 19th century,

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,803
our nation's history
entered a new chapter.

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,516
Ships bearing the stars and stripes
of America's flag arrived,

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,021
and like Spain, these foreigners
also colonized the Philippines.

5
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,693
But unlike Spain,
America used the Philippines

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:31,656
to demonstrate its expansion of power
by implementing many changes here.

7
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:38,288
Many bridges and roads were built
and free trade was initiated.

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,291
America also introduced free education

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,211
and promoted teaching
the English language to Filipinos.

10
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,840
Alongside these, Hollywood films
were shown in theaters

11
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,885
as Filipinos' main form of entertainment,

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,723
and stage shows
called vaudeville became widespread.

13
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
That's my sister!

14
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,155
And I'm friends with that morena lady!

15
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,156
That one!

16
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,674
My generation embraced these changes

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,261
and the culture brought by the foreigners.

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,849
No one back then imagined
that other foreigners

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,562
would dare to seize
the Philippines from America.

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,774
No one was prepared

21
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,819
for the impending danger.

22
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,624
Over here!

23
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,387
Take cover!

24
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,970
Mario.

25
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,056
Mario.

26
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,861
Eduardo…

27
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,907
Am I going to die?

28
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,455
No, we'll still play baseball
after this war.

29
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,708
Come on, get up.

30
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,044
Let's get out of here. Get up, Mario.

31
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,258
-Get up.
-Eduardo, please…

32
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,305
If ever you survive…

33
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,520
pay a visit to Mom…

34
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,606
Mom and Dad.

35
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,578
Please tell them…

36
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:35,877
tell them that I love them so much.

37
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,171
That Mario loves them very much.

38
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,677
No. We'll get through this together, okay?

39
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,014
Just be strong, Mario.

40
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,061
We'll see our loved ones again,
just be strong.

41
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,980
Stay still.

42
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,073
Mario?

43
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,380
My dearest Adelina,

44
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,633
my most beloved sister.

45
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,643
-Halt.
-I pray that you are always safe and well

46
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,481
-especially once you receive…
-You there, stop.

47
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,066
…with the help
of the young yet courageous Juan,

48
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,361
this letter from your humble sibling.

49
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,199
-Clear. Go home, boy.
-A letter filled with hardship,

50
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,909
suffering, and pain.

51
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,747
But with this letter comes my warm embrace

52
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,416
and gratitude to the Almighty God

53
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,128
that somehow He still allows us a chance,

54
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,381
despite these harsh times,

55
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,593
to keep in touch.

56
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,022
Juan?

57
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,941
What are you doing here?

58
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,777
I came here
on behalf of your brother, Adelina.

59
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,239
He asked me to give you this.

60
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,951
Juan, thank you very much.

61
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:01,123
You're welcome, but I won't stay long.

62
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,291
Goodbye.

63
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,294
Wait, what about my reply?

64
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,420
Juan, wait!

65
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,607
"Oh, Adelina.

66
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,569
Forgive me, my sister,

67
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,531
-for this letter is filled with grief
-…for this letter is filled with grief

68
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,991
-and regret."
-and regret.

69
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
Almost every day,

70
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,582
I've witnessed heartbreaking battles
in every mountain,

71
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,377
forest, and village I go to.

72
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,550
Truly, this brutal war spares no life.

73
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,012
It has carelessly caused

74
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:01,100
the tragic and painful deaths
of my great comrades

75
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,853
as they fought in this foolish war.

76
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,067
The only thing
that strengthens my resolve now

77
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,821
is the hope that one day,
this war will end

78
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,199
and I will soon return
to be with my only sibling.

79
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,300
Adelina.

80
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,802
You and Teresita…

81
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,851
The two of you,
along with our memories of youth,

82
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,773
are my only source of strength

83
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,984
to continue fighting.

84
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,665
I hope I overcome all of this,

85
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,503
so I can return alive for you two.

86
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,808
May you always pray for my safety,
youngest one.

87
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,688
Just as I've always prayed for yours.

88
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,568
With love, your brother Eduardo.

89
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:25,494
I can still remember the memories
of my youth with my brother.

90
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,332
Ten years
before the Japanese invaders arrived,

91
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,336
Eduardo and I
were truly happy in our world.

92
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,096
Hey, over here! Come in, buy some!

93
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,265
TEN YEARS BEFORE WORLD WAR II

94
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,899
Come in!

95
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,362
-Ouch.
-Buy here! It's cheap!

96
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,114
Buy here!

97
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,369
Run, Adelina! The ghost is coming!

98
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,704
Eduardo!

99
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
Hey! That kid.

100
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,302
I beat you again.

101
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,846
You owe me ten flicks, lice girl.

102
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,891
Stop teasing me! It's getting annoying!

103
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,894
Why did you push me?

104
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,903
This is why I don't like having a sister.

105
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't know why Mom had a girl.

106
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,199
Girls are weak and crybabies.

107
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,871
Eduardo! Adelina!

108
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,667
Get inside, right now!

109
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,429
You only have each other as siblings.

110
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,683
Is that how I raised you?

111
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,935
To hurt each other?

112
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,229
-No, Mom.
-No, Mom.

113
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,606
Eduardo and I won't do it again.

114
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,616
Okay.

115
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,285
That's enough. Stand up.

116
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,798
All right, I'm not mad anymore.

117
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,844
Just don't fight again, okay?

118
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,596
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mom.

119
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,727
Okay. Go wash up and eat.

120
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,712
Say your prayers first.

121
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,467
Let's thank the Lord for the grace
He has bestowed upon us.

122
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:32,431
Not everyone gets to eat like us
in these hard times.

123
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,840
Our mother was the most beautiful woman
my brother and I had ever seen.

124
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,303
We often compared her
to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

125
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:37,955
But unlike the Blessed Virgin Mary,
our mother is not a saint.

126
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,666
Especially since Eduardo and I
became her children

127
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,418
even though she wasn't married.

128
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,045
We also have different fathers.

129
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,943
Though it's embarrassing,
I had to do this.

130
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,136
It's still your obligation
to help me with him.

131
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
Help me save Eduardo.

132
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
This is not enough.

133
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,822
This is not enough, please.

134
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,663
I don't want to ask Julio
because Eduardo is your son.

135
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,094
I swear to you,

136
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,473
we will never bother you again

137
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,434
for as long as I live.

138
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,729
Go to hell.

139
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,357
Let's go, children.

140
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,533
Why doesn't he see me as his son, Mom?

141
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,993
Don't we look alike?

142
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,460
Yes, you resemble him.

143
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,255
But he's a worthless, neglectful father.

144
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,632
Don't you ever be like him.

145
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,761
Enough crying now, let's go.

146
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:06,353
Since then, Mom never asked for help
from my brother's father.

147
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,160
My dad, Julio, came into Mom's life
after she gave birth to my brother.

148
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,041
Mom, Dad is here!

149
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,837
My daughter.

150
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,182
I got you chocolates.

151
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,559
Share them with Eduardo.

152
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,978
Okay.

153
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,605
-Thank you, Dad.
-Thank you, Uncle.

154
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,064
You're welcome.

155
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,693
Let's share.

156
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,987
And these…

157
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,741
roses…

158
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,579
for the only…

159
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,832
Filipina of my life.

160
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,630
Thank you.

161
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,592
Shall we go inside?

162
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,812
But my father did not live with us
in our house.

163
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,069
His visits are only brief,
and he always leaves right away.

164
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,616
It's Mom.

165
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,999
Well, then.

166
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,377
Take care, okay?

167
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,548
And you, my princess.

168
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,511
And you too, Eduardo.

169
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,350
Behave yourselves,
and treat your mother with respect.

170
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,227
-Yes, Dad.
-Yes, Uncle.

171
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,857
I'll be going now.

172
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,231
Mom, why isn't Dad always with us?

173
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,158
Didn't I tell you

174
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,120
that your father's work
is in a far-off province?

175
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,250
But why, Mom? What does Uncle do?

176
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,131
Quit asking so many questions.
Let's go inside now.

177
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,508
And clean after yourself.

178
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,265
I believed Mom's words back then.

179
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,194
But, eventually,
Eduardo and I discovered the truth.

180
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,197
They're here!

181
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,867
The mistress' children are here.

182
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,868
-Mistress.
-Mistress!

183
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,411
Hey!

184
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,456
Eduardo! Bastard!

185
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,959
Adelina! A mistress' daughter!

186
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,921
Eduardo! Bastard!

187
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,091
Adelina! A mistress' daughter!

188
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,051
Can you stop teasing us?

189
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,011
Our mother is not a mistress!

190
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,139
She is, my mother told me.

191
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,436
She's having an affair with a married man!

192
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:21,233
-Mistress! She's a mistress!
-Mistress! She's a mistress!

193
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,944
-Mistress!
-You rascals!

194
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,570
Hey!

195
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,531
-Eduardo!
-Dado!

196
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,907
Dado!

197
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,467
Children, wash your…

198
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,096
My God.

199
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,307
What happened to you two?

200
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,893
Why do you look like that?

201
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,857
Don't lie to me.

202
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,026
Why do you look like that?

203
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,611
Filipina!

204
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,781
Bring out your unruly children!

205
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,200
Fina!

206
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,164
What's the problem, Mimay?

207
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,207
It's your children, Fina!

208
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,710
They beat up our kids!

209
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,379
Come out and face us!

210
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,715
Wait there.

211
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,386
Mom, they were mocking us.

212
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,263
That's why Eduardo and I fought back.

213
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,390
They called me a bastard.

214
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,729
-And Adelina…
-They said I'm a child of a mistress.

215
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,940
Is it true, Mom?

216
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,943
Are you really a mistress?

217
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,865
Fina!

218
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,659
Filipina, come out here!

219
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,412
Come out, you mistress!

220
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,663
Fina!

221
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,001
Mom, are they telling the truth?

222
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,504
Are you really a mistress?

223
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,010
-Mom…
-Mom.

224
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,970
Why did you take out the dagger?

225
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
Mom!

226
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,812
Good Lord. Are you going to kill us?

227
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:28,693
The next time your unruly kids
tease my children,

228
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,949
I won't hesitate to chop your mouths off!

229
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:38,036
Not when you're teaching
your children to be evil!

230
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,454
Hey!

231
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,207
Don't you scare us!

232
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,001
We'll report you to the authorities!

233
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,045
Then do it!

234
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:52,008
Go on, call the police

235
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,220
because I'll slash all of you!

236
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,389
I'll slash you all!

237
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,937
Come back here!

238
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,730
-Mom!
-Mom!

239
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,321
Did you two pray?

240
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,739
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mom.

241
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,410
Good.

242
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,708
Even though I am like this,

243
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,422
a lowly woman, who is worthless,

244
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,550
mocked, and ridiculed by others

245
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,511
because of my wrong decisions in life…

246
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,517
may you two never forget to pray.

247
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,398
And strive hard in your studies,

248
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,569
so your fate won't be like mine.

249
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,532
It's all my fault, Mom.

250
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,785
I hurt them first.

251
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,042
I promise I won't pick fights anymore,

252
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,502
no matter how much they tease us.

253
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,133
No, Eduardo.

254
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,182
You did the right thing
by defending yourself and your sibling.

255
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,187
Always remember this, okay?

256
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,647
I don't want you

257
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,651
to be oppressed by others.

258
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,782
Stand up for each other,

259
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,451
especially when you're in the right.

260
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,621
Do you understand?

261
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,081
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mom.

262
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,049
My brave, brave children.

263
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,552
Come closer.

264
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,101
-Mom!
-Mom…

265
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,486
Little did we know,
that would be the last moment

266
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,531
we'd be happy with Mom.

267
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,910
Mother fell ill with tuberculosis,

268
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:29,082
a disease that, in 1931,
didn't have an effective cure.

269
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,590
-Hello, Mom.
-No, stay away.

270
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,551
Stay away from me.

271
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,429
You might get infected.

272
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,391
-Mom.
-Mom?

273
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,818
Just fetch your Auntie Amalia.

274
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,363
Tell her…

275
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,200
I am already coughing up blood.

276
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,749
She already knows what to do.

277
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,087
Go, now.

278
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,230
-Mom…
-Mom?

279
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,657
I'll cover all of Filipina's expenses.

280
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,914
Just make sure she will recover.

281
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,087
If there is any problem,
don't hesitate to tell me right away.

282
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,517
My love.

283
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,645
Please get well soon.

284
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,860
Don't come near me.

285
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,447
You might get infected.

286
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,578
Amalia?

287
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,587
Please take care of my children.

288
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,423
Yes, cousin.

289
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,260
I will take care of your children.

290
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,053
Get well soon, okay?

291
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,814
I'll be there in the ambulance.

292
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,248
Eduardo.

293
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,168
Always take care of your sister.

294
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,633
Always be patient with her.

295
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,054
And no matter what happens,

296
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,266
never abandon her.

297
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,019
Yes, Mom.

298
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,857
Adelina.

299
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,322
Always listen to your brother Eduardo.

300
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,869
Be more understanding towards him,

301
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,123
especially with his teasing and jokes.

302
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,674
Promise me that whatever happens,

303
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,721
you will never be apart.

304
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,266
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mom.

305
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,648
Time to go, ma'am.

306
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,818
-Mom.
-Mom.

307
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,196
Let me come with you.

308
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,823
Me too, Mom. Let us take care of you.

309
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,825
-Mom.
-That's enough.

310
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,744
You cannot go with me!

311
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,288
And don't embrace me!

312
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,209
You might get sick too.

313
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,423
When I come back…

314
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,927
once I am well…

315
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:58,351
I will be the first one to embrace you.

316
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,522
I promise.

317
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,204
Mom…

318
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,210
-Mom.
-Mom…

319
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,606
But Mom never got to fulfill
her promise to me and Eduardo.

320
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,874
You said you'd come back.

321
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,753
Mom, you said…

322
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,425
you'd embrace us when you come back.

323
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,931
Mom…

324
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,936
Why didn't you come home, Mom?

325
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,110
We love you so much, Mom.

326
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:05,186
When Mother died, people suddenly
treated me and my brother well.

327
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,896
Our condolences.

328
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,404
Thank you, Tasyo.

329
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,907
Enough with the bad news.

330
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,118
What do you think, love?

331
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,664
Will the Japanese occupation reach us?

332
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,334
-Hello, Auntie.
-Hello, Uncle.

333
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,839
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello, Auntie.

334
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,801
Will America even let
the Japanese steal this country?

335
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,970
Have some snacks, kids.

336
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,598
No need, we must leave
so we can go home early.

337
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,267
Adelina, help me with your things.

338
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,854
Where are you taking those, Auntie?

339
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,565
We are taking Adelina to her father,

340
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,235
who didn't even go
to your mother's funeral.

341
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,322
Why, Auntie?

342
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,909
Does Dad want to see me?

343
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,412
But why are we bringing my things?

344
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,539
Oh, of course!

345
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,833
It's because you will live
with Julio from now on.

346
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,004
Lauro and I can't take care of you both.

347
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,759
Your father should
take responsibility for you.

348
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,262
-But what about Eduardo?
-Auntie.

349
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,848
Don't give Adelina away.

350
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,935
I'll stop studying.

351
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,813
I'll work so I can help you and Uncle
with the expenses.

352
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,066
Enough.

353
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,068
Your sister will have a better life there.

354
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,820
I don't need that, Uncle.

355
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,282
I'm begging you, Auntie.

356
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:29,413
I won't eat much
so I won't be a burden to you.

357
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:36,754
I will also do all the household chores,
so you won't have a hard time.

358
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,966
I will be good.

359
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,635
We will be good from now on, Auntie.

360
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:46,264
-Please, don't keep us apart.
-Shut your mouth, Eduardo!

361
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:51,227
Do you want me to hand you over
to your father who has no love for you?

362
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,437
Is that what you want?

363
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,108
Don't ever mention that person again.

364
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:02,029
Besides, why are you kicking Adelina
out of our mother's house

365
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,449
when this place isn't even yours?

366
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,660
Eduardo.

367
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,166
If you disrespect me one more time,

368
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,461
I will beat the hell out of you.

369
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,511
Do you understand?

370
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,561
My friend is here. Let's go, love.

371
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,396
Eduardo.

372
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,817
-Let's go.
-Auntie!

373
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,362
-Auntie, I don't want to leave!
-Stop it! Lauro!

374
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,031
-Let's go!
-Uncle! Auntie!

375
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,532
You stay here!

376
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,618
-Go.
-Eduardo…

377
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,412
Uncle!

378
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,831
Eduardo!

379
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,792
Adelina!

380
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,384
Eduardo!

381
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,345
Adelina!

382
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,388
-Eduardo!
-Adelina!

383
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,976
Get back in the house!

384
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,186
Adelina.

385
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,522
What I told you before isn't true.

386
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,318
I never wanted to have a brother,

387
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,112
you have always been enough for me.

388
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,741
Eduardo.

389
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,332
Stubborn brat.

390
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,251
-Go home! That's enough!
-Adelina!

391
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,962
-Adelina!
-I said, enough.

392
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,882
-Auntie!
-Enough!

393
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,802
-Go home.
-Adelina!

394
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,137
-Eduardo!
-Adelina!

395
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,097
Go home.

396
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,849
Let's go.

397
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,017
Eduardo!

398
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,060
Adelina!

399
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,938
-Eduardo!
-Adelina!

400
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,314
-Adelina!
-Eduardo!

401
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:35,307
On that day, Eduardo
fulfilled his promise to our mother.

402
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,228
I knew he would never let us part.

403
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
My brother would fight for me.

404
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,917
But what could Eduardo do at that time,

405
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,590
when it seemed like I was fated
to be separated from my only sibling?

406
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,870
Ten years before World War II began,

407
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,083
a war erupted in both of our lives.

408
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,973
COMING UP

409
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,519
What are you doing here?
Are you my husband's mistress?

410
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,146
-They are just my friends.
-Your friends?

411
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,481
Lies!

412
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,484
Did any of my companions survive?

413
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,153
I'm sorry.
You're the only one who survived.

414
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,739
Back then, I felt like I had no sibling.

415
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:18,160
Or even friends who could shield me
from the danger I was about to face.

416
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,329
And that's when I saw him again.

417
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,415
My defender.

418
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,375
From now on,

419
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,460
you will call her Mama Carmela.

420
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,421
The devil's whisper might be heard.

421
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,174
But I fear no evil.

422
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,052
I'm not afraid of any demon.

423
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,346
That's enough, Mother!

424
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,311
