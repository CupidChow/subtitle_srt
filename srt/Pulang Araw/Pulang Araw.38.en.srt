1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,878
They said the Japanese are abducting women

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,880
and raping then killing them,

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,633
because women were never seen
coming home to their families.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,176
You won't get away from them!

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,553
What kind of place is this?

6
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,139
There's nothing more you can do,
just pray.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:19,853
It may be best if we start discussing
when our children will be married.

8
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,897
My father is withdrawing
from the agreement.

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,024
Why are you backing out?

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,986
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:35,577
I met your fiancée earlier at the theater.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,289
Maybe I can convince Teresita's parents

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,833
not to force you two to marry.

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,419
He's a much better
replacement for Hiroshi.

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,380
Are you really so eager
to marry me off to just any man?

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,883
He's a colonel, a high-ranking officer!

17
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,301
Unlike Eduardo.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,931
I'm scared of what's happening now
and for what will happen next.

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,392
I will fight for you every day.

20
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,436
Even from your colonel,

21
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,437
Colonel Yuta?

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,398
Just don't kill me, sir! Master!

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,652
Have mercy! Sir! Master!

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,196
Goodness!

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,574
I was being chased by a monster.

26
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,328
And it wants to kill me,
Adelina, and Teresita.

27
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,351
What happened?

28
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,355
Did you wet your pants?

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,735
I'm still alive, sir, master!

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,071
Thank you, sir, master! I'm still alive!

31
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,865
Thank you so much.

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,578
You can still be of use to me.

33
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,873
Come with me.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,919
You don't need to fear him, Adelina.

35
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,255
He's a good man.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,310
No matter what you tell me about him,
I won't like him.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,188
I don't trust people like him.

38
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:16,195
So it will not please me if you let him
get close to us, especially my sister.

39
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,825
What do you want me to do, Adelina?

40
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,496
Defy someone who is above me?

41
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:32,629
That's why I don't believe you can defend
and protect us at all times.

42
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,926
Because, Hiroshi, the truth is…

43
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,390
just like us, you're powerless too.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,392
Perhaps I can drop by
our house later today.

45
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,560
I'd like to see
how my wife and daughter are doing.

46
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:39,195
Earn my trust first
before I grant you a favor.

47
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,614
Yes, sir, master.

48
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,244
Colonel, Mr. Hiroshi is here.

49
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
Hide. Quickly!

50
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,845
Colonel.

51
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,935
Tanaka, I have good news for you.

52
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,649
Justice has been served
for your mother's death.

53
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,946
The culprit has been sentenced to death.

54
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,580
But…

55
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,668
why do you not seem pleased
with the justice you have received?

56
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,631
I thought this was what you wanted.

57
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,762
Thank you very much, Colonel.

58
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,224
You are welcome.

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,522
I will visit your home later
to speak with your father

60
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,025
and Teresita's mother regarding--

61
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,319
That will not be necessary, Colonel.

62
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,657
Since they have withdrawn
from the agreement.

63
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,746
One good news after another!

64
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,874
Let's drink to that!

65
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,364
Because of what happened…

66
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,327
Teresita is now free
from the agreement made by our parents.

67
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,164
And I am pleased with that, Colonel,

68
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,960
because my childhood friends
are important to me.

69
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:07,218
I desire nothing
but for them to always be happy and safe.

70
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,638
I understand.

71
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,057
Cheers!

72
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,361
Why?

73
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,614
Do you think it's poisoned?

74
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,879
If Eduardo and Teresita are happy,

75
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,425
I'm certain Adelina will be happy as well.

76
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,385
Adelina?

77
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,978
She's the one I love, Colonel.

78
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,241
My wish is that no one else
will stand in the way of their happiness.

79
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,081
I will take my leave now, Colonel.

80
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,282
Colonel.

81
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,525
I know the person mentioned by your guest.

82
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,403
You know Teresita?

83
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,613
Yes, sir.

84
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,741
Especially Eduardo.

85
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,578
I know that traitor very well.

86
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,379
I'm glad I kept you alive.

87
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,634
You're definitely useful to me.

88
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,865
What are you doing here?

89
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,287
Are you still furious with me?

90
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,390
My apologies for how I acted last time.

91
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,146
I took out my anger
towards the Japanese on you. I'm sorry.

92
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,205
The power is back.

93
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,374
Why don't you come up for a while?

94
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,836
Maybe not, Eduardo.
I might not make it to curfew.

95
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,965
Come on. Who are you fooling?

96
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,969
As if people like you, the Japanese,
are affected by the curfew.

97
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,434
Eduardo.

98
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,230
Don't let Teresita go.

99
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,983
If I were you, I'd elope with her.

100
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,986
Get as far away from the city as you can.

101
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,739
There you go again
with your warnings, Hiroshi.

102
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,868
Why? Do you have new information
from your countrymen?

103
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,833
It looks like you do.

104
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
What is it this time, Hiroshi?

105
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,633
There's a colonel
who wants to take Teresita.

106
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,261
And he has everything, Eduardo.

107
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,141
Money, power, things you don't have yet.

108
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,937
Who is this colonel?

109
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,649
Just take my advice, Eduardo.

110
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,944
It's for you and Teresita's own good.

111
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,115
Who is this colonel, Hiroshi? Tell me.

112
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,034
Why don't you ask Teresita?

113
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,413
I'm sure she knows
who I'm talking about, Eduardo.

114
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,709
What's that?

115
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,631
Here is the information you requested
about Eduardo Dela Cruz.

116
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:29,642
Did I not tell you
that this is just between the two of us?

117
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,938
Please don't be angry, Colonel Saitoh.

118
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,775
Especially since the information
you needed came from me.

119
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,238
Good evening, sirs.

120
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,574
What are you doing here?

121
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,911
Get out, we're talking about
an important matter.

122
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,287
Let him be.

123
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,707
Watanabe!

124
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,127
He works for me.

125
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,298
Lauro.

126
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,145
I'm already aware of this.

127
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
Thanks to this Filipino…

128
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,701
I now know Eduardo Dela Cruz
like the back of my hand.

129
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,124
But, Colonel, Eduardo is on our list.

130
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,377
What?

131
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,839
Eduardo's father
is an American military officer,

132
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,633
so Eduardo
is a potential threat to us too.

133
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,927
Where is that report?

134
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,765
It's on the second page, Colonel.

135
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,527
And where is his father?

136
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,116
This Major Tyler Campbell?

137
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,872
He's probably an American coward

138
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,002
who fled to Bataan or Corregidor.

139
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,632
He's not there, Colonel.
He's not among those who fled.

140
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,643
Our troops captured that person
a month ago.

141
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:37,978
Hurry!

142
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,941
Hurry! What are you doing?

143
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,158
Major Campbell escaped
with the help of some armed Filipinos

144
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,619
who killed some of our men.

145
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,413
So I know that Eduardo's father
is still here.

146
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,249
Especially since our troops
are there to pursue

147
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,629
and capture the fleeing Americans,
so he cannot get in there.

148
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,301
But don't you have any information
about Eduardo's father?

149
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,805
No, we don't.

150
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,267
Watch Eduardo Dela Cruz closely

151
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,650
because he himself
might be hiding his own father.

152
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,903
Monitor his movements.

153
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,613
Yes, Colonel.

154
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,305
Why has the colonel
suddenly taken an interest in Dela Cruz?

155
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:01,770
The colonel is not really interested
in Eduardo Dela Cruz,

156
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,860
but in his girlfriend, Teresita Borromeo.

157
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,529
Teresita Borromeo?

158
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,407
The vaudeville actress?

159
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,451
Yes.

160
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:22,541
Our colonel's heart and loins

161
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,255
were immediately set aflame
by Teresita Borromeo.

162
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,467
Is that so?

163
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,696
Adelina, what are you doing?

164
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,326
I'm just happy
that the lights are on again.

165
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,330
Maybe the Japanese
hurriedly fixed the electricity,

166
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,541
probably to show off to us Filipinos.

167
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,381
Teresita, you have a guest.

168
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,425
Who is it?

169
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,434
We will watch your show again later

170
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,439
because I want to hear
your sweet voice once more.

171
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,614
Mr. Luis, can you please give us a moment?

172
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,287
We'll take care of this.

173
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,098
My apologies, Colonel,

174
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,019
but I am not leaving.
I will not leave Teresita here.

175
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
Why?

176
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,692
Am I asking you to leave?

177
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,533
Colonel…

178
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,790
we are very glad
to have a new friend like you.

179
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:57,839
But… I want to be honest with you.

180
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,264
Forgive me…

181
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,643
but since I already have a fiancé…

182
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,231
I feel extremely uncomfortable

183
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,944
receiving this kind of treatment from you.

184
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,992
I'm begging you, I hope

185
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,538
this is the last time you visit me here

186
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,000
and bring me flowers.

187
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,779
Good day, Sir Luis.

188
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,243
Isn't Juan, the little boy
who's always here, selling flowers today?

189
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,745
Instead of worrying about that,

190
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,665
go to Adelina and Teresita
in their dressing room right away.

191
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,419
They have a visitor, a Japanese colonel.

192
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,171
A colonel, sir?

193
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,967
Yes. And I think he's courting Teresita.

194
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,969
He even gave her flowers.

195
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,890
There's a colonel
who wants to take Teresita.

196
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:42,736
I hope you won't
take my request against me.

197
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:10,263
I admire your utmost honesty, miss.

198
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:19,106
Your fiancé is very lucky
because you'll also be honest with him.

199
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,692
Thank you, Colonel.

200
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,903
Adelina.

201
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,281
You can go inside later.

202
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,326
Where is that colonel?

203
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,123
And I admit, Teresita…

204
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:44,422
I am hurt by the words you uttered.

205
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,595
Forgive me, Colonel, but--

206
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,393
But I am a soldier
who never surrenders in any fight.

207
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,271
I apologize,

208
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,402
but I cannot accommodate your request
to stay away from you.

209
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,956
Eduardo!

210
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,124
One!

211
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,918
Don't do anything
that will get you in trouble.

212
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,547
What's your plan?

213
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,382
Are you going to fight a colonel?

214
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,717
Are you insane?

215
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,349
Thank you so much, Colonel, but--

216
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,934
I implore you

217
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:45,192
to give me a chance
to prove myself to you.

218
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,527
Colonel.

219
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,697
I really can't do that.

220
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,954
Especially since I don't want
my fiancé to doubt me.

221
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,710
I don't want to destroy Eduardo's honor.

222
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,804
I hope you understand
where I'm coming from.

223
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:16,973
My apologies.

224
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,726
I understand.

225
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,397
And I bid you farewell.

226
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,859
Let's go. Let's leave, come on.

227
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,182
Are you leaving?

228
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,476
I will visit the imprisoned man
who killed your mother.

229
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,645
They have been punished, Father.

230
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,230
They're all dead now.

231
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,483
I still can't believe
Teresita is going to elope with you.

232
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,028
My only problem now
is where to take Teresita later.

233
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,781
Why are you locking yourselves up
in your room?

234
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,241
What are you two doing?

235
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,369
Colonel, please forget about the person
I mentioned to you, Eduardo Dela Cruz.

236
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,954
With all due respect, Colonel,

237
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,664
why don't you put Eduardo in jail,

238
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,874
so no one can come
between you and Teresita?

239
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,334
Don't be impatient.

240
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,877
It's going to happen soon.

241
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,671
COMING UP

242
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,432
