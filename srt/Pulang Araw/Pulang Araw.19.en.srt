1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
I will work hard and save up.

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,880
I'll prove your mother wrong.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,674
You're so stupid.

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,676
You should study again, Eduardo.

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,594
-Will you wait for me?
-I'll wait for you.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,138
Hiroshi.

7
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,766
Your father, and your mother, Teresita,

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,560
want you to marry each other.

9
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,602
What?

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,730
I will not marry Hiroshi.

11
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,482
Mr. Tanaka is willing to return to us

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,193
the land where
your burned-down theater is.

13
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,821
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm agreeing to it.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,661
I will marry Hiroshi.

16
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,581
Think carefully
about your decision, Teresita.

17
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,126
And don't hurt other people.

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,045
This is for my future with Teresita.

19
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,092
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,638
I cannot wait to invade
this American-allied country.

21
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,728
When should we set the wedding?

22
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,146
My apologies, Mrs. Borromeo.

23
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,399
But we shouldn't rush things.

24
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,362
Father.

25
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,489
I am deeply shocked by all of this.

26
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,366
We should talk about this first.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,702
Let's discuss this at home.

28
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,622
For now, do not say anything.

29
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,915
It seems like…

30
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,543
you two are arguing.

31
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,254
Are you backing out?

32
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,093
-They are just talking.
-My apologies.

33
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,731
August?

34
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,197
August is not a good month
here in the Philippines.

35
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,491
It's the rainy season.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,910
A storm might come by then.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,413
We wouldn't want

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,583
Hiroshi and Teresita's marriage
to be a catastrophe.

39
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,336
And besides,

40
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,673
we don't want to rush the preparations.

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,552
Why don't we have it in December?

42
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,846
The 16th of December.

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,057
The first night mass for Christmas.

44
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,189
Do not forget

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,400
these important dates.

46
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,738
On December 7, 1941,
our country will attack Pearl Harbor.

47
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,658
And on December 8,
the Philippines will be our next target.

48
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,593
Please agree, Mr. Tanaka.

49
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,554
I will not allow them to get married

50
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,558
during those ill-fated
and calamitous months.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,355
All right.

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,608
I won't object anymore.

53
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,818
Thank you so much, Mr. Tanaka.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,406
Now, let us discuss the wedding expenses.

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,577
It's best if we clarify
our share for this wedding, right?

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,127
No worries.

57
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,130
Thank you very much to all of you.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,925
You don't have to worry about anything.

59
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,685
Mr. Borromeo.

60
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,729
Teresita.

61
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,081
Now that you have a fiancé, Teresita,

62
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,251
you must sever whatever
connection you have

63
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,254
to that man
Adelina keeps mentioning earlier.

64
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,259
Do not bring shame
to our family and the Tanakas!

65
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,347
Teresita.

66
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,684
If you're in love with someone else,

67
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,313
you should not sacrifice yourself.

68
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,318
Do you truly not care
about what other people will say?

69
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,697
We cannot allow other people to think
we went back on our word!

70
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,035
Teresita, who is that man?

71
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,244
Tell us the truth.

72
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,415
I do not have a boyfriend, Mama.

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,626
And do not worry.

74
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,880
I will not back out from this marriage.

75
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,843
That's good, then.

76
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,346
Let's go, it's quite hot out here. Come.

77
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,169
Did I pass the exam?

78
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:22,340
I am sorry. You have failed, young man.

79
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,345
You just wasted my time.

80
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,642
I knew it. I'm hopeless.

81
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,353
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

82
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,356
I was just joking, son.

83
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,652
You passed. With flying colors.

84
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,823
-Really?
-Yes.

85
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,241
Well done.

86
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,455
Thank you very much, sir.

87
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,958
Thank you. You scared me.

88
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,002
I thought I was going
to disappoint my lover.

89
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,632
Truth is, she was the one
who pushed me to go back to school.

90
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,009
She will be happy to hear this.

91
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,014
When can I return to enroll?

92
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,601
As soon as possible.
School starts on the 21st.

93
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,229
You must give these to the registrar,

94
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,358
so you better secure all those
documents for submission.

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,361
Will do, sir.

96
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,822
Thank you very much.

97
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,824
-Well done.
-Thank you.

98
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,954
Thank you!

99
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,362
My dear Hiroshi.

100
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,948
Do you still remember me?

101
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,286
Your childhood friend,
who is still waiting for you.

102
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,146
Dear Hiroshi, did you know
that today is my birthday?

103
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,899
I only have one wish today,

104
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,529
and that's for you to return,
just like my father.

105
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,458
Were you looking for this, Adelina?

106
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,212
Why didn't you tell me?

107
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,259
Why didn't you tell me
you're in love with Hiroshi?

108
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,847
Give me that!

109
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,476
You shouldn't touch things
that aren't yours.

110
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,773
Adelina.

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,112
Adelina, forgive me.

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,115
I'm sorry I hurt you.

113
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,416
Why didn't you tell me about this?

114
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,379
Why didn't you tell me
you had feelings for him?

115
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,422
Why would I?

116
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,133
So you and Eduardo could tease me?

117
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,263
I'll talk to Papa.

118
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,475
We'll go to the Tanakas
and take back our deal.

119
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,605
You don't have to, Teresita.

120
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,065
You are right.

121
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,237
If I were in your situation,
I would sacrifice for our father too.

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,663
What if you marry Hiroshi instead of me?

123
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,375
Don't you think it's a good idea?

124
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,880
Why don't you marry Hiroshi?

125
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,847
What nonsense is this, Teresita?

126
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,977
Why are you trying to set up
that bastard with your fiancé?

127
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,318
Because Adelina is in love
with Hiroshi, Mama.

128
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,738
Teresita. That's not true, señora.

129
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,573
That's not true.

130
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,409
Adelina, don't deny it.

131
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,872
Mama, why don't we have Adelina
marry Hiroshi instead?

132
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,635
I'm sorry, Father.

133
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,348
But I really don't agree
with the arrangement we struck.

134
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,188
I do not want to marry Teresita.

135
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,357
Why?

136
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,734
I'm in love with someone else.

137
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,238
Who is it?

138
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,534
Adelina.

139
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,126
Teresita's sister.

140
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,213
I would like to know her better

141
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,217
and marry her someday, Father.

142
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,438
Are you joking, Teresita?

143
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,651
What use is a bastard to the Tanakas, huh?

144
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,406
They would never accept her.

145
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,158
And besides,

146
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,454
she is not suitable for the educated

147
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,248
and sole heir of the Tanakas!

148
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,958
Mama!

149
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,336
The nail that sticks out…

150
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,799
gets hammered down.

151
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,014
That saying emphasizes…

152
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,685
the importance

153
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,855
of obedience as a Japanese.

154
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,860
That is our most important principle.

155
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,070
But, Father…

156
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm really not ready to settle down.

157
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,453
Why did you have to say that?

158
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,997
I'm just telling the truth!

159
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,543
What use does a woman born
from shame have for the Tanakas?

160
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,799
I'm sorry, señora.

161
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,135
My sister was just mistaken.

162
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,473
I don't have any feelings for Hiroshi.

163
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,559
That's good.

164
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,104
And you, stop this nonsense.

165
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,280
Adelina.

166
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,575
Why did you lie to Mama?

167
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,578
Because she's right!

168
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,997
Señora is right.

169
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,585
Hiroshi's family would never like me.

170
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,629
And besides,

171
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,173
I don't think the feeling is mutual.

172
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,760
He just sees me as a friend.

173
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,012
You two are better for each other.

174
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,597
Adelina.

175
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,393
Don't belittle yourself.

176
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,311
No, it's not like that.

177
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,981
Don't cry.

178
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,232
Just leave me be.

179
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,151
Don't worry about me, okay?

180
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:28,868
If you do not follow
your father and our Emperor,

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,537
what will happen to you?

182
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,123
You're like

183
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,669
a protruding nail that can be…

184
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,339
easily hammered.

185
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,261
Just like someone who will turn his back
on his family, country, and Emperor.

186
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,852
Is that what you want?

187
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,733
To lose us?

188
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,491
How about this?

189
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,535
I will just avoid Hiroshi,

190
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,830
so I can forget about my feelings for him.

191
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,130
-There.
-Adelina! Don't do that!

192
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,007
Why did you do that?

193
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,593
Because it's the right thing to do!

194
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,638
I can't keep holding on to these.

195
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,392
Don't worry about me.

196
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,394
All right?

197
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,979
I can handle myself!

198
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,149
I'll forget about Hiroshi in no time.

199
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,652
Come on. Who are you talking to?

200
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,695
I'm your brave little sister, remember?

201
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,664
Teresita, the person you need
to be concerned about is my brother.

202
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,000
Because he will be hurt the most.

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,129
Go to him. Talk, tell him what happened.

204
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,507
Go! Go to him.

205
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,801
I still have to clean up here. Go.

206
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,135
Go, Teresita.

207
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,888
You got this.

208
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,049
Teresita.

209
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,384
Eduardo.

210
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,553
I'm glad you're finally home.

211
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,140
Teresita, I have good news for you.

212
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,683
I went to the university.

213
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,227
And I took their entrance exam.

214
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,728
Here, take a look.

215
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,690
I passed.

216
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,777
This means I can enroll in college now.

217
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,616
I don't know how I can pay for my tuition,

218
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,118
but I'll figure it out.

219
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,328
Maybe I can ask Mr. Tanaka for an advance.

220
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,624
I'm happy for you, Eduardo.

221
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,090
No matter what happens,
you need to finish your studies, okay?

222
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,932
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

223
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,728
Aren't you happy with what I told you?

224
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,315
Forgive me, Eduardo.

225
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,110
But…

226
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,865
I don't think I can fulfill
my promise to you.

227
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,618
I can no longer wait for you.

228
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,205
Why? What happened?

229
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,500
Did I do something wrong?

230
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,879
My family has made an arrangement.

231
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,134
They will marry me off
to Hiroshi in December.

232
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,512
I agreed because…

233
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,974
the Tanakas will return my father's land,

234
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,436
where his theater was built.

235
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,736
You know how important it is to us, right?

236
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,992
Just continue your studies, okay?

237
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,538
You will graduate no matter what happens.

238
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,040
Yes.

239
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,501
I will really work hard

240
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,338
so that, someday,

241
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,175
I can also buy a woman like you

242
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,303
whose worth is only
that of a piece of land.

243
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,186
Teresita.

244
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,896
I apologize.

245
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,023
I apologize if I…

246
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,943
if I insulted you, I'm hurt too.

247
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,488
Don't marry Hiroshi.

248
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,535
-Come with me. Let's run away…
-What kind of life will you give me?

249
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,456
I thought you weren't looking down on me?

250
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,711
We will be throwing away our dreams
with this plan of yours, Eduardo.

251
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,178
And Papa will never get back
his property if I run away with you.

252
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,807
And how will we be happy…

253
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,396
when I'm only going to hurt
my parents, Eduardo?

254
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,946
So study hard.

255
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,913
And forget about me.

256
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,418
COMING UP

257
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,882
