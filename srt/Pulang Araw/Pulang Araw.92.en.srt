1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>I'm waiting for someone to return.</i>

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>My Auntie Amalia.</i>

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,340
You'll tell me where Eduardo is…

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,469
or you'll watch your daughter
pay the price.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Eduardo's in danger.</i>

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,473
<i>Soldiers are on their way to his location,</i>

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>and his Aunt Amalia is leading the hunt.</i>

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>Your father is dead.</i>

9
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,062
What happened, Akio?

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>Someone killed him
before he could board the ship.</i>

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,902
Who gave the orders to kill him?

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>I think you already know who he is.</i>

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>Lend me your gun.</i>

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,411
<i>To protect myself and Adelina.</i>

15
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,538
<i>Be safe, my friend. Please.</i>

16
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,457
PREVIOUSLY

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
<i>You wench!</i>

18
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>Teresita!</i>

19
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>Have you found Adelina?</i>

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>Yes, Colonel.
I know where she is right now.</i>

21
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,759
Adelina! Run away!

22
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Now you've seen your father's grave,</i>

23
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>I guess you've already mourned enough.</i>

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,518
Let me mourn and cry for my father!

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,188
My country…

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,609
<i>You might as well weep for the deaths</i>

27
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,654
<i>of Eduardo and Adelina Dela Cruz.</i>

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>I'm sure that by now
my soldiers have tracked them down</i>

29
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>and killed them.</i>

30
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,507
Just end all the suffering
you've put me through!

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,013
There's no reason for me
to live anymore, Yuta!

32
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,060
You've already ruined my family.

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,521
So just kill me instead.

34
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,110
Do it, you bastard!

35
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,907
I would rather die here

36
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,660
and lay to rest next to my father

37
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,538
than be alive with you
on this hellish world!

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,544
You took away my reason to live.

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,797
I'm no longer afraid to die!

40
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,679
Don't embarrass me in front
of my soldiers, my beloved wife.

41
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,778
Where did you go?

42
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,404
Where can I find you?

43
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,498
Where are you, my love?

44
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,432
I'm not an enemy, sir.

45
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,644
My name is Hiroshi Tanaka.

46
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,730
I'm Adelina's boyfriend.

47
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,443
Wait, aren't you allies?

48
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,447
I'm looking for her.
Do you know where she is?

49
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,077
Where can I find her?

50
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,581
Luis!

51
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,880
Adelina.

52
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,689
Sir, where could she have gone?

53
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,275
She went to her brother's camp.

54
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,569
But I don't know where that is.

55
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,572
I hope she gets there safely

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,450
without our soldiers capturing her.

57
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,163
Sir, thanks for your help
but I really need to go.

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,666
- Where are you going?
- To see Colonel Saitoh Yuta.

59
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,377
I'm going to put an end to all of this.

60
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,560
You had the audacity to escape.

61
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,065
And the way you talk back?

62
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,485
It's as if I'm not your husband.

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,993
Have you forgotten
that I'm the leader of our army?

64
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,956
I should be well-respected.

65
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,128
But what did you do?

66
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,217
You embarrassed me
in front of my soldiers!

67
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,662
Why aren't you answering?

68
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,722
You! Woman!

69
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,017
Are you sure this is where

70
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,146
Eduardo Dela Cruz is hiding?

71
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,900
Everybody, get off!

72
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,073
Don't touch my daughter. Don't touch her.

73
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,995
Tell the camp that we're here.

74
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,373
We'll wait for their arrival.

75
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,375
Yes, sir!

76
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,754
Now, show me your insolence, woman.

77
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,262
It's just us two in this room.

78
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,730
Are you really going to stay silent?

79
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,279
Are you really not going to talk?

80
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,408
Why don't you just kill me, Yuta?

81
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,955
Let's just end this torment.

82
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,127
I won't kill you just yet.

83
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:35,348
Especially once they bring me
the bodies of your sister

84
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,019
and that Eduardo Dela Cruz.

85
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:47,401
I want to see you mourn and regret.

86
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,615
That's what you get for crossing me!

87
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,422
Don't you dare try to escape again.

88
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,270
You're all worthless!

89
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,939
Useless bunch!

90
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,194
How and why did you let
Adelina Dela Cruz escape?

91
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,240
Forgive us, Colonel.

92
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,578
We let them get away.

93
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,831
But we killed her male companion.

94
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,333
Who did you kill?

95
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,711
Do you know him?

96
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,504
I don't care who he was!

97
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:55,261
I only wanted Adelina Dela Cruz
and her brother,

98
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,347
but you all failed me.

99
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,726
You're all useless!

100
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,481
Now, get out of my sight!

101
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,359
All of you!

102
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,569
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

103
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,914
Good morning, Sir Master.

104
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,917
Forgive me for the intrusion.

105
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,921
But have you met my wife?

106
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,675
Did she tell you where Eduardo
and his group are hiding?

107
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,386
Let the soldiers in!

108
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,514
Even if you threaten me with your power,

109
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,225
I will never tell you where Eduardo is.

110
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,561
Either you tell me where Eduardo is,

111
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,313
or your daughter will experience

112
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,358
the same things you did
at the hands of my soldiers.

113
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,778
Thanks for all your help, Lauro.

114
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,074
I appreciate your loyalty.

115
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,076
It's my pleasure, Sir Master.

116
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,498
Now, I have proven my devotion.

117
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,126
I even betrayed my wife for you.

118
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,923
If it's not too much to ask,
I only have one request.

119
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,509
It's about my daughter, Luisa.

120
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,303
I ask that you help me find her.

121
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,180
Don't worry, Lauro.

122
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,894
Once Eduardo Dela Cruz
is brought back to me,

123
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,522
alive or dead,

124
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,194
I'll personally take
your daughter home to you.

125
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,864
Thank you very much, Sir Master.

126
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,827
I won't kill you just yet.

127
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,833
<i>I want to see you mourn</i>

128
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,545
<i>once they bring me
the bodies of your sister</i>

129
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,007
<i>and that Eduardo Dela Cruz.</i>

130
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,682
My Lord!

131
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,436
Help me!

132
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,067
Please help Adelina and Eduardo, Lord!

133
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,364
Please save them!

134
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,957
There they are! Get down!

135
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,676
Who's your leader of this troop?

136
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:35,606
Colonel Saitoh assigned me
to lead this hunt.

137
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,319
We're ready to leave. Let's go.

138
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,617
Woman, you go first!

139
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,162
Take us to Eduardo Dela Cruz!

140
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,039
Now!

141
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,755
Faster!

142
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,509
Hush.

143
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,896
Woman!

144
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,651
Are you sure this is the way
to Eduardo's hideout?

145
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,653
It's over there.

146
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,283
Ouch. Ouch.

147
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,038
Sir, my stomach hurts.

148
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,040
I need to defecate.

149
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
I'll just be by the bushes.

150
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,380
Come with me, Luisa.

151
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,341
Leave the child here!

152
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,721
- No, sir. Please don't.
- Mom!

153
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,935
I told you, leave the child here!

154
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,562
I'll come with you!

155
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,024
Mom!

156
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,192
No, please.

157
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,528
Please, no.

158
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,365
It's embarrassing.

159
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,867
Why, woman?

160
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
Are you ashamed?

161
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,833
- I've seen your body countless times!
- Mom!

162
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,378
I've slept with you several times!

163
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,761
Please, sir.

164
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,847
Don't disrespect me in front of my child.

165
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,273
Are you really going to defecate?
Maybe you're just tricking us!

166
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,734
No, sir.

167
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,945
Or are you going to escape?

168
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,948
- Are you?
- No, sir.

169
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,575
No, sir. We would never.

170
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,035
Please don't shoot.

171
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,456
Please don't. We won't run away.

172
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,500
Move.

173
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,753
I said move!

174
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,257
Mom, don't leave me.

175
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm scared!

176
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,013
My dear, hush. Don't worry.

177
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll be back.

178
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,312
That's enough!

179
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,399
Mom!

180
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,817
- Mom!
- Luisa.

181
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,485
Move!

182
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,069
Mom!

183
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,490
I'll kill your leader
if you kill my daughter.

184
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,796
I will kill your leader

185
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,134
if you don't release my daughter.

186
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,224
You're an idiot!

187
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,978
How can you be so stupid?

188
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:49,109
If you kill me, my soldiers will kill you

189
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,029
and your child!

190
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,117
Go, shoot.

191
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,214
Mom!

192
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,933
Looks like there's an attack.

193
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,519
Or maybe someone got shot.

194
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,731
I'm sure the enemies are outside, Uncle.

195
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,399
Tasyo, Panyong.

196
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
Stay here. Stay with Juan.

197
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,237
You're leaving me again?

198
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,074
Poor you.

199
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,826
All alone again.

200
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,578
What? You mad?

201
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,205
Okay, slow down.

202
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,915
You punches don't even land.

203
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,042
If can't hit me,
you won't be able to hit the enemy.

204
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,130
Ow.

205
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,056
You monsters!

206
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,603
You monsters!

207
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,064
If you do that again, I'll kill you!

208
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,699
Now, tell us where Eduardo Dela Cruz is.

209
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,700
Where is he?

210
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,705
- Over there.
- We don't need to find him.

211
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,290
Surely, the guerrillas heard us.

212
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,209
The sound will lead them straight here.

213
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,797
He's right. They surely would've heard it.

214
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,050
This woman gave them a warning!

215
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,222
- I think it's over there.
- Everyone, be careful!

216
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,396
Don't waste your bullets!

217
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,814
Shut up!

218
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,858
I'm setting our bait!

219
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,153
We'll use these women to capture them!

220
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,119
That was for the guerillas.

221
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,829
So they would find us.

222
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,290
We'll make them come to us.

223
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,027
Eduardo.

224
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,446
- It's your Auntie Amalia.
- Auntie!

225
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,830
It's a trap.

226
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,542
It's a trap! Retreat, retreat!

227
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,224
<i>This is for Colonel Saitoh.</i>

228
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,351
I'll stay with you and keep watch.

229
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,356
This is my last request, my friend.

230
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,983
Find Adelina.

231
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,526
<i>Save her.</i>

232
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,152
<i>Adelina, whose house is this?</i>

233
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,114
<i>This was our mother's house.
We'll hide here for now.</i>

234
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,448
Just my luck.

235
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,826
Who would've thought
I'd be able to catch you here?

236
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,703
<i>It's my good-for-nothing uncle.</i>

237
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,163
COMING UP

238
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,586
