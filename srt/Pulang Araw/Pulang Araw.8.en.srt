1
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,625
I'm not surprised your señora got angry.

2
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,880
Do you really think she'll let her
go, considering Teresita went to college?

3
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,840
Just think about it,

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,706
I wanted to send you to
college, but you didn't want to.

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,097
Eduardo, we've talked about this.

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,516
I don't want to waste
your hard-earned money.

7
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,394
Besides, I've already made up my mind.

8
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,024
I really want to become
a famous vaudeville star.

9
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,988
But how can that happen now?
Señora won't even let my sister go.

10
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,704
Why don't you just pray
for death to take your señora

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,581
so your troubles finally end?

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,500
-You rascal! -Ow.

13
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,752
You're full of nonsense.

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,089
But just between the two of us…

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,759
I also prayed for that several times.

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,843
I knew it.

17
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,180
But it seems the saying is true.

18
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,434
"God takes the good
ones before the bad ones."

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,607
Like Mom.

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,991
Mom and Dad never left my thoughts.

21
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,037
I still mourn their absence.

22
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,957
Adelina.

23
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,585
There's still hope that
your father is alive.

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,712
Unlike Mom.

25
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,007
Do you remember what she always told us?

26
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,138
We shouldn't let anyone oppress us.

27
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,724
You tell Teresita that too.

28
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
Tell her to fight for her dream.

29
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,732
And you should be the ones
to take charge of your lives.

30
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,528
You're doing this for your father

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,489
and your desire to entertain, right?

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,617
Always have courage.

33
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,377
How about you, Eduardo?

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,545
If I may ask,

35
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,339
what do you dream for yourself?

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,385
-What? -What?

37
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,220
I won't tell a blabbermouth like you.

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,890
It'll be embarrassing if someone finds out.

39
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,475
Wait, why are you keeping
secrets from me now?

40
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,227
-Tell me! -Adelina.

41
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,771
Let's go home, or your
señora will scold you again.

42
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,899
I was just curious.

43
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,485
-Come on. -Tell me! I was just asking.

44
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,155
-Be quiet! -Okay, let me guess.

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,741
You're so nosy.

46
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,328
Do you dream of finally taking a bath?

47
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,581
And when did I not bathe, huh?

48
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,711
- The things you say!
- You're so mean, Eduardo!

49
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,173
Hey.

50
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,512
That's enough.

51
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,140
The young lady you like
might melt from your staring.

52
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,435
Shut up, she might hear you.

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,861
Why don't you woo her,

54
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,239
so you'll find out if
she feels the same way?

55
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,287
She only sees me as a brother,

56
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,873
she made that clear many times.

57
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,584
And…

58
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,963
her mother wouldn't approve of me.

59
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,966
So why would I put myself through that?

60
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,513
Besides, finding another woman
is not difficult for me, right?

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,390
Oh, boy!

62
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,768
Your lips say one thing,
but your heart says another.

63
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,021
You're teasing me again.

64
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:17,400
By the way, I need your share of the rent.

65
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,237
-We need to pay the landlord. -See?

66
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,365
Because of your deep
admiration for Teresita,

67
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,827
we even rented a place
right behind their house.

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
Aren't you clever?

69
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,583
- Right?
- I'm here to keep an eye on Adelina.

70
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,084
And Teresita.

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,254
Don't forget Teresita.
We both know the truth.

72
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,799
Tasyo.

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,803
I don't know what I'll
do if you don't stop.

74
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,684
All right.

75
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,693
Teresita.

76
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,158
How will we pursue vaudeville
now that your mother disapproves?

77
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,163
Don't worry.

78
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,000
I only agreed with her
so she wouldn't get mad.

79
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,130
But those were just empty promises.

80
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,176
Really, Teresita?

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,594
We'll still do it?

82
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,680
You're asking me again?
Weren't you listening?

83
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
I just wanted to be sure.

84
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,230
I promised, didn't I?

85
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,649
So I'll stand by it.

86
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,991
But, Teresita…

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,327
what about your mama?

88
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,539
I'm sure this will enrage her more.

89
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,293
I don't care. I'm used to it already.

90
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,839
But you, can you handle
her being mad at you?

91
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,633
I don't want to make Mama angry.

92
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,013
But I won't forgive myself

93
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,433
if I don't do something
to fulfill our dreams.

94
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,187
That's why we'll leave
early tomorrow morning.

95
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,568
We'll go to Papa's theater
and practice there, all right?

96
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,195
So Mama won't see us.

97
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,325
We need to do well on our next
audition for that old impresario.

98
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,243
You're right.

99
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,667
It's sad, isn't it?

100
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,712
If Dad was here,

101
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,924
we wouldn't need to hide
or lie to your mother.

102
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,177
We'd have someone on our side.

103
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,058
Where could Papa be?

104
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,144
I've been wondering that too.

105
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,814
I wonder what happened to him.

106
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,777
Why hasn't he returned?

107
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,775
Mama…

108
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,029
Adelina and I will go to church.

109
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,742
We have an altar here. You can pray there.

110
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,375
Mama, I also want to go to confession.

111
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,961
Adelina and I won't take long.

112
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,879
Teresita.

113
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,968
Do not use God and the
priest for your excuses.

114
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,263
You can't fool me.

115
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,767
I wasn't born yesterday.

116
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:52,902
That is why no one leaves this
house without my permission.

117
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,031
So just go back to your rooms.

118
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,366
Go on.

119
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,265
Señora is so unreasonable.

120
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,144
I never knew she could
smell our lies like a dog.

121
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,441
How are we going to rehearse
and attend the audition now?

122
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,707
Teresita.

123
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,465
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

124
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,347
Good heavens, Adelina. Can
we really climb down from here?

125
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,519
If that's what it takes, then we can.

126
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,205
Teresita.

127
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,422
Wasn't this candle
upright when we last saw it?

128
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,760
Someone else must have gotten in here.

129
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,390
But who would dare come here?

130
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,831
Forgive me, my children.

131
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,836
But I have returned.

132
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,758
We will be together again.

133
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,769
Señora, lunch is ready.

134
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,356
All right. My friends and I will eat later.

135
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,901
- Let Teresita eat first.
- Yes, ma'am, I'll fetch her.

136
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,990
Did you know I locked
my daughter in her room?

137
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,201
She's become so stubborn lately.

138
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,703
She doesn't listen, she doesn't obey.

139
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,373
That child thinks she can outsmart me.

140
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,251
She's wrong about that.

141
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,545
What should we do

142
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:02,633
so that old impresario won't
call us Katy Dela Cruz copycats?

143
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,561
I've been thinking about
that since yesterday.

144
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,607
And I think I found the perfect solution.

145
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,568
What?

146
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,329
Jesus, our Savior.

147
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,645
I ask only one
thing from you and the Heavenly Father.

148
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,964
I pray that
Teresita and Adelina can fulfill their dream.

149
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,010
That alone would make me happy.

150
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,805
There's one more thing.

151
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,602
You know that
I have feelings for Teresita, don't you?

152
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,521
I trust that nothing
is impossible for you and the Heavenly Father.

153
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,401
That is why I hope that one day,

154
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,449
Teresita will find
it in her heart to love me, not as a brother,

155
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,620
but in the same way as I love her.

156
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:20,044
Yes, I know I'm not
worthy of her because I'm nothing but a lowly man.

157
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,465
But no other woman in this world

158
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,469
can compare to Teresita.

159
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,014
She is my only dream.

160
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,727
I hope the time will come

161
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,313
when she'll notice me.

162
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,314
Thank you.

163
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,464
I think it's a shame, Carmela.

164
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,008
If I only had an available son,

165
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,386
I'd arrange his wedding for him.

166
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,680
We could marry him and Teresita,

167
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:18,936
to make an honest woman out of
your daughter as soon as possible.

168
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,522
Betina is right, my friend.

169
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,734
Especially since Teresita
is of age to settle down.

170
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,278
You should find someone for her to marry.

171
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,823
Who should I marry her off to?

172
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,033
I don't want just anyone.

173
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:38,372
I want a man I can
proudly call my son-in-law.

174
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,455
I want someone

175
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,877
who can provide a good
life for my only daughter.

176
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,295
Don't worry.

177
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,464
I'll help you look for one.

178
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,508
It's your turn.

179
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,510
-Is it? -Yes, my friend.

180
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,686
Señora, Teresita and
Adelina are not in their room.

181
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,773
- What do you mean?
- It looks like they escaped

182
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,942
through the window.

183
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,198
Teresita!

184
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,415
Carmela, what is...

185
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,551
Until you marry off Teresita,

186
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,929
she will continue being a problem.

187
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,807
You're right.

188
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,729
I need to marry off my
daughter as soon as possible.

189
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,026
Isn't she a pain?

190
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,947
What you came up with was great, Adelina.

191
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,831
I'm sure this is very different
from what Ms. Katy Dela Cruz performs.

192
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,787
I'm sure that old impresario
won't insult us anymore.

193
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,287
You're right.

194
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,459
Oh, I just hope he loves
what we're going to do.

195
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,297
When do you think we can
go back for another audition?

196
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,424
Tomorrow.

197
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,513
Mama will be at the office.
We can sneak out tomorrow.

198
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,948
Deliver these sacks of
rice to Mr. Arata, okay?

199
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,120
By the way, how is Hiroshi doing?

200
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,749
Has your son finished his studies?

201
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,753
All is well with my son, Eduardo.

202
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,881
Now, do me a favor and deliver
these supplies to Mr. Arata.

203
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,551
-All right? -Yes, boss.

204
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,470
-Yes, boss. -Ready? Let's go.

205
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,554
Goodbye, sir.

206
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,058
Can you carry it?

207
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,726
You sure?

208
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,867
Kobayashi is waiting for us. Let's go.

209
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,035
All right, let's go.

210
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,097
Good morning!

211
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,850
Good morning, sir.

212
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,060
Thank you for your hard work.

213
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,982
-One moment, please. -All right.

214
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,452
Eduardo, did you notice

215
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,455
that there seem to be
more Japanese coming here?

216
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,211
Do you think the rumors are
true, that they will invade us next?

217
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,255
Stop listening to those
baseless rumors, Tasyo.

218
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,925
The Japanese are good people.

219
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,469
Look at our boss, Mr. Tanaka.

220
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,596
He is very good to us.

221
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,223
They are not violent people.

222
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,466
They won't
invade this country. That's rubbish.

223
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,715
Oh, no!

224
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,344
Teresita, the blanket is gone.

225
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,478
Do you think we've been caught?

226
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,963
I can no longer trust you, Teresita.

227
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,926
You've become very stubborn.

228
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,094
Ma…

229
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:49,391
- Forgive me…
- But I know this is not your fault.

230
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,523
Perhaps that little devil
is to blame after all.

231
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,068
She's the reason you've been disobeying me.

232
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,326
But I am not afraid of that devil.

233
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,790
-I am not afraid of any devil! -Mama!

234
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,459
Mama!

235
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,669
This is not Adelina's fault!

236
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,670
Don't interfere!

237
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,590
I've been holding back
so much on this girl!

238
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,552
Ever since she came here, you've changed!

239
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,180
-That's enough! -I beg you, please stop!

240
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,057
-Ma! -Pease!

241
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,603
Why do you insist on
staying in this house, huh?

242
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,523
I should have sent you
away a long time ago!

243
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,776
Enough, Mama!

244
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,611
Enough, Mama!

245
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,907
Whatever I do, I decided for myself!

246
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,159
And Adelina is not to blame!

247
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,912
Teresita, that's enough.
Don't answer back, please.

248
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,582
Why do you have to decide for me, Mama?

249
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,167
Times have changed!

250
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,421
Now that the Americans are
in-charge, we all have rights now!

251
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,756
Be it a woman or a man,

252
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,425
they have the right to
decide for themselves.

253
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,136
So just accept our dream!

254
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,475
Do not insist on what you want

255
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:20,440
if you still want your
half-sister to stay in my house.

256
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,734
Believe me.

257
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,823
I will not think twice
about sending Adelina away

258
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,075
if you disobey me again.

259
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:35,330
And don't you ever threaten
to run away again, Teresita.

260
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,000
You are not a child anymore.

261
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,131
I am no longer afraid of you.

262
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,679
If you ever try to run away from me again,

263
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:57,519
I will do everything I can
to keep you and Adelina apart,

264
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,689
and I will never let
you see each other again.

265
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,357
Is that what you both want?

266
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,933
You, Filipino. Call your master.

267
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,268
Tell him Watanabe is here.

268
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,605
Watch how you talk to
me. I am not your slave.

269
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,815
The Japanese businessmen here have money.

270
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,695
Maybe we'll find a worthy
husband among them for Teresita.

271
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,072
COMING UP

272
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,368
Don't they know they should fear

273
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:59,164
our honorable country and Emperor?

274
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,293
I applaud you for coming back here.

275
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,753
All right, I'll give you a chance.

276
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,297
Wherever you are

277
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,091
Be it the city or the country

278
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:15,430
You will
always bump into The naughty clown…

279
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,975
Just try and involve my
daughter in your foolishness,

280
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,228
I won't just send you away,

281
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,021
I will break your bones too.

282
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,696
