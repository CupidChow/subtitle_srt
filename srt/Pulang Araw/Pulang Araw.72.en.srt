1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,088
Get ready.
I'll find a way for us to escape.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,383
Do you have any cough medicine?

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,136
I'm not feeling well these days.

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,640
I think our colonel wants
to embarrass me in this camp

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,477
and put you all in danger
as your worthless leader.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,604
Kenji, we'll all die together.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,023
I'm ready for my first mission.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,442
What's your mission?

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,068
Love for the Philippines.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,403
Be careful with this.

11
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,281
This will be a big help
for our guerrillas.

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,574
My mother…

13
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:37,704
She was killed by my worthless father,

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,873
who is a Filipino.

15
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,418
-But that means you're also Filipino.
-I'm not like you!

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:48,047
I despise the blood of that monster.

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,592
We'll go after Adelina Dela Cruz,

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,678
and she'll be our bait
to capture her brother.

19
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,221
Hey, kid! Stop!

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
Hey, stop!

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,558
I just to see my wife and daughter again.

22
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,436
-That's all I want.
-It will be granted.

23
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,771
Adelina?

24
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:08,276
Tell others that no one
should sleep tonight.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,655
I don't know where she is anymore!

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,543
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,469
Amalia, we already told the others.

28
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,055
I hope Teresita's plan succeeds.

29
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,189
Amalia.

30
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,193
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

31
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,989
I'm worried about my daughter.

32
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,870
Where could she be right now?

33
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,333
I hope

34
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,338
the Japanese soldiers didn't take her too.

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,564
Luisa, come.

36
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,982
Stay here.

37
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,652
Luisa, I want you to stay here for now.

38
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,947
This is just really important.
I'll be back.

39
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,578
Don't worry too much, Amalia.

40
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,082
The Lord protects the innocent children.

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,459
Have faith.

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,463
The moment we get out of here,

43
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,507
trust that you'll be
with your daughter again.

44
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,385
So don't lose hope.

45
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,265
Would you like us to pray for her?

46
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,425
Well done.

47
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,970
You've completed your mission.

48
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,767
This means you can now
take on bigger missions.

49
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,189
They're going to need
more weapons, Adelina.

50
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,316
Especially since the Americans,

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,319
if they're not in jail,
are probably in Bataan and Corregidor.

52
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,867
We need to secure weapons,
anything our guerrillas can use.

53
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,244
Leave it to me.

54
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
I'll handle it.

55
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,710
Let's go.

56
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,505
What about my dad?

57
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,134
Did you find out what happened to him?

58
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,468
He's safe.

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,401
Keep walking!

60
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,610
Hurry up!

61
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,506
He's currently imprisoned
at Fort Santiago.

62
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,059
Don't worry.

63
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,645
He might be in prison,
but Mr. Julio is alive.

64
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,190
How do you know all this?

65
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,195
How can I be sure
you're telling me the truth?

66
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:22,840
This is the perfect opportunity for us
to escape this hell.

67
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,926
What about that Devil Colonel?

68
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,973
We have a man inside who confirmed this.

69
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,102
Don't ask who.

70
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,354
The less you know,

71
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,399
the better it will be for you
and our group.

72
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,403
You're right.

73
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,239
He truly is the devil.

74
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,201
He's corrupted by his own thoughts
and experiences,

75
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,537
so we have to get out of here.

76
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,166
Don't worry.

77
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,627
The devil is sleeping soundly.

78
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,922
That monster won't wake easily,

79
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,634
and there are only a few soldiers left.

80
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,971
We can't miss this chance.

81
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,807
Come.

82
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,726
Move closer and I'll tell you our plan.

83
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,940
We have to go. Let's go, Luis.

84
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,443
Wait.

85
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,530
If there's really a man inside,

86
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,162
could you also ask them
to find where those bastards

87
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,539
took Teresita and Auntie Amalia?

88
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,089
Yes, both of them
were taken by those monsters.

89
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,594
And I know they're not in safe hands.

90
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,265
That's why I want to know where.

91
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,101
I will find them myself.

92
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,687
We've already asked about Teresita,

93
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,106
but they still don't know anything.

94
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,359
We'll ask again tomorrow.

95
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,405
Don't forget your new mission.

96
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,534
And be careful, Adelina.

97
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,668
Teresita.

98
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,463
Auntie Amalia.

99
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
Wherever you are right now,

100
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,471
I'll find you.

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,570
What are you doing here?

102
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,779
Go back to your room.

103
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,199
Scram!

104
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,418
I am engaged to your colonel, soldier.

105
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,010
Or do you want me
to report you to your colonel

106
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,762
for your rude behavior?

107
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,233
Together!

108
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,818
Colonel! Me!

109
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,113
My apologies, madam. Forgive me.

110
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,074
Enough.

111
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,788
Just fetch me some water from the well

112
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,209
and bring it up to the kitchen.

113
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,214
I'll prepare the bath for your colonel.

114
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,425
What?

115
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,262
That's a woman's job.

116
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,308
Are you going to do what I say
or do you want me to report you?

117
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,561
I'm on it.

118
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,051
I hope you can forgive me.

119
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,806
I had no other choice
but to bring you here.

120
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,850
I know you understand why.

121
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,740
I want you to write down
all your camps here, Ryo.

122
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,036
I can't do that, Eduardo.

123
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,049
My fiancée's life is at stake,

124
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,929
as well as the other women
who have been abducted by your soldiers!

125
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,601
So just cooperate and write them down!

126
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,452
What do you want?

127
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,415
Follow me.

128
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,126
The Colonel is calling for you.

129
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,470
Go to your colonel!

130
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,721
To the Colonel! Go!

131
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,566
Amalia, that's enough!

132
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,527
Eduardo.

133
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,112
You're just wasting your time.

134
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,658
I don't think he can be swayed.

135
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,705
He's right. Do you want me to beat you up?

136
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,712
Is this really what you want? To die here?

137
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,096
Write them down and we'll set you free.

138
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
Enough!

139
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,357
You killed him.

140
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,820
I regret nothing.

141
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,701
There are no more soldiers!

142
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,869
No more! Go!

143
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,745
Hurry! Just go!

144
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,420
Go.

145
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,174
Wait for me, Eduardo.

146
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,844
We'll meet again soon.

147
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,941
I don't believe
these are the only camps you have!

148
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,030
That's all I know.

149
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,575
I don't know where the others are.

150
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,537
I don't believe you!

151
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,298
Even if you kill me,

152
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,510
I really don't know anything else.

153
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,518
Put the gun down.

154
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,980
I know him, he's not lying.

155
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
I guess she was really hungry.

156
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,826
My dear.

157
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,665
Since when have you been
living on the streets?

158
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,336
Leave her to me, Uncle Johnny.

159
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,672
Get some rest. I'll take care of her.

160
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,508
Thank you for letting her stay here.

161
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,597
Women

162
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,432
and especially the children

163
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,978
are truly the most unfortunate

164
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,647
in this damn war.

165
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,207
Luisa.

166
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,921
I know the Lord made a way for us to meet.

167
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,589
However,

168
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,676
you bring very unfortunate news.

169
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,929
But nevertheless,

170
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,726
I'm glad the Japanese soldiers
didn't take you either.

171
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,310
Unlike your mother.

172
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,771
My mother made me run.

173
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,026
She saved me.

174
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,572
Please help me, Adelina.

175
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,908
Please help me find my mother.

176
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,744
Of course.

177
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,370
Of course, Luisa.

178
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,372
Don't worry.

179
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,709
I'll find a way to find her and my sister.

180
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,587
Dry your tears.

181
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,092
Hurry up.

182
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,970
Watch your step.

183
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,939
Auntie Amalia!

184
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,507
Damn women!

185
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,971
Damn women!

186
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,604
Lorena, no! Let's go!

187
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,333
Why did I dream that something bad
happened to Teresita?

188
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,176
My God.

189
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,978
My God.

190
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,232
Is this my punishment?

191
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,283
Am I to live alone…

192
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,579
and lose my family?

193
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,711
You know, Luisa…

194
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,923
I'm all alone now just like you.

195
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,721
The Japanese took my family one by one.

196
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,557
Who had you arrested?

197
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,766
Their heartless colonel.

198
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,643
Colonel Saitoh Yuta.

199
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,230
He almost killed us.
That's why we attempted to escape.

200
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,274
Please, not my sister!

201
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,528
-Dad!
-Take Mr. Borromeo!

202
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,155
Dad!

203
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,073
Including the love of my life.

204
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,287
I'm sure the only reason our colonel
wants me to become a soldier

205
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,497
is because he wants me to die.

206
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,293
Thank God I found you, Luisa.

207
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,131
You're my only family right now

208
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:21,220
that I can hold on to and be stronger for.

209
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,640
Thank you, Luisa.

210
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,976
I promise.

211
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,481
I'll do everything to keep you safe.

212
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:41,114
I won't allow our enemies to take you.

213
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,769
Hey.

214
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,187
Hey.

215
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,147
What are you doing?

216
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,359
What is this, Eduardo?

217
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,196
Don't worry. I'm setting you free.

218
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,198
My comrades will drop you off.

219
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:29,204
Lucas, you and Minyong
drop him off near their camp.

220
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,710
Mario will go with Sir Lucas.

221
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,130
Mario, don't hurt him.

222
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,923
I won't, Eduardo.

223
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,887
Get up from there.

224
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,640
Come on.

225
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,523
We'll be in danger if we let him live.

226
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,650
Finish him off.

227
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,069
Yes, sir.

228
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,040
Come in!

229
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,462
Colonel, we have bad news.

230
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,257
-Are we being attacked?
-No, Colonel.

231
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,427
But the women tried to escape.

232
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,432
How can you be so stupid?

233
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,687
Where's Teresita?

234
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,482
-Did she escape?
-No, sir.

235
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,695
She's outside, along with the other women.

236
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,284
Whoever planned this

237
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,038
will pay dearly.

238
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,416
Call for backup!

239
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,633
Who goes there?

240
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,511
Don't worry.

241
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:12,057
We'll be together with our families
and loved ones again soon.

242
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,433
Wait, Sir Lucas.

243
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,018
-Why?
-The master's orders.

244
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,770
What are you going to do?

245
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,691
You're worse than a traitor!

246
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,612
Take this woman outside
and kill her there.

247
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,696
COMING UP

248
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,495
