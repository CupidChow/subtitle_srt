1
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,573
Someone's coming.

2
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,831
Juan?

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,085
Eduardo, I have delivered your letter.

4
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,882
Why did you come back here?

5
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,218
Didn't I tell you to stay with Adelina?

6
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,304
A child like you doesn't belong here.

7
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,306
I want to fight, Eduardo.

8
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,308
Like you.

9
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,101
Please, let me stay.

10
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,979
Don't you need my help?

11
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,315
I do your errands.

12
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,568
I clean your equipment.

13
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,240
And look, I brought
some food and clothes for you too.

14
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,869
Perfect! We haven't eaten in days.

15
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,042
Here. Share this among yourselves.

16
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,507
I'm sorry if it's not much.

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,384
These are just alms.

18
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,764
This is enough, Juan.

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142
Come with me.

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,311
Okay, Eduardo. But where are we going?

21
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,533
Hello?

22
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,870
Anybody home?

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,373
Auntie? Uncle?

24
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,803
Anybody home?

25
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,437
Eduardo.

26
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,358
Thank God you're here.

27
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,404
Where is our son? Is Mario with you?

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,406
No.

29
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,412
I apologize for bringing you
this terrible news.

30
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,874
No.

31
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,296
Mario…

32
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,300
-Our child…
-Is our child dead?

33
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,844
Is that why you're here?

34
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,181
Mario!

35
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,189
Pay a visit to Mom…

36
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,359
Mom and Dad.

37
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,321
Please tell them that I love them so much.

38
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,115
That Mario loves them very much.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,159
Mario?

40
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,957
Mario loved you both very much.

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,502
That's what…

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,338
he wanted me to tell you both.

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,008
He died…

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,387
thinking of you both.

45
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,577
My dear Adelina,

46
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,249
in times of war, I've always
been reminded of what it means

47
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,793
to have a complete and happy family.

48
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,339
Once more, I remembered our past.

49
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,385
When they separated us.

50
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,335
I will wait for you here, my friend.

51
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,254
I need to buy something from the pharmacy.

52
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,756
Thank you very much, my friend.

53
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,215
-We won't be long.
-All right.

54
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,342
What building is that, Auntie?

55
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,137
Can't you read?

56
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,640
Its name, Cine Borromeo,
is in big, bold letters.

57
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,102
Cine Borromeo?

58
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,107
Borromeo is my father's surname.

59
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,902
Why is that theater named after him?

60
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,779
Because your father owns it.

61
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,073
Didn't Fina tell you about this?

62
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,661
I didn't know my father was very wealthy.

63
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,747
Yes.

64
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,124
You should thank me

65
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,753
because you will live in luxury
from now on.

66
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,547
Like a princess.

67
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,663
The Japanese didn't just invade Manchuria.

68
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,291
Aren't they still in Korea until now?

69
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,921
I wouldn't be surprised
if our country is their next target.

70
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,631
And what concerns do you have

71
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,052
with the Japanese invasion, ladies?

72
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,598
What you should be focusing on
is our stage show.

73
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,933
Remember,

74
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:18,271
we are here to entertain our audience.

75
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,775
Get ready, the show is about to start.

76
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,903
Do your best.

77
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,824
My beloved family is watching.

78
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,328
Yes, sir.

79
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,502
The women here are so beautiful, Julio.

80
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,589
Don't worry, my love.

81
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,134
You and our child
are the only women in my life.

82
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,473
-Let's go?
-Sure.

83
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,436
Your father must be here.

84
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,771
I bet he has a performance today.

85
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,773
What performance, Uncle?

86
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
You ask too many questions. Let's just go.

87
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,553
I was separated from my brother
at a very young age.

88
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,362
THE QUEEN OF VAUDEVILLE

89
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,090
I was brought to a new world
I had never seen before.

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,055
I saw my father's luxurious theater
showcasing vaudeville performances.

91
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:30,319
For the first time, I witnessed a world
that was so beautiful and colorful.

92
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,832
An exciting world that I never thought
my father belonged in.

93
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,791
Dad?

94
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,406
Dad!

95
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,700
Adelina.

96
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,827
You can't call me Dad here.

97
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,832
-My family is here.
-Your family?

98
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,138
Lauro, what are you doing here?

99
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,681
What kind of question is that?

100
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,687
Since my cousin passed away,
you've forgotten about your child.

101
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,399
I've just been busy.

102
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,031
You know what, let's talk outside.

103
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,115
-But why?
-Outside.

104
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,202
-Let us watch. We paid to be here.
-Lauro. Let's talk outside.

105
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,578
What? Let go of me.

106
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,871
-Hey!
-Julio.

107
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,791
What's this commotion?

108
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,668
Why are you disturbing my husband?

109
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,174
This is the real world of my father

110
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,468
that I just discovered,

111
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,055
where my dad has other loved ones.

112
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,059
So, you're Julio's wife?

113
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,064
My love.

114
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,568
I think it's best for you
to return to your seats.

115
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,823
But, Julio, who are they?

116
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,366
I'll take care of this.

117
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,161
-They are just my friends.
-Your friends?

118
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,080
Lies!

119
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,878
Why don't you tell the truth to your wife?

120
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,755
Can you keep quiet?

121
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,092
Sir, I think your wife deserves
to know the truth.

122
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,769
With all due respect,

123
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,148
are you…

124
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,401
my husband's mistress?

125
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,486
What a big joke.

126
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,659
I am not the mistress
of your beloved husband.

127
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,162
It was my cousin.

128
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,958
She used to perform
in Julio's vaudeville shows.

129
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,751
And this kid right here?

130
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,755
She is their love child.

131
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,549
Good Lord.

132
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,593
Julio.

133
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,430
Is it true you had a child
with another woman?

134
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,056
My love.

135
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,144
Forgive me, I have wronged you.

136
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,067
My love, forgive me.

137
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,819
Forgive me.

138
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,614
I've wronged you.

139
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,824
I was tempted.

140
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,747
But believe me, you and our daughter
are the only women I truly love.

141
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,465
Let's go, Teresita.

142
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,810
I'll wait for you at home.

143
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,731
We will talk there.

144
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,658
Are you happy now?

145
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,245
You destroyed my family.

146
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,623
I didn't destroy it! You did!

147
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,292
Now, you deal with Adelina.

148
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,711
Let's go.

149
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,604
Juanito!

150
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,899
Juanito!

151
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,581
I never thought he would do this to us.

152
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,709
This scandal is beyond terrible!

153
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,796
Enough, Mama.

154
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,017
If he tries to bring
his bastard child home,

155
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,353
I'll make sure there won't be peace.

156
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,440
Señorita?

157
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,984
-What happened?
-Let's go!

158
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,579
Get inside.

159
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,424
Eduardo? Why did you follow us here?

160
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,510
-Where's Adelina?
-She's with her father.

161
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,096
Get in, Amalia. Let's go, Eduardo.

162
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,475
I want to wait for my sister, Uncle.

163
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,025
And you even took my bicycle!

164
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,528
I can't take her home.

165
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,824
She'll only cause
more tension in my family.

166
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,995
That's why I'm here, Rosing.

167
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,874
Maybe you could take care
of Adelina for me.

168
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,588
I'm willing to provide
sufficient monthly support

169
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,883
for your efforts and her needs.

170
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,179
Let me talk to my husband first, señor.

171
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,473
Señor, your daughter.

172
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,725
Adelina?

173
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,688
Adelina.

174
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,946
Where are you going, child?

175
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,867
I'll just leave so I won't be a burden.

176
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,496
I don't want to cause you trouble, Dad.

177
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,917
Especially to your real family.
So, please, just let me leave.

178
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,961
And where will you go?

179
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,255
Where?

180
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,632
Your auntie doesn't want you anymore.

181
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,051
Don't worry about me, Dad.

182
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:56,598
What matters is that you reconcile
and make peace with your wife.

183
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,406
Are you tired, my child?

184
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,411
Our home is just close by.

185
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,206
Mom lied.

186
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,462
My dad doesn't work and live
in a far-off province

187
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,298
because I'm very familiar with this place…

188
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,775
and this open field,
where my brother and I used to play.

189
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,745
Oh, no, Eduardo.

190
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,372
The Japanese kids got here before us.

191
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,475
That one looks like trouble.

192
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,937
Let him come at us.

193
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,482
Let's just go home.

194
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,946
Wait here.
I'll handle these Japanese kids.

195
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,639
Everyone, come!

196
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,685
-Let's go!
-All right!

197
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,074
Hit the ball, Adelina!

198
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,870
Show these Japanese kids
how good you are even if you're a girl!

199
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,761
That's right! Run! Faster!

200
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,640
-Good job.
-Run!

201
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,475
-Run, Adelina!
-You can do it!

202
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,544
Hey, Akio! Why did you hurt her?

203
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,512
A mere girl shouldn't have beaten us.

204
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,266
Nonsense. You should apologize.

205
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,435
Why should I follow you?

206
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,395
That's enough.

207
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,648
-Stop fighting.
-Okay.

208
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,152
-Okay.
-I met him that day.

209
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,781
The Japanese boy who defended me
from his Japanese friends.

210
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,576
His name is Hiroshi.

211
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,082
Just like my brother prayed for,
I hoped I could meet someone like him

212
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,838
so they could defend me
from the life that awaited me.

213
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,132
Adelina!

214
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,261
What are you staring at?

215
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,223
Let's go. I'm already sweating here.

216
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,505
Mr. Julio Borromeo.

217
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,094
-Mr. Tanaka.
-Yes.

218
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,263
Likewise.

219
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:57,477
He's here to get the documents
of the land he bought from us.

220
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,903
Can you get it from
the right bedside table in our room?

221
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,989
Really, you're ordering me around?

222
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,958
Sure.

223
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,436
Miss.

224
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,813
What is that you're carrying?

225
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,194
Meding, please stay outside with…

226
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,322
Papa?

227
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,074
What is she doing here?

228
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,911
Why is she here?

229
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,589
Papa?

230
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,925
Is she going to stay here?

231
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,801
What about Mama?

232
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,847
Meding.

233
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,851
Bring her belongings to my office.

234
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,981
At that moment, I just wanted
the earth to swallow me.

235
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,869
Back then, I felt like I had no sibling.

236
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,415
Or even friends who could shield me
from the danger I was about to face.

237
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,310
And that's when I saw him again.

238
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,397
My defender.

239
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,047
Hiroshi!

240
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,248
Let's talk later.

241
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,916
We have guests.

242
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,141
Thank you.

243
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,310
Hiroshi.

244
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,979
Say your goodbyes.

245
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,481
Yes, Father.

246
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,414
-It's a pleasure to see you.
-Thank you very much.

247
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,644
Now, we can talk.

248
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,315
Why did you bring
your bastard child here to my house?

249
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,246
COMING UP

250
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,789
Juan reminds me of you, Adelina.

251
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,588
Especially when you were brought
to someone else's home.

252
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,298
I am warning you.

253
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,009
Love and take good care of my sister.

254
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,053
And don't let your family abuse her.

255
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,097
You are just like your mother.

256
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,850
You steal things that are not yours.

257
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,186
You are so evil!

258
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,312
What did you say?

259
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,938
-You have such a foul mouth!
-I'm sorry…

260
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,273
-Can't you shut up…
-Adelina!

261
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,319
Eduardo, don't!

262
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,452
