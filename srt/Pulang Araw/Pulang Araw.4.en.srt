1
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,125
Where did the two children go

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,544
and why did you let them leave?

3
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,339
I'm sure this is all
your bastard daughter's fault.

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,302
Now do you understand
why I don't want her here?

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,845
Enough, Carmela.

6
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,181
Let's not argue about this anymore.

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,600
They're back.

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,812
Adelina. Teresita.

9
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,400
Where did the two of you go?

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,861
We were worried sick.

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,702
My apologies, señor.

12
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,081
The two thought to go on a walk.

13
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,712
Teresita.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,217
Next time, tell your mother
whenever you're going out.

15
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,136
So we won't have to worry.

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
But…

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,224
I'm glad.

18
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,810
You two seem like you're getting along.

19
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,855
Very well.

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,440
Go wash up.

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,943
And get changed.

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,624
Why are you looking at me like that?

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,733
Meding, get me a glass of water.

24
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,026
Let me.

25
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,997
Here you go, señorita.

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,675
Even if you wish to serve me,
I will never accept you.

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
Because you are…

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,433
a bastard.

29
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,522
Meding, take my glass of water to my room.

30
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,485
Tasyo!

31
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,282
Tasyo, what are you doing here?

32
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,992
I don't want to go home yet.

33
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,786
The constables are still there.

34
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,415
Why are they at your house?

35
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,127
They want to arrest my father.

36
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,049
They said my father was an insurgent
against the Americans.

37
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,136
Oh, no! Why is he fighting against them?

38
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:27,976
My father said that the Americans
are not really helping our country.

39
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,354
They're only helping
the rich and themselves.

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,149
While poor people like us are still poor.

41
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,446
Maybe your father is right,
especially since Sir is a bad person.

42
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,574
Who's "Sir"?

43
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,485
Hey! Look who finally decided
to come home.

44
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,405
Sorry, Uncle.

45
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,495
Merese. That's what naughty children get.

46
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,290
Clean the pigsty out back.

47
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,668
You can't sleep
until you're done with your chores.

48
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,336
Yes, Uncle.

49
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:47,013
When I grow up,
I want to become an insurgent too.

50
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,850
I will punish all our oppressors.

51
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,148
Why did you bring that child back here?

52
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,360
Mama, please don't scold me.

53
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,866
I didn't think
that she would come home with me.

54
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,454
Mr. Juanito wouldn't go home without her.

55
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,085
And Papa told our driver
to keep an eye on Adelina.

56
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,505
Your father really wants to hurt me.

57
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,801
But, Mama…

58
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,097
I feel bad for Adelina and her brother.

59
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,142
Why are you defending those vagrants, huh?

60
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,185
Just, please…

61
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,397
do not get too close to them.

62
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,817
Especially that bastard.

63
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,778
So she'll choose to leave on her own.

64
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,354
Adelina.

65
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,858
Don't just stand there. Come, child.

66
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,403
Don't be shy.

67
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,329
You're really amazing, Uncle.

68
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:41,711
Doesn't your sister
sing and play the piano well too?

69
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,922
Yes, Uncle.

70
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,508
She's really talented.

71
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,680
Teresita, my dear.

72
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,640
Where are you going?

73
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,352
I want to rest now, Papa.

74
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,064
Can't you stay a little longer?

75
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,151
I want to spend some time
with you and your sister.

76
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,361
Go on. Sit down.

77
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm not done rehearsing yet.

78
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,473
Your big sister takes after me.

79
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,685
She is truly very talented.

80
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,777
Come. Sit beside me.

81
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,657
How about you?

82
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,245
I wonder what you got from me.

83
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,924
Why won't you answer me, my dear?

84
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,764
Like you, I also like dancing.

85
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,143
Though I'm not as good as you.

86
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:28,568
And I'm often chosen
to lead our performances in class.

87
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Is that so?

88
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,324
Then there is no doubt
that you are my daughter.

89
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,161
But you are much more
knowledgeable than I am.

90
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,416
Especially since I don't know…

91
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,045
What do you call the dance
you were performing, Dad?

92
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,674
Don't worry.

93
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:58,431
Your Mama Carmela
went out to visit her friends.

94
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,849
She's not here.

95
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,435
So you can call me "Dad" all you want.

96
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,023
It's a good thing she's not here.

97
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,693
Or else, she's going to scold me again.

98
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,362
There's no doubt about that.

99
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,704
Tap dance. That's what I perform.

100
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,331
Tap dance?

101
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,376
Don't you know what tap dance is, Adelina?

102
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,545
To tell you the truth,

103
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:35,968
the first time I saw it
was when Dad was dancing it on stage.

104
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,807
In that case,
welcome to the world of tap dancing.

105
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,154
Come here, you two. Come.

106
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,914
Tap dancing is a type of dance

107
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:10,002
that combines rhythm and expression

108
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:15,049
in a symphony of sound and movement.

109
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,134
Watch this.

110
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:32,274
Your feet aren't just for walking.

111
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,361
You can also use them as an instrument,

112
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:42,118
much like playing the piano,
guitar, or drums.

113
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,391
Right?

114
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,395
Dad, I feel like my feet want to sing!

115
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,604
You're right, dear.

116
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:17,653
As a tap dancer,
you are not just a dancer.

117
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,950
You're also a musician.

118
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,162
Both of you, listen to me.

119
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,959
Feel the music in your hearts,

120
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,964
and let the rhythm guide you.

121
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,036
Mama!

122
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,373
Mama.

123
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,671
I just stepped out for a while
and you've already become…

124
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,965
friends with that bastard.

125
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,533
Mama.

126
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:14,121
I understand how you feel,
but I must admit…

127
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,834
I feel bad whenever I ignore Adelina.

128
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,170
Forgive me, but…

129
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:26,008
I don't think I can be cruel
to my own sister, Mama.

130
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,514
You're telling our daughter
to stay away from Adelina?

131
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,891
Have you no shame?

132
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,896
You're teaching our daughter
to be cruel to other people.

133
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,272
And what about you, Julio?

134
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,900
What do you know about decency?

135
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,404
You're the one who was unfaithful
and had a child with another woman!

136
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,949
This discussion is over!

137
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,411
You won't hear anything from me.

138
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,831
But I swear, until the day I die,

139
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,251
I will never speak to you
and your bastard child again.

140
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,569
Mom.

141
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,824
I feel so guilty.

142
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,996
They're fighting because of me.

143
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,208
Why did you have to leave me so soon?

144
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,378
Mom…

145
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,550
Mom…

146
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,604
Wait, Adelina.

147
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,150
Why are you crying?

148
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,322
I was crying earlier too. Just like you.

149
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,327
Is it because
your mother and father fought again?

150
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm sorry, Teresita.

151
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,462
I understand if you won't
speak to me ever again.

152
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,051
I won't hold anything against you.

153
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,053
And your mom.

154
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:42,227
Can you embrace me
just like how you embraced your brother?

155
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:47,983
I want to know how it feels
to be embraced by a sibling.

156
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,086
Good morning, Mama!

157
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,546
Let's have breakfast.

158
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,423
You go ahead.

159
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,219
I don't want to share a table
with the daughter of Satan's whore.

160
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,121
Teresita. Adelina.

161
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,833
Pack your belongings.

162
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,210
We won't be coming home for a while.

163
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,463
Papa.

164
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,301
Wouldn't Mama hate us even more
if we did that?

165
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,386
Please don't make things worse, Dad.

166
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:45,809
Just try to calm her down
until she stops hating us.

167
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,829
Just do what I'm telling you. Right now.

168
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,418
Get in the car. Now.

169
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,688
There are so many.

170
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,316
Papa! Look!

171
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,027
There are so many butterflies
and dragonflies.

172
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,822
You're right, Teresita. It's amazing!

173
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,949
Dad, can we catch some?

174
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,119
All right. I'll come with you.

175
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,747
Ingo, please bring our belongings inside.

176
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,083
-Quickly, please.
-Let's go over there.

177
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,626
Sure! Dad!

178
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,593
-Dad!
-Papa…

179
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,251
Long live the Filipino people!

180
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,800
-Papa!
-Jose!

181
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,553
-Jose!
-Papa!

182
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,097
Papa!

183
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,601
-Papa!
-Jose!

184
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,852
Papa!

185
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,190
Jose!

186
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,985
What did you do?

187
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,738
Jose!

188
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,792
We're already looking into it.

189
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,878
We will investigate
this matter thoroughly.

190
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,254
I'm begging you.

191
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,714
Show some mercy.

192
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,343
I gave my whole life and heart to my art.

193
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,013
Have pity on me. Help me save the theater.

194
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,266
COMING UP

195
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,272
It's a hefty sum,
and I don't have that amount of money.

196
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,233
Hide here.

197
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,864
Eduardo, I think we're going to die here.

198
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,658
They have us surrounded.

199
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,161
Fortunato!
