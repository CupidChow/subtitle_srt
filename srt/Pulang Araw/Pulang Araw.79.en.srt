1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,210
Please be honest with me.

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,753
Where's Teresita?

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,132
-I don’t…
-I don’t believe you anymore.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,971
I'm passing these onto you and Julio.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,264
And Eduardo too.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,725
So he can help his fellow guerillas.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,601
Do you know a girl named "Teresita"?

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,395
Yes.

9
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,232
She's one of the women we met here.

10
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,527
-Where is she?
-I think she's in her room.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,906
-Teresita, are you there?
-Eduardo?

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,451
I won't say goodbye to your father.

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536
But you can't go out at this hour, señora.

14
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,497
I can't, I need to be somewhere.

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,166
I'll find Eduardo, Adelina.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,917
I can't stay much longer.

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,252
Will I see you again?

18
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,628
Where's Carmela?

19
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,506
She left immediately after we spoke.

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,217
-I have a favor to ask you.
-What is it, my friend?

21
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,677
I need to borrow your gun.

22
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,971
I know now where Teresita is.

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,975
It's time we attack the Colonel's garrison
and free Teresita from his grasp.

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,477
I heard Eduardo.

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,355
I really thought he came.

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,982
Where's Hiroshi?

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,318
He abandoned his post and his men.

28
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,612
Traitor!

29
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,115
We've been betrayed
by Hiroshi and his father!

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,076
Have our men look for him.

31
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,495
Arrest him at once.

32
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,624
And if he resists, kill him.

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:24,959
Am I clear?

34
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,586
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

35
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,756
PREVIOUSLY

36
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,753
Yamamoto!

37
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,797
Carry out my orders immediately.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,714
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,678
Colonel, there’s one more thing.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,015
Mrs. Borromeo has been requesting
for your presence outside.

41
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,562
Her again?

42
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,274
What does she want now?

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,777
Fine.

44
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:40,743
Just do as I instructed.

45
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,412
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,049
Kenji.

47
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,721
Hiroshi's still our childhood friend.

48
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,682
We’ve known his father
since we were young.

49
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,225
His father treated us like his sons.

50
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,645
You shouldn’t have reported them.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,898
You could’ve at least told me first.

52
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,651
Why?

53
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,947
Could you have prevented them

54
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:23,119
from betraying and abandoning
our country and army?

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,509
That's her, Eduardo.

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,389
She's my Auntie Amalia.

57
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,516
She’s your relative?

58
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,393
Yes, what happened?

59
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,063
We thought she was a Japanese soldier.

60
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,816
That's why Sir Jorge shot her.

61
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
Sir!

62
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,502
Why are you here again, Mrs. Borromeo?

63
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,799
Are you really not going to let me see
or speak to my daughter?

64
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,801
Please, Colonel.

65
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,178
I’ve been good to you.

66
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,722
I respected you.

67
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
-Please don't deny me--
-Go home.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,063
Auntie?

69
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,149
Auntie?

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,486
Auntie Amalia?

71
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,158
Auntie?

72
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,122
Don’t be afraid.

73
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,171
It’s me. Eduardo.

74
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,633
Eduardo?

75
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,885
Colonel, is this…

76
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,098
Is this how you repay me

77
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,104
for my loyalty to you and your army?

78
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,329
Is anyone else with you?

79
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,918
Wait there.

80
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,064
Thank goodness you’re safe.

81
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,901
I'd also like to apologize on behalf
of my comrades for hurting you.

82
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,571
But, Auntie, what happened?

83
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,907
Why are you wearing that uniform?

84
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,871
I escaped from the garrison
the Japanese kept us in.

85
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,254
Eduardo.

86
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,425
Every night…

87
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,845
Every night, they would rape us.

88
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,647
Where is Yoshida?

89
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,274
Call him for me.

90
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,486
I need to talk to him.

91
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,245
Teresita was there too.

92
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,331
You know her, don’t you?

93
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,918
-She’s the daughter…
-You came from the Colonel's garrison?

94
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,545
Yes.

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,800
-How did you know?
-Because I was there

96
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,470
and I talked to Teresita.

97
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,683
I just can't believe

98
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,146
you're a victim in this too.

99
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,124
Go to hell.

100
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,336
Sir…

101
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:48,176
This is what the Japanese soldiers
do to our women.

102
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,263
We can't turn our backs on them now.

103
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:56,434
I’ve ordered Minyong to gather
the other guerrillas we know.

104
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,270
We can't beat them alone.

105
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,024
We're going to need help
from the other groups.

106
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,486
All we have to do is wait, Eduardo.

107
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,239
We'll attack those bastards
as soon as our brothers get here.

108
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,301
Lauro!

109
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,948
I regret…

110
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:59,455
the day I accepted
this so-called friendship!

111
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,834
They were all right!

112
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:12,218
No foreigner will ever love our country!

113
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,096
Die!

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,015
I pray you all die!

115
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,295
Are you sure this is their hideout?

116
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,088
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,992
Why is no one here?

118
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,342
I think they moved elsewhere, Eduardo.

119
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,361
Teresita!

120
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
Colonel, good morning.

121
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,983
Good morning.

122
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,074
What happened to you? Why are you injured?

123
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
Don't ask any more questions.

124
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,330
Bring the women down!

125
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,040
Yes, sir!

126
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:15,234
Welcome to your new home, Teresita.

127
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,486
Why did you move us here?

128
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,364
Too many women have escaped.

129
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,118
They might report us to our enemies.

130
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:30,249
It's no longer safe for us to stay
in that garrison anymore.

131
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,918
Take these women inside!

132
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,128
-Yes, sir!
-Go!

133
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,798
Get inside! Inside now!

134
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,633
Faster!

135
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,808
-Let's go, Alicia.
-I have bad news to tell you, Teresita.

136
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,314
What is it?

137
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,696
Your mother is gone.

138
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,990
She has passed away.

139
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,799
How did my mother die?

140
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,928
What was the cause of her death?

141
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,766
She was killed by your people

142
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,851
who were angry with her

143
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,939
because she was my close friend.

144
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,816
Now do you understand?

145
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,113
Filipinos are not good people.

146
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,699
Because like mine,

147
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,121
your mother was killed by them too.

148
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,167
Yuta, where's my mother’s body?

149
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,586
I want to see her.

150
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,882
Yuta, please. Let me see my mother’s body.

151
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,637
I don't care
if you or your men come along.

152
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
I won't allow it.

153
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,394
Now get inside.

154
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,605
How can you be so cold?

155
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,402
She’s still my mother, Yuta!

156
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,992
I can’t believe
God created a monster like you!

157
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,579
Get inside right now!

158
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,376
Go! Get inside!

159
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
Go!

160
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,059
We failed to rescue Teresita.

161
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,522
We weren’t able to catch them
back at the garrison.

162
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,193
Looks like the devil outsmarted us again.

163
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,742
Now I don't know
if I should be happy that I survived

164
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:15,789
while my companions continue to suffer.

165
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,542
I will find them, Auntie.

166
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,212
No matter where they take them.

167
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,261
I'll make sure to kill Saitoh myself
for all the atrocities he has done.

168
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
As soon as I get better,

169
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,227
I'll look for Luisa and Lauro.

170
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,400
When I find them, I'll take them here.

171
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,404
We'll join you, Eduardo.

172
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,119
I want to help you search and rescue

173
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,207
those women they've raped.

174
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,627
Uncle Lauro is out of the picture.

175
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,548
He has sided with the enemy.

176
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:12,137
He has sold his own soul to that devil.

177
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,476
He already turned his back on us.

178
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,187
Is that true, Eduardo?

179
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,189
He's after me…

180
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,778
and all the guerrillas
that are against his master.

181
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,451
Your husband is no longer one of us.

182
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,746
If what you are saying is true…

183
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,882
it pains me

184
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,137
that my own husband has sided with the men

185
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:59,059
who raped me very single night.

186
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,128
I hope we finally defeat our enemies

187
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:34,428
so that women like your Auntie Amalia
can find peace.

188
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,682
That counts us too.

189
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,522
Do you still remember what you promised?

190
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:50,152
That we’d play baseball after the war?

191
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,072
Let’s do that, Eduardo.

192
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,032
Everyone can join.

193
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,993
Men or women, young or old,

194
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,536
we'll include everyone.

195
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,247
It'll be the end of the war.

196
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,227
1942 has just started,

197
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,564
but we've already faced
numerous painful events at the onset.

198
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,823
Let us through.

199
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,786
Adelina, there she is.

200
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,545
I saw them earlier when I passed by,
so I went to pick you up immediately.

201
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,437
WARNING, DON'T BE A TRAITOR
LIKE MRS. CARMELA BORROMEO…

202
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,244
These are very unfortunate events
in our family’s life

203
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,125
and it coincided with the war
that was happening in our country,

204
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,043
which only got worse

205
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,713
after General Douglas MacArthur
left the Philippines.

206
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,969
In the following months, we've suffered
even greater defeat and hardship.

207
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,183
On the same day Bataan fell,

208
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,936
the notorious Death March began.

209
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,690
Thousands of soldiers died
because of fatigue,

210
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,442
thirst, hunger, and disease.

211
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,112
Or they were simply killed by our enemies.

212
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:03,368
The Japanese Imperial Army
forced more or less 60,000

213
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,664
to 80,000 Filipino and American soldiers

214
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,585
to march from Mariveles, Bataan
to Camp O’Donell in Capas, Tarlac.

215
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,128
Then the enemy proceeded

216
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,717
to strengthen their attacks on Corregidor,
the country’s last defense.

217
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,010
The battle didn’t last long.

218
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,348
Corregidor also fell
to the Land of the Rising Sun.

219
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,392
Japan had completely defeated America.

220
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,353
But they haven't defeated the Filipinos

221
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,939
who continued to fight for our motherland.

222
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
Mario?

223
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,552
Eduardo…

224
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,736
Despite being abandoned by the Americans,
the Filipinos kept fighting.

225
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,282
Armies who opposed the Japanese
continued to increase in number.

226
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,095
For each Filipino they kill,

227
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,516
the enemies just keep
profaning their bodies.

228
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,608
Hey, look!

229
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,194
-I’m rich!
-Me too!

230
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,410
Blood and tears flooded
the Pearl of the Orient.

231
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:14,207
Starvation was rampant,
especially in Manila.

232
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,794
To alleviate our sorrows and fears,

233
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,506
vaudeville continued
to give hope to the people.

234
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,550
You’re from the Philippines, Tuging.

235
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,510
Where else?

236
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,096
Wrong!

237
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,599
I’m not from here.

238
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,560
Wait.

239
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,732
Are you…

240
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
Sir Arturo?

241
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,364
Have you returned from America?

242
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,868
That’s not me!

243
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,043
The theater also served as a secret office

244
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:03,006
and a hideout for spies like me
who continue to help the guerillas.

245
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,813
Ouch! Ouch!

246
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,732
Quit it, Puging! You’re hurting me!

247
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,609
Unbelievable.

248
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,153
I really don’t know where you’re from.

249
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,613
I'm not who you think I am.

250
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,989
Still don't believe me?

251
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,787
Look!

252
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,290
Well?

253
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,668
Are you stupid?

254
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,963
Can you guess now?

255
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,259
I know where you’re from!

256
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,387
From Japan!

257
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,029
Even if Teresita is gone,

258
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,117
I'm still going to fight
for our country and for our people.

259
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,124
If you say no, I won’t think twice

260
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,043
about handing her over
to my soldiers tonight.

261
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,055
It seems like you don’t know
your employees very well.

262
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,059
It has come to our attention
that one of your people is a spy.

263
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,519
-What's that?
-A Makapili.

264
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,106
They're traitors
who report to the enemies.

265
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,399
COMING UP

266
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,281
