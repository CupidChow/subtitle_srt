1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,878
<i>You need to leave here, save yourself.</i>

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,172
If we succeed, you’ll be free.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>But if not…</i>

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,676
<i>There are bombs planted in the room!</i>

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,136
Someone here wants to kill us!

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,263
<i>Close all the doors!</i>

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>And seal off the entire venue!</i>

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,560
Don't you dare betray those who fight

9
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:24,983
for the oppressed men and women
under the rule of your disgusting master.

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,944
- This might be our end.
- They’re over here!

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,738
<i>Don't you recognize me, my friend?</i>

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,073
How can you just show up here
after you abandoned me?

13
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,367
<i>Good thing I managed to get out.</i>

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,412
But Adelina and Josefa are still inside.

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>Adelina won't make it out alive, anyway.</i>

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,504
Were you the ones who planted the bombs?

17
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,506
I want to learn how to shoot.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,425
You, come here! Now!

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,552
<i>I'm not an enemy.</i>

20
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>- You're Japanese?</i>
- Yes.

21
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,474
<i>The man inside my cart is my father.</i>

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,517
Die, all of you!

23
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,270
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,230
I know a way to distract them.

25
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>Draw your weapons!</i>

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>Defend this building!</i>

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>2145.</i>

28
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,615
<i>That's the telephone number
of Yuta's room.</i>

29
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>That number is the only way for you
to reach me.</i>

30
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>Captain, there's one missing!</i>

31
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,662
<i>One of them was still alive.</i>

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,372
<i>Find that clown!</i>

33
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>Captain, look at this!</i>

34
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,840
That bastard!

35
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,300
Sir!

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,053
Eduardo's back.

37
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,824
Uncle, who are they?

38
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,412
He's Tasyo, my best friend.

39
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,081
And this here is Miguel.

40
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,625
They're comrades.

41
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,378
Why did you bring them here?

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,214
What if they're enemies?

43
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,966
We're Filipinos too.

44
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,260
Why would you say that?

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,807
Even our own people can betray us
and side with the enemies.

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,020
How can we be sure
that you're not one of them?

47
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,980
Didn’t you hear what I said?

48
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,066
Tasyo's my best friend.

49
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,944
I can assure you he won't betray us.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,450
You're getting out of line, Eduardo.

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,994
What do you want me to do?

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,038
Leave them there?

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,832
Their group was killed.

54
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,252
They have no one else to turn to.

55
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,212
So whether you like it or not,

56
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,798
from now on, they're one of us.

57
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,842
Juan.

58
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,929
Give them some food and water.

59
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,514
- Okay, Uncle.
- Thank you, Eduardo.

60
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,558
Please believe us.

61
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,354
We have no bad intentions
towards our people.

62
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,147
Come with me, Uncle Tasyo.

63
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,441
Let's grab a bite to eat.

64
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,985
You too, Pablo. Get some rest.

65
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,196
Thanks again for your help.

66
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,757
Stay here.

67
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,218
I’ll be right back.

68
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,897
Put the gun down, sir.

69
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,483
I don't want to hurt you.

70
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,778
You've been getting in my nerves, Eduardo!

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,322
Forgive me.

72
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,366
But if listened to you back then,

73
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,037
we wouldn't have secured
the weapons and jewelry we used

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,915
to buy our food and necessities.

75
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,042
If I had no conscience,

76
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,672
I wouldn’t have freed the women
who were being abused and raped

77
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,132
by the Japanese!

78
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,800
If I obeyed your command,

79
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,678
I wouldn’t have found
Tasyo and Miguel alive!

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,513
So what are you angry about?

81
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,016
Don’t make me look like the villain here!

82
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,727
That's not what I'm trying to do.

83
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,979
All I’m saying is

84
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,023
you’re a terrible leader!

85
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
Put the gun down, sir.

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,077
We’re a team.

87
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,079
We're not your enemies.

88
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,666
You're no longer part of this group!

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,460
Now, get out of my face!

90
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,086
Why should I leave?

91
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,255
I've done so much for us.

92
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,549
You leave if that’s what you want!

93
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,926
You only care about your stupid pride!

94
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,532
A respectable leader

95
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,413
is someone brave enough
to face our battles!

96
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,501
We need someone to look out for our people

97
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,087
whether they're part of this group or not!

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,257
But you've shown me the complete opposite

99
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,845
and now I know
we can no longer trust you anymore!

100
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:34,060
So I will give you enough time to leave.

101
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,319
Captain, what's the status here?

102
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,782
Looks like you didn’t kill
all of them, Captain.

103
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,202
One of them was alive and got away.

104
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,800
Find that clown at once!

105
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,554
Let me do it.

106
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,305
<i>I want to learn how to shoot.</i>

107
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,016
Traitors like you
shouldn't be allowed to live!

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,852
Die, all of you!

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,110
Teresita wasn’t able to kill the clown.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,572
And that costume is the proof.

111
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,791
She didn’t hit the clown’s body.

112
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,337
Do you think Teresita did this on purpose?

113
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,339
Or not?

114
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,368
Whoever respects this man may follow him

115
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,413
despite his betrayal within our comradery.

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,040
Stand up.

117
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,416
Stand up!

118
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,008
I’ll give you five seconds.

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,677
You must be out of here by then.

120
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,431
One!

121
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,642
Who’s coming with me?

122
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,809
Two!

123
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,228
I will!

124
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,689
Three!

125
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,982
Who else?

126
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,401
Who’s coming with me?

127
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,445
You ungrateful bastards!

128
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,447
Who else is coming with me?

129
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,366
Who?

130
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,742
Four!

131
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,829
Sir, I changed my mind.

132
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,873
Forgive me.

133
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,631
Looks like your time is up.

134
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,924
Now, get out!

135
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,386
Get out.

136
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,192
We’re not done yet, Eduardo.

137
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,511
Who's this?

138
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,722
Teresita?

139
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,474
God.

140
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,601
Adelina.

141
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,270
You're alive.

142
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,608
Forgive us, Eduardo.

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,777
Looks like we caused you more trouble.

144
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,904
It's your fault.

145
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,115
But his.

146
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,827
He was overcome by envy
and his lack of conviction.

147
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,831
Comrades!

148
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,542
Thank you.

149
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,463
Thank you for sticking by.

150
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,425
We recognize you as our leader
more than Sir Jorge.

151
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,637
- Long live Eduardo!
- Long live!

152
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,972
- Long live the group!
- Long live!

153
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,308
<i>Have you managed to escape?</i>

154
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,435
Yes, Teresita.

155
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,437
I did.

156
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,065
I'm safe now.

157
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,524
Thank you.

158
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,902
Thank God.

159
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,905
Now, it's your turn to save me.

160
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,369
Yuta is hiding me inside Fort Santiago.

161
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,205
I'm locked up in his place.

162
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,332
If you see Eduardo again,

163
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,167
whom we both know is still alive,

164
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,295
tell him where I am.

165
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,215
Okay, Teresita.

166
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,176
Don't worry, we'll do everything we can.

167
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,803
Thank you.

168
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,262
Thank you, Adelina.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,307
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we don't have time to celebrate.

170
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,187
From this night on,

171
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,401
our death sentences…

172
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,697
are hanging over our heads.

173
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,579
- I have to go.
- All right.

174
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,123
Look after yourself.

175
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,573
Ouch! What did I do?

176
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,951
The clown you shot earlier
was still alive.

177
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,292
You didn't intend to kill her
in the first place.

178
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,711
Tell me who she was?

179
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:40,259
Why did you help a criminal
who wanted to kill us?

180
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,178
I don't know her, Yuta!

181
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
I didn't know she was still alive.

182
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,975
Ouch! Yuta!

183
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,477
You're hurting me! Let go!

184
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,730
Was that Adelina?

185
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,235
Was your sister the clown all along?

186
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,031
Tell me…

187
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,242
or I'll kill you!

188
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,502
I don't know anything
about what you're accusing me of.

189
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,381
If you don't believe me,
why don't you just kill me?

190
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,221
I'm sick of being with you anyway!

191
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:32,144
Once I prove that I was right all along,

192
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,733
I won't hesitate to punish you!

193
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,621
Captain, my apologies.
But someone is looking for you.

194
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,706
It is of great importance.

195
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,043
Who is it?

196
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,670
Let him in!

197
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,688
What do you want, Lauro?

198
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:23,153
Sir Master, I have come to inform you
that Eduardo Dela Cruz isn't dead.

199
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,364
He’s still alive.

200
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,784
I talked to him the other day
that's why I know this.

201
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,414
He's still out there
fighting alongside my wife.

202
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,589
Every moment counts

203
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,799
because it means either death…

204
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,845
or even greater suffering for our people.

205
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,849
What are you waiting for?

206
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,642
Kill them all!

207
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,147
<i>We'll go to every town and state.</i>

208
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,653
<i>We'll free the oppressed
and kill their captors!</i>

209
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,499
Go. Untie them!

210
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,376
Thank you, sir.

211
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,172
Go home to your families.

212
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,175
- Thank you…
- Thank you very much, sir!

213
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,509
Thank you.

214
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>We'll also attack every garrison
in the area.</i>

215
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,353
<i>We'll take their weapons…</i>

216
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,653
<i>and release the men and women
they've captured.</i>

217
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,490
That is our mission

218
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,828
because our people
have no one else to rely on.

219
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,916
They're counting on us to save them
with our weapons.

220
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,630
We can no longer wait for the Americans.

221
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,759
Our salvation is no longer in their hands,

222
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,681
but it is in ours as Filipinos.

223
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,642
- For freedom!
- For freedom!

224
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,269
- For the country!
- For the country!

225
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,022
- For freedom!
- For freedom!

226
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,150
- For the country!
- For the country!

227
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,944
Where is he?

228
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,281
Where's Eduardo Dela Cruz?

229
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,036
My wife, Amalia, knows where he is.

230
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,956
And where is your wife?

231
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,083
She's back at home.

232
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,335
Uncle?

233
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,634
Uncle, aren't you ashamed?

234
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,138
You're betraying your own wife!

235
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,227
Do you even know
how much she suffered just to get to you?

236
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,604
Be quiet, Teresita!

237
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,441
- Nakamura!
- Yes, sir!

238
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,860
Take Lauro with you.

239
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:12,531
Arrest Amalia immediately
and bring her to me!

240
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,658
It will be done, Colonel.

241
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,952
Lauro, let's go.

242
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,044
Yuta.

243
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,504
Whatever it is you're planning to do
with my Aunt Amalia,

244
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,381
please stop.

245
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,802
Your soldiers already took
everything from her.

246
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,556
So don’t make her suffer anymore.

247
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,273
Don’t pretend that you care for Amalia.

248
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,196
I know you still love Eduardo to this day.

249
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,284
That's why I want to torment him.

250
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,496
I want to ruin his life

251
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,250
before I finally kill him.

252
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,462
This is no longer about Eduardo!

253
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,007
It’s about your wicked conscience!

254
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,595
You’re blind, Yuta.

255
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,390
You’re blinded by your own hatred!

256
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,436
You’re no longer human.

257
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,356
You’re a monster!

258
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,783
You dare raise your hand
against your husband?

259
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,160
Even if you kill me,

260
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,496
Eduardo, and Aunt Amalia all together,

261
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:48,001
there are others who are no longer afraid
of monsters like you!

262
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,799
You'll be held accountable
by the honorable children of this nation!

263
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,300
The hell I care.

264
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,055
I will crush all of you.

265
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,086
I didn't know the gravity
of Teresita's situation.

266
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,840
I’ve heard many stories.

267
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,719
They're not just stripped
of their dignity,

268
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,722
but also their entire being.

269
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,474
Just like…

270
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,104
what they did to us
when we were still prisoners.

271
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,651
Women like Teresita
are no different from our country.

272
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,405
Imprisoned.

273
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,948
Yuta!

274
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,991
Yuta, open the door!

275
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,784
Yuta!

276
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,162
Oppressed.

277
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,170
Stripped of their dignity.

278
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,845
It's time we set our country free, Tasyo.

279
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,100
We’ll make our oppressors pay
for what they've done.

280
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,062
I’m with you on that.

281
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,148
But this time,

282
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,235
we'll face this together.

283
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,612
No one will be left behind.

284
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>Who's he?</i>

285
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,168
Your father.

286
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,838
<i>Was it the Japanese?
Did they kill my father?</i>

287
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,590
Monsters!

288
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,468
<i>Hey, you.</i>

289
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,303
<i>Come with us.</i>

290
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,304
Don’t fight back!

291
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
<i>Lower your weapons!</i>

292
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,643
I will help you find your daughter

293
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:15,691
if you tell me the whereabouts
of Eduardo Dela Cruz.

294
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,401
COMING UP

295
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,031
