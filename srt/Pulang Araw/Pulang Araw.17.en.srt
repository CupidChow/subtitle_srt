1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
This is a message from Colonel Arata.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,005
He is asking you to make
connections with the locals.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,223
We need her and her family.

4
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,726
They can help with our mission.

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,187
Hiroshi's back and we met.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,523
I'm sure you'll see him soon.

7
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,859
I hope so.
So us friends can be together again.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,654
You made arrangements to marry off
our daughter to those Japanese?

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,782
His family is well-off.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,325
Don't you want that for her?

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,243
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,079
Haven't you noticed my appearance?

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,957
The people you paid off did this to me!

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,501
When you choose someone to marry,

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,005
make sure that he loves you
and he can take care of you.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,799
Get some rest. We're leaving early
to visit the Borromeos.

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,802
I'm glad. It would be nice
to see my old friends again.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,431
I am against your agreement
with the Tanakas.

19
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:00,060
-You will only embarrass yourself.
-We will see about that.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,938
PREVIOUSLY

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,321
Teresita, I noticed something earlier.

22
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,449
What was that look
between you and Eduardo?

23
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,994
What look are you talking about?

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,789
You can't fool me, Teresita.

25
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,083
I'm not blind.

26
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,670
What happened
when you two left me earlier?

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,923
Let's talk about that later, Adelina.

28
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,759
I need to deal with Mama first.

29
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,355
Could my hunch be right?

30
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,775
Or was it just my wild imagination?

31
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,947
I just have a wild imagination.

32
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,379
I've always wondered why my daughter
wanted to be friends with you.

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,132
You are such an uncouth person.

34
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,677
You are even beneath
the spit of lowly people!

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,721
Hey.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,348
Why aren't you asleep yet?

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,482
I'm tired of being ignorant
and poor, Tasyo.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,194
Of being scorned,

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,573
humiliated,

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,704
ignored, and stripped of dignity.

41
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,706
I've had enough.

42
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,003
Did something happen to make you say this?

43
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,172
Tell me, what's going on?

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,801
All I'm saying is,
I'm fed up with this kind of life.

45
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:40,929
Life.

46
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,890
You know, Eduardo,

47
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,684
there's nothing we can do about this life.

48
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,022
The fact is, we're poor
and society will always look down on us.

49
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,065
That's just how it is.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,901
But…

51
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,736
you shouldn't worry about it

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,074
because Adelina has a great chance
to become wealthy and famous

53
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,202
now that she's doing vaudeville, right?

54
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,038
Who knows.

55
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,582
Besides, I'm sure your sister
won't abandon you.

56
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,751
I don't want to depend on her, Tasyo.

57
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,879
I want to improve my life
through my own efforts.

58
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,089
Do you understand?

59
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,383
Yes, but how?

60
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,968
Tell me, how?

61
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,429
How can we rise from poverty
through mere servitude?

62
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,933
That's impossible.

63
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,727
You know, I think you should just rest.

64
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,981
Sleep makes all the difference.

65
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,029
Mama!

66
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,576
How can your conscience bear
to order people to hurt someone?

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,955
What is this about, Teresita?

68
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,832
Don't deny it, Mama!

69
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,376
I overheard your conversation
with Eduardo.

70
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,295
Leave him and Adelina alone,

71
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,506
and don't have Eduardo beaten up again

72
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,801
unless you want me
to disown you as my mother!

73
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,477
If you keep talking to me this way,

74
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,024
it just proves that I must
keep you away from those two.

75
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,652
Forgive me, Mama.

76
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,573
But I'll only feel resentment towards you

77
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,285
if you continue to oppress
Adelina and Eduardo.

78
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,292
Teresita!

79
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,441
Teresita.

80
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,152
Why did you come back?

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,038
Did you forget something?

82
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,499
What is it? I'll get it inside.

83
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,503
I just feel guilty
about what happened to you, Eduardo.

84
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,925
On behalf of my mama,
I apologize for anything she said and did.

85
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,679
And thank you,

86
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,849
because, despite everything,

87
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,518
you never sought revenge.

88
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,064
You're very kind.

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,068
How did you find out about it?

90
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,487
It doesn't matter, Eduardo.

91
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,284
What's important is that, to me,
you are an honorable man.

92
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,038
So don't be ashamed

93
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,378
and never belittle yourself
even when others insult you.

94
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,258
Because not everyone

95
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,678
looks down on you.

96
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
Thank you.

97
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,101
I will do everything I can.

98
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,437
I will work hard and save up.

99
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:06,235
-I'll prove your mother wrong.
-You should study again, Eduardo.

100
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,324
Fulfill your dreams
from when we were children.

101
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,204
Didn't you want to be a doctor?

102
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,958
If you study well

103
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,462
and succeed in life,

104
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,757
you will prove to everyone,

105
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,679
not just my mother,
that they judged you wrongly.

106
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,100
Teresita, do you think
I can still do that?

107
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,270
I'm old now.

108
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,732
Isn't it too late for me to do that?

109
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,838
Enough of this.

110
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,967
Let's just talk, you and me.

111
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,636
About what, Dad?

112
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,599
About you and your sister.

113
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,481
I've been away for a long time and…

114
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,694
I missed a lot of things.

115
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,489
Do you have boyfriends?

116
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,449
Suitors?

117
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,452
-Dad!
-What?

118
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,790
-My goodness!
-Well, do you?

119
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:50,590
When I was in intermediate school,
so many guys flirted with me.

120
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,466
And Teresita had even more!

121
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,387
But my brother shooed them all away.

122
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,101
We never really thought about romance

123
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,231
because what we really wanted ever since

124
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,442
was to do vaudeville.

125
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,239
But, Dad…

126
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,619
I fancy someone now.

127
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,955
And who is this man?

128
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,875
Adelina.

129
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,294
Don't entertain just anyone.

130
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,758
Bring that man to me.

131
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,968
I want to scrutinize him thoroughly.

132
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,180
Papa, how can I introduce him to you?

133
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,642
I'm not even sure
if he likes me the same way.

134
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,480
For now, we are just friends.

135
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,567
I need to find out first
if he loves me too.

136
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,945
Eduardo, no.

137
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,448
It's not too late.

138
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,826
Look at Adelina and I.

139
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,246
We're just starting in vaudeville.

140
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,708
Let's make our dreams happen together.

141
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:14,298
You should study again,
so none of us will be left behind.

142
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,386
Eduardo.

143
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,389
Catch up, okay?

144
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,849
I know you can do it.

145
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,565
I want you to reach your dreams.
I want to see you succeed one day.

146
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,491
Teresita.

147
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,624
If I go back to school,
will you wait for me?

148
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,010
Forget I asked.

149
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,722
-I know…
-I'll wait for you.

150
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,105
Really?

151
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,027
I'll wait for you no matter what happens.

152
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,952
You have given me courage.

153
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,581
Thank you, Teresita. I will do everything.

154
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,876
We will make our dreams come true.

155
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,671
I will fight in life. I promise.

156
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,306
You are a woman.

157
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,643
Don't just show interest in a man.

158
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,606
He might take advantage of you.

159
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,984
No, Dad. He is a gentleman.

160
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,653
And he's very kind, like you.

161
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,489
-Goodness, child.
-What?

162
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,823
This is trouble.

163
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:09,747
But he doesn't seem
to be a womanizer, Dad.

164
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,921
Just be careful.

165
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,673
Same goes for your sister.

166
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:25,888
Don't give your love to just any man.

167
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,644
I don't want you to get hurt.

168
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,938
I hate that the most.

169
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,233
"Julio and Carmela Borromeo."

170
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,029
And Teresita Borromeo?

171
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,699
Yes, Colonel.

172
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,827
Their family belongs to high society.

173
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,663
They can help us a lot.

174
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:37,960
How can you be sure
that these people will help us?

175
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,214
Because Teresita Borromeo
will soon be daughter-in-law.

176
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,092
She is marrying my son.

177
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,763
They won't have a choice
but to side with us and cooperate.

178
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,314
Long live the Emperor!

179
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,735
Long live! Long live! Long live!

180
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,294
You can't tickle me, I'm not ticklish.

181
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,343
I said, I'm not ticklish!

182
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,058
You're such a bother, Teresita!

183
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,686
You were already asleep last night.

184
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,232
We didn't get to talk.

185
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,276
I wanted to tell you something.

186
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,197
But don't tell this to anyone.

187
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,783
I don't want Mama to know this.

188
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,035
What is it?

189
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,038
I think Eduardo and I
are on the same page.

190
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,999
We already had an agreement last night.

191
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,544
My brother?

192
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,922
My goodness!

193
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,591
That was fast.

194
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,302
You don't seem happy.

195
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,554
Oh! Heavens, no.

196
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,224
I'm really happy for you, Teresita.

197
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,269
Especially since I know that Eduardo
has been admiring you for a long time.

198
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,023
But as for you…

199
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,442
I didn't know you liked him too.

200
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,573
No wonder you looked at
each other differently last night.

201
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,992
Is that what it means?

202
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,869
How delightful!

203
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,164
But this is all happening so fast.

204
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,751
I've liked him for a while now, Adelina.

205
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,880
But I kept it hidden.

206
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,508
Many things have happened,

207
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:54,388
that's when I realized
I want to give him my heart.

208
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,309
My golly! I'm sure that boy
must be so happy.

209
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,771
I'll talk to him later. Geez!

210
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,191
Just don't tell anyone about this, okay?

211
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,401
Yes.

212
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,319
About what?

213
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,617
Nothing, Mama.

214
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,624
Well, get dressed.
Our guests will be arriving shortly.

215
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,827
Why are you dressed like that?
Aren't you going to work?

216
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm going to the nearest university.

217
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,707
I just have something to ask them.

218
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,668
Tell our boss I won't be at work today.

219
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,711
I leave it to you.

220
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,673
Wait, what are you going to do
at the university?

221
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,803
I'll tell you all about it later.
I don't want to jinx it.

222
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,388
Just pray that I'll do well.

223
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,474
All right.

224
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,282
Eduardo?

225
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,701
You look swell!

226
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,164
I didn't know love could turn you
into such a decent person.

227
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,792
-Can you be quiet?
-What?

228
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,547
-There's no one around!
-Come here.

229
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,216
Did Teresita confess to you already?

230
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,928
Yes.

231
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,516
I can't believe she fell for you!

232
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,517
Really?

233
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,353
-What?
-Me? With my good looks?

234
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,896
-She won't fall for me?
-Ouch!

235
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,274
-Are you sure?
-Ouch! Eduardo, enough!

236
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,154
Really, huh?

237
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,283
-Really, huh?
-You are indeed very handsome, Eduardo.

238
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,035
You too.

239
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,123
I mean, you're beautiful.

240
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,082
So beautiful.

241
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,336
Don't be so rattled, Eduardo.
You're embarrassing me.

242
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,339
Handsome… Ouch!

243
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,677
Enough teasing me, Adelina.
It's getting annoying.

244
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,184
Let go!

245
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,904
Hiroshi?

246
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
-Adelina.
-Hiroshi.

247
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,992
How are you?

248
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,911
Do you still recognize us?

249
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,580
Teresita. Eduardo.

250
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,166
-Is it really you two?
-That's us.

251
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,376
Welcome back to the Philippines, friend.

252
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
Eduardo.

253
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,017
-How are you?
-I'm doing good.

254
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,527
-What is it now?
-Just like before!

255
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,488
Come on!

256
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,825
Finally! We're reunited again!

257
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,393
Goodness!

258
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,144
-What is this, Adelina?
-What?

259
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,580
Are you getting embarrassed now?

260
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,208
We are grown-ups now. Enough of this.

261
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,922
So, Hiroshi, do you still know
how to play baseball?

262
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,632
Wait a minute.

263
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,800
What happened to your face?

264
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,761
Did you get that from a game?

265
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,389
Or did you get into a fight?

266
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,810
It's a long story.

267
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,486
Let's go inside, Hiroshi.

268
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,700
Adelina.

269
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,118
Let's go?

270
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,413
Eduardo, come join us.

271
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,040
No, I have to be somewhere.

272
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,709
He's right.

273
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,212
Leave him be.
Teresita's mother might get upset.

274
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,756
Let's go.

275
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,183
Where are you off to, dressed like that?

276
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,101
Well…

277
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,690
I need to fulfill my promise
to a beautiful lady last night.

278
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,447
Whatever you say.

279
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,240
Just take care.

280
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,550
Why are you wearing those old clothes?

281
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,138
Why should I wear
something new and dashing

282
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,268
when I know I won't be happy with this?

283
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,189
Just don't get ahead of things.

284
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,949
Good morning.

285
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,704
-Good morning, Mr. Tanaka.
-Welcome back, Julio.

286
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,005
You're all grown up.

287
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,555
Please accept our gift.

288
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,100
Thank you, Mr. Tanaka. Thank you.

289
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,020
Let's go upstairs, so we can talk.

290
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,815
Let's clear things up.

291
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,442
Follow me.

292
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,406
Don't follow us.

293
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,117
Just stay here, Adelina.

294
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,413
-I'll stay here with…
-No.

295
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,457
I need you there. Let's go.

296
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:40,604
Mr. Tanaka, I think it's time to tell
the kids about our agreement.

297
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,314
What is this agreement?

298
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,234
I won't let my daughter marry
a man she doesn't love.

299
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,653
Here's a list of the documents
you will need.

300
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,573
When can I go back to enroll?

301
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,991
You must pass the test first.

302
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,368
God Almighty,
please help me pass this test.

303
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,455
This is for my future with Teresita.

304
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,666
COMING UP

305
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,463
In that case,
I won't agree to this wedding.

306
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,672
You've embarrassed us enough!

307
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,637
Mr. Tanaka! Hiroshi!

308
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,522
