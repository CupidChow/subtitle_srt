1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,419
<i>I’ll surrender.</i>

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,838
<i>Not just to free my sister.</i>

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>But to secure Yuta's demise.</i>

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>Take off your uniforms!</i>

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,553
This is for the all lives you took away!

6
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>My wife has decided to come back
to save Adelina Dela Cruz.</i>

7
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>As soon as she returns,
carry out my orders immediately.</i>

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>Kill Hiroshi Tanaka
and Adelina Dela Cruz all at once.</i>

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,984
<i>- Commander, there's a checkpoint.
- Don't be too obvious.</i>

10
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,736
Good morning. Where are you headed?

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>Did you take a wrong turn?
Why aren't you talking?</i>

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,782
- Where are we going?
<i>- To Adelina's cell.</i>

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>We will set them free.</i>

14
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>Colonel, I saw Captain Watanabe just now.</i>

15
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>He released Hiroshi Tanaka from his cell.</i>

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,043
<i>Where's Adelina?</i>

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>I don’t know. I didn't peek inside.</i>

18
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,716
You’re Filipinos!

20
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,014
PREVIOUSLY

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,808
Retreat! Retreat!

22
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>Akio, what about Adelina?</i>

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>We're caught. We need to leave now.</i>

24
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>There are too many checkpoints.</i>

25
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>We won't get through.</i>

26
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,903
<i>This is suicide, Eduardo.</i>

27
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,697
I can’t leave Adelina and Teresita behind.

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>You can back out if you want.</i>

29
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,076
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>He's already figured us out.</i>

31
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:18,912
<i>It's no use.</i>

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>Unless I show myself.</i>

33
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,999
- You must go without me, my friend.
- Akio.

34
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,462
Don't get yourself killed for me.

35
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,382
I've already accepted my fate.

36
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,724
Captain Watanabe is gone.

37
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,351
And so are the prisoners.

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,485
Go to our first hideout.

39
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,573
I left something for you in my old desk.

40
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,619
We can still escape, Akio.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,122
Let go of me.

42
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,125
Use that head of yours

43
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,086
if you want to survive.

44
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,719
Keep looking!

45
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,388
They haven't gotten far!

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,391
Find them!

47
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,410
Captain Watanabe.

48
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,872
Colonel.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,959
Were you looking for me?

50
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,721
I received a report

51
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:48,353
that you helped Hiroshi
and Adelina escape just now.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,606
Is this true?

53
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,193
And who could that liar be, Colonel?

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,198
Colonel, I wasn't lying!

55
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,451
I saw you!
I know you helped Tanaka escape!

56
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,063
Where is Hiroshi Tanaka?

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,322
Find him yourself.

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,367
Search the entire camp!

59
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,286
Find the prisoners!

60
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,495
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

61
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,595
Captain Watanabe.

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,056
What has gotten into you?

63
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,226
Why are you doing this?

64
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,688
He's also a traitor.

65
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,817
He ruined our mission.

66
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,113
You’re the one whole killed Colonel Arata.

67
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,907
Which makes you a traitor too.

68
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,085
Don’t make up stories.

69
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:43,051
I was loyal to our Colonel Arata…

70
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,137
back then.

71
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,432
You’re such a liar, Colonel.

72
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,312
And for that,

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,231
I will never honor you.

74
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,158
Captain, drop that gun right now!

75
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,536
Let him be.

76
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,291
He's doing what's best for him.

77
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,584
Saitoh.

78
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,296
I’m not like you.

79
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:27,762
I will die with honor.

80
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:35,186
My family back home will be proud of me.

81
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,030
What a stupid boy.

82
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,217
Where's Hiroshi Tanaka?

83
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,388
Have you found him?

84
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,224
Did he…

85
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,894
escape the camp?

86
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,815
Colonel, forgive us.

87
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,904
What about Adelina Dela Cruz?

88
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,906
Is she gone too?

89
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,076
You’re all useless!

90
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,621
Watanabe…

91
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,126
had you all tricked!

92
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,630
But, Colonel, the Captain
was also taken aback

93
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,843
when he saw the girls' empty cell.

94
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:54,140
If Watanabe didn’t help them escape,

95
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,977
then who did?

96
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
Forgive us.

97
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,232
We don’t know, Colonel.

98
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,074
Colonel, your wife has come back.

99
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,118
Bring her in!

100
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,637
Leave us.

101
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,556
I want to be alone with my wife.

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,807
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

103
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,316
I never agreed for you to hurt me.

104
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,071
Now, where's my sister?

105
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,073
Release her this instant.

106
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,033
There’s no need for that.

107
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:42,540
She has escaped just like Hiroshi.

108
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,213
How can I be sure
you're telling the truth?

109
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,011
Let me remind you, Teresita.

110
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,723
I'm the one you deceived.

111
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,228
You disobeyed me.

112
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,234
You made me look like a complete idiot.

113
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,240
Now, I won't let you escape again!

114
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,702
Not only will I imprison you here,

115
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:25,082
but I'll have my toughest soldiers
to guard you!

116
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,293
What are you doing?

117
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,283
Don’t scream if you don’t want to die.

118
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,869
Where's Colonel Saitoh?

119
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>That's a powerful poison for rats.</i>

120
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,217
It can also kill humans and other animals.

121
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,429
<i>That can kill you through your nose,
eyes, and body.</i>

122
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,061
Madam, where's my Colonel?

123
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,488
Sure, ma'am.

124
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
Colonel?

125
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,874
Colonel?

126
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,791
Colonel?

127
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,255
The Colonel is dying! Hurry up!

128
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,549
- Yes, sir!
- Take him to the infirmary!

129
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,682
Hurry.

130
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,595
- Teresita?
- Eduardo.

131
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,316
Thank God I got to see you again.

132
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,663
Eduardo.

133
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,709
I did something bad to Yuta.

134
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm sure his soldiers
will come looking for me.

135
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,012
Let's go.

136
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,518
Adelina?

137
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,229
Adelina!

138
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,900
Are you here?

139
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,033
Adelina!

140
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,333
Go to our first hideout.

141
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,796
I left something for you in my old desk.

142
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,933
You there!

143
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,352
Good job capturing Mrs. Saitoh!

144
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,079
What did you do to Colonel?

145
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,843
You scoundrel!

146
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,429
You're not Japanese!

147
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,185
My name is Eduardo Dela Cruz.

148
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,978
A true Filipino.

149
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,397
Let go of him right now!

150
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,276
Don't shoot or I'll kill your officer!

151
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,283
<i>Why did you help us escape?</i>

152
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,244
What do you want from us?

153
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,204
<i>The traitor is over here!</i>

154
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,705
Catch him!

155
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,500
<i>From now on, we'll split into two groups</i>

156
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,044
<i>so we can take down more enemies.</i>

157
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,922
We fight for our people and our nation!

158
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,590
- Long live!
- Long live!

159
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,384
<i>- Where are they headed?
- Where else?</i>

160
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,345
<i>They're looking for the Colonel's wife.</i>

161
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,389
Please help. I got away from the Japanese.

162
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,141
Please don’t send me back to them.

163
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,185
<i>Please, Sister. Don’t send me back!</i>

164
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,814
Adelina, someone broke in!

165
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,692
COMING UP

166
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,693
Hiroshi?

167
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,199
