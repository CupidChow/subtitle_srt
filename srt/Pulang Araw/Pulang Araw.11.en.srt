1
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,735
Don't worry, Adelina.

2
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,988
You're next.

3
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,364
Eduardo?

4
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,996
- Why did you follow me here?
- Why wouldn't I?

5
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,290
I can't just leave you like this.

6
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,753
That driver is a liar just like his boss.

7
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,632
They framed me so they could lock me up.

8
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,008
I know, Eduardo.

9
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,720
I believe you, but you
shouldn't stay here any longer.

10
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,849
That is, if the señora
would even let me leave.

11
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,103
I know a constable named Dado.

12
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,275
He's our childhood friend.
We used to bully you back then.

13
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,735
Let me talk to him. Maybe he can help us.

14
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,964
-Okay, Tasyo. Please hurry. -Of course.

15
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,828
This is great. Tasyo will help us, Eduardo.

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,206
See how hard it is to be poor?

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,585
We're so weak.

18
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,340
Adelina.

19
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,635
You have to promise me

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,347
you will work hard to be rich and famous,

21
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,476
so you won't ever be oppressed, got it?

22
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,607
I promise, Eduardo.

23
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,193
I'll work hard in my career.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,448
So when I become rich and famous,

25
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,077
I'll be the one to look after you.

26
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,623
I promise you.

27
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,605
I know Diosdado Ramos, but
he's no longer assigned here.

28
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,443
I heard he was sent to Clark, Pampanga.

29
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:01,491
Many American soldiers left their
camps and were sent to a war in Europe.

30
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,619
I think it's best for
you to look for a lawyer.

31
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,579
That would be better for your friend.

32
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,830
Okay, thank you.

33
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,253
Tasyo, I don't have
money to pay for a lawyer.

34
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,545
Me neither.

35
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,923
But…

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,387
But if memory serves me right,
your brother saved some money.

37
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,306
I think he kept it at the
very top of his wardrobe.

38
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,101
He hid it there. I saw it.

39
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,687
Do you want to use that?

40
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,150
I have a favor to ask. Take
care of my brother for me.

41
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
-Keep an eye on him. -Sure.

42
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,945
-I will find a way. -Okay.

43
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,871
Do you remember

44
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,083
when we used to have picnics
here when Mom was still alive?

45
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,460
Of course.

46
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,379
How could I forget, Eduardo?

47
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,303
We were happy back then, weren't we?

48
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,514
When Mom was still alive.

49
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,644
You know,

50
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,648
I hope this place doesn't change.

51
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,277
Unlike that field, where
we used to play baseball.

52
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,034
I hope this place stays the same,

53
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,913
so we can always have
somewhere to return to.

54
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm saving up, Adelina.

55
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,711
I'm saving up

56
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,925
so I can buy a piece of land here someday.

57
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,350
I want to build a house
we can call our own,

58
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,561
and start a family here.

59
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,521
What do you think?

60
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,276
You're thinking about that already?

61
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,613
You want to start a family? Wow!

62
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,575
That sounds like a great plan.

63
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,704
Can I have a small piece of land too?

64
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,582
I want to build my own hut.

65
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,875
Over there!

66
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
Don't be so greedy now.

67
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,300
You are full of nonsense.

68
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,384
What?

69
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,304
- Where did you get that idea?
- You said you wanted to start a family!

70
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,390
You didn't tell me about that before.

71
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,309
I didn't want to share that
to a chatterbox like you.

72
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,593
Señorita Teresita isn't here.

73
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,219
She just left.

74
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,763
I don't know where she went.

75
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,190
How about Señora Carmela?

76
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,902
Is she here? Can I speak to her?

77
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,658
Major Arata and I will
come to your house later.

78
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,246
You have to bring the
list you prepared tonight.

79
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,376
Understood, Mr. Akio.

80
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,257
My apologies. Someone is looking for you.

81
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,259
Who?

82
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,151
I have something important
to discuss with you,

83
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,487
but I didn't know you had a visitor.

84
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,324
He's about to leave,
anyway. Please come in.

85
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,622
Could you please leave us?

86
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,432
I'd like to revoke your agreement.

87
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,190
You want me to withdraw my
case against your brother?

88
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,151
Yes, señora.

89
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,989
My brother firmly denied the accusation.

90
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,784
And I know my brother, he doesn't lie.

91
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,164
And who is lying, me?

92
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,398
The deal has been finalized, and
I have urgent matters to attend to.

93
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,737
You may leave. You are wasting my time.

94
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,825
Señora, I am willing to do anything.
Just please, forgive my brother.

95
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,788
I'm begging you.

96
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,876
Please withdraw the case against him.

97
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,881
Señora, let's end this conflict please.

98
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,802
Very well.

99
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,392
I am not that apathetic.

100
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,937
I will withdraw my
case against your brother

101
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,690
under some conditions.

102
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm sure that, if Hiroshi were here,

103
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,987
he would understand us.

104
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,450
He knows how important that
land is to Adelina and me!

105
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,794
What is it, señora?

106
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,131
Stop seeing Teresita.

107
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,508
Leave this place.

108
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,470
You should never see my daughter again.

109
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,683
Both of you, stop communicating with her,

110
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,395
most especially you.

111
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,445
You will treat her as a
stranger, not a sister.

112
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,241
That's all you have to do, Adelina.

113
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,451
That is,

114
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,746
if you want your brother to be set free.

115
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,916
So choose.

116
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,423
What is more important to you?

117
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,885
Eduardo's freedom…

118
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:49,768
or my daughter, who's
under your bad influence?

119
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,879
Is this how low you
think of me and Eduardo?

120
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,220
Do you actually believe
we made her resent you?

121
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,350
Is why you want to
separate us from her, señora?

122
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,561
That doesn't matter!

123
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,481
Think about everything I've said,

124
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,943
and don't you dare tell
my daughter about this.

125
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,989
Otherwise, I will never withdraw
the case against your brother

126
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,159
if you cause any more conflict between us.

127
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,703
Do you understand?

128
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,582
I do.

129
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,787
Adelina, I'm glad we…

130
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,208
I'm glad you're here, I
have something to tell you.

131
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,383
Adelina, are you mad at me

132
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,346
because I didn't help your brother?

133
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,517
I just didn't know who
to believe between them.

134
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,523
You can't blame me, she's still my mother.

135
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,693
Adelina.

136
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,165
Adelina. Don't be mad at me, Adelina!

137
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,423
The lawyer I hired just
left. We bailed you out.

138
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,218
Where did you get the money?

139
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,850
I used your savings, Eduardo.

140
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,691
I know you were saving it for
yourself, but I had no other choice.

141
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,319
I'm sorry.

142
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,034
Don't cry.

143
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,558
Come in.

144
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,525
It's time to eat, señorita.

145
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,072
Just return it to the kitchen, Yolanda.

146
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,867
I lost my appetite.

147
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,039
You shouldn't skip meals.

148
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,041
You have to eat, okay?

149
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,503
I feel so down, Yolanda.

150
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,090
Adelina won't talk to me.

151
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
She's probably mad at me

152
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,887
because I didn't help her and Eduardo.

153
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:43,645
But how could I help them
if Eduardo really hurt Mama?

154
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,190
Why is he like that?

155
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,901
He hasn't changed.

156
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,030
Even my sister and I are
getting dragged into this.

157
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,326
Eduardo is innocent.

158
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,913
What do you mean he's innocent?

159
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,123
Never mind, señorita.

160
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,751
I don't want to talk about it

161
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,089
because your mother might punish me.

162
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,555
Do you know something, Yolanda?

163
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,645
Don't worry, Yolanda.

164
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,108
Whatever you tell me won't reach Mama.

165
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,447
It's not true that Eduardo hurt your Mama.

166
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,621
We were there. We saw
and heard what happened.

167
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,878
Eduardo just reprimanded
her. He never hit her.

168
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,552
Mama lied to me?

169
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,097
And Francisco too?

170
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,810
I don't understand.

171
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,813
Why would Mama do that
to me? What's her reason?

172
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:15,070
Because your mother wants to
keep you away from those two.

173
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,700
In fact, that was what
she asked from Adelina

174
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,952
in exchange for her brother's freedom.

175
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:29,334
That they sever their ties with you.

176
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,442
How can you stand
hurting other people, Mama?

177
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,323
What are you talking about, Teresita?

178
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,535
I know Eduardo is innocent, Mama.

179
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,498
You fabricated everything
to keep me away from them!

180
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,834
You dare accuse me of that?

181
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:16,673
Is Adelina badmouthing me? Is
she poisoning your mind again?

182
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,093
Adelina has nothing to do with this, Mama!

183
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,555
So don't you dare!

184
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,312
But like her, I can't bear
to stay in this house with you.

185
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,606
And what do you mean by that, Teresita?

186
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,857
Teresita!

187
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,569
Teresita!

188
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,088
Let's go, Eduardo. You
still have to pack your stuff.

189
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,183
You go ahead, I want to talk to Teresita.

190
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,727
What for?

191
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,938
Didn't we already agree

192
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,607
that we won't go near her or talk to her?

193
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,695
How would the señora withdraw her
complaint if we end our agreement?

194
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,738
Adelina, don't worry.

195
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,740
I won't let the señora see me.

196
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,786
I want to say goodbye to Teresita.

197
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,335
Wait, I'm coming with you.

198
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,219
Stop this, Teresita!

199
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,848
You are not leaving this house!

200
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,059
I'm old enough to make
my own decisions, Mama!

201
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,602
What? You're leaving me?

202
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,480
So you and Adelina can
do whatever you want?

203
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,357
You are not leaving.

204
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,693
- You are staying here!
- Stop it, Mama! Give it to me!

205
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,653
You are not leaving! Teresita!

206
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,574
You are not leaving, Teresita!

207
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,910
Are you going against me now
just because you're all grown up?

208
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,621
You are not leaving!
You will stay in my house!

209
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,040
-You are not leaving. -Mama!

210
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,416
-You are not… -Let me go!

211
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,939
-You are not leaving. -Mama, let go!

212
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,377
Teresita, you are not leaving.

213
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,547
-You're not leaving me. -Enough! Let me go!

214
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,674
- Mama, enough!
- You are not leaving! Don't leave…

215
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,261
Mama!

216
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,787
My God! What have I done?

217
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,247
Mama!

218
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,000
Mama!

219
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,627
Yolanda!

220
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,880
Yolanda, call Francisco!

221
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,260
Mama!

222
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,477
Yolanda!

223
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,064
Yolanda!

224
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,195
Teresita, the señora lost
consciousness because she hit her head.

225
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,822
She needs to be taken to the hospital.

226
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,574
Yolanda, call Francisco!

227
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,619
Señora, Francisco is
not here. He went home.

228
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,163
-Eduardo. -Mama.

229
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,582
Mama…

230
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,931
Teresita, let's go.

231
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,570
Let it go, Eduardo.

232
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,531
I'm sure you're more handsome

233
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,868
than the
rascal the señora wants for Teresita.

234
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,621
Why did they come here, Father?

235
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,206
Who was with Akio?

236
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,624
And what were you talking about?

237
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,959
Adelina!

238
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,086
Teresita!

239
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,024
The people will
finally watch Adelina and Teresita tomorrow.

240
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,967
We can't miss it.

241
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,218
What are your names?

242
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,971
She is Chinita and she is Morena.

243
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,099
We have an important guest

244
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,703
and he
wants to watch you two in particular.

245
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,936
COMING UP

246
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,775
