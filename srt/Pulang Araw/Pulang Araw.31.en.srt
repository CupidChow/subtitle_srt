1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,463
Due to our coordinated attacks yesterday,

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:10,093
the strength of the American Far East
Air Force was cut in half.

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,222
-Proceed with the land invasion.
-Yes, sir!

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,682
Lower the casket.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,183
Hold on!

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,435
Hiroshi?

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,603
Where will we hide him?

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,605
Don't we have a farm?

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,399
I don't want to leave Manila.

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,069
I need to know where they took
and imprisoned my father.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,030
-But how will you do that, Hiroshi?
-Where? How will you find him, Hiroshi?

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,490
We have many friends, mostly my father's.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,867
I'm sure they can help me.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,203
How did you know
this country would be in danger?

15
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,957
What is your connection with
your fellow Japanese invading our country?

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,041
I suspect

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,878
that Hiroshi's father is a Japanese spy.

18
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,590
We don't know each other, so who are you?

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,595
Hiroshi. He's the son of Chikara Tanaka,
one of our army's spies.

20
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,056
If Eduardo's suspicion is correct,

21
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,642
shouldn't you forget
about your feelings for Hiroshi?

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,894
I am Hiroshi Tanaka,

23
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:06,524
ready to offer my life and service
for the glory of Japan.

24
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,818
This isn't what I expected

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,280
for our first Christmas dinner
since my return.

26
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,241
What matters most
is that you're here with us again.

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,078
Merry Christmas, Papa, Mama.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,954
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,382
For you two.

30
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,885
Adelina said you had nothing
prepared for Christmas Eve.

31
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,971
Why bother celebrating?
We're in the middle of a war.

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,183
But still, thank you for the food.

33
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,645
Take those upstairs, Tasyo.
No need to wait for me.

34
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,773
We all know you just want
some time alone with Teresita.

35
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,150
-Shut up.
-Okay, fine.

36
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,820
Don't eat it all, okay?
Leave some for Eduardo.

37
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,779
Sure.

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,531
You shouldn't have troubled yourselves.

39
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,700
If Señora finds out,

40
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,743
she'll probably scold or insult me again.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,996
Don't worry, Eduardo.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,875
She's sound asleep. She won't know.

43
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,128
It's actually strange,

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,840
how she could sleep so peacefully
despite everything that's happening.

45
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,968
Have you heard the news?

46
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,472
General MacArthur
and his entire force have retreated.

47
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,310
They've left Manila.

48
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,812
Rumors say they headed to Bataan,

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,440
and, any day now,

50
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,445
Manila might be declared an open city.

51
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,866
What does that mean, Eduardo?

52
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,827
It means they can no longer defend Manila,

53
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:29,292
and our city will be free
for enemies to take over.

54
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,294
Merciful Lord.

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,298
What you said might actually come true.

56
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,260
The Japanese might succeed in
completely taking over us.

57
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,435
I can't even begin to imagine the horrors
that await us once that happens.

58
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,437
It'll be the same.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,941
We'll surely have to adapt to them.

60
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,610
Aren't we already used to
being conquered by foreigners?

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,447
But America's governance
was far more favorable.

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,449
Whether it's the Japanese
or the Americans,

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,661
what will foreign occupation bring us?

64
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,703
Eduardo.

65
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,124
You sounded like an insurgent just now.

66
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm just very frustrated.
It seems our lives have come to a halt.

67
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,006
Not long ago,
you two were performing at the theater

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,758
and I was just starting college.

69
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,802
We were full of dreams, and now…

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,514
Don't worry.

71
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,309
Everything will be all right.

72
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,311
Just have faith.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,695
Teresita is right.

74
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,781
The disturbance caused by the enemies

75
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,242
has become a common sight for everyone,

76
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,245
that's why our lives just went on.

77
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,414
Even in the world of vaudeville,

78
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,709
which reopened to momentarily sweep away

79
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,503
and calm the fears and worries
of the people.

80
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,839
That's my sister!

81
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,841
And I'm friends with that morena lady!

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,119
This was the course of our lives,

83
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,789
-That's my sister!
-even when the Japanese arrived

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,919
and attacked our beautiful
and prosperous city of Manila.

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,006
MANILA
DECEMBER 27, 1941

86
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,253
Colonel, our long-awaited
moment has finally come!

87
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,800
The key buildings in Manila
have been bombed.

88
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,343
Just as I anticipated.

89
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:32,767
We must celebrate this event,

90
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,771
for the whole city of Manila

91
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,984
will be soaked in blood.

92
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,835
Please don't come any closer.

93
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,795
-Please.
-Go home now, please!

94
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,213
Go home now!

95
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,097
Lord!

96
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,310
Why did you allow this cruelty to happen?

97
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,313
Why did you take my child?

98
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,570
That was the first time we truly felt

99
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,531
that the war had come to our land.

100
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,242
From that day on,

101
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,496
the lives of the Filipino people
will forever be changed.

102
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,123
Eduardo,

103
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,125
are we going to die too?

104
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,882
No. We'll survive this.

105
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,801
The two of you shouldn't worry.

106
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,223
Why are you still here?

107
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,808
Please, go home.

108
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,768
-Go home now, it's dangerous here.
-Please.

109
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,769
Let's go.

110
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,697
We already knew back then

111
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,449
that it was only a matter of time

112
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,577
before the Japanese
would completely take over Manila.

113
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,944
Hey, Yuki, wake up.

114
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,780
Where's the constabulary?

115
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,284
Ryo, they left in a hurry earlier.

116
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,912
I have no idea where they went.

117
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,332
Good! This is our chance
to get out of here.

118
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,583
He's right. Let's escape now!

119
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,628
Let's hurry while they're not here.

120
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,546
Wait a moment!

121
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,923
Let's not go out yet.

122
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,593
They might just be testing us.

123
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:19,892
If we try to escape,
they could be waiting for us outside.

124
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,522
That makes sense.
Comrades, let's stay here for now!

125
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,609
Ryo, where could the constabulary be?

126
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,486
Why did they leave us here?

127
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,239
Eduardo!

128
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,157
Tasyo!

129
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,534
Eduardo!

130
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,451
What is it, Dado?

131
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,289
They're here.
The Japanese have taken over Manila!

132
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,957
Come with me.

133
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,376
Why? Where are we going?

134
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,629
We'll go to the mountains and fight!
We cannot let them rule over us!

135
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,173
So grab all the weapons you have,

136
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,051
bolos, machetes, knives. Hurry!

137
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,887
Wait. Dado, hold on.

138
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,973
Let's first wait and see
what the Japanese will do

139
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,558
before we decide to fight.

140
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,476
What else is there to wait for, Eduardo?

141
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,312
Do you expect them to be fair to us?

142
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,731
Or maybe you're just scared?

143
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,068
I'm not scared, Dado.
If I go to the mountains now,

144
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,946
what will happen
to my sister and Teresita?

145
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,408
Am I supposed to leave them now,
when nothing is certain?

146
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,077
Are you going to place them
before your country?

147
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,247
Admit it, you're just scared!

148
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,670
Wait! Hey now, wait! Calm down.

149
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,174
We'll gain nothing
if we just fight blindly, Dado.

150
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,677
And understand this, Dado,
we're not cowards

151
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,721
because Eduardo and I are ready to fight!

152
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,723
But he's right.

153
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,686
I want to know what they plan to do
before we fight or do anything.

154
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,690
Do what you want.
I just know I'm going to fight.

155
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,660
Wait. Where are you going?

156
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,330
To Adelina's.
I'm going to check on their situation.

157
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,507
Make sure it's secured tightly
so it doesn't fall.

158
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,260
Francisco, make sure it's level.

159
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,018
Carmela!

160
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,729
What are you doing?

161
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,398
Why is it up there?

162
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,531
Mama, it's embarrassing to our neighbors.

163
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,158
They might think
we're supporting the enemies.

164
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,912
Should I still care
about what others think?

165
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:51,085
America has been defeated
and they're cowards for fleeing to Bataan!

166
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,962
We can't rely on them anymore.

167
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,923
There's a new country in charge,

168
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,094
so we need to show the Japanese
we can cooperate with them.

169
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,350
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

170
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,145
You know what they call you?

171
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,647
A traitor.

172
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,858
And an opportunist.

173
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,446
Are you referring to yourself?

174
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,534
In this household,
there's only one traitor I know

175
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,703
and it's not me.

176
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,502
Do whatever you want.

177
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,139
My daughters, let's go inside.

178
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,140
Dad, just a moment.

179
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,642
I need to talk to Eduardo.

180
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,242
Get inside, Teresita.

181
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,253
-Eduardo.
-Adelina.

182
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,589
Are you aware of what's happening?

183
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,341
Yes.

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,553
So as much as possible,
you and Teresita shouldn't go outside.

185
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,514
It's better to be careful.

186
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,939
But Eduardo,
isn't there still something good

187
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,732
about what's happening now?

188
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,444
Hiroshi can finally come out from hiding.

189
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,490
We'll see our friend again, right?

190
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,998
Our great Japanese Imperial Army!

191
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,732
Hiroshi, is that you?

192
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,321
It's him! What happened?

193
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,199
Our soldiers
have successfully entered Manila.

194
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,452
You are all free now.

195
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,873
Long live the Emperor!
Long live our Japanese Imperial Army!

196
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,207
-Long live!
-Long live!

197
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,166
Long live!

198
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,085
-Long live!
-Long live!

199
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,004
Long live!

200
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,171
-Long live!
-Long live!

201
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,357
Hiroshi.

202
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,570
Thank you very much
for coming back to free us.

203
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,369
But…

204
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,749
you're wearing the uniform of our army.

205
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,045
Have you become one of them too?

206
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,839
I don't want to
talk about it anymore, Ryo.

207
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,178
What are you waiting for?

208
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,183
Leave now, go home.

209
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,851
Thank you.

210
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,980
Yuki, let's go.

211
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,443
Hiroshi, you are a good person.

212
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,112
May you not be changed by anger

213
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,115
because of what happened to your family.

214
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,959
All the detained Japanese civilians
were released that same day…

215
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,469
including Hiroshi's father.

216
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,816
-Many imprisoned Japanese
-Hey!

217
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,110
were filled with resentment
for what happened to them,

218
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,822
so some of them took revenge
on those who were not their own.

219
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,628
How embarrassing!

220
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,550
Have a taste of your own medicine!

221
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,431
Let's go here! Come with us!

222
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,683
Though the war had just started,

223
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,936
many hearts
were already filled with hatred.

224
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,235
Shut up!

225
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,033
They caught and imprisoned
all the Americans, civilian or not,

226
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,329
along with their Filipino
constabularies and soldiers.

227
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,583
You are the enemy so it's just right

228
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,543
to kill all of you!

229
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,546
Just die!

230
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,633
Everything in this country
has truly changed.

231
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,319
May you two never forget to pray.

232
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,074
Eduardo, would you like to come with me
to Escolta or Sta. Cruz Plaza?

233
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,575
Come on, let's survey the area.

234
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,452
We might see some Japanese there.

235
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,124
Hey! Do you even hear me?

236
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,210
You're so deep in thought.

237
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,174
We don't know
when we'll die, right, Tasyo?

238
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,970
Do you think the Japanese
are going to hurt us too?

239
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,811
Do you think they're as ruthless
as the Americans who killed my father?

240
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,110
What do we even know?

241
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,905
Still…

242
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,243
I want to die without any secrets.

243
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,749
Where are you going?

244
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,057
Who are you?

245
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,393
Why are you in my house?

246
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,612
Don't you recognize me anymore, Father?

247
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,200
Hiroshi?

248
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,664
Father.

249
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,275
My God!

250
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,028
Eduardo.

251
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,864
-Sorry.
-It's you.

252
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:47,454
Sorry if I startled you
and sorry for daring to enter your room.

253
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,166
But this is the only way
I can talk to you, Teresita.

254
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,297
Is there something you need?

255
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,092
What is it?

256
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,519
Teresita, I don't want you to think
that I'm disrespectful.

257
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,607
But we don't know
what will happen to us, do we?

258
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,363
So I want you to know
that nothing has changed in me.

259
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,616
I still love you even now.

260
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,747
Here.

261
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,918
This rosary belonged to my mother.

262
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,424
I want to give it to you
so it can protect you.

263
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,599
Thank you very much.

264
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,896
But you don't have
to give this to me, Eduardo.

265
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,441
Take it.

266
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,360
Why can't you accept it, Teresita?

267
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,575
Is your heart no longer for me?

268
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,495
Has someone completely taken you away?

269
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,837
I already told you, didn't I?

270
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,591
I won't be marrying Hiroshi anymore.

271
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,430
So why would you think that?

272
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,600
But why won't you accept my gift?

273
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,061
Because I'm ashamed to take

274
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:40,776
the only remembrance
you have of your mother.

275
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,946
Perhaps your feelings for me
have disappeared completely.

276
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,076
Right. Who am I, anyway?

277
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,081
Apologies for wasting your time
with my confession, Teresita.

278
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,375
Just forget about this moment…

279
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,633
Why do you think that way, my love?

280
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,928
What did you say?

281
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,347
You love me?

282
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,560
I called the wedding off…

283
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,816
not only for Hiroshi and Adelina,

284
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,777
but also for you.

285
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,949
For the both of us.

286
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,243
So my love,

287
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,371
why are you wondering now?

288
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,001
You took away the fear and sorrow
in my heart, Teresita.

289
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,007
You've made me very happy
despite everything happening around us.

290
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,593
Thank you very much.

291
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,720
Thank you, Teresita.

292
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,307
Thank you, my love.

293
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,077
What are you doing, Teresita?

294
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,252
Manila Hotel.

295
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,671
The former home of
the American General MacArthur.

296
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,048
Who would have thought

297
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,217
this would fall into our hands?

298
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,638
I'm really glad that you want to serve now
and help our country.

299
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,726
I don't want to ruin what little happiness
my brother has, Tasyo.

300
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061
But I also know the señora
will do everything

301
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,230
to break my two siblings apart.

302
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,984
Good thing I came here.
I had a feeling you would be here.

303
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:50,864
It is time to clean up
all the filth and corruption

304
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,576
that America brought to this country.

305
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,078
It's a good thing our flag is already

306
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,999
at the house of the Borromeos.

307
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,667
Why did you go to the Tanakas?

308
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,544
We had an important discussion

309
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,296
about you and Hiroshi.

310
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,839
About your upcoming wedding.

311
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,300
COMING UP

312
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,224
