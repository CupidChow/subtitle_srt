1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,752
And what you said to me before is true.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,337
I have a duty to our country.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,424
I need to seek justice for my mother.

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,260
They want me to reopen this theater.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,220
They said they'll watch!

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,639
I really do not want to perform
for those soldiers.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,226
And I do not wish
to show my daughters to them.

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,729
There is a Japanese officer
who wishes to meet you.

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,439
They shouldn't find you attractive.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,776
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,320
Thank you for showing your talent, miss.

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,739
Long live the Philippines…

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,199
who is always being invaded by foreigners!

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,953
Death and defeat for all animals like you!

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,455
What did you say?

16
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,167
I know Eduardo. He is my childhood friend.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,043
So please leave him to me.

18
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,506
I will wait for you
and your daughters outside.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,096
And I hope you allow me to bring
you and your daughters home.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,058
I suspect he has his eyes on Teresita
so he's acting that way.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,267
I sensed that too.

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,144
But who are we to refuse

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,813
a Japanese officer
who is invading our country, huh?

24
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,400
Your people have brought us nothing
but war and invasion!

25
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,027
And you knew this all along!

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,239
That's why even your friendship
with us seems like a lie!

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,908
Hiroshi is a good person.

28
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,576
His country is still our enemy.

29
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,702
Prepare yourself.

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,120
Because, just like Dado,

31
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,914
we will soon be forced
to go to the mountains

32
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,249
and fight those damn Japanese.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,597
These are the criminals
you're looking for.

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,600
Open the cell door, please.

35
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,729
Why, sir? Are we being released?

36
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,025
Which one of you is Lauro?

37
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,863
That's me, sir. Who are you?

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,460
I am the son
of the poor woman you murdered!

39
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,466
Enough, sir! Please!

40
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,097
Enough!

41
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,938
You're an animal!

42
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,775
A monster!

43
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,403
-Enough!
-Enough, sir!

44
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,738
Stop it! Stop!

45
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,906
Enough! That's enough!

46
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,201
I'll come back for you, bastard!

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,087
I'm going out again today.
Teresita and I made plans.

48
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,632
Would you like me to come with you?

49
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,761
Why? You'll just get in the way.

50
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,515
Good day!

51
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,609
Good day!

52
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,921
Teresita.

53
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,510
We have company.

54
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,978
Colonel!

55
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,313
Good afternoon.

56
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,274
Good afternoon to you too.

57
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:44,158
Mr. Chikara Tanaka
is the owner of this house.

58
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,204
Chikara Tanaka.

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,334
I know you and your son.

60
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,422
The role you played for the Imperial Army

61
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,133
was significant.

62
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,884
Thank you very much!

63
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,808
Do you live here in Mr. Tanaka's house?

64
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,147
Yes, Colonel.

65
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:21,529
We were forcibly evicted
by your soldiers from our home

66
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,573
because they said
it would be used as a garrison.

67
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,620
My apologies, Teresita.

68
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,543
And thank you
for letting us borrow your home.

69
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,754
"Borrow"?

70
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,589
Or should it be "take"?

71
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:47,805
I am Carmela Borromeo,
the wife of Julio and mother of Teresita.

72
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:56,064
No wonder she is so beautiful.
She takes after you.

73
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,650
Thank you.

74
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,444
Please have a seat.

75
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,949
-I'll just go and fetch some food.
-Dad…

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,244
Why did she ask him to sit?
He'll just stay longer.

77
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,290
Keep your mouths shut.

78
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,886
They are going door to door in our area.

79
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,390
As the village chief,
I can't do anything but accompany them.

80
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,143
They just want to ask you a few things.

81
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:29,866
I'm aware that the Borromeo family
is well-respected in this city.

82
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,618
So we hope

83
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,999
you can help us
enlighten your fellow citizens

84
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,919
about our gesture of friendship

85
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,174
and the liberation of this country

86
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,928
from the colonialist Americans.

87
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,974
Pardon me,

88
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:01,022
but isn't what you're doing now
an act of colonialism as well?

89
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,822
What?

90
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,470
Let's go.

91
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,945
I thought it was for something else.

92
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:38,744
Our country is not a colonizer, miss.

93
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,375
Asia is only for Asians.

94
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,088
That's why we want our countries
to help each other

95
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,009
to strengthen our economy and culture.

96
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,722
While the Americans,

97
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,476
who only value
their own interests in this nation,

98
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:08,316
continue to strengthen
and enrich their own country

99
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,905
by using you Filipinos
to become more powerful in this region.

100
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,079
Is that what you'd call a true friend?

101
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,540
Adelina.

102
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,989
Please don't hold anything

103
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,826
against my beloved sister, Colonel.

104
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,252
How can I refuse you, Teresita?

105
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,968
Only because you asked,
I'll forget her insult to our country.

106
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,430
Read it, Tasyo.

107
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:26,018
They're offering a peso
in exchange for each surrendered gun.

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,313
But that's too cheap.

109
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,736
Why would I surrender if I had a gun?

110
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,490
I'd rather use it against them.

111
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,623
I bid farewell to you now.

112
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,711
Why don't you stay for dinner, Colonel?

113
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,672
Maybe some other day,

114
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,135
since this won't be our last visit to you.

115
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,180
If it's no problem with you, Teresita.

116
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,152
I shouldn't be the one you ask, Colonel.

117
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,946
Because I already have a fiancé.

118
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,993
In our culture,

119
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:29,790
it is inappropriate
to entertain strangers.

120
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,918
But Colonel,

121
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,965
we wholeheartedly accept your friendship.

122
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,262
Thank you.

123
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,143
Thank you very much,
Mr. and Mrs. Borromeo.

124
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,746
You're dragging us
into your mess with the Colonel!

125
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,998
Are you really going to
make enemies right now?

126
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,374
Enough!

127
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,335
We're already being colonized by demons

128
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,463
and you'll even allow them
into our family?

129
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,944
You shouldn't take in
someone who is against us.

130
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,574
She might put you and Hiroshi at risk.

131
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:52,456
Please excuse Adelina's behavior, Colonel.

132
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,626
How will you punish her?

133
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,718
I gave my word to Teresita.

134
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,642
Who exactly is Teresita's fiancé?

135
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,521
Do you know him?

136
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes.

137
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,319
It's my son, Colonel. It's Hiroshi.

138
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,920
Your son is very fortunate, Mr. Tanaka.

139
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,341
Please excuse my question, Colonel,

140
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:49,346
but do you also have eyes for Teresita?

141
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,283
I really have a bad feeling
about that colonel.

142
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,703
I can clearly see
his intentions towards you, Teresita.

143
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,917
Adelina.

144
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,256
Next time,
don't endanger yourself for my sake.

145
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,595
I'm your older sister.
I should be the one protecting you.

146
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,850
Just leave him be. I can protect myself.

147
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,603
Really? You, Teresita?

148
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,356
You're not used to fighting,

149
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,942
unlike Eduardo and me,
who grew up fighters.

150
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,111
Adelina, times have changed.

151
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,322
Your enemies are no longer children,

152
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,532
but Japanese soldiers

153
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,911
who are willing to kill
and die for their country.

154
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,707
Do you want to die young?

155
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,917
-Teresita!
-See?

156
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,423
I'm sorry.

157
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,011
Fine, I won't anger the colonel again.

158
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,808
Next time, I'll just pretend
to be ignorant and useless.

159
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,315
But Teresita, be extra careful
with that colonel, okay?

160
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,779
If they were able to conquer our country,

161
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,907
what's going to stop him
from taking you as well?

162
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:40,124
If he does that, I'm sure he'll have to
face you and your brother's wrath.

163
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,712
I'm sure my Eduardo will make him pay.

164
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,018
Colonel.

165
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,403
Good thing you visited, Tanaka.

166
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,197
Please have a seat.

167
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,034
Yes, sir!

168
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,878
I visited the prison
to meet my mother's killer.

169
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,424
I'm ashamed to bring this up, Colonel,

170
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,637
but I want to remind you
of the promise you made to me.

171
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:42,102
That you would give justice to my mother
and punish her killer.

172
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,482
The moment we conquer this country,

173
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,152
we will immediately free
the Japanese who have been detained.

174
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,823
And put to death
everyone who arrested them.

175
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,869
Especially the ones
who killed your mother.

176
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,461
I will not let this day pass

177
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,092
without delivering the justice you seek.

178
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,595
Thank you very much, Colonel!

179
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:24,853
I met your fiancée earlier at the theater.

180
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,898
Is that right?

181
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,734
That she is your fiancée?

182
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,496
Why won't you admit it?

183
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,918
You shouldn't be ashamed of Teresita.

184
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,508
Only my father and her mother
made the agreement,

185
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,930
me and Teresita are against it.

186
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:05,519
Because like me, she is already
in love with someone else.

187
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,313
Who?

188
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:15,195
A childhood friend worthy of Teresita.

189
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,657
Tell me who he is.

190
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,119
Maybe I can help you.

191
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,456
Maybe I can convince Teresita's parents

192
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,169
not to force you two to marry.

193
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,461
Really, sir?

194
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,589
You're willing to do that?

195
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,093
But I think it's right

196
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,931
that I meet this fortunate man,

197
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,349
yes?

198
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,981
He is Eduardo dela Cruz.

199
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,151
Colonel.

200
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,572
Eduardo dela Cruz?

201
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,409
A Filipino?

202
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,913
Yes, sir.

203
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,809
-Teresita.
-Eduardo.

204
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,817
Eduardo.

205
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,616
Mama might see us.

206
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,535
Come with me.

207
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,725
Eduardo may be Filipino,

208
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,397
but like us,
he has genuine concern for his family,

209
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:20,988
especially for his younger sister
whom I truly love.

210
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,118
I want Eduardo and Teresita to be happy.

211
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,371
If there is no one to stop them,

212
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,166
then I will be free to marry
the woman I love the most.

213
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,586
I understand you.

214
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,384
You can count on my help.

215
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,971
Thank you very much, Colonel.

216
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,186
Tanaka…

217
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,939
Apologies, Colonel,

218
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,651
but you have some documents
to read and sign.

219
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,947
I shall take my leave now, Colonel.

220
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,784
Wait, Tanaka.

221
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,748
One last thing.

222
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,467
You must not tell Teresita that we spoke.

223
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,728
Yes, sir!

224
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,875
Here are the documents, Colonel.

225
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,886
I have an order for you.

226
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,679
What is it, Colonel?

227
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,933
Gather all the information
on Eduardo dela Cruz.

228
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,521
Everything.

229
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:25,028
His background, records,
status, everything.

230
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,825
I want to know everything about him.

231
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,579
Consider it done, sir.

232
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,256
Eduardo dela Cruz.

233
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,303
Whoever you are,

234
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,350
nobody crosses me.

235
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,499
I will never forget this wonderful night.

236
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:28,508
If you dare run away from me
like you did to all those women before…

237
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,721
you will truly regret it.

238
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,063
If I ever do that,

239
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,901
you and Adelina
will surely give me hell for it.

240
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,655
That's true.

241
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,953
But I have to go home now.

242
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,791
Mama might already be looking for me.

243
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
Why is it dark in here?

244
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,554
-Señora.
-Why are the lights off?

245
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,973
There has been no electricity
for some time now.

246
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,476
Damn it!

247
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,020
Bring some candles to my room right away!

248
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,397
Will do.

249
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,404
Good thing she didn't look for Teresita.

250
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,246
Don't mind her.

251
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,668
If she sees us, then good.

252
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,258
Because she'd have no choice
but to let us marry right away, right?

253
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,588
Why did you bow?

254
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,424
Isn't she Japanese?

255
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,425
No, she's not.

256
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,803
She's a vaudeville actress
who has Japanese friends.

257
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,179
A traitor.

258
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:43,685
They said the Japanese are abducting women
and raping then killing them,

259
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,646
because women were never seen
coming home to their families.

260
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,025
Don't try to leave.
You won't get away from them!

261
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,193
COMING UP

262
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,779
My father is backing out
of your agreement.

263
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,626
Don't let go of Teresita.

264
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,503
If I were you, I'd elope with her.

265
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,213
What is it this time, Hiroshi?

266
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,175
There's this colonel
who wants to take Teresita.

267
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,393
