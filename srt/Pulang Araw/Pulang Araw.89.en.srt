1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>Is Eduardo still a guerrilla?</i>

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,296
<i>Promise me you won't hurt him.</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,428
And never let that devil know
that I'm here with you.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,179
<i>Why did you bring them here?</i>

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,015
What if they're enemies?

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,683
We're Filipinos too.

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>Even our own people can betray us
and side with the enemies.</i>

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,773
Traitors like you
shouldn't be allowed to live!

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,608
Die, all of you!

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,860
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>Teresita wasn’t able to kill the clown.</i>

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>Do you think Teresita did this on purpose?</i>

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,451
<i>Or not?</i>

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>We recognize you as our leader
more than Sir Jorge.</i>

15
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,123
<i>- Long live Eduardo!</i>
- Long live!

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>Our people have no one else to rely on.</i>

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,630
<i>They're counting on us to save them
with our weapons.</i>

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,258
The clown you shot earlier
was still alive.

19
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,552
<i>Was that Adelina?</i>

20
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:59,100
<i>I have come to inform you
that Eduardo Dela Cruz isn't dead!</i>

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,312
<i>He's still out there
fighting alongside my wife.</i>

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,148
You're betraying your own wife!

23
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>Do you even know
how much she suffered just to get to you?</i>

24
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>This is no longer about Eduardo!</i>

25
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>You’re blinded by your own hatred!</i>

26
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,325
You’re a monster!

27
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>Women like Teresita
are no different from our country.</i>

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>Imprisoned.</i>

29
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>Oppressed.</i>

30
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>Stripped of their dignity.</i>

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>It's time we set our country free, Tasyo.</i>

32
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,963
<i>We’ll make our oppressors pay
for what they've done.</i>

33
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,089
<i>I’m with you on that.</i>

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,424
We'll face this together.

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,967
<i>No one will be left behind.</i>

36
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,057
<i>- Dad!
- Hey!</i>

37
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,060
Come here, I bought a gift for you.

38
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,562
I got you a doll, see?

39
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
This is my early Christmas gift to you.

40
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,566
Thanks, Dad.

41
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,706
Thank goodness you're back.

42
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,053
They're here to take you away.

43
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,308
You're just like your master.

44
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,726
A traitor.

45
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,312
A devil!

46
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,605
You're a devil!

47
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,108
- Enough! Arrest her!
- No, no, no!

48
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,735
I'm not coming with you!

49
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,987
I'm not coming with you!

50
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,947
I'm not coming with you!

51
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,450
Let me go, you monsters!

52
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,618
You monsters!

53
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,745
I said I'm not coming!

54
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,064
Hiroshi?

55
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,485
Is this a dream?

56
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,156
It's really me.

57
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,839
My God. Hiroshi.

58
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
If you only knew what happened to me.

59
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,803
I almost died.

60
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,141
Your damned Colonel almost killed me.

61
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,062
Is that true?

62
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,360
We performed at a party
for one of Saitoh's friends.

63
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,697
Our mission was to kill everyone there.

64
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,951
We planted dynamites in the venue,
but they quickly caught on with our plan.

65
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,413
Saitoh shot all my companions.

66
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,417
Good thing my sister was there.

67
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,128
You mean Teresita?

68
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,177
Have you spoken with her?

69
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,095
Yes.

70
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,806
And you were right.

71
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,309
Saitoh has her under control.

72
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,481
I managed to survive because of her help.

73
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,109
But if she hadn't been there,

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,906
I'd probably be a corpse by now.

75
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,999
Hiroshi?

76
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,503
My love.

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,172
Forgive me.

78
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,259
I've told you so much,
but I haven't even asked about you.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,679
What happened to you? Are you okay?

80
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,731
I bring bad news, Adelina.

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,985
What is it?

82
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,906
What’s that smell?

83
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,576
Come closer, Adelina.

84
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,358
Who's he?

85
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,696
It's…

86
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,407
your father.

87
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,602
Impossible.

88
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,729
No.

89
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,355
Impossible.

90
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,065
Hiroshi, it can't be.

91
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,802
Dad!

92
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,726
Dad!

93
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,074
Stop crying over there!

94
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,784
Be quiet!

95
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,212
I said stop crying! Be quiet!

96
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,216
Hey, you.

97
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,551
Come with us.

98
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,065
Don’t fight back!

99
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,282
Lower your weapons!

100
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,340
You, pig!

101
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,176
Serves you right for groping me.

102
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,888
Take their guns.

103
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,234
Ladies, there's no need to be afraid.

104
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,986
You're safe now.

105
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,405
I need you to run far away from here.

106
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,781
- Go.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,199
Thank you, sir.

108
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,035
Thank you.

109
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,585
You two, get off.

110
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,382
Move!

111
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,550
Move!

112
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,646
Eduardo, what are we going to do
with these soldiers?

113
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,900
If we let them live,

114
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,113
they'll just keep abducting
and killing our men and women.

115
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,742
So let's silence them for good!

116
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,243
Wait!

117
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,830
Let me do it.

118
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,961
After all, I almost got raped.

119
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,141
Let’s go!

120
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,157
God!

121
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,164
What happened?

122
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,838
How? What happened, Hiroshi?

123
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,840
How did my father die?

124
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,592
Who killed him? Tell me!

125
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,140
The enemies have ambushed

126
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,892
our camp.

127
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>A bloody battle broke out.</i>

128
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,157
<i>Your father was shot, Adelina.</i>

129
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,205
Who?

130
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,833
Who shot him?

131
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,169
Was it the Japanese?

132
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,754
Did they kill my father?

133
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,805
Monsters!

134
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
Damn them!

135
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,688
How can they be so cruel?

136
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,398
Adelina.

137
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,361
Adelina.

138
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,873
Adelina.

139
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,335
Anyone…

140
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,047
can die at war.

141
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,343
Anyone…

142
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:31,977
can end up killing even their own comrade.

143
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,987
So calm down, Adelina.

144
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,116
There is no forgiveness
for what they have done, Hiroshi.

145
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,665
I will never forgive

146
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,669
whoever did this to him.

147
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,923
I'll curse him for as long as I live!

148
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,304
I'll learn how to shoot.

149
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,018
I'm going to kill
every single one of them!

150
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,441
My family deserves justice
from what they did!

151
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,652
Especially my father, Hiroshi!

152
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,951
How are you, Amalia?

153
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,714
Where's Eduardo Dela Cruz?

154
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,719
Tell me this instant.

155
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,806
Or I will kill you.

156
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,812
I’m begging you.

157
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
My daughter needs me.

158
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,818
I still want to see her, sir.

159
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,749
I will help you find your daughter

160
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,087
if you tell me

161
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,634
the whereabouts of Eduardo Dela Cruz.

162
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,445
Teresita?

163
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,530
<i>Adelina.</i>

164
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,490
<i>My God, Adelina.</i>

165
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,827
Yuta knows that Eduardo's alive.

166
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,747
<i>Auntie Amalia has been captured.</i>

167
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,459
I’m certain that she's being forced
to tell him where he is right now.

168
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,421
I'll tell Eduardo immediately.

169
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,050
But…

170
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,303
there’s something you need to know.

171
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,350
I don’t know how to tell you this.

172
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,728
What is it?

173
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,360
Adelina, you’re making me nervous.

174
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,197
What’s going on?

175
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,330
It's dad.

176
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,461
Dad's gone.

177
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,174
They killed him.

178
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,136
Papa's dead?

179
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,560
What happened?

180
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
How did you find out?

181
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,317
How?

182
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,035
He fought at war with Hiroshi.

183
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,126
Dad was shot in the middle
of the encounter.

184
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,674
Hiroshi brought him home to me.

185
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,888
He has left this world, Teresita.

186
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,477
We already buried him…

187
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,149
in the backyard of Uncle Johnny’s house.

188
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,637
We put a cross on his grave…

189
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,898
so you can easily find him.

190
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,153
Teresita, please.

191
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,573
Do everything you can to survive.

192
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,910
<i>I don’t know how you'll do it.</i>

193
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,997
But I need you to get away from Saitoh.

194
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,460
I just really need you to make it out here

195
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,757
so you can visit Dad’s grave.

196
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,012
I’ll try.

197
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,934
I’ll talk to Yuta.

198
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,813
<i>Be strong, Teresita.</i>

199
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,358
Until we meet again.

200
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,486
Goodbye.

201
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,776
Papa…

202
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,720
Does your silence mean
you're agreeing to my condition?

203
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,977
Just tell me where Eduardo Dela Cruz is,

204
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,773
and you'll see your daughter.

205
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,781
Why should I believe you?

206
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:28,495
How can I be sure
that you’ll keep your word?

207
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,000
If tell you where he is,

208
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,837
are you sure you won't kill me too?

209
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,141
<i>You're wanted in town, Adelina.</i>

210
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,686
<i>They know who you are
and there’s a huge bounty for your head.</i>

211
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,273
Didn't you say you we have a spy
inside the enemy camp?

212
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,232
<i>Talk to him.</i>

213
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,277
<i>Ask him what Saitoh did to Auntie Amalia.</i>

214
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,237
What do you want? I’ll be there.

215
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>Yuta, I need to ask for your permission.</i>

216
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,615
<i>Where are you going?</i>

217
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>To my father.</i>

218
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,493
<i>He’s dead, Yuta.</i>

219
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,870
<i>I just got a call.</i>

220
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,121
<i>Was it Adelina?</i>

221
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,122
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

222
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>Don't you think it's about time
we leave this camp?</i>

223
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,418
I’m waiting for someone to return.

224
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,211
- Who?
- My Auntie Amalia.

225
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,672
<i>You're not leaving my sight.</i>

226
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,631
COMING UP

227
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>You're not allowed to go anywhere!</i>

228
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,015
