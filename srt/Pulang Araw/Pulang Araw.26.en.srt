1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,669
Hiroshi asked me a favor.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,796
Take care of my parents.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,673
Don't abandon them.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:11,511
I cannot just abandon the parents
of Teresita's husband-to-be.

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,346
The wedding is off, Mama.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,390
Does honor mean nothing to you?

7
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,351
Our friendship with their family
will be ruined!

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,478
You didn't tell us your boss was rich.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,648
You could've asked him for a loan
for your auntie and me.

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,191
You can head back home.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,069
-I need to go somewhere.
-Where are you going?

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,738
I'm going to scrape together some money!

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,948
The Japanese couple are inside.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,367
I'm sure we will gain a lot from this.

15
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,702
They're here.

16
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,538
Our army has arrived.

17
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,874
PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,466
The war has reached our country.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,387
I'm sure we'll be blamed
for what's happening.

20
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,445
Hurry!

21
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,870
Francisco! Come here, hurry!

22
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,872
Why are you looking for the driver, Julio?

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,500
The war has reached us.
We need to prepare.

24
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,876
-Francisco!
-Yes, señor?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,631
Get the car ready.
We need to buy rice and food to stock up.

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,549
-Got it?
-Yes, señor.

27
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,926
-Hurry, before they run out.
-Dad, I'll go with you.

28
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,594
It's dangerous outside.

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,931
Just stay at home
and listen to the news on the radio.

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,684
No, what if something happens to you?

31
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,937
It's dangerous out there.
I don't want you to get hurt!

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,523
Papa, why don't you
let Francisco go alone?

33
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,859
Why must you leave us here?

34
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,777
I agree, Julio. We're all women here.

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,571
What if a burglar comes in?

36
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,699
Or a bomb drops on this house?

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,535
What nonsense are you talking about?

38
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,620
I'll be quick.

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,621
-Dad!
-Papa!

40
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,706
-Be safe, Dad!
-Julio!

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Why did this have to happen
before Christmas?

42
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,049
Teresita, come. Let's listen to the news.

43
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,092
Come, dear.

44
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,608
Where do you think you're going?

45
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,276
Who are you?

46
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,996
Why did you kill her?

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,582
So she can't report us to the constables.

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,543
Let's go!

49
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,597
I'm so scared, Chikara.

50
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,059
I never imagined
we'd be in a situation like this.

51
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,977
We'll get through this together.

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,689
We have to stay strong for each other.

53
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,450
God Almighty.

54
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,412
Please don't let
anything bad happen to us.

55
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,254
Save our country
from the Japanese invaders.

56
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,133
Please guide our soldiers.

57
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,595
Help them drive away the new conquerors.

58
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,430
Help us, please.

59
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,954
Give us your money and jewelry.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,375
I mean…

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,634
-Nicanor, grab everything now!
-Okay.

62
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,929
Do it if you don't want us
to kill you both!

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,597
Don't come any closer…

64
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,268
or I'll shoot.

65
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
What's taking them so long?

66
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,694
They're handing them out.

67
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,656
-Everybody is paying, right?
-And for you?

68
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,993
Those who came earlier
bought everything already.

69
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,997
They should be used
as cannon fodders against the Japanese!

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,458
-Right!
-Calm down, friends!

71
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,709
Let's be patient.

72
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,253
I know we'll be able
to buy rice soon, right?

73
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,005
-Señor.
-Did you get any?

74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,050
No, every store ran out of stock.
This is the only one open.

75
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,259
-Get in line.
-Okay.

76
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,345
-He's cutting in line!
-Señor, may I buy a sack of rice?

77
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,640
-I can pay double.
-You'll pay double?

78
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,768
Rice is already expensive,
now you're doubling it?

79
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,270
Right, the price has doubled already.

80
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,773
Unbelievable. We've been here all day.

81
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,527
Señor, I'll buy it no matter how much.
Just tell me.

82
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,323
Señor, the rich and the poor
are now on equal footing.

83
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,407
Get back in line.

84
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,868
-See?
-Yeah, serves him right.

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,496
-We've been here all day.
-Get back in line.

86
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,248
-Give it to them.
-Do they still have rice?

87
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,586
There's still some.

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,046
Haruka, run!

89
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,008
-No! I won't leave you!
-Just go!

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,969
Don't move!

91
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,724
Chikara!

92
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,103
Take everything in this house!

93
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,116
-What about the woman?
-I'll take care of her.

94
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,802
I agree with the attack on Pearl Harbor.

95
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,054
Those greedy Americans.

96
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,723
They want to rule the world.

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,270
But why the Philippines?
Why did our country invade it too?

98
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:24,110
Did our government even consider
that we'd be affected by this?

99
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,823
What about our Filipino friends?

100
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,910
They welcomed us and this country
has become our second home.

101
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,999
You're choosing this country over our own?

102
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,709
Can you stop arguing?

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,297
You. Whose side are you on?

104
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:52,430
Is it our country
or the Filipinos and Americans?

105
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,145
Is loyalty only measured by that?

106
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,901
By blindly choosing one's own country
and accepting their violence?

107
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,528
You are defying the Emperor!

108
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,739
Traitor!

109
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,786
You're a disgrace to your family and race!

110
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,787
Enough, Hiroshi.

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,122
-Such a disgrace!
-That's enough.

112
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,750
Stop it.

113
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,419
Hey!

114
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,631
What's happening here?

115
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,556
You won't succeed
with your evil plans for this country!

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,434
America will destroy you
and your demonic race!

117
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,895
You're all demons!

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,471
Stop!

119
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,771
Go away!

120
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,359
Help!

121
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,695
Help! Stop!

122
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,240
No! Stop! Go away!

123
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,244
I wonder what they're talking about.

124
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,707
I'm nervous, Ryo.

125
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,877
They look like they're plotting something.

126
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,923
Do we just wait here until they hurt us?

127
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,884
Mr. Tanaka.

128
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,304
What do you mean?

129
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,599
I don't know
what's happening to my parents.

130
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,354
I don't know if they've been caught.

131
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,607
They could be in danger.

132
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,486
That's why I can't stay here any longer.

133
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,656
But how will you get out of here, Hiroshi?

134
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,962
You scolded us earlier for killing,
yet you killed that Japanese woman.

135
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,383
-You're really something, Lauro.
-Did you see what she did to me?

136
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,179
Just grab their things and go,
so we can have a better Christmas.

137
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,640
Let's go! Hurry up!

138
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,419
Eduardo!

139
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,670
Eduardo.

140
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,423
The war has arrived in our country.

141
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,050
It's complicated.

142
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,428
Especially with what's about to happen
in this country.

143
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,973
Just leave now, Eduardo.

144
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,852
Go to your province.
Go somewhere far from Manila.

145
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,438
It's the only way to be safe.

146
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,399
Hiroshi was referring to the war.

147
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,403
-What?
-What are you saying?

148
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,406
He came to see me this morning.

149
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,782
He told us to leave.

150
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,287
I didn't understand him at first.
But now, I do.

151
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,206
He knew about the war all this time.

152
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,126
I should've listened to him.

153
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,423
But how did Hiroshi know about the war?

154
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,052
Why is my father's name
included on that list?

155
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,804
What is that for, sir?

156
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,231
Could it be Mr. Tanaka?

157
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,153
I saw some documents with him.
Maybe he knows something.

158
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,948
What does our boss have to do
with the war right now?

159
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,034
I don't know.

160
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,870
I need to talk to him. Stay here.

161
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,623
-Eduardo, I'm coming with you!
-Wait, Eduardo!

162
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,550
Why did the Japanese
deceive the Americans?

163
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,094
They even managed to enter our airspace.

164
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,764
MacArthur is a weak general.

165
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:33,229
He should've prepared the entire USAFFE
long before Pearl Harbor was bombed.

166
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,066
If they were ready,
we wouldn't have been attacked here.

167
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,901
Just a cup, please.

168
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm sorry, madam. We're out of rice.

169
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,989
We ran out.

170
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,201
Can't I even buy a scoop?

171
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,995
They're no longer selling rice.

172
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,666
How come? You still have some sacks left.

173
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,835
-Exactly.
-We're not selling those anymore.

174
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,921
Those are reserved for my family.

175
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,422
-What?
-What?

176
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
You made us line up here.

177
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,093
We waited for so long,

178
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,928
and now you're telling us
we'll get nothing?

179
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,682
-What's your problem?
-Please pity our children, sir.

180
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,517
We've waited in line.

181
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,479
-There's more underneath.
-Every shop is closed.

182
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,240
Oh, no! Those are Japanese planes!

183
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,366
Run!

184
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,619
Don't run, you might get hurt!

185
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,705
They just keep coming.

186
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,417
Looks like the USAFFE
is not stopping them either.

187
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,005
It won't be long before our country
falls into the hands of the Japanese.

188
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,717
God, I hope not.

189
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,724
Let's go, sister.

190
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,435
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,336
Mr. Tanaka!

192
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,005
Stay there.

193
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,761
Teresita.

194
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,234
Mr. Tanaka.

195
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,580
He's alive.

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,290
Mr. Tanaka.

197
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,793
Mr. Tanaka!

198
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,337
Mr. Tanaka, please wake up.

199
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
Mr. Tanaka.

200
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,592
Eduardo, Mrs. Tanaka…

201
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,848
Mr. Tanaka.

202
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,851
Mr. Tanaka, please wake up.

203
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,228
Mr. Tanaka?

204
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,219
Mr. Tanaka.

205
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,305
It's us.

206
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,516
Adelina and Teresita.

207
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,394
Mr. Tanaka, what happened to you?

208
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,898
Adelina! Teresita!

209
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,734
Bring Mr. Tanaka here, hurry!

210
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,586
Haruka, wake up! Haruka! Ha…

211
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,465
Haruka.

212
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,010
Haruka!

213
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,679
Hey! Haruka!

214
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,060
Haruka!

215
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,441
Haruka!

216
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,401
Haruka!

217
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,708
Hiroshi.

218
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,253
You fell asleep, my friend.

219
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,547
Are you okay?

220
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,013
I had a nightmare.

221
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,102
I really don't feel good
about this place, Ryo.

222
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,064
I must go home.

223
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,485
MacArthur was unprepared
for the Japanese attacks.

224
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,821
I overheard our officials.

225
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,657
Based on the report they gathered,

226
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,577
most American warplanes are in Clark

227
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,873
and have been blown up by the Japanese.

228
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,583
Hey.

229
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,128
Hiroshi.

230
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,963
Where are you going?

231
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,548
Hiroshi.

232
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,925
Where are you going?

233
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,803
So don't be surprised

234
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,849
if nothing is intercepting
the warplanes attacking us.

235
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,891
Damn it.

236
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,395
So that useless general
was slacking off all along.

237
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,861
We did nothing wrong to be detained.

238
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,698
Isn't there a due process
before detaining someone?

239
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:22,578
We also have the right
to get an attorney to defend us.

240
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,964
This is war.

241
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,675
Your rights are worthless now!

242
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,135
Get back to your place!

243
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,139
Sir, I am begging you.

244
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,225
I just want to make sure
my parents are safe.

245
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,354
You won't step aside?

246
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,567
I'm sincerely asking for forgiveness

247
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,362
for the ongoing Japanese attack
on your country.

248
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,075
But I'm also asking for your understanding

249
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,121
to spare the Japanese residing here.

250
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,875
Most of us have nothing to do
with these atrocities.

251
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,293
You really won't obey?

252
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,797
Sir, I am begging you.

253
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,092
Set us free.

254
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,849
-Let go.
-Aren't we going to help him?

255
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,102
Hey. I said, let go.

256
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,814
Don't make things worse.
We're defenseless against them now!

257
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,275
-Get back!
-Sir, I am begging you.

258
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,028
Don't treat us as enemies, but as humans!

259
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,886
Hiroshi!

260
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,806
Hiroshi! Are you all right?

261
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,890
Hiroshi!

262
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,643
Hiroshi!

263
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,382
Julio.

264
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,342
The stores have closed.

265
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,513
There are no more supplies left.
The others won't sell anymore.

266
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,475
It's the same with the neighboring towns.

267
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,729
We still have plenty
of food in the pantry.

268
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:59,818
Besides, we have a farm.
I'm sure we have plenty of crops.

269
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,449
I don't think this war will last long.

270
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,578
The Americans will surely defeat

271
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,665
and drive those Japanese out
before Christmas!

272
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,584
What if you're wrong?

273
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,213
What if this drags on?

274
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,345
This war won't last, Julio.

275
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,060
Like I said, the Americans won't let
the Japanese take us from them.

276
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,352
Stop worrying!

277
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,478
Do you also smell that stench?

278
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,064
I think something is rotting.

279
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,775
It seems to be coming from a dead animal.

280
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,569
Maybe that's why flies are swarming us.

281
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,239
What about Hiroshi?
What if he finds out about this?

282
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,158
He'll be hurt when he hears about
what happened to his mother.

283
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,035
The war has indeed reached our country.

284
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,914
People are slowly losing
their compassion for one another.

285
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,833
That's why I'm more worried

286
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,920
about what will happen to us
once this war conquers us.

287
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:42,921
You must be delighted

288
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,632
now that Teresita
is giving Hiroshi to you.

289
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,510
-You're a whore like your mother!
-Señora!

290
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,304
Watanabe, what are you doing here?

291
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,099
The rotten smell is coming from here,
Lieutenant Colonel.

292
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,642
COMING UP

293
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,566
