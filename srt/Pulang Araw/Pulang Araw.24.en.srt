1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:06,339
I'm only following orders
to arrest all Japanese in Manila.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,091
But why are you arresting them?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,261
What do they have to do
with what's happening in Pearl Harbor?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,512
Think about it!

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,265
Poor Hiroshi. What about his parents?

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,018
-We won't allow anyone to enter.
-Yes, sir!

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,353
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,107
I hope so, Eduardo.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,191
Where is Hiroshi?

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,401
Where did you take him?

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,863
It's dangerous for you
to go out of this building.

12
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:35,869
You are relieved of your duties!

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,662
I find him mysterious.

14
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,749
What do you know about him, Lieutenant?

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,792
I was with him in Nanjing.

16
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,587
He killed them like animals.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,757
What are you doing here?

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,967
I didn't know I'd get here.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,802
Just take care of yourself.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:59,476
Even if I get out of here,
I can no longer marry you.

21
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,190
Where is your sister?

22
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,486
She'll be out in a bit.

23
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,029
Adelina.

24
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,491
Tell me the truth.

25
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,786
What's the real reason

26
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,664
for this conflict
between you and your sister?

27
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,666
What?

28
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,258
I can definitely feel
the tension between you two.

29
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,177
You cannot hide that from me.

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,767
Is it Hiroshi?

31
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,563
Is he the real reason?

32
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,905
What are you telling her?

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
Do not speak in your language!

34
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,452
Hiroshi, I do not understand you.

35
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,288
Teresita…

36
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,750
I do not want you
to lose face in front of these men.

37
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,253
That's why

38
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,257
I need to speak to you in my own language.

39
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,679
I love Adelina.

40
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,848
What?

41
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,183
I said, do not speak in your own language!

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,353
You might be scheming against our country!

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,647
Sir.

44
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,692
I may not understand what he is saying,

45
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,404
but I am certain Hiroshi
is not planning anything evil.

46
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:23,161
Hiroshi, why won't you speak to me
in my language?

47
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,247
So that I can understand you,

48
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,791
and he will stop suspecting you.

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,293
Teresita.

50
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,671
Please understand what I am saying.

51
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,674
I know you will understand.

52
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,386
I taught it to you
when we were still children.

53
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,266
I…

54
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,435
love…

55
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,063
Adelina.

56
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,401
"Arigato gozaimasu."

57
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,616
"Arigato gozaimasu."

58
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,666
What is "I love you" in Japanese?

59
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,462
I mean, I love Adelina.

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,466
"I love Adelina"?

61
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,427
Hey, really?

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,554
Ouch!

63
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,890
Quit it!

64
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,309
I was just joking.

65
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,312
Whatever. I need to go to the bathroom.

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,403
"Adelina no koto ga daisuki desu."

67
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,825
That's how you say, "I like Adelina",

68
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,287
or "I love Adelina" in our language.

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,833
"Adelina no koto ga daisuki desu."

70
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,711
-"Adelina no koto ga…"
-"Adelina no koto ga…"

71
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,170
"…daisuki desu."

72
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,548
"…daisuki desu."

73
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,013
-Adelina no koto ga daisuki desu.
-Adelina no koto ga daisuki desu.

74
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,059
Teresita, forgive me.

75
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,979
But…

76
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,189
it is the truth.

77
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:22,822
I love Adelina.

78
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,579
That's enough.
Go back with the rest of them.

79
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,915
Why are you still here?
Aren't you suspended?

80
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,377
I'd like to hand over…

81
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,507
my resignation letter.

82
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,087
We are not fighting about anything, Dad.

83
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,256
Tell me the truth.

84
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,885
Do not lie to me.

85
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,347
I am not dense.

86
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,771
I know when something's going on,
so just tell me the truth.

87
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,692
Is it because of Hiroshi?

88
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,863
Why do you say that, Dad?

89
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,575
Why would we fight over a man?

90
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,245
I do not think that's reasonable.

91
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,625
Teresita.

92
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,419
Wait for me outside.

93
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,005
I will get my car.

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,222
Teresita, Dad thinks
we're fighting because of Hiroshi.

95
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,310
Teresita!

96
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,021
Please, Adelina.

97
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,067
I don't want to talk to you right now.

98
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,071
Are you angry again?

99
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,369
It's not my fault I got here.

100
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,498
It just so happened
that Hiroshi was here and I saw him.

101
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,666
I didn't mean to…

102
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,752
I know why he kissed you.

103
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,089
-Can't we just forget about…
-Hiroshi loves you too!

104
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,011
Colonel!

105
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,517
Colonel!

106
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,564
Lieutenant Colonel.

107
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,609
Where is the colonel?

108
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,072
We've been looking for him.

109
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,490
Perhaps…

110
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,494
he went through with his plan to go out…

111
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,916
and monitor the situation outside.

112
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,629
I thought he was going
to take us with him?

113
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,677
You know how stubborn the colonel can be.

114
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,225
Did we receive
any new messages from Japan?

115
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,727
Yes, sir!

116
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,606
The colonel needs to read this.

117
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,818
And what does that message say?

118
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:16,741
Our air force will soon be flying here
to the Philippines, Lieutenant Colonel.

119
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,744
What wonderful news.

120
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,078
Yes, sir!

121
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,417
Come, Nakamura.
The colonel is just here somewhere.

122
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,669
Yes!

123
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,775
Now, I am ready to slaughter…

124
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:57,281
the American and Filipino enemies.

125
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,796
Why are you telling me this?

126
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,632
Is this a test, Teresita?

127
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,468
I accept and support your marriage.

128
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,054
-I have no objections…
-How can I marry him

129
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,056
when he loves you?

130
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,477
That's what he told me earlier.

131
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,863
I'm calling off the wedding.

132
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,203
I will withdraw from the agreement myself.

133
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,539
But what about Dad's property?

134
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,000
And isn't his theater being rebuilt now?

135
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,588
Would you let the Tanakas take it back
and Dad get hurt again?

136
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,382
What about you and Hiroshi?

137
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,303
Do you think I could bear

138
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,598
getting in the way
of your love for each other?

139
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,435
-Teresita…
-Adelina.

140
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,312
Listen to me.

141
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,902
We both know I'm not
marrying him out of love.

142
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,835
Which is why I cannot marry him.

143
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,006
Adelina.

144
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,051
You two…

145
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,724
You and Hiroshi
should be together, not us.

146
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,979
But how, Teresita?

147
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,024
As much as I want that, I don't know how.

148
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,069
I will never be accepted
by Hiroshi's family.

149
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,906
They will also take back Dad's land!

150
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,699
Your family will lose face.

151
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,703
-The Tanakas will be humiliated…
-Adelina, I have sacrificed myself.

152
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,872
I've already hurt Eduardo!

153
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,167
I cannot sacrifice
your love for each other too!

154
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,920
No, Teresita.
I'm sure Hiroshi was just mistaken.

155
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,089
-I will talk to him.
-Adelina, come back!

156
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,680
What about their food?

157
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,474
Will the government cover it?

158
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,060
I'll ask the lieutenant later.

159
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,203
That's enough, Adelina.

160
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,414
Don't do this.

161
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,756
Were you telling the truth to my sister?

162
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,845
Did you understand what I said?

163
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,850
Take it back, Hiroshi.

164
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,770
What you're feeling is wrong.

165
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,106
You're about to marry my sister.

166
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,152
-Apologize to her now!
-There's no need, Adelina.

167
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,115
Tell her you're taking back
all the hurtful things you said.

168
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,538
Don't look at me like that.

169
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,834
Take back what you just confessed

170
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,711
because you shouldn't love
anyone else but her.

171
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,213
Aren't you going to marry her?

172
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,636
Say something!

173
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,767
Take it back before my sister backs out
from the marriage, please.

174
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,228
Adelina, that's enough.
I've made my decision.

175
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,276
Hiroshi, please don't do this.

176
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,657
Your family can no longer take back
the land they returned to our father.

177
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,786
Your family will also be humiliated
if that happens.

178
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,998
So I'm begging you,
take back what you said.

179
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,003
We don't know what will happen to us here.

180
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,757
Adelina, what if I die here?

181
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,887
I will accept whatever fate
is in store for me.

182
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,767
I would rather die with honor
than die a liar.

183
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,856
Even though I'm only worth…

184
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,318
a piece of land to you.

185
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,533
But what I told Teresita is true.

186
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,205
I love you.

187
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,920
I love you, Adelina.

188
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,988
Anybody home?

189
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,951
Who's there?

190
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,749
-Anybody home?
-Who's there?

191
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,299
What do you need, kids?

192
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,969
The constabulary ordered us to help them.

193
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,432
We need to arrest the Japanese
living in that house.

194
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,770
Boys, the Japanese are no longer here.

195
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,272
We kicked them out. Go, off with you.

196
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,153
Go on, scram.

197
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,323
They're gone. What should we do now?

198
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,242
-Let's just go.
-Come on, let's go.

199
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,286
Our apologies. We'll get going, then!

200
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,794
I can no longer guarantee

201
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,215
that I can drive away anyone
who comes here looking for you.

202
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,968
The constabulary might come next time.
We won't be able to handle them.

203
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,890
Chikara, maybe it is right
that we go with them.

204
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,726
You have nothing to fear.

205
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,105
I know our army will arrive at any moment.

206
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,690
We're safe here.

207
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,861
Make them leave now.

208
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,254
We need to protect you.

209
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,802
Chikara, let go of that.
Where did you get that?

210
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,971
You are putting our army at risk!

211
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,597
That Eduardo is dangerous.

212
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,516
Do something about him, Tanaka.

213
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,060
Kill him if you have to!

214
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,984
What's the matter with you, Chikara?

215
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,985
Put that down!

216
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,002
Eduardo.

217
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,172
Let's go before he shoots us for real.

218
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,176
Let's go, Eduardo.

219
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,518
You scared me, Chikara.
I thought you were going to shoot him.

220
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,063
I can't.

221
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:58,655
I will let the Japanese Imperial Army
deal with Eduardo.

222
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,952
They can handle him and his father.

223
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,300
Your wedding will push through, Hiroshi.

224
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,551
Adelina.

225
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,596
Teresita.

226
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,604
If you really love me,

227
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,109
you will do what I want.

228
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,951
And that's for you and my father's family
to have a peaceful and quiet life.

229
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,746
This is what is best for all of us.

230
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,976
There is something you must know.

231
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,686
Teresita, that's enough.

232
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,148
Adelina has made her decision.

233
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,612
Go after your sister.

234
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,990
But my sister loves you too.

235
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,203
Adelina loves you.

236
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,791
Is that true, Teresita?

237
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,005
Are you stupid?

238
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:44,553
Do you think it meant nothing
when she kissed you back?

239
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,479
My sister loves you.

240
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,232
Teresita.

241
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,946
I hope you're not just saying this
because you pity me.

242
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,703
Hiroshi.

244
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,376
Adelina loves you.

245
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,633
I'm setting you free…

246
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,137
my friend.

247
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,142
And please don't think…

248
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,395
you will die here.

249
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,192
We will wait for you.

250
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,027
Thank you.

251
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,280
Thank you, my friend.

252
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,515
Didn't you say Hiroshi warned you

253
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,725
that someone wants to kill you?

254
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,228
I'm not scared.
Teresita won't cry for me, anyway.

255
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,732
I cannot just abandon the parents
of Teresita's husband-to-be.

256
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,609
The wedding is off!

257
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,362
Does honor mean nothing to you?

258
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,573
I have already decided!
This conversation is over!

259
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,283
-Gather round!
-Yes, sir!

260
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,203
Allow me to share
our next course of action.

261
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:38,917
COMING UP

262
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,456
