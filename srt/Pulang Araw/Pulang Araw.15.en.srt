1
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,045
Hiroshi.

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,756
What's the name

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,594
of the childhood friend
you mentioned earlier?

4
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,388
Why?

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,351
We're friends, right?

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,936
So…

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,481
who is it?

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,778
Let's not talk about that anymore.

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,864
Did you hear?

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,242
The Nazis have invaded the Soviet Union.

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,954
I heard it on the news earlier.

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,836
Adolf Hitler is a ruthless leader

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,466
who wants to expand Germany's territory

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:37,263
and establish a vast empire of Germans,

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,477
even if it means killing countless people.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,106
If Japan were to do the same,

17
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,653
expanding its territory in Asia-Pacific,

18
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,074
would you also call
our Emperor a ruthless leader?

19
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,077
No.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,207
But war only brings great suffering

21
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,961
and the loss of many lives.

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,840
So leaders should prioritize

23
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,467
the welfare of humanity.

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,054
Not just their political interests!

25
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,515
You have a point.

26
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,892
I agree with you.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,687
You didn't answer my question.

28
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:33,027
Would you oppose
the orders of our Emperor?

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,907
Of course not!

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:44,164
Because the Emperor is a holy person.

31
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,916
He is our sovereign.

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,380
So he will never make a wrong decision.

33
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,631
Right, Hiroshi?

34
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,926
I'm not asking you!

35
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,474
I greatly respect our Emperor, Akio.

36
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,312
But if you ask me if I agree with the war…

37
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,648
I do not.

38
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,612
I'll go ahead.

39
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,405
Traitor!

40
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,921
-Tasyo!
-Hey! Huh?

41
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,924
You're alone? Where's my brother?

42
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,468
He didn't show up to work today.

43
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,385
What?
Yes.

44
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,139
Oh, no!

45
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,516
What happened to Eduardo?

46
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,730
Jeez! Where did he go?

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,732
Well, I don't know, but…

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,152
Oh, don't worry.

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,821
He's a man.
Nothing bad will happen to him.

50
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,948
Whatever!

51
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,282
I'll go find my brother.

52
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,284
Hey! Wait, hold on.

53
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,496
Where are you going?
It's late. It's dangerous out here!

54
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,833
Who would dare hurt me here?

55
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,669
I'm a celebrity now.

56
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,338
Let them try.

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,631
Bye now!

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,017
Who is this person, Ryo?

59
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,898
Why did they hurt him like this?

60
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,860
Well, when he wakes up, we'll find out.

61
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,517
Adelina…

62
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,104
Teresita…

63
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,568
Adelina…

64
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,030
Teresita.

65
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh, you're here!

66
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,877
Hello! Good evening, Mrs. Carmela!

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,088
Good evening, Mr. Chikara, Mrs. Haruka.

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
Forgive me for visiting so suddenly.

69
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,720
I hope I didn't disturb you.

70
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,766
No, not at all. What can we do for you?

71
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,783
Kulas, if you see Eduardo,
tell him to come home

72
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,076
because I'm getting worried.

73
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,285
All right.

74
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,412
All right, thanks.

75
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,919
Eduardo is so annoying.
He got into trouble again!

76
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,004
Where is he?

77
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,522
Excuse me, miss.

78
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,442
Are you following me?

79
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,074
How amusing!

80
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,951
You still know how to speak Tagalog.

81
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,163
Do we know each other?

82
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,335
You really don't remember me?

83
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,296
I'm your childhood friend!

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,341
Along with Eduardo and Teresita.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,594
Adelina?

86
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,932
Is that really you, Adelina?

87
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,561
It's me!

88
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,273
I knew it, you're Hiroshi!

89
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,321
This is truly a beautiful day.

90
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,174
Forgive me for hugging you.

91
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,843
You might be getting the wrong idea.

92
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,721
You're wrong. Really wrong!

93
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,726
Well, I'm just happy that our friend,

94
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,396
my and Eduardo's childhood friend,
has returned.

95
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,525
You have not changed.
You're still very talkative.

96
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,739
You've become more beautiful now

97
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,035
than when we were still young.

98
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,746
What did you say?

99
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,916
Sorry, I didn't understand.

100
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,336
Nothing.

101
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,962
What was that?

102
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,547
I heard you say something!

103
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,424
What did you say?

104
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,219
I said…

105
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,390
you've changed a lot.

106
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,809
You're not as pretty now.

107
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,944
You insult me just like my brother.

108
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,988
In that case, I take it back
when I said I was happy to see you!

109
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,491
I'm not happy to see you! Get lost!

110
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:59,455
You still get upset by jokes
so easily, Adelina.

111
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,945
Why are you talking to me in English?
It made me panic!

112
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,286
Mrs. Carmela,

113
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,663
I'm surprised
that's the reason you came here.

114
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:46,544
I apologize, Mr. Tanaka, Mrs. Haruka,

115
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:53,342
if it seems like
I am selling off my daughter.

116
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,056
But I am a mother who only
wants the best for Teresita's future.

117
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,395
Especially since
her irresponsible father has returned.

118
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,814
I want to spare her from him.

119
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,570
I know Teresita's situation will improve

120
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:19,243
if we agree to marry your son
and my daughter as soon as possible.

121
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,964
Did you know that our father
has returned, just like you?

122
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,049
Really?

123
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,676
That's good to hear.

124
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,306
You and Teresita must be
very happy now, right?

125
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
You're absolutely right.

126
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:48,105
I'm sure Dad, Eduardo, and Teresita
will be happy when they see you.

127
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,026
It would be great if we could
be complete again, right?

128
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,904
Absolutely. No doubt about it.

129
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,073
Come, join me.

130
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,414
You're not planning anything, are you?

131
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,875
Don't get any ideas.

132
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm not thinking anything, Adelina.

133
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,425
So where are we going?

134
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,515
We're going to look for Eduardo
because he still hasn't come home.

135
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,016
Shall we?

136
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,803
Who are you?

137
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,972
Where am I?

138
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,437
You're in our house.
My brother and I helped you.

139
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,855
Ah, just a moment, sir.

140
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,943
-Ryo! He's awake!
-What?

141
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,579
Don't try to sit up, sir.

142
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,955
You're still hurt.

143
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,542
You don't understand.

144
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,918
I want to go home.

145
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,674
It's important I talk to my sister
because I'm worried

146
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,885
she might get into trouble like me.

147
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,555
If that's the case, I will look for
a carriage to take you.

148
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,141
Yuki, take care of him for now.

149
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,643
Okay, be careful!

150
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:30,768
I would like our son to marry
someone of the same ethnicity.

151
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,772
It's important that the couple
share the same culture,

152
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,734
as they will understand each other better,
which leads to a longer-lasting marriage.

153
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:47,743
Forgive me, but it seems
you are not in favor of my proposal.

154
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,548
Good evening!

155
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,216
Mr. Watanabe.

156
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,426
I would like to speak with you.

157
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,933
Sorry, we have a guest.

158
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,354
What I have to say is important,
so come with me.

159
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,444
Mrs. Carmela. I apologize. Just a moment.

160
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,697
Of course.

161
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,586
Mrs. Carmela.

162
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,745
Hiroshi and I have spoken.

163
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,455
It turns out he's against the war.

164
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,292
He's not in favor of our country's
planned attack on this land either.

165
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,920
I saw him with a woman earlier too.

166
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,551
A damn Filipina who has no use
to your son or to us.

167
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,972
Is the woman the reason
your son came back here?

168
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,894
No, to help with our mission.

169
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,355
Correct.

170
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,609
But why does he have
differing beliefs and actions?

171
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,204
I apologize for all the wrong things
my son has said and done.

172
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,290
Forgive us!

173
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,961
Rest assured that I will correct my son

174
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,964
so he can become an honorable
and useful Japanese man

175
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:10,094
for the glory of our country
and our Emperor!

176
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,767
This is a message from Colonel Arata.

177
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,731
He is asking you to establish
connections among the locals.

178
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,028
One or several influential
Filipino families or individuals

179
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,617
respected by the people of Manila
and willing to cooperate

180
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,245
with our Japanese Imperial Army,

181
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,456
so that the Filipinos
can more easily accept us

182
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,084
once we have conquered this land.

183
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,503
The Japanese have noble intentions!

184
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,966
They freed us from American oppression!

185
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:54,763
Because only these white people
benefit from our natural resources!

186
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,599
The Japanese want us to unite!

187
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,393
Let us work with them,

188
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,895
fellow countrymen,
for the further development

189
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,939
of our country and all of Asia!

190
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,569
Because not only the Whites
will benefit from this continent,

191
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,404
but we Asians as well!

192
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,324
Filipinos will listen more
to their countrymen,

193
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,536
to bring us closer
to the hearts of the locals.

194
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,749
And that will be the role
of your chosen Filipino.

195
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,338
I know someone we can use.

196
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,339
Good.

197
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:37,514
But you need to hurry,
as our planned attack is approaching.

198
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,276
I saw Eduardo last night.

199
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,320
We bought bread here at the same time.

200
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,199
Is that so, Mameng?

201
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,910
All right, thank you.

202
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,203
All right.

203
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,081
Where is he?

204
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:35,364
I bought that because
it reminded me of someone.

205
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,662
Don't be mad at your father.

206
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,123
He's only thinking about
what's good for you.

207
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,045
That's why he wants you
to go back to your country to study there.

208
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,015
This sticky candy is called belekoy.

209
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,642
It's my favorite.

210
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,021
You can have it so you can smile again.

211
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,150
Go ahead, take it, Hiroshi.

212
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,256
So you haven't forgotten about that day.

213
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,845
Neither have I.
And I will never forget it.

214
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,059
I mean, those happy memories
of our childhood

215
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:50,689
with my sister and brother.

216
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,822
Eduardo.

217
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,198
My brother.

218
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,160
Where did he go?

219
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,412
Adelina.

220
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,710
Don't worry.

221
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:18,175
Just eat this so you can smile again.

222
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,441
Cheers?

223
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,321
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

224
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,965
My brother and I grew up here.

225
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,635
Until our parents passed away.

226
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,807
So that's why you speak Tagalog so well.

227
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,897
Thank you.

228
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,609
Thank you for helping me.

229
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,654
I thank you and your brother.

230
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,953
You seemed to be dreaming earlier.

231
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:32,207
You mentioned some names.

232
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,584
Adelina?

233
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,297
She is my sister.

234
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,508
And Teresita?

235
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
She's a childhood friend.

236
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,434
A dear friend.

237
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,936
Kanojo?

238
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,694
It means girlfriend.

239
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,114
That will never happen.

240
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,785
I'm no longer hoping that
Teresita will ever love me.

241
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,872
Or that we will end up together.

242
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,168
Especially since her mother is so evil.

243
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,300
Sorry for being curious,

244
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,304
but why do you say that?

245
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,890
I don't want to talk about it.

246
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,142
Sorry.

247
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,362
Stay away from the Borromeos!

248
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,116
Otherwise, we might beat up
your sister next.

249
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,091
I'll get off here, sir.

250
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,136
One moment.

251
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,775
Be careful.

252
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,655
Thank you.

253
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,868
Well, we live here now.

254
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,621
Eduardo is renting this house.

255
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,916
Why did you leave the Borromeos?

256
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,629
It's a long story.

257
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,926
I'll just tell you next time.
You might get home very late.

258
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,596
In that case, I will take my leave now.

259
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,932
Take care.

260
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,601
Thank you!

261
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,551
Apologies, Mrs. Carmela, if I took long.

262
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:42,772
I should apologize
because I have bothered you too much.

263
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,277
I won't keep you any longer.
I'll go ahead.

264
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,904
Don't leave.

265
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:53,783
I have made a decision.

266
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,959
I want my Hiroshi to marry your Teresita.

267
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,818
I wonder this about my daughter.
Why does she want to be friends with you?

268
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,405
You are even lower than
the spit of worthless people!

269
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,158
There is a huge divide
between me and Teresita.

270
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,702
That's why I am grateful
for the kindness in her heart.

271
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,038
Because she accepted me as a friend!

272
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:44,709
Julio and Carmela Borromeo.
Teresita Borromeo?

273
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,710
Yes, Colonel.

274
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,381
How sure are you that these people
will be helpful to us?

275
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,634
Because the Teresita Borromeo
listed there is my future daughter-in-law.

276
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,262
Mr. Tanaka is willing to return to us,

277
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,556
to you, the land where
your burned-down theater is,

278
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,184
if you agree for our children to marry.

279
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,981
I will really work hard so that someday,
I can also buy a woman like you

280
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,066
whose worth is only
that of a piece of land.

281
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,611
You are lucky that she is
the woman chosen for you.

282
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,156
I hope you support her career
of performing vaudeville.

283
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,575
I really love you, Adelina.

284
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,121
Hiroshi? Adelina? What is this?

285
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,457
I cannot wait to invade
this American-allied country.

286
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,169
COMING UP

287
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,135
