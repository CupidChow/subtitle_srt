1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,838
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,968
I thought your last name
was Dela Cruz, sir.

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,344
Because he's my father, Mario.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,433
He's the man who never
accepted nor cared for me.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,729
Colonel, what do you want exactly
in return for these gifts you're offering?

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,189
I want Teresita, your daughter.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,443
And if I refuse,

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,697
will you have me arrested
by your Kempeitai?

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,117
Why don't you just marry
the colonel yourself?

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,288
Our whole country will fall
into the hands of the Japanese.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,622
And Eduardo?

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,711
He and his rebel troops
will surely end up dead.

13
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,671
That won't happen, señora.

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,091
It's difficult to deal
with these Filipinos.

15
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,970
They're truly testing my patience.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,223
Looks like our army no longer needs me.

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,350
I believe I have already done my part.

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,518
If I may,

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,854
I would like to be
discharged from service.

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,192
You may speak to Colonel Yuta about it.

21
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,485
Good morning.

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,028
It's you!

23
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,113
You killed my wife!

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,700
Colonel, why is this man still alive?

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,827
Wasn't he given the death penalty?

26
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,832
With all due respect, Colonel.

27
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:09,712
But how can this murderer still be alive?

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,298
Mr. Tanaka.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,301
Please calm down.

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,640
I understand your frustration.

31
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,726
But…

32
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:32,610
Lauro here is an asset to us.

33
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,113
Colonel.

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,367
How can this murderer be our asset?

35
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:11,065
How can I accept him
knowing what he did, Colonel?

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,811
Understood, Colonel.

37
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,983
And one more thing, Mr. Tanaka.

38
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,656
Thank you very much, sir, master.

39
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,201
I'll make sure not to disappoint you.

40
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:51,457
Truth is, I have something in mind.

41
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,585
What is it, sir, master?

42
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,975
Forgive me for taking out
my frustrations with your colonel on you.

43
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,938
I understand, Adelina.

44
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,734
So…

45
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,279
Can you smile for me now?

46
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,493
I want to remember
your sweet smile in my travels,

47
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,414
not your sour expression.

48
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,293
For heaven's sake, Hiroshi!

49
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,837
Just go before I lose my temper.

50
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,131
I love you, Adelina.

51
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,264
What did you say?

52
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,185
Nothing!

53
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,436
I said…

54
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,649
You look beautiful today. Take care.

55
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,445
Fine!

56
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,614
Be careful.

57
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,158
And don't skip meals.

58
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,176
I'll always be careful for you, Adelina.

59
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,384
Teresita!

60
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,681
No one's outside, Papa.

61
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,976
Hey!

62
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,856
Whoever threw those rocks, it's not funny!

63
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,733
Someone could get really hurt!

64
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,617
Julio.

65
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,870
I found a note.

66
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,206
It's a note.

67
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,880
"Kill the Borromeos.

68
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,468
They are traitors
who are helping the Japanese."

69
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,262
Jesus Christ.

70
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
Why are they threatening us?

71
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,517
What have we done wrong?

72
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,068
Hey!

73
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:34,115
Whoever threw those rocks at us,
listen carefully!

74
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,243
We're not traitors!

75
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,204
Do you hear me?

76
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,290
You're right!

77
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,208
We're friends with the Tanakas,

78
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,504
but that doesn't mean
we're traitors to our own country!

79
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
-Come inside.
-Dad!

80
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,757
Get away from there!

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,551
-Yolanda, Meding.
-You might get hurt.

82
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,469
Please close the windows.

83
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,016
See?

84
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,186
This is why we need Colonel Saitoh
now more than ever.

85
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,773
Our countrymen are looking down on us.

86
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,079
What did our neighbors say?

87
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,707
Do they know who threw those rocks?

88
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,542
No one knows, señorita.

89
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,587
They were all too occupied
with their own matters.

90
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,633
They know who did it.
They're just covering it up!

91
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,094
If I know, they're just jealous.

92
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,805
While we're being protected
by the Japanese,

93
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,932
they're out there, suffering.

94
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,144
Francisco, get back to work.

95
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,067
Before, there was no malice
in being friends with the Japanese.

96
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,444
But now there is.

97
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,531
I don't give a damn what they think.

98
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,494
What's important is we ensure our safety!

99
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,583
I can only think of one thing
to keep us safe, Mama.

100
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,796
We must leave this place.

101
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,095
Why can't we just rent
or stay with our relatives?

102
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,930
Or with other Filipinos?

103
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,557
So we won't be accused of being traitors.

104
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,518
Teresita has a point.

105
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,813
I'll talk to Mr. Tanaka about this.

106
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,524
Have you all gone crazy?

107
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,860
Is no one thinking about this family?

108
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,989
Who will protect us without the Tanakas?

109
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,951
We'll be in even greater danger

110
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,372
from thieves and criminals
rampant in these times!

111
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,584
Carmela, you can stay here if you want.

112
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,464
I'll find another place
for the three of us.

113
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,438
Hands off, Juan. This is not a toy.

114
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,566
Can you stop treating me like a child?

115
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:18,529
I wish I'd grown up faster,
so Sir Campbell can teach me to shoot!

116
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't rush your youth, Juan.

117
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,954
I think you should leave us for now.

118
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,457
We have some things to talk about.

119
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,167
Like what?

120
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,503
Just do as he says. Now, go.

121
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,225
You seem to be getting along
with your father, sir.

122
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,106
And I think he's pretty fond of you.

123
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,654
That's because he doesn't know me, Mario.

124
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,575
The moment he finds out who I really am,

125
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,287
I'm sure he won't treat me the same way.

126
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,795
I don't believe any parent
can just forget about their children, sir.

127
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,216
If you only knew…

128
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,805
-But, sir…
-Let's not talk about him anymore.

129
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,352
And quit calling me "sir".

130
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,354
"Eduardo" is fine.

131
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,233
As you wish…

132
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,944
Eduardo.

133
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,783
But I'm glad you've reunited
with your father here.

134
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,994
Even if you don't admit it,

135
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,122
I know you feel the same way, Eduardo.

136
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,073
What's that?

137
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,659
Are they making up for tormenting us?

138
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,663
They'll feed you now,
but imprison and torture you tomorrow.

139
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,832
They might hear you.

140
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,521
Father, what are you doing here?

141
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,735
Did something bad happen, Father?

142
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,486
What's the matter?

143
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,911
Father, is there a problem?

144
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,040
None.

145
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,751
Everything is fine.

146
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm okay.

147
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,302
I only dropped by to see you.

148
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,431
Go, get back to work.

149
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,569
Adelina. Teresita.

150
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,573
Are you girls fit to perform tomorrow?

151
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,953
Our Filipino audience is back.

152
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,834
I think our audience
is looking for a distraction,

153
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,379
and they want the two of you.

154
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,590
-Really?
-It's true.

155
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,093
We'll perform for them right away.

156
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,516
That is if Papa allows us.

157
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,437
Why don't you just quit performing?

158
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,148
Carmela, stop objecting.

159
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,568
I owe Johnny a lot.

160
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:32,157
I want to repay his generosity
by letting the girls perform.

161
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
What do you owe him?

162
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:42,042
My friend has opened his house
for us to stay in.

163
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,045
That is because I live alone.

164
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,090
My only companion is my servant.

165
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,968
My home is spacious enough for all of you.

166
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,053
Thank you very much, my friend.

167
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,350
What you're planning to do
is embarrassing, Julio.

168
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,229
We're staying at another person's place?

169
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,316
How is that different
from staying with the Tanakas?

170
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,193
The difference?

171
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,654
Johnny is a Filipino like us.

172
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,617
Wouldn't it be better
if we ask him for help?

173
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,537
Suit yourselves!

174
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,289
Yolanda!

175
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,046
Then it's settled.

176
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,176
Just keep me updated on
what the Tanakas say

177
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,470
when you decide to move out.

178
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,305
Thank you very much.

179
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,185
They're here.

180
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,104
Let me introduce you.

181
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,904
-Good day, Mr. Tanaka.
-Good day.

182
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,700
Good day to you too.

183
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,328
Hiroshi. Mr. Tanaka.

184
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,748
This is Johnny, a good friend of mine.

185
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,710
He owns the theater
where Teresita and Adelina perform.

186
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,430
By the way, Hiroshi…

187
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,100
Mr. Tanaka.

188
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,229
I'd like to take this opportunity

189
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,651
to thank your family
for welcoming us into your home,

190
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,113
and we'd also like to bid farewell.

191
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,534
It's time for us to move out…

192
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:45,165
now that Johnny and I have decided

193
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,418
that we will stay with him.

194
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,051
Why are you leaving?

195
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,348
Adelina, why are you leaving us?

196
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,323
Finish all of it, Juan.

197
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,201
That's our lunch, snack, and dinner.

198
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,537
Seriously?

199
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,000
Then can I have some more?

200
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,880
Juan, we still have plenty to feed.
So learn to share, okay?

201
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,383
All right. Thank you.

202
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,347
Pablo.

203
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,269
Is Sir Campbell coming out to eat?

204
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,980
Can I have some more?

205
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,482
I called him out earlier,
but he doesn't want to come out.

206
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,610
Maybe he doesn't like our porridge.

207
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,995
Why don't you bring him food
and convince him to eat, Eduardo?

208
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,622
Why me?

209
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,415
Because he's our leader.

210
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,167
He mustn't starve himself.

211
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,214
Here.

212
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,800
Take this to Sir Campbell.

213
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,066
You don't need to leave.

214
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,489
We can get soldiers to guard outside

215
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,369
so no one will harm
or throw stones at you, right?

216
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,372
There's no need, Hiroshi.

217
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,876
We've burdened you enough.

218
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,006
Leaving is our best option right now.

219
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,927
For everyone's peace.

220
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,015
We already owe your family so much.

221
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,522
But you'll be safer here.

222
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,110
We can protect you better
if you're with us.

223
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,071
Isn't that right, Father?

224
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,449
Hiroshi.

225
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,619
They'd be safer with their own people.

226
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,726
Well, that's settled.
Looks like Mr. Tanaka is okay with it.

227
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,106
I better get going.

228
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
Thank you very much, friend.

229
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,860
-I'll walk you out.
-Take care.

230
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
Take care, Daddy Johnny.

231
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,295
You too, Adelina.

232
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,839
Especially during this time.

233
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,218
I'm off. Goodbye.

234
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,021
Once I find out who shamelessly
threw those stones at you,

235
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,065
I'll teach them a lesson.

236
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,194
Hiroshi, let it go.

237
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,529
Maybe, it's better this way

238
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,575
to make us realize that,
as long as our countries are at war,

239
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,495
it's better for us to keep our distance.

240
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,121
Why, Adelina?

241
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,832
Do you also see me as an enemy

242
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,127
just like how other Filipinos see me?

243
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,466
Hiroshi, we can't blame my countrymen

244
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,845
for thinking that every Japanese
is an enemy

245
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,766
because your country started this war.

246
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,523
Will I see you again, Adelina?

247
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,527
Or are you going to avoid me too?

248
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,198
Have you forgotten
our agreement with Eduardo?

249
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,161
We'll meet up every full moon, remember?

250
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,332
Promise, Teresita and I will be there.

251
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,337
So should you and Eduardo, okay?

252
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,341
That way, we'll see each other again.

253
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:52,556
I'll surely miss you, Adelina.

254
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,371
Major's right.

255
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,457
Everything we need is in the garrison,

256
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,835
like weapons and food.

257
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,546
Excuse me.

258
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,384
Where is Major Campbell?
I brought him some food.

259
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,721
He just left.
They have an important mission.

260
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,351
All right, thank you.

261
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,811
Wait!

262
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,857
Is he one of the new recruits?

263
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,026
Yes, Sir Jorge.

264
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,736
He's Eduardo.

265
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,363
Eduardo, this is Sir Jorge.

266
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,532
He is the major's right-hand man.

267
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,869
-Eduardo?
-Yes, sir.

268
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
Perfect timing, we have a mission for you.

269
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,750
Go with Lucas.

270
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,547
Where are we going, sir?

271
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,425
To the new Japanese garrison
in the barrio.

272
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,348
Observe them thoroughly
and come back here to report.

273
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:20,101
Eduardo, get some rest.

274
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,771
I'll wake you when it's time to go.

275
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,648
All right, sir.

276
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,403
Do you know when he'll be back?

277
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,031
He'll be back in time for your return.

278
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,992
So you two must be careful.

279
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,958
Colonel Saitoh?

280
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,543
COMING UP

281
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,505
Can we meet tomorrow?

282
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,798
Where did Eduardo go?

283
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,300
They left. He's on a mission with Lucas.

284
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,593
It's too dangerous.

285
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,096
Your family never comes home anymore.

286
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,222
Where are they?

287
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,184
Mama! Mama!

288
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,353
Why are we here?

289
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,522
What is this place?

290
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,440
You're in hell.

291
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,858
So be prepared.

292
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,362
If you really want to marry
my daughter, Colonel,

293
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:17,075
you must keep Julio away from my family.

294
