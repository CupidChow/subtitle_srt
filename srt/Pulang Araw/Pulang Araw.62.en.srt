1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,545
Adelina and Eduardo still see each other.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:08,800
She also knows the whereabouts
of her rebel brother.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,593
Why isn't Teresita here with you?

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,470
She was abducted by the Japanese.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,848
Go to hell, you bastards!

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,307
Don't send my son away.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,519
Don't take him to a far-off place.

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,523
Don't let anger get the best of you,
Eduardo.

9
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,943
You better make sure
that Hiroshi Tanaka complies.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,321
I don't want him to get in my way anymore.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,533
And once he's gone, bring me Adelina.

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,161
Why is there still no sign of my daughter?

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,377
Forgive me, my son. I have failed you.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,462
You're right.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,090
We're surrounded by monsters.

16
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,301
You must be careful.

17
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,677
We'll escape.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,390
How are we going to escape
from these vile soldiers?

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,809
Hey, what's wrong?

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,604
Someone's here, I heard it.

21
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,647
PREVIOUSLY

22
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,439
How are you going to help us escape?

23
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,235
You're going to get us killed.

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,490
You might be educated,
but you aren't thinking.

25
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,995
Doesn't it make you sick
that we're raped every night?

26
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,418
And now, you dare put our lives at stake?

27
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,255
Teresita.

28
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,219
We'll surely get killed
if we're caught by the soldiers.

29
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,680
One of us tried to escape before,

30
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:23,393
but they took her life as punishment
and used her death to scare us.

31
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:30,191
If you think you can get out of here,
you're just wasting your time.

32
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,870
Why are you all here?

33
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,166
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,254
Why is no one answering?

35
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,557
It was you!
I thought I heard someone else.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,142
My apologies!

37
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,768
I'm feeling a bit sick.

38
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,315
No enemies in sight!

39
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,774
Let's keep moving!

40
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,664
The man is getting suspicious.

41
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,877
Don't make him any angrier.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,046
You know what will happen if you do.

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,184
That's enough talking!

44
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,854
All of you get out!

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,314
Now!

46
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,150
You heard him. Out.

47
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,785
You can't fool me.

48
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,498
Whatever it is you're planning to do,

49
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,500
for heaven's sake,

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,335
don't do it.

51
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,421
You'll never make it out of here alive.

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,509
I am just reminding you, so please.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,097
Now, go.

54
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,808
Leave. Hurry up.

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,114
Lorena.

56
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,410
We can still escape, okay?

57
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,038
I'll do everything I can.

58
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,355
Be on your way.

59
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,358
You don't have to take me inside,
I'll be okay.

60
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,737
Go. This is none of your business.

61
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,410
-Go.
-Adelina, be safe.

62
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,203
Thank you.

63
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,667
Go.

64
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,244
Hiroshi.

65
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,163
Were you able to meet with Eduardo?

66
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,670
Hiroshi, why are there soldiers here?

67
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,839
What do they want?

68
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,966
Let's talk inside.

69
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,847
They're here to fetch me.

70
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,849
Fetch you?

71
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,227
Why? Is there…

72
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,396
a new mission?

73
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,399
No, Adelina.

74
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,277
They're sending me to the province.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,905
I'm to be assigned there.

76
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,949
You agreed to this?

77
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,086
I was going to visit you
in your room, Teresita.

78
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,213
Get yourself ready.

79
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,550
I've already arranged for a priest
to officiate our wedding.

80
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,927
He's a Catholic.

81
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,850
That's how much I value you.

82
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,312
I'm even ready to embrace your religion.

83
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,356
This is happening so fast.

84
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,526
From what I know,

85
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,154
it's difficult to get a hold
of a priest these days

86
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,698
since they're always busy.

87
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,036
You might be forgetting that my rank

88
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,875
allows me to command whoever I want.

89
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,215
Adelina, I'm nothing but a mere soldier

90
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,968
who follows the orders of his superiors.

91
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,057
Is that why you're leaving?

92
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,521
I thought you promised
you wouldn't leave me.

93
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,276
-You said you wouldn't leave me!
-Adelina, no.

94
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,403
You're a liar!

95
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,240
You all promised
you wouldn't leave and abandon me,

96
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,783
but you all lied!

97
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,410
-Especially you! You're a liar!
-Adelina…

98
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,954
-You're a liar!
-Adelina, stop.

99
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,166
-Let go of me! No!
-Adelina…

100
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,752
No, let me go!

101
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,192
Why, Teresita?

102
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,404
Have you changed your mind?

103
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,244
I was just thinking
about what to wear for the occasion.

104
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,040
This dress Dolores gave me
doesn't seem appropriate for it.

105
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,004
I don't mind,

106
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,218
you're still the most
beautiful woman to me.

107
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,890
But weddings are very important
to our religion, Yuta.

108
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,525
I want to wear

109
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,362
a beautiful white dress
before I present myself to God.

110
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,658
Can we buy one?

111
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,082
But the priest is arriving soon.

112
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,877
The priest can wait, Yuta.

113
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,841
Didn't you say your rank
can command anyone you like?

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,347
Yuta, please grant my request.

115
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,601
Let's buy my wedding dress together.

116
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,154
Adelina.

117
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,783
No need to serve me.

118
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,871
You'll only make me miss it
when you're away.

119
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,415
You can have it.

120
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,883
Adelina.

121
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,986
Be safe, okay?

122
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,283
Take care of yourself.

123
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,288
I also left a letter for you.

124
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,832
It's in your room.

125
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,011
You can reread that letter
anytime you want.

126
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,857
Please carry it with you at all times.

127
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,026
Wherever you go.

128
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,072
I hope that my letter
can keep you company.

129
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,840
You take care too.

130
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,888
And I hope…

131
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:10,104
I won't have to wait another ten years
before you return.

132
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,068
Adelina.

133
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,198
Don't be silly. Ten years is too much.

134
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,912
I can't even survive a day
without seeing your face.

135
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,673
How did we end up like this, Hiroshi?

136
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,971
So many things are happening so fast.

137
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,891
Eduardo is in the guerilla.

138
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,518
Teresita is missing.

139
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,313
And now, you're leaving me.

140
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,568
You're going away to a far-off province.

141
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:02,865
I just want the world to stop,
just for a moment,

142
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,242
because I can't keep up anymore.

143
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,958
I hope we can just go back
to the way things were.

144
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,254
Back to when we only thought of
winning baseball games.

145
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,426
Adelina.

146
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:31,060
Adelina, don't make this sadder
for the both of us.

147
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,687
I promise I'll come back.

148
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,815
I'll find a way to come back to you.

149
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,196
And when I do,
I'll fulfill all my promises.

150
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,829
Then, I'll wait for you.

151
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,588
I'll wait for you.

152
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,527
Hiroshi.

153
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,407
It's time.

154
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,757
Go.

155
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,877
Hiroshi.

156
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,285
Looks like there's no one here.

157
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,829
Let's set up base here for now.

158
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,624
Alberto, call the others.

159
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,566
If you truly love your family
and your woman,

160
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:36,073
you'll do everything
for our freedom and our country.

161
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,826
I'm upset…

162
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,540
because I don't know

163
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,585
what could possibly happen to them.

164
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,576
One moment.

165
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,459
Call my driver. Hurry up.

166
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
Yes, sir.

167
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
Thank you for granting my request, Yuta.

168
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,392
Why would I deny such a simple request

169
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,480
from my future bride
if it will make her happy?

170
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,830
Let's not be deceived by the guerrillas.

171
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,500
And we should not give them any help.

172
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,629
Let's not allow our husbands
and sons to join them.

173
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,259
Their lives and their future
will only be wasted.

174
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,887
The truth is, the Japanese are kind.

175
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,307
Especially to those on their side.

176
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,396
They can be unforgiving
to those who side with the enemy,

177
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,814
the Americans.

178
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,529
If you want to live,
let's offer our loyalty to them.

179
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,031
Do you understand?

180
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,533
Yes.

181
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,159
Thank you very much.

182
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,584
Let's go.

183
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,170
Let's find the guerrillas.

184
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,631
There is someone I want to see.

185
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,260
-Who, Lauro?
-My wife's treacherous nephew.

186
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

187
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,682
I want to kill that demon myself!

188
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,336
Dad.

189
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,348
Our efforts led nowhere.

190
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,103
Your sister is still nowhere to be found.

191
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,194
Dad.

192
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,156
Dad, look at me.

193
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,620
We will not stop searching.

194
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,165
We won't give up on her.

195
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,100
Good day, Captain.

196
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,979
I've received the report
that Hiroshi has left his house.

197
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,482
He's now on his way to his new assignment.

198
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,609
Good.

199
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:29,616
It's time to arrest Adelina Dela Cruz.

200
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,596
-Adelina!
-What?

201
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,392
Go back. Something's not right.

202
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,520
No, this truck is not yours to use!

203
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,982
Stop the truck, I'll go back by myself.

204
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,152
-Stop the truck!
-Don't listen to him!

205
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,635
Follow him!

206
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,400
Yolanda!

207
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,651
Bow down!

208
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,154
Enough!

209
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,823
Take us to Adelina.

210
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,369
With all due respect,
may we know why you're looking for her?

211
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,247
Take us to Adelina this instant!

212
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,166
Yes, sir. Follow us.

213
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,129
I'm sorry to hear about Hiroshi,
Mr. Tanaka.

214
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,512
Others are so lucky.

215
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,266
They're free and safe.

216
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,935
Carmela, please.

217
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,686
-Enough…
-Señor!

218
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,980
-Señora!
-What's wrong?

219
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,608
They're looking for Adelina!

220
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,776
Who?

221
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,111
Where is she?

222
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,783
What do you want from her?

223
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,327
We came here to arrest her!

224
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,995
Arrest her?

225
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,998
For what reason?

226
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,210
One moment, please.

227
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,339
Captain, they have the right to know why.

228
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,757
It's an order from our superior.

229
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,301
I am only following it.
That woman is coming with us.

230
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,183
I won't allow it.
You will not take my daughter!

231
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,561
She's the only one I have!

232
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,127
Aside from the Japanese troops
looking for us,

233
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,586
what else is happening down there?

234
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,550
The enemy garrison was invaded
and attacked by two of our own.

235
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,885
That's why the Japanese
are retaliating severely.

236
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,555
-Long live the Emperor!
-Please have mercy!

237
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,390
I'm coming, Adelina.

238
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,018
Wait for me. I'm coming back for you.

239
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,978
-There he is!
-Wait!

240
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,147
Manuela, why is the devil here so soon?

241
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,356
Let me go, Colonel!

242
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,358
I beg you! Don't put me back here!

243
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,943
Please!

244
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:57,574
You only proved to me
that you cannot be trusted.

245
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,075
COMING UP

246
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,827
Help me!

247
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,496
Help me! Help me!

248
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,378
