1
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,415
Hiroshi.

2
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,335
Let's go. You might miss your ship.

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,258
Write to us often.

4
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,551
Take care of yourself.

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,055
Be careful, my son.

6
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,182
Yes, Mother.

7
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,184
Don't worry.

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,895
Hiroshi.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,646
Get in the car.

10
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,750
Wait a moment, Hiroshi.

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,086
I know this is important to you, so…

12
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,089
I'm giving it back.

13
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,557
Take care in Japan, Hiroshi.

14
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,941
Hiroshi. That's enough.

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,424
Just like
our father, we never saw Hiroshi again.

16
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,597
And like Hiroshi, it
seems like our father will not be coming back.

17
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,225
Raise your hand, Adelina.

18
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
Let's make a promise.

19
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,605
To do what, Teresita?

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,983
That when we grow up,

21
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:37,615
we will help each other
rebuild Papa's theater.

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,408
Promise me.

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,036
Let's promise each other.

24
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,290
Repeat after me, Adelina.

25
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,962
-I promise… - "I promise…"

26
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,842
…we will work hard, so that one day,

27
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,930
we can rebuild Papa's theater.

28
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,559
"We will work hard,

29
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:11,024
so that one day, we can
rebuild Papa's theater."

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,154
So Papa can return to us.

31
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,407
So Papa…

32
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,495
can return to us

33
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,707
the moment…

34
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,837
we have his theater rebuilt.

35
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,798
Teresita.

36
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,844
Hush now, Teresita.

37
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,726
Dry your tears, Teresita.

38
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,857
God will listen to our prayer.

39
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,653
I know Dad will come back.

40
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,365
I'm sure of it, Teresita.

41
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,161
I believe that your promise
will be fulfilled one day.

42
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,748
Don't worry.

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,170
I promise to always be by your side

44
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,465
to remind you of this day.

45
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,218
Thank you so much, Eduardo.

46
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,845
Thank you.

47
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,901
Teresita.

48
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:54,294
Teresita and I did
not forget that promise even after we grew up.

49
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,381
But as the year 1941 came…

50
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,844
We gradually felt the Japanese closing in

51
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,221
as well as the war they brought with them.

52
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,185
-That airplane. -They're here.

53
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,484
I can't be mistaken.
Those are Japanese planes.

54
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,820
Are they going to conquer us next?

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,327
I've been hearing those since I
was a kid, but they never came.

56
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,497
Because the truth is, even if they try,

57
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,793
the Japanese cannot
win against the Americans

58
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,670
because the whole world knows

59
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,674
how superior America's military power is.

60
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,426
That's right.

61
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,387
And besides, the Japanese are too polite.

62
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,555
Aren't they?

63
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,308
They'll probably bow to their enemy,

64
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:54,228
then offer them tea or
sushi, rather than fight.

65
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,397
Enough of that.

66
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,983
Let's go, I don't want to
be late for our audition.

67
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,986
Oh, right. You just never shut up, do you?

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,488
Okay, don't blame me.

69
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,075
Move aside! The king and his
princesses are coming through!

70
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,118
-You are so arrogant. -Just stop!

71
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,328
Move aside!

72
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,593
-Good morning! -Good morning.

73
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,761
And you are?

74
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,554
Adelina Dela Cruz, sir.

75
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,431
Teresita Borromeo, sir.

76
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,724
Borro...

77
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,608
How are you related to the
former impresario, Julio Borromeo?

78
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,612
He's our father, señor.

79
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,576
Yes, we have different surnames,
but I'm also his daughter.

80
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,996
Have you heard anything from him?

81
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,250
Has Julio returned to your family?

82
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,588
No, he has not.

83
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,050
But we're hoping that
Papa will come back to us.

84
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,762
She's right.

85
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,807
That's why we're here now.

86
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,560
We want to follow in his footsteps.

87
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:21,274
Teresita and I believe that, if he
finds out we're performing onstage,

88
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,901
performing vaudeville like
him, he'll come back immediately.

89
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,947
That's why we're hoping we'll
pass this audition, maestro.

90
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,160
This is the only way we can get to him.

91
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,752
He is a brilliant artist.

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,883
I hope you'll be as great as your father.

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,094
We will try our best, maestro.

94
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,854
Prove to me that you are the
children of Julio Borromeo!

95
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,231
Thank you, maestro.

96
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,146
Beautiful lady.

97
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:50,863
Are you the angel God sent to fetch me?

98
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,242
Why? Will you come with me?

99
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,078
We can go right now.

100
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,375
Do you want me to show
you the way to heaven?

101
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,837
Okay, go on. That's it.

102
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,106
Rosalia!

103
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,900
What are you doing?

104
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
I'm sorry. Is he your father?

105
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,989
No.

106
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,449
He's my husband.

107
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,663
-You're married? -Yes.

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,581
She is.

109
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,626
-You're ugly! -Come here! Quick!

110
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,587
Not you, you're pretty. You're ugly.

111
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,629
Wait!

112
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,882
You can't escape me.

113
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
I just want to talk to you...

114
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,471
Hey, you're crossing the line!

115
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,598
I said... Wait!

116
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,311
Calm down, sir. I just
need a moment to explain.

117
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,521
-Let me explain. -You're ugly!

118
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,398
-I said, wait! -You're not ugly.

119
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,319
Sir, I don't want to hurt you.

120
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,114
I know I'm also to blame for what happened.

121
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,200
But whether you believe it or
not, I didn't know she was married...

122
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,748
You're still ugly!

123
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,796
Rosalia…

124
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,716
Fine.

125
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,843
We're both ugly.

126
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,181
I'm sorry. Come, now.

127
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,098
Come on.

128
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,185
Get up.

129
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,063
And you…

130
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,442
You're a married woman,
don't be such a flirt.

131
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,527
Be an honest woman.

132
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,739
Here's your father. I mean, your husband.

133
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,366
My wife.

134
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,452
Rosalia, forgive me.

135
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,817
Enough!

136
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,777
Stop!

137
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,533
Why, maestro? Are you
satisfied with our performance?

138
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,452
Oh, my! Is that all you can show me?

139
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,581
You're just copycats of Katy Dela Cruz.

140
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,627
She's the one and only queen of vaudeville!

141
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,259
Tell me, why would I hire you in
my company if you'd only imitate her?

142
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,180
You know, if your father were here,

143
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,976
I'm sure he would agree with me.

144
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,937
He might even disown both of you.

145
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm sorry, maestro, but…

146
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,820
would you like us to
sing a different piece?

147
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,824
Teresita, what different piece?

148
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,910
We only mimic Katy's songs, don't we?

149
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,000
Just come back when you've found your own…

150
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,796
voice or identity as performers.

151
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,591
So you'll be worthy of being called

152
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,511
the daughters of your great father.

153
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,397
That old impresario doesn't know anything.

154
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,526
He just doesn't see
the talent you both have.

155
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,155
Good thing I stopped myself.

156
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,618
Because if I didn't, I would've punched him

157
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,954
because of the insults he threw at you.

158
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,167
I only felt sorry for him
because he was old, but…

159
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,630
if it were up to me, I would
have made him kiss the ground.

160
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,342
Eduardo, he has a point.

161
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,471
Maybe Adelina and I really
aren't meant for the stage.

162
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,472
What?

163
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,976
Teresita, I disagree.

164
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,313
We shouldn't be discouraged.

165
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,903
We should prove that old man
wrong and show him we can improve.

166
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,030
Adelina is right, Teresita.

167
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,700
So don't lose hope.

168
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:52,206
Work harder and show that old geezer

169
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,543
he judged you too quickly.

170
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,257
Teresita.

171
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,592
Cheer up.

172
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,804
We'll try again, okay?

173
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,972
For what?

174
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,142
To fail and be humiliated again?

175
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,356
Do you think it's easy to
accept what that maestro said?

176
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,194
I wanted the earth to swallow me whole.

177
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,870
Teresita, are you saying we
should just give up on our dream?

178
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,289
What about Dad?

179
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,084
What about our dream of
rebuilding his theater?

180
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,505
The dream we've had since we were kids.

181
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,050
Are we just going to give that up?

182
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,556
I thought you wanted Dad to
return. Are we giving up on him too?

183
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,963
You're right, Adelina.

184
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,885
We won't give up on our dreams.

185
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,638
Especially on Papa.

186
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,977
That's the spirit. You
really shouldn't give up.

187
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,607
I mean, I did a lot for the both of you.

188
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,986
I even took time off from
work just to come with you.

189
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,446
And then you'll just give up?

190
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
No way, Eduardo!

191
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:53,994
Not anymore.

192
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,623
Teresita and I will never
give up no matter what.

193
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,625
Right, Teresita?

194
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,835
So, come on. Let's make our promise again.

195
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,013
We won't give up no matter
what obstacle we face…

196
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,684
"We won't give up no matter
what obstacle we face…"

197
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,019
Until we get…

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,271
"Until we get…"

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,649
…the sweet approval…

200
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,319
"…the sweet approval…"

201
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
…of that grumpy old geezer!

202
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,450
"…of that grumpy old geezer!"

203
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,371
With his face, "Hmph!"

204
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,093
Let's never give up, Teresita.

205
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,057
We won't give up on anything.

206
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,688
Not on this theater.

207
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,066
Not on our dream.

208
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,531
Especially not on Dad, who'll
be coming back very soon.

209
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,018
Hush now, my crybaby princesses.

210
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,771
I still have a lot to do.
You've taken too much of my time.

211
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,025
Hold on, Eduardo. What's that?

212
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,111
Is that blood? What's that on your nose?

213
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,655
-What happened to you? -This is nothing.

214
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,950
I just tripped. Let's go.

215
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,034
Wait.

216
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,506
I wish that old impresario
tripped instead of you.

217
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,049
Then maybe he'd come to his senses.

218
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,926
Maybe would have hired us then.

219
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,635
That old geezer!

220
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,305
Here. You can keep this.

221
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,186
You're so thoughtful.

222
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,688
Maybe you're falling for me?

223
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,567
What are you saying, Eduardo?

224
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,048
- You're like a brother to me.
- "You're like a brother to me."

225
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,324
-You're unbelievable. -I'm just kidding.

226
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,910
- Well, it's not funny!
- You keep repeating yourself!

227
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,290
She's right, Eduardo. Your
jokes really aren't funny.

228
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,669
Besides, Teresita is
like a sister to you too.

229
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,462
Hold on, Adelina.

230
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,798
You're my only blood relative here.

231
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,634
Our mother and father are not the same.

232
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,804
So how can she be my sister?

233
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,100
That's why I said, you're
like a brother to me.

234
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,435
Which part of that didn't you understand?

235
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,067
That only means…

236
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,654
you're truly smitten with my sister.

237
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,075
Are you hearing yourself?

238
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,581
- Why would I fall for that ugly girl?
- Me? Ugly?

239
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,918
You're very pretty. Just
like me. We are both pretty!

240
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,549
My princesses are so
arrogant. Have some humility.

241
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,179
-He's annoyed. -He's annoyed.

242
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,847
Annoyed, huh?

243
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,350
Hey!

244
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,518
Are you going to hurt us?

245
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,979
Don't you remember what Mom said?

246
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,440
Don't ever hit a woman, especially me.

247
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,152
I'd like to see you try, Eduardo.

248
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,570
You want me to try?

249
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,070
Okay.

250
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,324
Idiots.

251
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,952
You're such a jerk, Eduardo!

252
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,145
Mama, I'm home.

253
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,568
- Good morning, seño...
- Francisco, leave us.

254
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,362
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,082
Mama, where did you find your driver?

256
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,045
I don't know why, but I
have a bad feeling about him.

257
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,589
I still prefer Mr. Juanito.

258
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,219
I agree. I wish you didn't send him away.

259
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,098
And what do you care
about my decision, bastard?

260
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,729
And you, Teresita.

261
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,819
You told me you were going to our
office. That's why I allowed you to leave.

262
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,405
But you never showed up.

263
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,449
-Where did you go? -Mama, forgive me.

264
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,493
The truth is, we went

265
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,705
to the vaudeville company
of a famous impresario,

266
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,207
Mr. Johnny Duque, for an audition.

267
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,087
However, Adelina and I didn't pass.

268
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,761
You have the gall to tell me this?

269
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,597
I sent you to college, Teresita.

270
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,691
Mama, you know this has
been our dream ever since.

271
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,819
It doesn't matter if that
uneducated bastard does it.

272
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,070
She belongs there!

273
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:07,284
With women who dance shamelessly
on stage and mingle with married men.

274
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,368
She fits right in!

275
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,539
But you are different, Teresita.

276
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:18,628
How will you marry a gentleman
from a respected family

277
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,340
if you do vaudeville?

278
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,968
But I should have known.

279
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,057
You're always with his bastard,
that's why you're like that.

280
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
Mama.

281
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,560
Don't blame her for this.

282
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,647
I just want to follow my heart.

283
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,109
Adelina and I are meant for the stage.

284
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,445
We can't deny that.

285
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,699
But I won't allow you to
ruin your bright future!

286
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,913
So from now on, you will not do vaudeville.

287
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,374
I'm telling you, Teresita.

288
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:01,171
Put an end to that worthless
dream of yours, do you understand?

289
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,309
Don't you turn your back on me, Teresita.

290
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,062
You will do as I say.

291
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,355
Answer me!

292
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,235
Your stubbornness won't work on me anymore.

293
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,153
I repeat.

294
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:30,992
You will do as I say and
you will not do vaudeville.

295
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,120
Do you understand?

296
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,915
Do you understand?

297
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,876
Yes. Yes, Mama.

298
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,838
You better stick to your promises.

299
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,258
And don't you ever try me, Teresita.

300
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,885
I'm warning you.

301
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,304
You'll regret it.

302
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,468
We shouldn't let anyone oppress us.

303
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,095
Tell Teresita that too.

304
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,680
Tell her to fight for her dream.

305
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,784
How about you,
Eduardo? What do you dream for yourself?

306
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,271
That's enough. The young lady you
like might melt from your staring.

307
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,064
Shut up, she might hear you.

308
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,816
Where could Papa be?

309
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,985
I've been wondering that too.

310
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,948
If I only had an available son,
we could marry him and Teresita

311
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:58,413
to make an honest
woman out of your daughter as soon as possible.

312
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,374
I can no longer trust you, Teresita.

313
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,001
Eduardo, did you notice

314
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,479
that there
seem to be more Japanese coming here?

315
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:09,299
Do you think the rumors are
true, that they will invade us next?

316
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,178
COMING UP

317
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,101
