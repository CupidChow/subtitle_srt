1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002
Eduardo.

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,171
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,926
We're not merely soldiers.
We'll win this war.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:15,974
The whole Japanese Imperial Army
are warriors bound by honor and duty.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,560
-Long live the Emperor!
-Long live!

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,688
Do you also smell that stench?

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,523
I think something is rotting.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,900
It seems to be coming from a dead animal.

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,403
Uncle Lauro has his vices,
but to kill someone?

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,363
Do we really know our uncle?

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,284
Do we know how far he would go
when he's desperate for money?

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,869
What about Hiroshi?

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,496
He'll be hurt when he hears about
what happened to his mother.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,832
I really don't feel good
about this place, Ryo.

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,336
-I have to go home.
-I'll go see Hiroshi.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,381
I'll ask Eduardo to go with me,
so I'll wait for him to come back.

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,884
And as if that wasn't enough,
you even murdered Mrs. Tanaka!

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,766
All you do is bring misfortune
and trouble to this family!

19
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,517
Try to arrest me!

20
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,937
-Lauro, she's your daughter! Lauro!
-Stay back!

21
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,733
People like you are useless.

22
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,324
Lauro, she's your daughter!

23
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,993
If you don't back off,
I'll hurt this child!

24
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,870
Lauro, please don't! She's your daughter!

25
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,876
Kneel!

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,218
He had accomplices
when he broke into the Tanakas'.

27
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,429
But I don't know their names, sir.

28
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,014
Leave your uncle to us.

29
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,851
-Thank you, sir.
-Now, move.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,853
Amalia.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,730
Dad!

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,984
-Luisa!
-Dad!

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,244
You ungrateful wretch!

34
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,331
After everything Lauro and I
have done for you,

35
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,292
this is how you repay us?

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,920
You'd turn your own kin
over to the authorities?

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,589
Wait a moment, Auntie.

38
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,843
Why are you mad at me?

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,139
I'm not the murderer here.

40
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,267
It was Uncle Lauro
who wronged the Tanakas!

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,144
Did you see what he did to your daughter?

42
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,855
Tanaka is just your employer!

43
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,526
And he's Japanese,
you shouldn't take his side!

44
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,239
Why did you betray Lauro?

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,326
We're your family!

46
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,876
I should be angry with you.

47
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,589
Because my own family…

48
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,677
betrayed my friend.

49
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,430
Do you know how painful that is?

50
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,185
To carry the guilt of Uncle Lauro's crime

51
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,147
for the rest of my life!

52
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,568
And until the day I die,

53
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,154
I will regret trusting him.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,158
Uncle Eduardo, Mom, please stop.

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,286
Just bring Dad back home.

56
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,748
Luisa, forgive me.

57
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,710
Don't touch her.

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,258
Don't you ever come see us again.

59
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,179
I no longer consider you family.

60
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,099
You're a traitor.

61
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,394
Traitor!

62
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,523
Judas!

63
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,192
Judas!

64
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,362
Go away!

65
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,364
What are you waiting for? Leave!

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,234
How are you, Hiroshi?

67
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,863
Despite your current situation,

68
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,450
I'm still hoping you're doing well.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,037
In a way, we're both prisoners.

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,752
You are in prison
because of your blood and race,

71
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:40,548
and I've long been a prisoner
in my own father's house.

72
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:48,598
In these times when our safety,
future, and lives are uncertain,

73
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,602
the only thing I'm praying for,

74
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,646
despite the trials that come our way,

75
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,818
is that kindness and love
still reign in the hearts of people.

76
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Hiroshi.

77
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,076
I was able to ask for some water

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,621
from a kind constable.

79
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,333
Drink it.

80
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,672
Mother, I'm thirsty.

81
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,800
I want some water too.

82
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,595
You have to bear the thirst
a bit more, my son.

83
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,181
Ryo.

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,142
Give this to the boy instead.

85
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,659
Thank you.

86
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,577
-Please drink.
-Okay.

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,209
Give him the rest.

88
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,629
He needs to drink too.

89
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,426
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

90
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,178
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,858
Hiroshi, drink this.

92
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,753
Ryo…

93
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,840
You drink the rest.

94
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,800
I know you're thirsty too.

95
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,321
Excuse me.

96
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,618
-Here, please drink.
-Thank you very much.

97
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,286
Don't mention it.

98
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,959
Good evening, men.

99
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,922
We're here to visit one of your detainees.

100
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,595
You'll need to ask for permission first.

101
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,766
I have a letter with me…

102
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,063
from our mayor.

103
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,997
All right, you can let him through.

104
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,083
I know Eduardo, anyway.

105
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,337
Please come in, but you can't stay long.

106
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,423
Call him out here.

107
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,135
-Thank you, Dado.
-Thank you.

108
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,146
Hiroshi.

109
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,901
Good evening, Mr. Borromeo.

110
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,990
I'm very grateful
that you visited me once again.

111
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,828
I brought you some bread.

112
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,582
I'm sorry if it has gotten cold.

113
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,251
Those are leftovers
from our breakfast this morning.

114
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,795
I'm sorry if that's all I have right now.

115
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,631
The stores are running out of food.

116
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,551
You don't need to apologize, sir.

117
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,637
You've helped us enough.

118
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,641
Thank you very much.

119
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,523
Eduardo.

120
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,151
What's wrong with you?

121
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,864
Why is my best friend so quiet?

122
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,827
Aren't you happy that I'm still alive?

123
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,590
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,511
I'm sorry, Hiroshi.

125
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,516
Forgive me.

126
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,066
Wait.

127
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,198
Why are you asking
for forgiveness, Eduardo?

128
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,250
Mr. Borromeo.

129
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,629
What's happening?

130
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,931
You're both starting to scare me.

131
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,980
Eduardo, tell me the truth.

132
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,484
What happened?

133
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,001
Do you think Dad safely got to Hiroshi?

134
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,066
Are you really going to
ignore me, Teresita?

135
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,696
Do you still hate me?

136
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,256
I could never hate you.

137
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,020
I might be upset, yes.

138
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,568
But I could never hate you.

139
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,243
Teresita…

140
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,836
Speak up.

141
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,006
Is it about my parents?

142
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,719
What happened to them?

143
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,683
Were they also arrested
by the constabulary?

144
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,816
Your father…

145
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,153
was arrested earlier.

146
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,282
Was he brought here too?

147
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,909
No, sir.

148
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,412
He's most likely imprisoned
somewhere else.

149
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,835
It's a pity we won't
get to see each other.

150
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,881
But I feel at ease knowing…

151
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,800
he is safe.

152
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,719
Along with my mother.

153
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,898
My father and mother are together, right?

154
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,737
They were probably arrested
and imprisoned together.

155
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
No, Hiroshi.

156
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,211
It pains us deeply
to be the bearer of this news, but…

157
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,135
your mother is gone.

158
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,096
She passed away.

159
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,807
She died earlier.

160
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,065
Why did she die?

161
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,696
How did she die?

162
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,883
Mama, I'm tired of arguing with you.

163
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,345
Well, in that case,
I just wanted to let you know

164
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,766
that I've arranged
Haruka's burial for tomorrow.

165
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,393
Tomorrow?

166
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,523
Aren't we going to hold a wake
for Hiroshi's mother?

167
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,818
And wait for Mr. Tanaka
to be released so he can join us.

168
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,029
Adelina, please.

169
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,908
Stop trying to bootlick the Tanakas.

170
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:56,080
Besides, we don't know
when Mr. Tanaka will be released.

171
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,415
What do you want?

172
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,584
For Haruka's body to rot?

173
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,878
Is that it?

174
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,296
It's better this way.

175
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,215
We won't have to worry about them anymore.

176
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,843
Mama, where is the burial?

177
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,180
We'll go there
and ask Papa to come with us.

178
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,767
You're going out at a time like this?

179
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,143
It's dangerous.

180
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,856
Mama, we're friends with Hiroshi's family.

181
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,859
It's only right that we pay our respects.

182
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,280
-You're right, Teresita.
-Do whatever you want.

183
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
Go ask Francisco.

184
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,079
But if your hearts are weak,

185
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,708
where will you two end up?

186
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,966
Your empathy can put you at risk.

187
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,062
Teresita.

188
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,820
Please don't get mad
with what I'm about to say.

189
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,073
What is it?

190
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,325
I think your mother is Satan's spawn.

191
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,550
Eduardo.

192
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,427
Answer me.

193
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,096
Why did my mother die?

194
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,265
She was shot by…

195
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,144
scoundrels who broke into your home.

196
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,233
She didn't make it to the hospital.

197
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,237
She died in your home.

198
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
Forgive me, I couldn't defend her.

199
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,338
I never imagined this would happen.

200
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,427
Who killed her?

201
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,515
Were they caught?

202
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,644
They've caught…

203
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,691
the culprit, according to Eduardo.

204
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,487
And they're currently
looking for his accomplices.

205
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,411
Eduardo, who are those merciless people?

206
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,999
I want to know their names.

207
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,043
Who killed my mother?

208
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,257
Eduardo, I know that you know.

209
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,343
Mr. Borromeo just said so.

210
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,179
Who killed my mother?

211
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
It was Uncle Lauro.

212
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,980
My uncle.

213
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,707
Damn flies!

214
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,713
I really don't trust
our lieutenant colonel.

215
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,343
Captain, the lieutenant colonel
might hear you.

216
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,387
You'll get me in trouble.

217
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,351
I feel uneasy.

218
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,899
Colonel Arata will not leave us
all of a sudden

219
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,901
without saying goodbye.

220
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,071
I think something bad happened to him.

221
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:04,244
And you suspect
the lieutenant colonel is behind it?

222
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:13,086
Only the rotten smell and the flies
can reveal the truth.

223
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,886
Your relative?

224
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,598
I had no idea Uncle Lauro would do that.

225
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,356
I entrusted your parents to him,
but this is what he did.

226
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,193
Forgive me, my friend.

227
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,035
-I trusted you!
-Hiroshi.

228
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,329
Don't blame Eduardo.

229
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,374
But I didn't think
you would be one to betray them.

230
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,584
I didn't want this to happen.

231
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,214
I didn't want this to happen, Hiroshi.

232
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,635
I trusted him. That was my mistake.

233
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,303
Please forgive me.

234
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,681
Leave.

235
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,434
I don't want to see you right now.

236
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,437
Hiroshi.

237
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,692
Calm down, son.

238
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,444
For heaven's sake, Mr. Borromeo.

239
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,906
Please leave.

240
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,873
Let's go, Eduardo.

241
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,942
Day and night,

242
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,695
they keep attacking us.

243
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,575
We're truly helpless against the Japanese.

244
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,999
We're also helpless against the conflicts
coming into our lives and relationships.

245
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,172
Don't take Hiroshi's words to heart.

246
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,718
He said those things out of anger.

247
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,305
Once he calms down,

248
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,518
I'm sure he'll realize
it wasn't your fault.

249
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,397
Even if he didn't get mad at me, Uncle…

250
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,526
I will still blame myself.

251
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,824
It is with guilt that I am the reason

252
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,619
why he lost his mother.

253
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,339
And what will you gain

254
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,592
from blaming yourself?

255
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,261
Especially during these times

256
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,140
when our lives are full of uncertainties.

257
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,648
Go on.

258
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,484
Head upstairs and get some rest.

259
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,487
I'll be heading home too.

260
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
Take care, Uncle.

261
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,005
Yuki and I…

262
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,176
have also lost our parents.

263
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,308
That's why I know
what you're going through right now.

264
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,483
Mr. Hiroshi, we offer our condolences.

265
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,902
Now, tell me.

266
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:11,366
Can you still trust
those traitorous Filipinos?

267
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,622
Mr. Yamada, don't generalize.

268
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,583
Because, just like us,

269
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:24,254
there are still good people among them.

270
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,089
Where are the good ones?

271
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:34,389
Why did they let us
suffer these injustices?

272
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,644
I don't care if I get beaten up or die.

273
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,525
I will avenge my mother.

274
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,165
Lieutenant Colonel, aren't you
going to order us to look for the colonel?

275
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,667
There's chaos outside.

276
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:08,298
I won't let any of you go out
and look for him.

277
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,841
Not a single one!

278
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,177
I wanted to see how you're doing.

279
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,638
Are you going to hate me
since your fiancé is mad at me?

280
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,058
Adelina hasn't told you yet,
but there will be no wedding.

281
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,142
COMING UP

282
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,562
What crime did Hiroshi do,
as well as the other Japanese civilians?

283
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,191
Adelina, I don't have time
to argue about an order I did not make.

284
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,568
It was the Commonwealth government.

285
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,697
Be careful with your words, Adelina.
It might put you in danger.

286
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,243
My only allies right now are my own kin.

287
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,869
So I need your help.

288
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,537
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,878
