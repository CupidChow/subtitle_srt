1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:07,132
If you’re looking for my brother,
I don’t know where he’s hiding.

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>I'll use you in some other way.</i>

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>Did they catch Adelina?</i>

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,388
What did the Colonel do to her?

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,223
Is she still alive?

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,561
<i>Why are you so concerned for her?</i>

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,148
They'll only release her
if Eduardo or I surrender.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>Where's your pistol?</i>

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>I must've left it in my quarters.</i>

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>What impeccable timing.</i>

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>Hiroshi just used a gun against me.</i>

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,077
Was that your gun, Akio?

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:41,332
<i>He's just using Adelina to force Teresita
and Eduardo to surrender?</i>

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,087
<i>Yuta, leave Adelina alone.</i>

15
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,173
I'll do what you wish,

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,134
but you must come back home to me.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,344
<i>Saitoh is suspecting me.</i>

18
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,221
He thinks I'm no longer loyal to him.

19
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,973
I know you're a good man
and a good soldier.

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,308
<i>So, do what’s right.</i>

21
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>Help us escape.</i>

22
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Keep an eye on Akio.</i>

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

25
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>I’m giving you until tonight to come back.</i>

26
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>Or else, something bad
will happen to Adelina.</i>

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>Eduardo…</i>

28
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>He needs to know about this.
so he can save our sister.</i>

29
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,414
But I don't know where Eduardo is.

30
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,832
We need to talk, Eduardo.

31
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,959
There's something you need to know.

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,381
PREVIOUSLY

33
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,508
They want Teresita and I to surrender
in exchange for Adelina's freedom.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,387
That means Teresita escaped.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,472
I saw that poster at Plaza Sta. Cruz.

36
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,893
Saitoh just couldn't leave us alone,
can he?

37
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,024
Why would he?

38
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,570
You’re the face of the resistance.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,408
I’m certain that you know they’ll do
whatever it takes to capture you

40
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,995
so they can weaken your group’s morale

41
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,331
and put an end to this opposition.

42
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,333
That damned Colonel.

43
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,503
Eduardo, does this mean
they're going to kill Adelina

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,672
if both of you don't surrender?

45
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,800
Comrades.

46
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,762
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to need your help.

47
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,473
I must save my sister.

48
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,645
I won’t force anyone,
but I'll forever be grateful.

49
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,022
Count me in, Commander.

50
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,982
Me too, Uncle.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,444
We'll help you save your sister.

52
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,366
I’ll go too.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,331
Raise your fists
if you’re willing to help Eduardo!

54
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,708
- Us too, Commander!
- We’re with you, Commander!

55
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,168
Me too, Commander!

56
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,045
Prepare yourselves, men.

57
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,839
We’ll leave as soon as possible.

58
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,347
Lord God.

59
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
Please give us

60
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,896
the courage to overcome our situation.

61
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,236
Please save Adelina, Hiroshi, and me.

62
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,959
Adelina.

63
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,211
Why is that soldier looking at us?

64
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
What's he going to do to us, Adelina?

65
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,467
My Lord.

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,347
Please don't lead us into temptation.

67
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,854
Sister, don’t be afraid.

68
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,608
I know Akio.

69
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,197
He's not a greedy man like Saitoh
who will do anything to get what he wants.

70
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,244
But we should fear him.

71
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,748
Our lives depend on him.

72
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,397
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,274
Thy kingdom come.

74
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:17,984
Thy will be done…

75
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,825
Teresita.

76
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,952
Where are you?

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,122
What is it going to be?

78
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,292
Are you coming back?

79
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,795
Or not?

80
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,641
Are you going to disobey me?

81
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,025
As time passes,

82
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,657
I can’t think of any other way

83
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,992
to save my sister.

84
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,580
<i>Be safe out there.</i>

85
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,332
<i>You too, Teresita.</i>

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,292
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

87
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,088
<i>- I love you very much.
- I love you very much too.</i>

88
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,066
Colonel.

89
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
Why are you back so soon?

90
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,825
Do you have something to report?

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,998
I caught Captain Watanabe
talking to Hiroshi Tanaka.

92
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,793
What were they talking about?

93
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,712
Forgive me, Colonel.

94
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,506
But I couldn't hear
what they're talking about.

95
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,050
After their conversation,

96
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,680
he also checked on the nun
and Adelina Dela Cruz

97
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,432
in their cell.

98
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,727
Colonel, your suspicion could be right.

99
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,775
I don't think Captain Watanabe
should be trusted.

100
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,323
Well done.

101
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,326
Thank you.

102
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,412
Yes, sir!

103
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,596
<i>Why do you still fear him?</i>

104
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,642
How long are you going to tolerate
his evil deeds?

105
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,144
Until it's too late?

106
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,022
Until he has killed many more?

107
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,111
He might kill you too,
just like what he did to Colonel Arata.

108
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,408
Akio, you are a good man.

109
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,603
<i>My dear Akio.</i>

110
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,108
<i>How have you been, my son?</i>

111
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,114
<i>Your siblings and I
are doing well here in Nagasaki.</i>

112
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,118
<i>We all miss you so much.</i>

113
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,205
<i>I'm waiting for your return, my son.</i>

114
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>Please take care of yourself.</i>

115
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>Thank you for bringing honor
to our family.</i>

116
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,716
<i>We're so proud of you.</i>

117
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,845
Watanabe.

118
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,231
Colonel, do you need something from me?

119
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
Drink it.

120
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,544
Do I have to repeat myself?

121
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,423
I said drink!

122
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,485
That has poison.

123
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,992
It’s a prank, soldier.

124
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,330
You got me there, Colonel.

125
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,209
Why, Akio?

126
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:15,132
Is there a reason for me
to take your life away?

127
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,469
None at all, Colonel.

128
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,265
You know how loyal I am to our army.

129
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,272
To our army?

130
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,609
Of course.

131
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,034
But are you loyal to me?

132
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,537
Yes, Colonel.

133
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,500
I am your most loyal soldier.

134
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,692
- Miss!
- Sir.

135
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,612
Any news from your trip?

136
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,450
Did you see anyone
at the house of the Tanakas?

137
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,702
Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka wasn’t there.

138
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,788
The servants were also gone.

139
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,083
Their house looked abandoned to me.

140
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,295
I also asked help from my cousin

141
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,340
whose husband is secretly part
of the resistance.

142
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,720
They might know who Eduardo Dela Cruz is.

143
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,889
They do know him.

144
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,684
But they don't know where he is right now.

145
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,604
I'm so sorry, Miss.

146
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,106
I know this isn't the news
you're expecting.

147
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,662
<i>I’m giving you until tonight to come back.</i>

148
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,917
<i>Or else, something bad
will happen to Adelina.</i>

149
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>I will hold the gun myself and kill her.</i>

150
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,717
Looks like I have no choice left.

151
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,852
Captain, you called.

152
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,278
Here are all the documents I have.

153
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,405
Take it.

154
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,991
I'm leaving those to you.

155
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
Whatever happens to me,

156
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,171
you'll be the one in charge of everything.

157
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,090
Whatever happens to you?

158
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,050
What do you mean, sir?

159
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,024
I'm going to get killed,

160
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,112
just like Colonel Arata.

161
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,823
Whom are you referring to, sir?

162
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,704
Don't worry.

163
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,041
I'm hard to kill.

164
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,004
Do you perhaps have any enemies
in our army?

165
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,214
You can tell me.

166
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,674
You may go.

167
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,595
Don't tell anyone what I’ve told you.

168
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,555
Yes, sir.

169
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,724
Understood.

170
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,658
Mother.

171
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,248
I'll die honorably.

172
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,252
That's a promise.

173
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,428
This is the office of Colonel Yuta Saitoh.

174
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,599
I'll do as you say, Yuta.

175
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,855
I'll surrender.

176
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,665
<i>I'm glad you made the right decision.</i>

177
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,919
<i>You have nowhere else to go,</i>

178
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,005
<i>but to me.</i>

179
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,891
<i>I’m giving you until today to return.</i>

180
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,230
<i>I'll be waiting for you, Mrs. Saitoh.</i>

181
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,581
Miss, what are you looking for?

182
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,169
I’m looking for something

183
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,881
I can use against that monster.

184
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,598
I have a dagger hidden here somewhere.

185
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,852
I can give it to you if you like.

186
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,147
I won't be able to take that
inside their camp.

187
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,650
If I'm going to be checked,

188
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:13,532
I need a weapon of some sort,

189
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,868
something that they won't suspect.

190
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,460
Are you sure about your decision?

191
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,836
You’ll be in great danger

192
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,546
if you surrender to the Japanese.

193
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm not afraid.

194
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:37,264
This is the only way to stop Yuta
once and for all.

195
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,788
No, put that bottle down.

196
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,165
That's a powerful poison for rats.

197
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,754
It can also kill humans and other animals.

198
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,715
Especially if you inhale a lot of it.

199
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,904
Who's responsible for this mess?

200
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,283
Remove the dead bodies here!

201
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,660
Quickly!

202
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,755
Can you really die by just inhaling this?

203
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,757
Yes, miss.

204
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:41,388
That can kill you through your mouth,
nose, eyes, and body.

205
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,224
Even just by a drop.

206
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,210
Miss?

207
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,378
What are you doing?

208
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,020
<i>Commander, there's a checkpoint.</i>

209
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,146
<i>Don't be too obvious.</i>

210
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,439
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

211
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,524
<i>- Did you take a wrong turn?
- I see.</i>

212
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,817
You’re not Japanese, are you?

213
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,152
You’re Filipinos!

214
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,656
<i>I'm ready to kill and die.</i>

215
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,450
<i>I'm going to kill that devil.</i>

216
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>My wife has decided to come back
to save Adelina Dela Cruz.</i>

217
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,457
<i>As soon as she returns,
carry out my orders immediately.</i>

218
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>- Hiroshi, follow me.
- Where are we going?</i>

219
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,169
To Adelina's cell.

220
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,129
<i>We will set them free.</i>

221
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,047
Adelina?

222
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,340
Where's Adelina?

223
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,716
COMING UP

224
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,014
