1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,045
<i>I'm carrying the child of the devil.</i>

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,922
<i>How can I be with you?</i>

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>This war may have tainted us for good.</i>

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,720
But one thing will never change, Teresita.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>And that is my love for you.</i>

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,391
<i>Good day to you, sir.</i>

7
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>- What's your purpose, sir?
- We're looking for a Filipina.</i>

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,105
Eduardo, Colonel Saitoh is there.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,898
He's looking for you, Teresita.

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>Search the entire church for Teresita!</i>

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>- Yes, Colonel!
- Who is this man?</i>

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,074
<i>Was he telling the truth?
Did you kill my father?</i>

13
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,954
I didn't realize that I shot
and killed your father.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>Are you sure my wife is not here?</i>

15
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,209
<i>Yes, sir. She's not here with us.</i>

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,004
Liars! Men, find her this instant!

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,380
<i>Forgive me, my love.</i>

18
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>I don't know
if I can ever forgive you, Hiroshi.</i>

19
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,344
<i>Maybe only time will tell.</i>

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,721
Hide, Teresita.

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>She was just here.
How could she disappear?</i>

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>Maybe she got scared and ran away.</i>

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>I don't want to be a burden to you.</i>

24
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>Only time can tell if we survive or not.</i>

25
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>Think about the guerillas,
who risk their lives every day at war.</i>

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,452
What if you put us
or yourself in Hiroshi's shoes?

27
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,581
<i>What if it was you
who unintentionally killed his father?</i>

28
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,459
<i>Would you want him to forgive you or not?</i>

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,436
PREVIOUSLY

30
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,940
Who are you listening to?

31
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,151
It's General Douglas MacArthur.

32
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,982
Good afternoon.

33
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,158
Who are these people, Sister?

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,661
I saw them on the street.

35
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,747
They were crying.

36
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,291
Her husband was just killed
by the Japanese.

37
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,751
I couldn't just leave them there.

38
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,967
You keep bringing people here out of pity.

39
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,305
What if one of them is a Makapili?

40
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,390
Or a spy of the enemy?

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,061
You're putting me at risk, Sister.

42
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,357
You know very well
that those soldiers are still after me

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,400
with a bounty on my head.

44
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,862
I have good news for you.

45
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,907
Is it true, Commander?

46
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,992
Have the Americans came back?

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,579
One of our trusted local chiefs
told us the news.

48
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,414
He has ties to the Americans.

49
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,085
The war is still ongoing.

50
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,421
But I'm confident that soon enough,

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,092
Leyte will fall into the hands
of the Americans.

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,845
I'm also certain the Americans
will infiltrate the other provinces next.

53
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,390
And Manila.

54
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,519
This city has been the center
of our enemy's greed and brutality.

55
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,772
We'll wait for them.

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,025
Thank you for this good news, Commander.

57
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,695
You've surely lifted our spirits.

58
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,489
You gave us hope,

59
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,576
and now we know that our sacrifices
have not been in vain.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,455
Freedom is within our grasp, Eduardo.

61
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,499
Have faith.

62
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,672
I heard that the Americans
are gradually winning in Europe.

63
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,258
Looks like this is the end for us.

64
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,261
- Shame on you, Lieutenant!
- Are you doubting our own army?

65
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,846
- That's impossible!
- What did you say?

66
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,723
- That won't happen…
- Silence, all of you!

67
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,434
Do not speak of defeat, Nakamura.

68
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,063
We will fight till the very end.

69
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,110
We won't retreat,
and we will never surrender.

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,036
We fight or we die.

71
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,956
I can't just abandon our people,

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,710
who are in need of help and shelter.

73
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,923
We have nothing left to feed them.

74
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,094
We'll find a way.

75
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,722
Just like we always do, right?

76
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,692
You may stay with us for now.

77
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,737
Rosing will take care of you.

78
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,990
- She'll take you to your resting space.
- Thank you very much.

79
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,078
Thank you for your kindness.

80
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>All right.</i>

81
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,140
<i>We won't stay much longer.</i>

82
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,309
Farewell.

83
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,898
Just a moment, my lady.

84
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,484
I want to introduce myself.

85
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,194
My name is Tasyo.

86
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,496
Thank you for visiting us here.
May I know your name?

87
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,542
Tasyo, this is Commander Liwayway.

88
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,713
She's one of the most respected
commanders of the Hukbalahap.

89
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,600
Forgive me for intruding.

90
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:20,106
It's just that I've never met
such a lady who fights in such clothing.

91
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,234
You don't look like you fight
in that dress…

92
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,822
I don't fight to entice fools like you!

93
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,283
- You got that, boy?
- Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm a woman who's capable
of striking down her enemies.

95
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,126
I don't hold back towards insolent men.

96
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,503
Commander.

97
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,090
Tasyo can be a foolish lad sometimes.

98
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,178
But I can assure you,
he has good intentions for the country.

99
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,056
- Please forgive him.
- Yes, I'm usually pretty tough.

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm only shaking right now
because of fear.

101
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,519
You may lower your blade now.

102
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,110
Go along now. Goodbye.

103
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,945
Please take this with you.

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,615
Give that to them.

105
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,741
Thank you very much.

106
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,380
Be safe, ma'am.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,018
She's so beautiful, Eduardo.

108
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,063
And she's brave.
You're perfect for each other.

109
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,359
Only Teresita holds my heart, Tasyo.

110
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,571
No one can take her place.

111
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,829
I just hope she's safe

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,457
with her child.

113
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,670
I hope they're still alive.

114
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,544
<i>Do you remember the time, Hiroshi,</i>

115
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,462
<i>when you brought Eduardo
and me to a restaurant</i>

116
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,590
<i>owned by a foreign Black man?</i>

117
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,177
<i>I can never forget that day.</i>

118
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,808
<i>Our gazes and smiles at each other
make it so easy for me to remember.</i>

119
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>Back then, I felt like we shared
the same feelings.</i>

120
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,568
<i>I thought you loved me, too.</i>

121
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,071
<i>But now I know you didn't.</i>

122
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,824
<i>I was the only one feeling that way.</i>

123
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>Because if you do love me,</i>

124
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,786
<i>why aren't you back yet?</i>

125
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,372
<i>Why haven't you returned?</i>

126
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>I guess I'm the only one
who loves you between us.</i>

127
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,255
<i>I probably don't matter to you.</i>

128
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,594
You're reading her letter again.

129
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,723
I never should've let her

130
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,769
leave without me.

131
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,648
We'd probably still be together by now.

132
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,608
What could've happened to them?

133
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,820
I hope she's still alive
with Sister Manuela.

134
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,782
- Sergeant!
- What's wrong, Kadyo?

135
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,784
We saw soldiers coming this way.

136
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,452
There are so many of them.

137
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,204
We're outnumbered.

138
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,455
They're searching the area.

139
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,123
They're probably looking for us.

140
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,125
All of you!

141
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,920
We're evacuating this instant! Go!

142
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,713
Move!

143
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,465
Move!

144
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,217
- Go!
- Move faster!

145
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,555
Have mercy on us!

146
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,433
Please set us free!

147
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,977
God, help us!

148
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,356
Sir, please have pity!

149
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,233
Who are these people?

150
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,110
Silence!

151
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,242
We've just captured them.
They're guerrillas, sir.

152
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,161
May I know where the Colonel is?

153
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,040
The Colonel is busy.

154
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,293
You shouldn't have brought them here!

155
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,131
- Kill them all right now!
- Yes, sir!

156
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,056
Please have mercy on us!

157
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,577
Ma'am, please watch us at Cine Bayani.

158
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,790
Sir, please watch us at Cine Bayani.

159
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,336
Ma'am, please watch us at Cine Bayani.

160
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,257
Sir, please watch us at Cine Bayani.

161
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,028
Sir, please watch us at Cine Bayani.

162
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,798
Lord, please forgive us.

163
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,005
Forgive me for intruding, Sister Carmela.

164
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,216
But your carriage has arrived.

165
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,108
Thank you very much, Sister Maria.

166
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,318
I'll be back very soon.

167
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,655
May the Lord guide you, child.

168
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,159
The ghost is clear.
Make sure to sell that to Mrs. Socorro.

169
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,787
- Use the money to buy food.
- Aren't you coming with me?

170
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,581
I have somewhere to be.

171
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,625
Go.

172
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,148
Looks like vaudeville is not dead.

173
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,755
Morena!

174
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,215
I mean, Sister.

175
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,967
I've been waiting for you.

176
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,970
Who is that young boy?

177
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,180
The one practicing?

178
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,475
He's a new talent around here.

179
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,645
His name is Golay.

180
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,773
He'll be performing tomorrow,

181
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,817
that's why he's been practicing nonstop.

182
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,698
<i>What's do you call this dance again, Dad?</i>

183
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,868
<i>This is what you call tap dance, my dear.</i>

184
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,045
<i>Crying nonstop</i>

185
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,296
<i>Don't stop.</i>

186
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,507
<i>Ouch! Oh, no!</i>

187
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,883
<i>Silly clown</i>

188
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,594
<i>Don't let</i>

189
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,682
<i>your resentment towards each other</i>

190
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,270
<i>overwhelm the blood that flows
through your veins.</i>

191
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,734
<i>I endured for ten years!</i>

192
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,070
<i>Being away from my daughters
to save up money</i>

193
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
<i>and rebuild my theater.</i>

194
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>You sold my land and my theater?</i>

195
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,329
<i>My only legacy for my children?</i>

196
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm here now.

197
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,793
We won't part ways again.

198
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,806
Sister?

199
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,643
Why are you crying?

200
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,397
Are you perhaps reminiscing
your days here?

201
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,866
Omar.

202
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,620
This is a large sum of money.

203
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,500
Please give that to the guerillas.

204
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,630
Tell them it's a donation
from the townspeople.

205
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,176
That large sum will greatly help them.

206
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,970
Will do, Sister.

207
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,556
I'll take this to them right away.

208
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,393
Thank you very much.

209
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,570
Please don't tell them

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,782
I gave this.

211
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,372
I don't want Eduardo to find out
where I am.

212
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>Who would've thought that vaudeville
is still alive in these times?</i>

213
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,488
<i>Perhaps it still exists to give
the people even the slightest of hope</i>

214
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,032
<i>amidst the darkness of this war.</i>

215
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,037
<i>This is probably their only happiness,</i>

216
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,457
<i>their brief escape
from the burdens of life.</i>

217
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:36,091
<i>Vaudeville is where Teresita and I
began to dream.</i>

218
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,106
<i>It is also where we found
each other again.</i>

219
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,616
Adelina!

220
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,970
<i>Teresita, where are you?</i>

221
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,557
<i>I'm with someone
you'll be very happy to see.</i>

222
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,894
<i>You're going to look for her?
But what if you get caught?</i>

223
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,189
<i>I'll do whatever it takes, Nando.
Just for Adelina to forgive me.</i>

224
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,565
Who are you? Introduce yourself.

225
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,778
<i>Why, Adelina?
Do you know who killed our father?</i>

226
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,530
Who?

227
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,618
COMING UP

228
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,415
