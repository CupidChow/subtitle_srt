1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
I'm worried about my daughter.

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,464
I hope the Japanese soldiers
didn't take her too.

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,799
You've completed your mission.

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,720
This means you can now
take on bigger missions.

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:15,598
This is the perfect opportunity for us
to escape this hell.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,517
Teresita. Auntie Amalia.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,394
I'll find you.

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,770
Follow me.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,313
The Colonel is calling for you.

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,692
I want you to write down
all your camps here, Ryo.

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,863
As well as the other women
who have been abducted by your comrades!

12
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,366
So just cooperate
and write down what I'm asking for!

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,368
I really don't know anything else.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,953
The women,

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,413
especially the children,

16
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,625
are truly the most unfortunate
in this damn war.

17
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,253
Please help me, Adelina.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,673
Please help me find my mother.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,553
Why did I dream that something bad
happened to Teresita?

20
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,388
Colonel, we have bad news.

21
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,390
-Are we being attacked?
-No, Colonel.

22
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,310
But the women tried to escape.

23
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,353
How can you be so stupid?

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,566
Where's Teresita? Did she escape?

25
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,443
Don't worry. I'm setting you free.

26
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,070
My comrades will drop you off.

27
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,948
We'll be in danger if we let him live.

28
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,450
Finish him off.

29
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,704
Whoever planned this will pay dearly.

30
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,498
PREVIOUSLY

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
Why did you run away?

32
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,959
What were you girls thinking?

33
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,045
You know you can't escape!

34
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,631
Now we're all doomed!

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,759
Why did you do this?

36
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,636
I have a daughter.

37
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,264
I don't even know if she's alive or dead.

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,475
What do you expect us to do?

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,021
Do you want us to endure
the abuse forever?

40
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,024
We fought for our freedom
because we're human!

41
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,860
We're still human beings!

42
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,867
Salute!

43
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,244
How many of them escaped?

44
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,623
Colonel, we killed two of them.

45
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,500
Two died.

46
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,589
-But how many escaped?
-Two of them escaped, Colonel.

47
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:59,220
They also killed two of our soldiers.

48
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,308
Two women managed to escape

49
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:12,317
and kill two of our soldiers.

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,322
You were bested by mere women?

51
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,711
And who among you…

52
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:38,968
is the idiot responsible for all of this?

53
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,974
No one's going to talk?

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,107
Do I have to kill each of you one by one
before someone speaks?

55
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
Who started this?

56
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,208
Please spare us!

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,148
It was me.

58
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,362
I'm the one responsible for all of this!

59
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,172
Liar.

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:03,177
I thought I could trust you.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,020
But you're worse than a traitor!

62
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:36,169
You can take my body,
but you can never have my soul!

63
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,670
What did you just say?

64
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,466
Colonel, please forgive us.

65
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,384
We won't do it again.

66
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,680
Teresita, let's beg for forgiveness.

67
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,683
Please forgive us.

68
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,271
Please forgive us. We won't do it again!

69
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,814
I was wrong.

70
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,612
I thought you were like my mother,

71
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,201
but you're nothing like her.

72
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,039
You're a shameless liar.

73
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,000
Just like my father.

74
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,587
And just like him,

75
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,508
you also deserve to die.

76
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,139
Please spare her!

77
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,474
Don't kill her!

78
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,018
Don't kill her!

79
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,937
Don't kill her!

80
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,690
You've lost my respect for you.

81
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,611
You deceived me.

82
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:51,369
Take this woman outside
and kill her there.

83
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,912
Don't kill her!

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,417
-Teresita!
-Don't kill her!

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,338
Colonel.

86
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,883
Colonel, we're begging you.

87
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,510
If any of you survive…

88
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,221
We won't do it again! Please!

89
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,306
…go to my family.

90
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,772
And tell them…

91
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
I love them very much.

92
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,531
-Take her outside!
-Wait!

93
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,409
Wait!

94
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,912
Teresita didn't do anything!

95
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,544
She tried to hide the truth
because she felt sorry for me.

96
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,259
She thought you wouldn't hurt her,

97
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,096
that's why she took the blame.

98
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,475
But the truth is…

99
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,518
it was me!

100
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,229
I started this!

101
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,024
I helped these women escape!

102
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,987
You hear me, Yuta?

103
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,532
You're a worse demon than Satan!

104
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,787
It's me! Teresita didn't do anything!

105
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,333
-Miss Dolores!
-Release Teresita.

106
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,002
Miss Dolores.

107
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,006
Take this woman outside and kill her.

108
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,639
Yuta, I'm begging you!

109
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,141
I won't change my mind.

110
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,730
Someone must be punished for you to learn.

111
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,398
Don't say another word.

112
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,945
You can still do so much for our country.

113
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,157
So please don't throw away your life.

114
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,621
Dolores.

115
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,671
Take her outside.

116
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,589
Now!

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,844
Miss Dolores!

118
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,972
Miss Dolores!

119
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,549
My dearly beloved

120
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:56,387
My soul adores you

121
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,892
You resemble

122
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,772
A fragrant flower

123
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:11,611
Pure in its cleanliness

124
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,991
Great in beauty

125
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,662
A sweet fountain

126
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:27,877
Of eternal happiness

127
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,423
A blissful Eden

128
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:38,262
You abode

129
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:43,267
Full of laughter

130
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:48,648
And sweet delight

131
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,943
You're like a radiant fairy

132
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:58,908
And upon seeing you

133
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,704
A fragrant flower

134
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:10,336
Immediately blooms

135
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
Papa.

136
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,294
Eduardo. Adelina.

137
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,302
Where are you?

138
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,907
I hope you're looking
at the moon right now,

139
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,618
wherever you are.

140
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,957
Are you also gazing
at the moon like I am, Adelina?

141
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,742
I guess

142
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,623
you've realized that the Japanese
were never truly our friends,

143
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,041
but our enemies.

144
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,126
Where are they?

145
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,130
Colonel, Adelina hasn't seen
her brother in a long time.

146
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,674
Hiroshi!

147
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,052
I'll come here every full moon.

148
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,804
Not as a member
of the Japanese Imperial Army,

149
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,600
but as a true and loyal friend.

150
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,901
Kenji.

151
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,035
Lieutenant.

152
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,459
Take your positions.

153
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,170
Warn the others.

154
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,798
There are enemies.

155
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,884
Watch out. Enemies.

156
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,026
They're ready.

157
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,573
Mom?

158
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,117
Mom!

159
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,296
Luisa.

160
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,131
Don't cry.

161
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,884
Don't worry.

162
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:51,098
We'll be together with our families
and loved ones again soon.

163
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,310
And we'll all be free.

164
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,395
Just a little more patience, okay?

165
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,066
Now, go back to sleep.

166
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,943
I'll be right by your side.

167
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,123
-What?
-We missed our chance.

168
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,958
Not yet.

169
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,295
Let's make them think we're not here,
then we'll attack.

170
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,789
I'm praying, Yuta. Leave me alone.

171
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,002
I just want to apologize
for hurting you earlier.

172
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,215
But it was also your fault for testing

173
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,885
and embarrassing me
in front of my soldiers.

174
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,015
I hope you won't try to escape again.

175
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,397
I'm expecting you not to break my trust.

176
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,818
You only need to love me, Teresita.

177
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,739
And I will do anything to make you happy.

178
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,785
Can you do that?

179
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,164
Under one condition.

180
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,128
You'll respect all the women here

181
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,342
and stop abusing us.

182
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,932
And what use will they be
if I give in to your request?

183
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,936
If not, I won't see you.

184
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,398
Leave me alone.

185
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,360
Teresita.

186
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,279
If you want me to love you

187
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,950
and if you want me to be like your mother,

188
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,705
don't be as cruel as your father.

189
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,002
Now, leave.

190
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,891
Colonel, we've already buried Dolores.

191
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,728
We have nothing else to do.

192
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,315
Can we have the women now?

193
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,566
You idiot!

194
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,861
-Get out!
-Yes, sir!

195
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,420
Teresita.

196
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,882
We still succeeded.

197
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,928
Even if they killed Miss Dolores,

198
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,932
Manuela and Lorena were able to escape.

199
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,266
And more importantly,

200
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,395
you were able to gain back
the devil's trust.

201
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,982
Be patient, Auntie Amalia.

202
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,070
We'll get out of here soon.

203
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,011
You've been staring at that for a while.

204
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,686
Before the sun rises tomorrow,
we'll go on a journey.

205
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,566
We'll check every garrison

206
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,489
and free those women
from the grasp of our enemies.

207
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,542
Forgive me, Lieutenant.
But we've been waiting for a while.

208
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,752
I think the enemy has fled.

209
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,255
Let's head back to the barracks, sir.

210
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,008
No. No one leaves.

211
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,594
I said no one!

212
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,054
What do you even know about war?

213
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,765
You're such a coward!

214
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,393
Let me get some rest.

215
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,612
Enemies nearby!

216
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,322
Enemies nearby!

217
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,752
Lieutenant, we're surrounded.

218
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,675
Use the radio! Call for backup!

219
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,844
We can't do that, sir!

220
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,388
Our radio is broken,
and they haven't sent us a new one!

221
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,227
They may want me to die,
but you can't die here.

222
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,616
Adelina, forgive me.
I don't think I'll see you again.

223
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,202
The coast is clear.

224
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,937
Wait, Sir Lucas.

225
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,109
-Why?
-The master's orders.

226
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,862
What's happening? Why did we stop?

227
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,739
This is not Eduardo's order!

228
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,201
He's not the leader,
so why should I obey him?

229
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,578
Now, move!

230
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,581
What's happening?
What are you going to do?

231
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,375
Mario, out of the way!

232
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,842
Over there! Let's go!

233
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,185
Help! Somebody!

234
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,937
Stop!

235
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,606
Please stop! Spare him, please!

236
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,824
Let's go.

237
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,231
Damn you, Colonel!

238
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,861
This is all your fault, Colonel!

239
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,406
There are two women looking for you.

240
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,075
They said they're Teresita's friends.

241
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,077
They have a message for you.

242
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,539
You're the reason I'm in this war.

243
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,169
Because you don't want to give
your loyalty to our country.

244
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:03,924
Adelina Dela Cruz is the only key
to Eduardo Dela Cruz's surrender.

245
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:08,136
That's why I want her
arrested immediately!

246
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,305
Why did you have Ryo killed?

247
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,224
Do you even need to ask?

248
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,684
I'm making arrangements for a ship.

249
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,311
I'm leaving tomorrow night.

250
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,687
I'm going back to Japan.

251
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,272
Where's my daughter?

252
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm sure Colonel Yuta
has already punished them all.

253
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,695
What does the Colonel
have to do with this?

254
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,365
COMING UP

255
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,621
