1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,212
Are you going to save me
and take me away from this place?

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,257
The Japanese soldiers
are raping the women here.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,636
The soldiers won't touch you.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,763
You're her master?

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,849
You had me abducted?

6
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,475
Have you reported Adelina?

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,729
Yes, I spoke directly with Colonel Yuta.

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,982
Let's just hope he can immediately
get rid of that woman.

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,067
How do you know my brother?

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,111
He has letters for you.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,156
He needs to know
what happened to Teresita.

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,743
This is the only way I know

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,911
that will make you mine.

14
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:42,000
Are you going to rape me
like what your men do to the women here?

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,043
If it's just Marcel and me,

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
can you take us to see my brother?

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,172
Eat!

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,174
Today's menu is special.

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,760
Pork adobo for those ravaged by pigs.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
Why don't we talk inside?

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,430
This is important.

22
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,434
Adelina, please bring that poor boy
to the nuns at the convent.

23
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,351
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,225
Let's go inside, Captain.

25
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,270
Wait for me here.

26
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,064
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,490
Consider yourself lucky.

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,619
You weren't raped

29
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,831
because you're protected.

30
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,462
The soldiers won't touch you.

31
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm the only man you deserve.

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,680
Don't deny it, Teresita.

33
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,434
Manuela and I heard
your conversation last night.

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,356
That man is taken with you.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,485
No wonder you're untouchable.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,822
Does that mean

37
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,700
she won't be raped like us?

38
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,706
You're lucky, Teresita.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,877
That's what you call blessed.

40
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,344
The Colonel has taken a liking to you.

41
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,222
He'll likely listen to you.

42
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,142
Teresita, can you help us?

43
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,480
Maybe you can ask him to let us go.

44
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,985
She's right. Please help us.

45
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,573
You could be the answer to our prayers.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,076
Please talk to him.

47
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,581
Tell him to let us go.

48
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,002
I really want to see my daughter again.

49
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,213
Me too. My mother is waiting for me.

50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,301
My Grandma Lumen
would be so happy to see me again.

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,387
Teresita, help us.

52
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,432
-She's right, Teresita.
-Please, have pity.

53
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,810
-We're begging you.
-I want to get out of here.

54
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,396
Please, have pity.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,732
-Teresita…
-Ladies, be quiet.

56
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,736
Do you still believe
you can escape this place?

57
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,242
Silence!

58
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,210
Let's go, men!

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,947
Filipinos are truly cowards.

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,870
What do you need from me, Captain?

61
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,809
You have angered our colonel, Hiroshi.

62
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:19,569
He has asked me to assign you to Pampanga.

63
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,113
I'll have you fetched later.

64
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,909
I can't accept this, Captain.

65
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,871
I can't just leave my father like this.

66
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,373
You have no right to refuse, Hiroshi.

67
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,750
You'll only be punished.

68
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,045
Do you want to complicate things further?

69
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,425
Have a seat, Teresita.

70
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
Teresita, please.

71
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,561
Please talk to Yuta for us.

72
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,730
Please.

73
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,941
Help us.

74
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,789
I'll try.

75
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,915
What exactly did you do this time?

76
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,585
Why is the Colonel assigning you
to a different city?

77
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,587
Surely you must've angered him.

78
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:06,884
If not, maybe he just wants you
out of the way.

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,012
Are you trying to imply something?

80
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,058
Good morning, Colonel.

81
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,271
Forgive us for the sudden intrusion.

82
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,107
Teresita asked me to accompany her

83
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
because she wants to talk to you.

84
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,281
You may go now, Dolores.

85
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,837
What can I do for you, beautiful lady?

86
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,926
I want to ask you,

87
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,971
please let go of the women here.

88
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,166
If I grant your request,

89
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,506
what will I get in return?

90
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,348
What do you mean?

91
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,061
You know what I desire, Teresita.

92
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,193
Your affections.

93
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,864
What was that all about?

94
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,369
I have my suspicions, Father.

95
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,665
I think I know who abducted Teresita.

96
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,751
Who?

97
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,794
A man of pure evil.

98
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,506
He's a parasite in our army and country.

99
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,094
It's Colonel Saitoh.

100
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,597
How can I love you, Yuta?

101
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,935
You allow your soldiers
to abuse our women!

102
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,022
Do you think

103
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,068
the soldiers enjoy what they're doing?

104
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,570
Are you telling me they're being forced?

105
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,990
I'm not a fool, Yuta!

106
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,703
I saw how they raped these women!

107
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,871
They wanted to!

108
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,630
Hey!

109
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,215
Are you praying?

110
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,342
Right now?

111
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,680
Men have needs,

112
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:27,436
especially when they're far
from their wives and lovers.

113
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,364
That's such a worthless excuse.

114
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,409
Do you even understand…

115
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,123
what they're sacrificing?

116
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,644
They fight to survive.

117
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,565
They work hard to be stronger,

118
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,693
so they can continue to fight.

119
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,530
Are you going to deny them

120
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,158
the reward…

121
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,411
for their sacrifice?

122
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,879
Why shouldn't I?

123
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,924
We should pray even more

124
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,095
so that God may help Teresita
convince the Colonel.

125
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,722
Reward?

126
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,477
Is that how little you think of women?

127
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,397
We're not trophies or medals

128
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,026
you can brandish on displays
or play dress-up with!

129
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,572
We are humans too!
We have a heart and a soul!

130
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,868
We're just like your soldiers

131
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:11,248
who want to live
for our principles and families!

132
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,959
But what are you doing?

133
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,921
You treat us like objects!

134
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,174
You're so shameless!

135
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,638
I think she'll be able to convince him.

136
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,390
He's still a man.

137
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,143
Men would do anything for love.

138
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,103
Right?

139
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,524
I hope Teresita succeeds.

140
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,610
I miss my grandmother so much.

141
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,531
Just get to work.

142
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,991
The sooner we finish,
the sooner we can leave.

143
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,579
Then we can go home to our families.

144
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,103
If I was really shameless,

145
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,023
I would've killed you long ago.

146
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,863
Your dignity is not
the only thing I can take.

147
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,491
I can take your life too.

148
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,954
But did I do that?

149
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,416
No.

150
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,753
Because I love you

151
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,966
and I respect you.

152
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,526
You already know the answer
to your request.

153
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,398
Teresita's here!

154
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,532
Tell us the good news, Teresita.

155
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
Were you able to convince him?

156
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,287
Is he going to free us?

157
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,501
No.

158
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,173
But why? What happened?

159
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,009
I thought that soldier liked you.

160
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,930
Why didn't he grant your request?

161
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,225
Did you talk to him properly?

162
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,519
Did you explain our situation?

163
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,897
Or didn't you do anything at all?

164
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,275
Auntie Amalia,
I did everything to convince him.

165
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,819
Really?

166
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,574
Think about it.

167
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:37,162
Why would she even help us?
Who are we to her, anyway?

168
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,167
She wasn't abused like the rest of us.

169
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,259
She doesn't understand our pain.

170
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,511
Auntie Amalia, I understand…

171
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:57,016
Until you experience it,
you will never understand!

172
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,893
What do you want me to do?

173
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,230
Let Yuta rape me too?

174
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,401
If that's the only way, then so be it!

175
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,154
But will you do that?

176
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,281
No.

177
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,201
Because you're selfish.

178
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,205
You only think of yourself.

179
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,544
As long as the colonel is protecting you
from these rapists,

180
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,129
you're safe.

181
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,132
You don't care what happens to us.

182
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,925
That's not true.

183
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,261
Why am I arguing with you?

184
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,183
Compared to you,

185
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,770
we can never be as fortunate.

186
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,953
Manuela, wait.

187
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,675
Let's talk inside.

188
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,183
I despise him, Father!

189
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,894
Our colonel is pure evil!

190
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,736
He's still one of us, son.

191
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,740
Don't disrespect him.

192
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,996
Do you have any proof
of what you're accusing him of?

193
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,790
It was his doing, Father.

194
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,042
It was him!

195
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,045
He doesn't want me to look for Teresita,

196
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,631
that's why he's sending me away.

197
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,466
He's dispatching me to the province.

198
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,386
Our colonel has lost his mind.

199
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,562
I know that you can help us, Mayor.

200
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,527
My wife and I are hoping
that with your help,

201
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,450
you can convince the Japanese
to free our daughter.

202
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,077
I'll try, Julio.

203
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,916
But we both know that I am merely
a puppet of the Japanese.

204
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:14,588
My new position
has no real power and authority.

205
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,634
Then why did you accept the position?

206
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,347
If we say no to them,
they'll only get more violent.

207
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,392
They're just going to
keep killing our people.

208
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,314
Our daughter needs help.

209
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,817
Please, Sir Vargas.

210
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,862
Please help our family.

211
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,573
We've reached out to the Japanese,

212
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,619
but they still haven't found our daughter.

213
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,790
You're our only hope.

214
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,125
Please, Mayor.

215
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,128
We need you.

216
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,131
Like I said,

217
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,134
I'll try, Carmela.

218
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,054
But I can't guarantee anything.

219
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,475
We're no longer the ones
in control of this country.

220
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,840
Our colonel is a terrible man.

221
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,135
Father, I no longer respect him.

222
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,723
He's nothing but a monster in our army!

223
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,982
Colonel, why is this man still alive?

224
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,067
Wasn't he given the death penalty?

225
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,514
We're here.

226
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,391
-You sure?
-Yes, we're here.

227
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,702
Where's my brother?

228
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,830
We need to go deep into the jungle.

229
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,880
Adelina, be careful.

230
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,924
I think there's a lot of snakes here.

231
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,012
We already have tons of them
back home, Marcel.

232
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,768
And they carry the flag of our enemies.

233
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,190
Let's go.

234
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,291
Colonel, this is Yamamoto.

235
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:42,754
Chikara Tanaka is here
and he wants to see you right away.

236
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,755
Shit!

237
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,258
God is gone, Manuela!

238
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,261
No matter how much you pray to Him,

239
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,806
He will no longer hear or listen to you!

240
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,766
Why did you only take Marcel with you?

241
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,227
Where's Teresita?

242
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,188
I will do as you wish.
But you must free Lorena this instant.

243
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,694
I will only set her free
after we are married.

244
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,904
Your tears are not the answer I want!

245
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,782
-Where's Teresita?
-She is gone, Eduardo.

246
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,160
She was abducted by the Japanese.

247
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,120
COMING UP

248
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,002
