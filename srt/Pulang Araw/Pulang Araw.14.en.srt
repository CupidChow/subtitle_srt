1
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,418
Hey! What are you doing?

2
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,878
Don't tear down my theater!

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,006
I am the true owner of this property
and that theater!

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,800
You have no right
to set foot here, so leave!

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,594
-Papa!
-I said leave!

6
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,762
You are disrupting our work!

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,265
Hey! Please stop!

8
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,726
Please! We don't want any trouble!
We apologize.

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,645
My sincere apologies, sir.

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,440
We want to apologize
for what our father did.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,192
We are sorry.

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,235
You're only causing trouble here! Get out!

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,528
Leave!

14
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,988
-Papa!
-Leave!

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,031
-No, you leave!
-Papa!

16
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,657
-I said leave!
-Papa!

17
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,992
Papa, stop!

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,329
We don't have any right to this place.

19
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,539
Someone else owns this now, Papa.

20
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,292
Teresita is right.

21
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,461
Let's stop causing trouble.

22
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,964
I don't want you to get into a fight.
And I definitely don't want you hurt.

23
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,508
Dad…

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,053
I knew you would be hurt
when you found out.

25
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,721
Please forgive us.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,209
Don’t worry, Papa.

27
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,754
Hush now.

28
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,592
We will buy a new land,

29
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,846
one where we can build the theater on.

30
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
Right?

31
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,267
Yeah!

32
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,935
Teresita's right!

33
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,688
We'll have a fresh start.

34
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,941
As long as the three of us are together,

35
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,152
I know there's nothing we can't do!

36
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,153
Isn't that right, Dad?

37
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,074
Dad.

38
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,959
Father.

39
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,336
So your business is still here.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,342
Now is the right time to further expand
our businesses here in the Philippines.

41
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,980
But the Philippines is
still under American control.

42
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,151
And now that our country
is allied with their enemies,

43
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,364
the Americans might make it
difficult for us to do business here.

44
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,744
American rule is about to end.

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:28,291
Japan will be the next to govern here.

46
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,425
Open the box.

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,435
Colonel.

48
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,731
What a great gun!

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,949
Get these out quickly.

50
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,784
Yes, sir!

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,038
Watanabe.

52
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,206
Yes?

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,583
I will leave the rest to you.

54
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,876
You understand, right?

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,794
Yes, sir!

56
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,469
Good morning.

57
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,223
Here is the payment for your services.

58
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,396
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,941
No one must know what you have seen here.

60
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,027
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,966
Did you say that Japan will rule
the Philippines next?

62
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,593
Why do you think so, Father?

63
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,763
I cannot answer that yet.

64
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,310
Come, let me show you inside.

65
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,859
I haven't spoken to Mr. Tanaka
about Hiroshi yet.

66
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,696
But one of these days,

67
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,658
I will invite him out
to finalize our agreement.

68
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,953
I doubt he can refuse my Teresita.

69
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,456
Especially since they look
so good together!

70
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,293
Yes, that's right, my friend.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,420
All right, then. Goodbye.

72
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,136
I've done what you asked me to do.

73
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,220
About?

74
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,348
About Eduardo and Adelina.

75
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,144
My friends will teach them a lesson.

76
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,277
Even if I am hurt,
the day is still so beautiful!

77
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,663
Excuse me, sir.

78
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,457
Are you Eduardo Dela Cruz?

79
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,086
Yeah, that's me.

80
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,671
You're coming with us!

81
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,586
Took you long enough. Go!
Get him out of here!

82
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,936
Mama.

83
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,856
Where have you been?

84
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,943
You just missed Mr. Tanaka and Hiroshi.

85
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,319
Hiroshi?

86
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,406
He's back in the Philippines?

87
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,576
And why is that woman here?

88
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,246
Do you really have no respect?

89
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,290
I've already made it clear.

90
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,959
I don't want to see you
or your damn brother ever again!

91
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,294
What about me?

92
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,551
Do you not wish
to see me as well, Carmela?

93
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,179
Julio?

94
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,106
Goodness gracious!

95
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,775
You're still alive?

96
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,239
And Papa knows
you've sold his land to Mr. Tanaka.

97
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,911
Let me talk to Carmela in private.

98
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,331
Of course, Dad.

99
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,999
Teresita, let's go.

100
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,209
No.

101
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,794
I'm not going anywhere.

102
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,465
I don't want you to fight again.
Mama, Papa.

103
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,135
I will go ahead.

104
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,514
I know this is a…

105
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
family matter.

106
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,268
I'll come back later.

107
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,520
Dad.

108
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:52,657
Why did you sell my theater?

109
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,535
I thought you were dead.

110
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,370
You that I would come back!

111
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,996
I wrote to you before!

112
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,373
And to my children.

113
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,835
I wrote to all of you!

114
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,133
But, Papa, Adelina and I
never received a single letter from you.

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,138
So that's why…

116
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
I never received a response

117
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,270
from any of you.

118
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,105
Then…

119
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,277
What happened to my letters?

120
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,949
Thank you.

121
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,761
Teresita must never know that
her father has been sending us letters.

122
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,223
If she does, you'll be the one to pay.

123
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,184
Yes, señora.

124
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,405
What do I know about your letters?

125
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,577
You're just making up stories
to make me look bad to our daughter!

126
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,082
I know when you are lying
and when you are telling the truth!

127
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,253
Where are my letters?

128
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,051
-Papa.
-What did you do with my letters?

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,595
I did not receive anything!

130
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,763
Enough, Papa.

131
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,015
Please don’t be angry, Papa!

132
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,184
And what can you do…

133
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,521
about the piece of land
I sold to Mr. Tanaka?

134
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,857
Nothing.

135
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,318
I endured for ten years!

136
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
Being away from my daughters

137
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,199
to save up money

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,035
and rebuild my theater.

139
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,248
I wasn't here to see Teresita
and Adelina grow up in those ten years!

140
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,335
And this is what I come home to?

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,839
You sold my land and theater?

142
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,927
My only legacy for my children?

143
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,306
You should have just killed me!

144
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,267
Now, Julio…

145
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,230
Now, you know the feeling…

146
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,027
of hoping and failing…

147
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,781
and being betrayed.

148
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,786
So welcome home, dear husband!

149
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,040
Papa!

150
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,335
Please stop, for heaven’s sake!

151
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,795
Don’t hurt her, Papa!

152
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,510
Forgive me.

153
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,765
Forgive me, Carmela.

154
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,561
Why are you…

155
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,690
still punishing me?

156
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,943
For my past mistakes?

157
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,613
I don’t want to argue with you anymore.

158
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,385
Good, you're finally awake.

159
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
Who are you?

160
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,931
What do you need from me?

161
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,766
Why are you doing this?

162
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,726
What have I done to you?

163
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,144
Stay away from the Borromeos!

164
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,022
Or we're coming after your sister next!

165
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,526
Don't you dare.

166
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:45,574
I will find you and have my revenge
the moment you touch my sister!

167
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,454
What can a nobody like you
do to someone rich and powerful?

168
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,081
Nothing, that's what!

169
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,063
I haven’t changed anything
in your office, Papa.

170
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,987
Adelina and I wanted you
to find it the way you left it.

171
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,037
You two are very good daughters.

172
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,750
I don’t deserve to be your father.

173
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,377
Papa.

174
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,672
Whatever mistakes you made in the past,

175
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,842
they don't matter to us anymore.

176
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,430
So, Papa, don’t mind what Mama said.

177
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,600
This house is still your home.

178
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,729
So you still have
every right to live here.

179
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,733
So your mother and I can keep arguing?

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,573
No more.

181
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,622
I don’t want to drag you two into this.

182
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,633
Adelina used this
when she was still living here.

183
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,594
But I don’t know
what she's keeping inside.

184
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,637
What did you say?

185
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,723
"When she was still living here"?

186
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,774
Adelina could no longer
stand Mama's treatment of her.

187
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,405
So she was forced to live there.

188
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,618
That's where her brother Eduardo lives.

189
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
That's why, Papa…

190
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,541
I'm begging you, please don't leave.

191
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,339
So we can save Adelina again
and take her back.

192
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,057
Papa!

193
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,688
Adelina!

194
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,193
Adelina, come out of there!

195
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,529
I don’t think anyone’s home, Papa.

196
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,073
The house is locked tight.

197
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,915
You allowed your sister to live
in that miserable house?

198
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:46,797
Didn’t I leave her with you,
so you could take care of her?

199
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,341
I’m sorry, Papa.

200
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,095
But what could I do against Mama?

201
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,648
Don’t follow me.

202
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,653
Just wait for Adelina and take her home.

203
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,252
Tasyo, where's my brother?

204
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,046
Huh? Well…

205
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,089
I don’t know. Maybe he’s still at home.

206
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,341
I already went there,
but the place was empty.

207
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,802
I thought he might be here. Isn't he?

208
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,262
No, he's not.

209
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,306
Well, maybe…

210
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,725
Why don't you just wait there?

211
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,893
He's probably on his way.

212
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,396
Hold on, Tasyo!

213
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,565
-Why?
-I want to ask you something.

214
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,733
What is it?

215
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,943
Has Hiroshi really returned?

216
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,446
Have you seen your boss' son?

217
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,782
No, not yet.

218
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,700
I just got here.

219
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,708
Where is Eduardo?

220
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,503
Unbelievable.

221
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,139
I thought I told you to leave.

222
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,480
I decided to live here again.

223
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,440
With my two daughters.

224
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,819
Did you hear that, Carmela?

225
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,575
With my two daughters.

226
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,503
In case you've forgotten,

227
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,091
I am still the head of this family.

228
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,970
So I am still in charge.

229
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,191
But I will fight for my right

230
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,613
and the life I want for my daughter.

231
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,194
I’m only here to look for my brother.

232
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,788
Hiroshi!

233
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,962
Akio!

234
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,890
What do you want?

235
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,226
Come ride with me.

236
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,270
Our childhood friends want to see you.

237
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,096
Adelina!

238
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,391
Is that really Hiroshi?

239
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,812
-It is him.
-Huh?

240
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,230
It really is Hiroshi.

241
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,356
Huh?

242
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,483
He's changed so much.

243
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,736
He's so handsome now.

244
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,158
I don't think so.

245
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,242
Ouch!

246
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,453
I'm more handsome than him!

247
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,996
He's lucky I was sitting earlier.

248
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,664
Don’t you have work to do, Tasyo?

249
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,541
Aren’t you waiting for Eduardo?

250
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
Thank you, Lord!

251
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,276
You made my wish come true,
Hiroshi came back.

252
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,157
Enjoy, my friend!

253
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,366
Thank you!

254
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,515
Thanks for the treat, Hiroshi!

255
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,809
This is my first time trying this.

256
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,102
It’s really good!

257
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,689
Don't wolf down your food or you might…

258
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,316
choke on it.

259
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,374
Why are you smiling?

260
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,839
I just remembered someone.

261
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,302
Who?

262
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,143
A childhood friend who was…

263
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,187
very kind to me.

264
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,234
It’s a girl, isn’t it?

265
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,238
A childhood sweetheart?

266
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,409
Cheers!

267
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,120
It’s foolishness to talk about women!

268
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,312
Teresita?

269
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,646
-Adelina.
-What are you doing?

270
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,607
Thank God you’re finally home.

271
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,401
Papa wants you to go
back to the other house.

272
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,030
Really?

273
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,161
But wouldn't this cause even more trouble?

274
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,832
I don't want to be the reason
our father and your mother argue again.

275
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,418
Why, Adelina?

276
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,253
Don’t you want to be with Papa?

277
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,467
You know that's been
my dream for the longest time.

278
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,221
But what about your mother?

279
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,978
Adelina.

280
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,772
Don’t worry.

281
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,025
Mama will never hurt you again.

282
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,987
Papa and I are here to protect you now.

283
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,034
Let's go home.

284
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,374
I want to wait for my brother.

285
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,043
I want to say goodbye to him.
Will that be all right?

286
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,003
All right, go ahead.

287
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,756
I’ll bring your belongings
to the other house, okay?

288
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,511
Oh, are you done packing?

289
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,054
-Wait.
-Just a few more things.

290
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,191
Here.

291
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,030
You don’t have to
worry about Adelina anymore, señora.

292
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,743
I'm sure that, once Eduardo talks to her,

293
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,912
they will never bother you again.

294
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,333
Those siblings aren't my only problem now.

295
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,668
Julio is back too.

296
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:34,134
How unfortunate that I was born
when men are the heads of the family.

297
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,806
I’ll figure out what to do
with my husband later.

298
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,143
What’s important is that
I save my only daughter

299
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,937
from the misfortune her father will bring.

300
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,856
So drive faster!

301
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,149
Yes, señora.

302
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,238
We caught a lot of snails again today!

303
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,700
I will cook delicious miso-mi for you.

304
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,286
Hey! Nana!

305
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,954
Wait, Nana!

306
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,831
Nana!

307
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,708
Nana!

308
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,089
Hey, Nana!

309
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,175
Nana?

310
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,343
Is there a snake?

311
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,512
Hey, Nana.

312
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,432
Nana?

313
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,565
Are you okay? Wake up!

314
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,901
Wake up! Are you all right?

315
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,487
Yuki!

316
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,572
Someone is lying on the ground! Come here!

317
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,574
Yuki!

318
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,203
Help me!

319
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,958
Excuse me, miss.

320
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,418
Are you following me?

321
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,378
How delightful!

322
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,213
You still know how to speak Tagalog.

323
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,214
Adelina?

324
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,633
It’s me! My hunch is correct.

325
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,675
You are Hiroshi!

326
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,969
This day is truly beautiful!

327
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,264
I know that Teresita
will have a much better life

328
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,769
if we can agree to marry
your son to my daughter

329
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,062
as soon as possible.

330
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,272
Who is he?

331
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,651
Why did they hurt him like this?

332
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,320
We will find out when he wakes up.

333
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,447
Colonel Arata wants to give you this.

334
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,951
He wants you to look for connections
among the locals who are willing

335
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,578
to cooperate with
our Japanese Imperial Army.

336
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,790
I know someone we can use.

337
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:33,169
I won’t let her be married off
to a man she doesn’t love.

338
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,546
COMING UP

339
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,511
