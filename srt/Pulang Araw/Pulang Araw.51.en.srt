1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,212
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,797
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,258
Where is your father hiding?

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,052
I don't know where he is!

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:15,140
I've never been with my worthless father!

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,392
Father, do you think

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,687
our intentions for this country are good?

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,316
I've seen injustices committed
by our soldiers.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,193
They left without me?

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,321
A youngster like you
shouldn't be in the guerrilla.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,950
That life is not yours to live.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,872
You should be glad I saved you!

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,624
I wonder what Eduardo is doing right now?

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,585
Do you think they reached
their destination?

15
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,712
I'm wondering the same thing, Teresita.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,006
-He's my father.
-Pablo!

17
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,592
The spawn of Satan is here.

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,469
Leave me and the Colonel for now.

19
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,471
I want to speak to him alone.

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,140
What are we going to talk about?

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,767
Even now,

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,937
my father is still the reason why
I'm suffering so much.

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,272
And even if I'm older,

24
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,026
I still want him to accept me as his son.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,653
But I don't think that will ever happen.

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,822
Let me just call our leader.

27
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,147
My name is Juan, sir.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,289
I didn't know your last name
was Acosta too, Eduardo.

29
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,387
"Eduardo Acosta."

30
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,026
Apologies, Colonel.

31
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,572
Make yourself at home.
You can chat with my husband later.

32
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,493
Carmela, you may leave us.

33
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,411
But, Julio…

34
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,956
This conversation is between men.

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,917
If it's not much to ask,

36
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,045
I'd like to talk to Colonel Yuta alone.

37
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,257
Mrs. Borromeo, let's go.

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,431
Teresita.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,532
Mama, just let Papa handle it.

40
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,743
I want to listen.

41
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,286
Now, be quiet.

42
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,249
I thought your last name
was Dela Cruz, sir.

43
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,919
That's what's on your mother's gravestone.

44
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,213
You're not wrong, Mario.

45
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,550
I just didn't want the American
to know my true identity

46
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,636
because he's my father, Mario.

47
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,306
He's the man

48
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,851
who never accepted nor cared for me.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,609
He never acknowledged me.
And even now, he still refuses to.

50
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,536
We have a saying that goes,

51
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,875
"Honesty leads to lasting relationships."

52
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,920
I wanted to talk to you in person

53
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,507
so we can avoid any misunderstanding

54
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,176
and get to know each other
a little better.

55
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:10,643
Is that why you seem reluctant
to accept my gifts?

56
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,480
What is it that troubles you?

57
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,735
Colonel, what do you want in return

58
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,113
for these gifts you're offering?

59
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,201
If what you seek is friendship,

60
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,120
I'll gladly accept them.

61
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,622
But if it's more than that…

62
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:36,544
The true gift I seek is in this house.

63
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,676
I want Teresita, your daughter.

64
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,518
I believe you're mistaken.

65
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,813
My daughter is not some gift

66
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,777
you can claim in exchange for these goods.

67
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,406
Teresita is not that kind of woman.

68
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,577
I don't see her that way either.

69
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,581
To me, she's like a star

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,668
and I want her to be a part of my world…

71
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,590
if you will allow it.

72
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,135
And if I refuse,

73
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,475
will you have me arrested
by your Kempeitai?

74
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,898
Are you going to punish me
for not giving in to your desires?

75
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,829
I don't know why
our feet led us to his camp.

76
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,417
I can't understand why this is happening.

77
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,632
Sir, why don't you
just tell him the truth?

78
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,888
Families are being separated right now
because of the war.

79
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm sure he'll be glad to know.

80
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,894
Didn't you hear me?

81
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,731
He never accepted me as his son.

82
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,861
So why would he accept me now?

83
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,157
I don't want to be with him,
but here we are.

84
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,786
I need to be in this camp.

85
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,085
We can't just leave,
so you have to promise me, Mario.

86
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,755
You must not let him or the others know.

87
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,303
This secret is between us,
do you understand?

88
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,013
I promise, sir.

89
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,140
You can count on me.

90
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:10,031
Why would I have you arrested
or imprisoned?

91
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,620
We only punish the enemies of our nation.

92
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,917
It's not my nature to hold grudges,

93
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,920
especially over a woman.

94
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,968
I will never force myself on anyone,

95
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,679
especially if they don't like me.

96
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,602
It's not that I don't like you, Colonel.

97
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,483
But my daughter's happiness
is more important to me.

98
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:52,365
I hope your daughter's happiness
does not depend on a man

99
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,452
who is currently sought-after
by the Kempeitai.

100
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,165
It will not be good for Teresita.

101
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:08,589
So I hope you allow me
to prove myself to your daughter.

102
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,052
I am willing to court her
sincerely and patiently

103
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,557
because she's the woman
I want to spend my life with.

104
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,268
Even if you wait,
you'll get nothing from me.

105
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,691
Be quiet or there will be consequences.

106
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,234
Mama…

107
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,281
I admire your honesty, Colonel.

108
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,493
But…

109
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,747
I don't want you to get your hopes up

110
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,878
and be disappointed in me
if I can't give you what you want.

111
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,884
Don't worry, sir.

112
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,721
No matter what happens,

113
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,642
I won't hold a grudge against you,

114
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,894
especially your daughter.

115
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,815
All I want is a chance

116
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:13,112
to prove that I am worthy of her.

117
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,282
That's all, sir.

118
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,041
My apologies, Colonel.

119
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,129
Julio and I accept your intention
to court our daughter.

120
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,922
Look at your mother.

121
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,676
She's so insistent on what she wants.

122
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,265
Thank you very much, Mrs. Borromeo,

123
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,352
for granting my request.

124
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:49,148
I don't think there's anything wrong
if we give the colonel a chance, Julio.

125
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,318
He hasn't forced our Teresita,

126
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,821
and I'm sure he won't punish us

127
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,074
if he doesn't succeed.

128
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,077
You can take my word.

129
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,830
Thank you very much, Mrs. Borromeo,

130
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,125
for allowing my intentions.

131
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,556
I will now take my leave.
I'll return some other day.

132
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,894
Colonel.

133
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,397
What about your gifts?

134
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,112
Please take and accept them as a token

135
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,448
from a friend.

136
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,709
With love…

137
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,754
Eduardo.

138
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,174
Who's that letter for, sir?

139
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,304
It's for my sister and Teresita.

140
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,015
They're vaudeville artists.

141
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,728
-Is it for Chinita and Morena?
-Yes.

142
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,482
I want to let them know that I'm well.

143
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,987
Good thing Pablo has
some paper and pencils.

144
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,074
Now, my only problem is…

145
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,994
how am I going to send this to them?

146
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,664
I can deliver your letters for you
if you want.

147
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,625
There you go again, Juan.

148
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,503
The city is far from here.

149
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,132
It's dangerous for you to travel alone.

150
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,595
Are you underestimating me again?

151
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,183
After all we've been through,
you still don't trust me.

152
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,520
I have great trust in you, Juan.

153
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,649
It's the Japanese I don't trust.

154
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,694
So let me handle it, all right?

155
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,907
Who knows, in God's grace,

156
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,827
I might be able to give
this letter to them personally.

157
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,248
Let's get going.

158
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,210
You shouldn't have interfered
in our conversation.

159
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,755
Why not?

160
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,966
The man was so respectful.

161
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,054
He's unlike the others who are rude

162
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,139
and impolite towards me.

163
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,059
You really think that, Mama?

164
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,853
Is that why he keeps visiting us?

165
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,189
What for?

166
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,942
So you could keep forcing me
to face that man?

167
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,735
Enough, Carmela.

168
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,113
Let me talk to my children.

169
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,451
Follow me. Teresita.

170
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,045
Why is my daughter so blind and stupid?

171
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,923
What more can she ask from the colonel?

172
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,928
Why don't you just marry Colonel yourself?

173
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,724
Can you repeat what you said, Hiroshi?

174
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,309
I said…

175
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,230
I must take my leave.

177
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,739
I have a feeling

178
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:30,411
that the two siblings know something
about Eduardo Dela Cruz,

179
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,622
and their father is also involved.

180
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,087
You must assign a civilian
to monitor Adelina and Teresita

181
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,630
at all times.

182
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,091
Understood, Colonel.

183
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,725
It's difficult to deal
with these Filipinos.

184
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,688
They're truly testing my patience.

185
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,619
Papa, you shouldn't have let him come.

186
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,915
How can I face him
when I don't even like him?

187
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,543
Carmela!

188
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,504
Why did you follow us here?

189
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,341
And why are you excluding me
from this conversation?

190
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,968
Teresita.

191
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,681
The colonel's courtship is not punishment,

192
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,477
but an opportunity.

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,190
An opportunity for you
to truly get to know and compare him

194
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,234
to that low-life Eduardo.

195
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,612
Don't you think the real
low-life here is a foreigner

196
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,865
who forces himself into this country
and to my sister?

197
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,035
You don't get a say
in our family discussion!

198
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,370
She is family too!

199
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:03,128
Teresita, you don't have to accept
the colonel's advances.

200
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,714
Let him be.

201
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,091
Let him hope.

202
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
You want me to lead him on, Papa?

203
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,514
Dearest, it's only temporary.

204
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,395
I still believe that the Americans

205
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,439
can overcome and drive away
those Japanese.

206
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,358
Papa.

207
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,070
The Americans have already
retreated to Bataan and Corregidor.

208
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,033
How can they save us when there are rumors

209
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,787
that the Japanese
are currently hunting them down?

210
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,208
How can they possibly win this war?

211
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,336
Don't underestimate the Americans.

212
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,050
I'm sure they will send help
and reinforcements.

213
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,635
Have a little faith.

214
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,433
As for me, I guarantee that,
in less than a year,

215
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,813
those Japanese will be running back
crying to their country.

216
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,310
I quit school, sir.

217
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:48,484
I needed to work so I could support myself
from a very young age

218
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,196
because I no longer have parents.

219
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,971
I came here to become a rebel!

220
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,974
Not a cook or helper!

221
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,982
And what if that doesn't happen?

222
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,780
What if the Americans
can't defeat the Japanese?

223
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,240
Rubbish!

224
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,077
No one can defeat the Americans,

225
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,123
especially with the help
of our brave countrymen.

226
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,250
And what if you're wrong?

227
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,965
I already know
what's going to happen to us.

228
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,596
Our whole country will fall
into the hands of the Japanese.

229
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,973
And Eduardo?

230
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:06,478
He and his rebel troops
will surely end up dead.

231
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,856
That won't happen, señora.

232
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,942
Then pray it won't, Adelina.

233
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,862
That is, if God will listen to you.

234
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,323
Listen to me, Teresita.

235
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,661
You must get along with the colonel

236
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,499
if you want all of us to live long.

237
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,895
You're leaving?

238
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,361
Yes, Adelina.

239
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,989
My comrades are on the way here.

240
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,074
I'm just waiting for them.

241
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,204
I won't ask where you're headed.

242
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,291
I'm sure it's…

243
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,504
your duty to your country.

244
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,048
Adelina.

245
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,592
This is also for your country.

246
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,013
Truth is, we'll be distributing rice
to a neighboring town

247
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,890
that's experiencing famine.

248
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,854
Just like your colonel,

249
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,359
do you also wish to buy
the loyalty of my countrymen?

250
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,490
Adelina.

251
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:48,247
Can you stop misinterpreting
our efforts to give aid and friendship?

252
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,291
You heard everything.

253
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,294
Our colonel showed courtesy.

254
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,173
He respects your father,

255
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,509
and he didn't force Teresita.

256
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,386
Adelina.

257
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,973
If you stop
idolizing the Americans so much,

258
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,184
you'll see that we're also good people.

259
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,312
Me? Idolize the Americans?

260
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,358
Hiroshi, believe me.

261
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,569
I prefer the Japanese
more than the Americans.

262
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,239
But that was before.

263
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,534
When you haven't invaded us.

264
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,913
-Now…
-What?

265
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,625
Adelina.

266
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
Do you hate us now?

267
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,215
Is that it?

268
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,555
Looks like our army no longer needs me.

269
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,227
I believe I have already done my part.

270
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
If I may,

271
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,650
I would like to be
discharged from service.

272
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm not the one who will decide that,

273
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,407
but my superiors.

274
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,371
You may speak to Colonel Yuta about it.

275
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,915
You're dismissed.

276
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,827
You don't have to follow me to my office.

277
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,873
-Just do what I ordered you.
-Yes, sir!

278
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,091
You may go now.

279
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,679
I'll relay this to our lieutenant colonel.

280
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,348
Yes, sir!

281
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,984
Would you like me to get you
something to eat or drink, sir, master?

282
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,450
What I need is advice.

283
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,580
What do I need to do
to win Teresita's heart

284
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,707
and her father's?

285
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,670
That's easy, sir.

286
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,007
Listen carefully.
This is what you need to do…

287
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,678
Colonel, good morning.

288
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,152
Give us your money and jewelry.

289
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,779
-Nicanor, grab everything now!
-Okay.

290
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,865
Don't come any closer…

291
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,910
or I'll shoot.

292
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,830
It's you!

293
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,915
You killed my wife!

294
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,587
Why are you still alive?

295
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,632
Colonel, why is this man still alive?

296
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,677
Wasn't he given the death penalty?

297
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,645
Before, there was no malice
in being friends with the Japanese.

298
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,563
But now there is.

299
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,941
I can only think of one thing
to keep us safe, Mama.

300
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,693
We must leave this place.

301
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,862
Are you girls fit to perform tomorrow?

302
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,948
I think our audience
is looking for a distraction.

303
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,201
We'll perform for them right away.

304
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,828
You seem to be getting along
with your father, sir.

305
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,747
The moment he finds out who I really am,

306
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,874
I'm sure he won't treat me the same way.

307
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,710
Did something bad happen, Father?

308
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,295
What's the matter?

309
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,755
COMING UP

310
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,637
