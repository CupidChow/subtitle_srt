1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,835
Who are you?

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,171
I am the son
of the poor woman you murdered!

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,591
I will not let this day pass

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:13,138
without delivering the justice you seek.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,222
We have company.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,391
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,308
Colonel!

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,187
We were forcibly evicted
by your soldiers from our home

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,189
because they said
it would be used as a garrison.

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,067
And thank you
for letting us borrow your home.

11
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,985
"Borrow"?

12
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,445
Or should it be "take"?

13
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,822
Read it, Tasyo.

14
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,451
They're offering a peso
in exchange for each surrendered gun.

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,745
But that's too cheap.

16
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,205
I'd rather use it against them.

17
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,667
Please excuse my question, Colonel,

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,838
but do you also have eyes for Teresita?

19
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,048
I really have a bad feeling
about that colonel.

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,760
I can clearly see
his intentions towards you, Teresita.

21
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,930
Only my father and her mother
made the agreement,

22
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,308
me and Teresita are against it.

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,935
Because like me, she is already
in love with someone else.

24
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,604
Who?

25
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,773
He is Eduardo Dela Cruz, Colonel.

26
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,317
Eduardo Dela Cruz?

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,861
-A Filipino?
-Yes, sir.

28
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,156
I will never forget this wonderful night.

29
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,699
But I have to go home now.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,367
Mama might already be looking for me.

31
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,162
If she sees us, then good.

32
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,041
Because she'd have no choice
but to let us marry right away, right?

33
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,084
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

34
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,837
Whoever you are,

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,924
nobody crosses me.

36
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,684
Why are those two taking so long?

37
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,695
The rumors are so frightening.

38
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,615
What rumors, Yolanda?

39
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,079
They said the Japanese are abducting women

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,791
and raping then killing them,

41
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,295
because women were never seen
coming home to their families.

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,965
I won't step out of this house.

43
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,429
You and Teresita should be careful.

44
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,517
The Japanese might take advantage of you.

45
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,145
Especially since you're both beautiful.

46
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,106
So be very, very careful.

47
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,668
We've been waiting for a while now.

48
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,046
What's taking so long?

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,050
We only wish to visit my husband.

50
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,970
I understand, ma'am.

51
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,726
But you still need permission
from the Japanese to visit your husband.

52
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,687
However, our new leader
has not yet arrived.

53
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,315
How long must we wait?

54
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,442
It's better that you go home.

55
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,569
You might miss the curfew.

56
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,488
You could end up imprisoned too.

57
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,032
Thanks for nothing.

58
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,575
Let's go.

59
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,954
Stop looking for Dad.
He'll return soon, all right?

60
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,666
I'm very sorry.

61
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,712
She's pretty, isn't she?

62
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,465
Yes, she is!

63
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,342
Come with me!

64
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,136
I don't want to go with you,
we're going home now!

65
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,931
You're so cruel! Let go of my mother!

66
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,266
Let go!

67
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,559
Let go of my mother!

68
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,854
Sir, let go of me!

69
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,650
No!

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,210
Mom…

71
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,172
Go! Leave now!

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,424
Escape now!

73
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,926
Mom, I don't want to!

74
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,094
Listen to me.

75
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,762
I'll go with you!

76
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
You need to leave.

77
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,599
Save yourself!

78
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,101
-I will find you!
-I love you!

79
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,603
I will find you, I promise!
That's a promise!

80
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,439
We will see each other again, now go.

81
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,733
We'll see each other again. Mom loves you.

82
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,109
-Mom, I love you--
-Leave now!

83
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,320
-I'll go with you!
-Leave!

84
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,487
Mom!

85
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,741
If you don't leave, I'll hit you!

86
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,950
-Mom!
-Go!

87
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,952
Mom!

88
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,842
My child…

89
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,067
Another widespread blackout occurred
in most of Manila.

90
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,695
I don't know what caused it.

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,740
My God.

92
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,076
Our lives are becoming
increasingly difficult.

93
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,536
This must be because of the Japanese.

94
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,039
Be quiet.

95
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,084
Mr. Tanaka is coming.

96
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,503
Teresita, help me put this on.

97
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,256
You're lucky that the señora
didn't look for you earlier.

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,926
But why did it take you so long
to speak with Eduardo?

99
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,262
No need.

100
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,697
Good evening to all of you.

101
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,408
Hiroshi…

102
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,495
-Come on, let's have dinner.
-All right.

103
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,174
This is indeed a beautiful evening.

104
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,605
Mr. Tanaka.

105
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:26,446
It may be best if we start discussing
when our children will be married.

106
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,158
Mama?

107
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,744
Forgive me, Mrs. Borromeo,

108
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,540
but I thought this matter
was already settled.

109
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,711
Carmela, perhaps we should not
push this any further.

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,385
I'm just thinking of our welfare.

111
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,348
Besides, we are living in the house
of these Japanese men.

112
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,352
I'm sure we are the talk of the town.

113
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:05,193
Once Hiroshi and Teresita are married,
they will no longer care.

114
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,950
Forgive me.

115
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,828
I will go ahead and rest now.

116
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,455
Mr. Tanaka.

117
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,862
Good evening!

118
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,531
We'll leave this woman in your care.

119
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,381
Don't try to leave.
You won't get away from them!

120
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,134
What?

121
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,392
Why?

122
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,562
What kind of place is this?

123
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,235
But they promised me
they would release me.

124
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,363
And you believe them?

125
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,953
But my child was separated from me.

126
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,790
I can't abandon her.

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,750
-Hey!
-Don't!

128
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,960
Where are you going?

129
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,046
Why?

130
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,299
Are you going to rape me too?

131
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,426
-Have mercy!
-I said stay here!

132
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,928
Let go of me!

133
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,806
Lady, I'm your fellow countryman! Help me!

134
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,311
-Help me! Lady, help me!
-Get inside!

135
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,446
Miss, help me, Miss! Help me.

136
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,364
There's nothing more you can do,
just pray.

137
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,700
I remember you.

138
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,870
It's good that you are here to pray.

139
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,331
The Lord will not abandon you.

140
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,374
I hope we meet again.

141
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,627
You're the nun!

142
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,839
Help me, Sister! Help me, I beg you!

143
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,799
Sister, help me.

144
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,844
Help me. I beg you, help me.

145
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,014
Have mercy on me!

146
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,061
-Me too!
-Me too!

147
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,851
Follow the Colonel's orders!

148
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,852
Yes, sir!

149
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,146
Why?

150
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,274
-Why? Where are you taking us?
-Faster!

151
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,401
No!

152
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,736
Let me go! I don't want to!

153
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
I don't want to, let me go!

154
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,783
-Help!
-Where are you taking us?

155
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,785
Help us!

156
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,746
Hey! I'm not involved in this!

157
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,456
Hey!

158
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,583
Have mercy, please, sir!

159
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:56,006
Father, I just came from prison
to meet the man who killed my mother.

160
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,427
I am not in the mood
to discuss such matters.

161
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,890
Especially your plans for me and Teresita.

162
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,142
Well…

163
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:13,149
I agree with your wish
not to continue your marriage to Teresita.

164
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,069
What? Is that true, Father?

165
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,989
She's not meant for you.

166
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,743
There is someone more suitable for her.

167
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,792
What did your father say, Hiroshi?

168
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,336
But, Mr. Tanaka…

169
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,717
No, Mrs. Borromeo.

170
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:46,015
Because my father is
withdrawing from the agreement.

171
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,778
Why are you backing out?

172
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,800
Colonel Yuta Saitoh, Father?

173
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,182
I didn't expect that he would
immediately grant my request.

174
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,856
Teresita, I think we need
to thank our Colonel.

175
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,317
Wait, Hiroshi.

176
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,530
What should we be thankful for?

177
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,574
Now that it's clear
he's interested in my sister,

178
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,493
should we be happy about that?

179
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:55,209
Even at the theater, I could clearly see
his interest in my sister.

180
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,087
Especially when he insisted
on escorting us here. Right, Dad?

181
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,428
I met your fiancée earlier at the theater.

182
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,890
Maybe I can convince Teresita's parents

183
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,393
not to force you two to marry.

184
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,144
So that's why.

185
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,438
What are you saying?

186
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,191
One last thing.

187
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:25,072
You should not tell Teresita
that we spoke.

188
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,083
Nothing, Teresita.

189
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,922
But if our colonel is interested in you,

190
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,134
I'm sure he won't force you
if you don't want to.

191
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:52,433
He is an honorable soldier
and has a heart for others.

192
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,020
For the Japanese like you, Hiroshi, yes.

193
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,440
But us? I can't say.

194
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,658
Julio.

195
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,328
I apologize for my daughter, Mr. Tanaka.

196
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,834
Stand up, let's talk.

197
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,129
Julio, just a moment.
Our discussion is not yet done.

198
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,217
Carmela, the father and son have decided,
and we need to respect that.

199
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,512
We should talk as a family.

200
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,808
So stand up and let's go to our room.

201
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Mr. Tanaka, Hiroshi.

202
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,773
Hiroshi.

203
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,992
Hiroshi, why do you like that girl?

204
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,747
She's too opinionated and strong-willed.

205
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,048
In these troubling times,

206
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,469
Adelina's outspoken nature could bring

207
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,682
more challenges than you realize.

208
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,685
Please keep that in mind.

209
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,030
Haven't I told the both of you?

210
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,992
Especially you, Adelina.

211
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,537
Keep your mouth shut
and be careful with what you say!

212
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,747
Especially in front of the Japanese!

213
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,711
No matter what you tell her,
your stubborn bastard won't listen!

214
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,547
And now Teresita is the same way.

215
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,840
She's just as stubborn.

216
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,051
Mama, please don't be angry.

217
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,512
That's enough, Papa.

218
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,476
Papa, I admit I'm a little harsh at times.

219
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,105
But I'm worried about my sister!

220
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,607
That Colonel Yuta really seems fishy!

221
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,738
Maybe you're just jealous because
the colonel likes Teresita and not you.

222
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,157
-Carmela.
-You think so low of me.

223
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:18,037
So what if the colonel likes Teresita?

224
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,957
He's a much better
replacement for Hiroshi.

225
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,878
Mama, are you really so eager
to marry me off to just any man?

226
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,505
You're something else, Carmela.

227
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,467
He's a colonel, a high-ranking officer!

228
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,429
Unlike Eduardo, who is not even a speck
compared to him!

229
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,516
My brother is much more honorable
than the others

230
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,312
who have no conscience and are willing
to offer their own child to an enemy,

231
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,272
and has likely already killed our people!

232
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
-Mama!
-What's the matter with you?

233
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,904
Mama, that's enough!
What Adelina is saying is true!

234
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,407
Am I the only one
thinking about this family?

235
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,118
Can't you see where we are?

236
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,039
We're like rags in someone else's house!

237
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,834
Is this it? Is this the life you want?

238
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,341
So what if the colonel
likes you, Teresita?

239
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,468
Maybe he'll even return our house to us!

240
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,844
Mama!

241
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,430
Or maybe he'll even give you
another house!

242
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,389
Enough!

243
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,226
I don't want to talk about this anymore!

244
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,370
Your daughter is really so stupid!

245
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,416
You know, Carmela…

246
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,589
You will manage to survive
in dangerous times like these.

247
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:07,312
But remember, not everyone
can succumb to your poison.

248
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,476
That house is owned by the Japanese.

249
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,593
-Why did you bow?
-Isn't she Japanese?

250
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,804
She's not Japanese, she's Filipino.

251
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,560
She's a vaudeville actress
who has Japanese friends.

252
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,688
She's a traitor!

253
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,070
Hurry up! It's curfew!

254
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,604
Don't come near me.

255
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,693
Your father might see us
and get mad at you too.

256
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,904
Don't mind him, Adelina.

257
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
Don't mind him, okay?

258
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,837
He can't do anything to me.

259
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,262
What's that?

260
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,763
What's that?

261
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,642
Gunshots.

262
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,396
Maybe someone violated the curfew.

263
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,285
Adelina, why are you crying?

264
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,040
I thought you were brave now.

265
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm scared.

266
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,050
I'm scared of what's happening now
and for what will happen next.

267
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,180
Adelina, don't be scared.

268
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,392
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't abandon you?

269
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,646
As long as you're here in our home,
you are safe.

270
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,986
Yes.

271
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,948
We are safe from your fellow Japanese.

272
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,701
For now.

273
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,085
But are we safe from our countrymen?

274
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,048
They think that we are traitors
to our own country

275
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,842
just because we are staying with you?

276
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,393
All my family wants is to survive.

277
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,437
But how?

278
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,068
All sides have accompanying dangers.

279
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,613
Everything has its own risks.

280
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,365
So how, Hiroshi?

281
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,911
How will we survive now?
I don't know anymore!

282
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,957
I don't know what's right from wrong now.

283
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,632
Adelina, you will survive.

284
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,176
And so will your loved ones.

285
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,929
All of you.

286
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,306
All of us.

287
00:23:54,766 --> 00:24:00,063
I will defend and fight for you every day.

288
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,405
Even from your colonel?

289
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,199
From Colonel Yuta?

290
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,415
Faster!

291
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,375
-Have mercy!
-Please don't, sir!

292
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,960
Sir, I beg you!

293
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,550
Comrade, they will bury us here.

294
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,969
It seems that this is the end for us.

295
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,929
That Eduardo is an animal!

296
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,556
Traitor!

297
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,850
I wish he would die!

298
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,020
I swear, I will kill that bastard!

299
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,188
You should!

300
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,402
On your knees!

301
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,614
-Sir, please!
-Sir, have mercy!

302
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,532
Enough!

303
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,659
I said get on your knees!

304
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,037
Sir, have mercy!

305
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,791
Have mercy!

306
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,628
We won't do it again!

307
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,338
Don't kill us, sir!

308
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,929
This is for my fellow Japanese,
Mrs. Tanaka,

309
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,184
whom you killed
even when she was innocent.

310
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,695
Sir! Please don't kill me!

311
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,239
I have a wife and child, sir!

312
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,032
Sir, have mercy! Sir! Master!

313
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,202
-I will change, sir!
-Hey! Give him a gun!

314
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,286
Yes, sir!

315
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,749
We won't do it again, we promise!

316
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,966
-Three, two…
-Have mercy, sir.

317
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,717
One.

318
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,180
Sir, have mercy!
Sir, we won't do it again!

319
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,932
Have mercy--

320
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,059
Sir, have mercy!

321
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,269
We won't do it again, sir--

322
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,482
Master, please don't!

323
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,318
I will serve you all my life!
I will help you!

324
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,279
I will let you know who the enemies are!

325
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,572
And anyone opposing the Japanese, sir!

326
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,866
Just don't kill me, sir! Master!

327
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,662
Have mercy! Sir! Master!

328
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,747
Goodness!

329
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,877
Weren't you asleep already?
What's the matter?

330
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,757
I had a nightmare, Tasyo.

331
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,094
I was being chased by a monster.

332
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,432
And it wants to kill me,
Adelina, and Teresita.

333
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,101
A monster?

334
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,771
The only monsters are the Japanese
who want to invade us.

335
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,606
Did you dream of them?

336
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,904
If not, then go back to sleep.
It's just a dream.

337
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,907
I'm washing my face here.

338
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,559
Eduardo's father is
an American military officer,

339
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,311
so Eduardo is a potential threat to us.

340
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,357
Major Campbell escaped
with the help of some armed Filipinos

341
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,776
who killed some of our men.

342
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,487
So I know that Eduardo's father
is still here.

343
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,240
Watch Eduardo Dela Cruz closely

344
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,870
because he himself
might be hiding his own father.

345
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,665
COMING UP

346
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,720
Go to Adelina and Teresita
in their dressing room right away.

347
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,223
They have a visitor, a Japanese Colonel.

348
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,100
I think he's courting Teresita.

349
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,351
He even gave her flowers.

350
