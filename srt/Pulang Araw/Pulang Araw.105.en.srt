1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,293
<i>Hide, Teresita.</i>

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,254
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>She was just here.
How could she disappear?</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>Maybe she got scared and ran away.</i>

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,136
<i>I don't want to be a burden to you.</i>

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,766
<i>Who are you listening to?</i>

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>It's General Douglas MacArthur.</i>

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>We will fight till the very end.</i>

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>We won't retreat,
and we will never surrender.</i>

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,240
We fight or we die.

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,784
Have the Americans came back?

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,328
Leyte will fall into the hands
of the Americans.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,915
I'm also certain the Americans
will infiltrate the other provinces next.

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,083
May I know your name?

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,668
This is Commander Liwayway.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:48,715
I don't fight to entice fools like you!

17
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>She's so beautiful, Eduardo.</i>

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,761
And she's brave.
You're perfect for each other.

19
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,013
<i>Only Teresita holds my heart, Tasyo.</i>

20
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>No one can take her place.</i>

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>Your carriage has arrived, Sister Carmela.</i>

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>We saw soldiers coming this way.</i>

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,645
<i>There are so many of them!</i>

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>They're searching the area.
They're probably looking for us.</i>

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>You shouldn't have brought them here!</i>

26
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,319
Kill them all right now!

27
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,823
<i>You keep bringing people here out of pity.</i>

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,117
<i>We have nothing left to feed them.</i>

29
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>We'll find a way.</i>

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,413
<i>Just like we always do.</i>

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,791
Make sure to sell that to Mrs. Socorro.

32
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,000
Use the money to buy food.

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,585
Aren't you coming with me?

34
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,378
<i>I have somewhere to be.</i>

35
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,963
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

36
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,758
<i>Are you perhaps
reminiscing about your days here?</i>

37
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,221
<i>Vaudeville is where Teresita and I
began to dream.</i>

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,518
<i>It is also where we found
each other again.</i>

39
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,645
Gentlemen.

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,523
I want you to hear the latest news

41
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,026
on the American advances.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,323
This information is highly confidential,

43
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,660
and it is critical you all understand

44
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,915
the full situation

45
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,127
we now face.

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,545
- Yes, Colonel!
- Yes, Colonel!

47
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,255
With that,

48
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,301
allow me to introduce

49
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,179
Rear Admiral Shuto Harada.

50
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,517
He will give us the report.

51
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:08,081
- At last, freedom is ours!
- The Lord has answered our prayers.

52
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,207
Thank God.

53
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,096
Is this true, Lord?

54
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,684
Are we really going to be free
from our enemies?

55
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,480
Three days ago, October 17th,

56
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,359
one of our lookout stations
on Suluan Island

57
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,361
reported the approach of American forces.

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,033
<i>Urgent report!</i>

59
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,036
Enemy forces sighted
near the following coordinates.

60
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:52,083
Ten degrees, 45 minutes, 50 seconds north,

61
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,669
125 degrees,

62
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:59,257
57 minutes,
23 seconds east Suluan Islands!

63
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,594
They're advancing swiftly. Please hurry!

64
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,598
Send us reinforcements!

65
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,686
We will die here, but we will fight!

66
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,024
Long live the Emperor!

67
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,109
The next day,

68
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,362
the skies over here in Manila,

69
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:29,412
Legaspi, and Clark Field
were swarming with enemy planes.

70
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,709
The Americans have struck
across Luzon, Visayas,

71
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,545
and even Mindanao,

72
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,591
crippling our air power
and blocking our movements.

73
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,803
They have also launched
devastating attacks on our ships,

74
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,474
destroying our fleet
and threatening to leave us

75
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,643
without the means to defend these waters!

76
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:58,107
These attacks leave no room for doubt,

77
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,152
the Americans will take back
the Philippines from us!

78
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,946
The Imperial General Headquarters

79
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:13,539
has commanded a decisive action
against these bastards.

80
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,669
But our ships, carriers,

81
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:24,592
and bombers are no match
for the enemy's strength.

82
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,302
Colonel.

83
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:33,059
If that's the case,
how will we be able to fight back?

84
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,206
Sho Ichigo Sakusen?

85
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,041
Colonel.

86
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,289
Colonel, are we really going to sacrifice
the lives of our pilots?

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,002
To die for our own homeland

88
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,592
is the highest honor we can ever achieve.

89
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,210
Sister, please eat first.

90
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,339
It's important that we stay alive
in these times.

91
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,218
So we can all witness
the day of our freedom.

92
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,970
Come now, everyone.

93
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,528
Adelina.

94
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,239
What took you so long?

95
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,201
We've been worried all night about you.

96
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,245
Where were you?

97
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:02,041
I'm with someone
you'll be very happy to see.

98
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,752
Who?

99
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,934
Do you still remember me?

100
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
Sister Manuela.

101
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,149
Auntie Yolanda.

102
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,068
God Almighty.

103
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,114
Teresita.

104
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,047
Thank the heavens.

105
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,466
We've finally met again.

106
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,844
And now,

107
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,433
you're wearing the habit of a novitiate.

108
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,685
Have you become a nun?

109
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,313
I'll tell you more about that later.

110
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,567
There's not a single night
I've never thought of you all.

111
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,281
I kept praying and wondering
if all of you are safe.

112
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,951
Now I know.

113
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,081
It's nice to see you again, señorita.

114
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,794
I've also prayed for you every night.

115
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,106
Hey, Japanese!

116
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,108
Why are you dressed
in our enemy's clothing?

117
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,153
Do you have a new mission?

118
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,947
I'm leaving for personal reasons.

119
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,326
I've already informed our sergeant,

120
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,661
and he permitted me to go.

121
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,953
Where are you going?

122
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,124
I can't rest until I've spoken to Adelina.

123
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,379
I can't die in this war
without earning her forgiveness.

124
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,797
You're going to look for her?

125
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,799
It's too dangerous, my friend.

126
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,302
But what if you get caught?

127
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,515
I'll do whatever it takes, Nando.
Just for Adelina to forgive me.

128
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,355
Thank you, Auntie Yolanda.

129
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,525
And thank you, Adelina.

130
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,237
Thanks for bringing me here.

131
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,664
But, Manuela, why are you
the only one here?

132
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,333
Where's Auntie Amalia and Lorena?

133
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
Lorena is safe.

134
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,343
She's hiding in the province.

135
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,720
She's with her family now.

136
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,807
Thank God.

137
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,227
What about Auntie Amalia?

138
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,612
She's at peace now, Teresita.

139
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,787
But she died a true hero.

140
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,664
Amalia…

141
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>She killed my Uncle Lauro,</i>

142
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>- who was brainwashed by our enemies.</i>
- They were right!

143
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,383
You're a traitor to our country!

144
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,010
Traitor!

145
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,346
But how was she…

146
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,892
How was she killed?

147
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,021
Her death was unfortunate, Teresita.

148
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,736
You'll pay for this!

149
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,115
<i>But she died avenging herself
for the terrible fate</i>

150
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:09,038
<i>she suffered from one of the soldiers
who abused her.</i>

151
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,289
Auntie!

152
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,962
At least I'll be with Luisa in paradise.

153
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,608
She passed away with a smile on her face.

154
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,073
She knew she was going to be
with her daughter in heaven.

155
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,910
So don't mourn for her, Teresita.

156
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,292
Auntie Amalia is now free and at peace.

157
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,546
We've lost so many lives.

158
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,633
Auntie Amalia.

159
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,179
Ma'am Dolores.

160
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,142
Mama and Papa too.

161
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,773
If we ever make it to the end,

162
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,610
would we still wish to live on?

163
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,242
From all the pain
and heartbreaks we've suffered?

164
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,371
I still can't imagine

165
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,419
all the suffering and torment
you went through, Teresita.

166
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,756
But even so,

167
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,302
we're still trying our best to survive.

168
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:53,309
And that's because we want to witness
our country's freedom.

169
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,134
Goodbye.

170
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,268
What will you do with the mud?

171
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:46,195
Nando, this is what I'll use
to hide my identity from the Japanese.

172
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,581
I had lost hope back then, Adelina.

173
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,627
So I decided to return

174
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,297
and offer myself to Yuta.

175
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,009
<i>I'm giving you until tonight to come back.</i>

176
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,013
<i>Or else, something bad
will happen to Adelina.</i>

177
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,391
<i>I'll do as you say, Yuta.</i>

178
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,642
<i>I'll surrender.</i>

179
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,311
But it was too late
when I found out you already escaped.

180
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,355
<i>Now, where's my sister?</i>

181
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,856
<i>Release her this instant.</i>

182
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,776
There's no need for that. She has escaped.

183
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,196
But I still carried out my plan.

184
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,241
<i>I tried to take Yuta's life.</i>

185
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,580
I really thought I killed him.

186
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,457
<i>So I fled.</i>

187
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,835
And there I saw Eduardo again.

188
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,175
Teresita.

189
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,218
<i>My brother?</i>

190
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,721
Did he attack Saitoh's camp again?

191
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,923
Teresita.

192
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,260
Where are you?

193
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,850
Have you completely forgotten about me?

194
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,198
I was overwhelmed with joy, Adelina.

195
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:03,332
<i>My hope was renewed in that brief moment.</i>

196
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,919
<i>But then the enemies came.</i>

197
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,716
Run, Teresita. Get yourself out of here.

198
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,927
They'll both catch us if you don't go now.

199
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>Your brother saved me.</i>

200
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,472
He helped me escape.

201
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,641
And then?

202
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,103
What happened to Eduardo?

203
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,563
We saw each other again at the convent.

204
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,067
<i>Where I sought refuge and asked for help.</i>

205
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,071
<i>Your brother invited me to their base.</i>

206
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,616
But I ran away.

207
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,702
Why, Teresita?

208
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,958
Eduardo would've felt more at ease
if you had gone with him.

209
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,752
I felt ashamed.

210
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,841
I didn't want to be a burden.

211
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,848
Especially since I knew
that I was pregnant at that time.

212
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,251
This is your Colonel.

213
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,673
What happened to your investigation?

214
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,219
Have you found what I'm looking for?

215
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,723
You're all useless!

216
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,351
When will you find them?

217
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,480
When I'm already dead?

218
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,402
I will give you three days

219
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,906
to bring me good news.

220
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,494
If not, I'll have you killed!

221
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,794
I was impregnated

222
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,465
by the devil himself.

223
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,931
I was pregnant

224
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,808
with Yuta's child.

225
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,189
God…

226
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,280
Hey! Wait!

227
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,451
My God.

228
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,039
My heart aches for you, Teresita.

229
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,419
After everything you've been through,

230
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:41,049
you had to carry in your womb the child
of that horrible Colonel Saitoh.

231
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,064
What happened to your pregnancy?

232
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,191
Where's the child?

233
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,197
Gone.

234
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,960
<i>I bled and miscarried</i>

235
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
<i>before I could return to the convent.</i>

236
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,402
<i>General Iwabuchi has chosen
to stay in Manila.</i>

237
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,573
<i>He's prepared to defend this city
to the last man.</i>

238
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,494
<i>- And so are we.
- You shouldn't have come here anymore.</i>

239
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,912
He's still an enemy.

240
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:56,041
<i>You can punish me in any way you want
if that will give you peace in your heart.</i>

241
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,459
COMING UP

242
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
<i>I finally found my wife.</i>

243
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,296
<i>You probably thought
you would reign over this land forever.</i>

244
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,592
<i>Now, taste the wrath of the people
who will not bow down</i>

245
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,260
<i>or be oppressed by anyone!</i>

246
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,433
