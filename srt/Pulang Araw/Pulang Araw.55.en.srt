1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,045
Mrs. Borromeo is not
a good wife and mother.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,341
I don't want to associate myself
with her anymore.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,885
I have a better plan in mind.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,263
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,099
Teresita, the Japanese soldiers
are looking for you.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,643
Pack your things
and get the hell out of here!

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,353
Which one is Teresita Borromeo?

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,689
We need more weapons.

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:27,152
Do you remember playing hide-and-seek
when we were kids?

10
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:32,032
But unlike before,
our seeker was a friend and a playmate.

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,994
Why isn't she with you?

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,287
She's gone.

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,708
She was abducted by Japanese soldiers.

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,501
We couldn't do anything.

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,628
We weren't able to help her.

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:50,675
And we don't know where they took her.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,721
Teresita shouldn't have been in danger.
It should've been you, Adelina!

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,266
Yes, she is.

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,102
Who would have thought
we would meet here in hell?

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,605
What are we doing here, Auntie Amalia?

21
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
Just come with me.

22
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,650
If she only knew
what happens in this hell.

23
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,487
Use our car to go there.

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,240
-Hiroshi, take care.
-Yes, I will.

25
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,826
Where are you going? I'm coming with you.

26
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,870
Stay here. We'll handle it. Let's go.

27
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,348
We also need to get going, Carmela.

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,267
Luis and I bid you farewell.

29
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,937
I hope they find Teresita.

30
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,231
Do you think they ever will?

31
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,608
I don't think so.

32
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,802
This will be your room.

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,434
Why?

34
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,853
What do they really want from me?

35
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,854
Shut up!

36
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,856
You never stop talking!

37
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,904
Just do what they say
so they won't make it harder on you.

38
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,199
Dolores, let's go.

39
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,618
Leave her alone.

40
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,169
Let me out of here!

41
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,174
Help! Let me out of here!

42
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,630
Get me out of here!

43
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,471
Captain Watanabe.

44
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,350
Hiroshi, what do you need from me?

45
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,435
My apologies for disturbing you.

46
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,690
We don't know
where our colonel is at the moment.

47
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,567
That's why we're asking for
your help instead.

48
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,278
"We"?

49
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,862
Mr. Borromeo.

50
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,656
Adelina.

51
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,373
We'll ask him for help, Hiroshi?

52
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,791
Adelina.

53
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,670
We must show him respect.

54
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,340
Good day, sir.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,426
Have a seat.

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,723
What do you want from me?

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,476
Why are they here, Hiroshi?

58
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,774
Why was Teresita abducted?

59
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,320
Who are these devils
going to arrest this time?

60
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,495
Where are Miss Teresita and Adelina?

61
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,788
Didn't you know

62
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,419
that Teresita was abducted
by Japanese soldiers this morning?

63
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,673
Which Japanese soldier arrested her?

64
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,054
Did you recognize any of them?

65
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,223
No, we did not. It all happened so fast.

66
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,934
How despicable!

67
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,187
This is absurd!

68
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,617
Rest assured, I will not let this pass.

69
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,663
I, myself, will punish those soldiers.

70
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,217
My daughter shouldn't have been arrested.

71
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,469
She didn't do anything wrong.

72
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,014
Captain, I'm begging you.

73
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,268
Can you help us find Teresita?

74
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,853
I will do what I can.

75
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,440
You may leave now.

76
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,111
We will be in your debt, sir.

77
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,655
Thank you so much.

78
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,046
Him? Really, Hiroshi?

79
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,007
I don't believe your friend
is going to help us.

80
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,802
He might even be the one behind all this.

81
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,680
Someone might hear you.

82
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,390
And what makes you say that, Adelina?

83
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,225
Have you forgotten?

84
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:19,105
That man threw us out
and hurt us in our own home.

85
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,233
Where are the others living with you?

86
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,861
-I only live here with my wife.
-Liar!

87
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,660
Search the entire house! Find the women!

88
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,163
Good thing Teresita and I
were able to hide.

89
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,957
Because if not, he might have
already taken my sister then.

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,335
Can you really blame me
for not trusting that man?

91
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,087
I feel the same, Hiroshi.

92
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,964
I have my doubts about him too.

93
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,551
I don't think he'll help us either.

94
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,725
But aside from Akio, our only option
is to approach the colonel.

95
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,436
You mean, Colonel Saitoh?

96
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,397
I don't trust him either.

97
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,984
I'm even more suspicious of that man.

98
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:09,822
Adelina, who will we turn to
if you don't trust anyone?

99
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,312
So from this day forward,

100
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:47,610
every single theater, performance,
stage play, and music,

101
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,906
will be reviewed by our Sendenbu

102
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:57,245
to ensure that you're following
our guidelines.

103
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,272
I thought you already asked for help.

104
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,649
Why hasn't Teresita been found?

105
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,236
There were so many of you in that theater,

106
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,030
but no one even tried to save her?

107
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,116
I tried to save my sister.

108
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,912
But I couldn't do much
because the soldiers had guns.

109
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:45,918
Just admit you prioritized
your safety over my daughter!

110
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,339
Adelina, you act like you love Teresita.

111
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,969
But in her time of need,
you abandoned her!

112
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:06,105
Am I really the selfish
and heartless one, señora?

113
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,568
There's nothing I wouldn't do
for the good of my siblings.

114
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,032
I'm not like some people here
who are so cunning

115
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,118
that they are willing to betray
even their own spouse

116
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,245
just to get what they want.

117
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,624
What do you mean by that?

118
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,711
Why don't you ask the señora?

119
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,177
Did you see that, Julio?

120
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,641
That woman has the gall
to try and ruin me so shamelessly.

121
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,770
You? Or your family?

122
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,148
No!

123
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,027
Señora, tell us.

124
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,990
Are you the one behind
your own daughter's arrest?

125
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,535
Did you make a deal
with that high-ranking Japanese official

126
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,914
and give him Teresita
in exchange for such petty comfort?

127
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,543
Enough! Stop! Carmela, stop!

128
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,381
I would never betray my daughter!

129
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,799
My own daughter?

130
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,720
I'd rather die
than let anyone take her from me

131
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,181
in such a violent way!

132
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,018
Your accusations are baseless, Adelina!

133
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,979
I really hope you're telling us the truth

134
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,024
because this is too vile, even for you!

135
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,692
-How dare you!
-Enough!

136
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,277
-I said enough!
-How dare you!

137
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,530
Stop, both of you! Enough!

138
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,199
Tell that bastard of yours to stop!

139
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,370
Ever since she started living with us,

140
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,039
she's brought nothing but bad luck!

141
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,668
You're the devil in this family!

142
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,754
You're the devil of all our lives!

143
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,383
I said, enough! Enough!

144
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,263
-Adelina!
-I'll take care of her.

145
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,235
It is important that you all work together

146
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,572
in building a new Philippines.

147
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:27,329
Now, if there are no further questions,
we'll take our leave.

148
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,555
They're arresting, imprisoning,
and hurting our men.

149
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,100
They're abducting our women, and now…

150
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,896
they're dictating what we can perform?

151
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,065
You shouldn't be surprised anymore, Luis.

152
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:01,405
This is just the start
of our oppression under them.

153
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,296
This rosary belonged to my mother.

154
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,968
I'm gifting this to you
so it may protect you at all times.

155
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,846
Eduardo.

156
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,227
I don't know who to ask for help.

157
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,525
I don't even know what awaits me here.

158
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,935
Come on, dance for us! Cheers!

159
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,664
Let's take this off!

160
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,272
Strip!

161
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,243
-Dance!
-Dance!

162
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,496
Dance, woman! Start dancing!

163
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,545
Let go of me!

164
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,443
Adelina, forgive me.

165
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,865
But you shouldn't have accused
Mrs. Borromeo so harshly.

166
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,660
That was not just an accusation, Hiroshi.

167
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,247
She tried to convince Colonel Saitoh
to get rid of my father.

168
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,583
And in return?

169
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,754
She'll marry Teresita to him.

170
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,800
Señora Carmela said that herself.

171
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,845
If you really want to marry
my daughter, Colonel,

172
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,850
you must keep Julio away from my family.

173
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,068
It's a good thing
the colonel didn't agree.

174
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,529
But why didn't you tell your father?

175
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,989
For what?

176
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,535
He'll just be more upset if he finds out,

177
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,789
and I'll burden only him.

178
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't want to talk
about the señora anymore.

179
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,755
Please.

180
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:54,263
My only concern
is the safety of my siblings.

181
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,142
There's nothing I can do
about the life Eduardo has chosen.

182
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,477
But Teresita…

183
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,689
I believe we can still find and save her.

184
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,982
Don't worry.

185
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,527
Are we still going to turn
a blind eye, Hiroshi?

186
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,863
Do you really think Teresita
would be taken

187
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,491
without an order from the upper ranks?

188
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,703
So tell me,

189
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,541
how am I supposed to believe
they'll help us find her?

190
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,671
I'm starting to fear
I won't see her again.

191
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,133
Adelina, not all Japanese are bad.

192
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,928
Can you please just trust me?

193
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,808
Adelina, I will do everything
to find Teresita.

194
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,947
I hope you do find her.

195
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,035
Because if you don't,

196
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,752
I'll be your country's greatest enemy.

197
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,814
I'm begging you,
I can't take this anymore.

198
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,442
I beg you.

199
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,028
Sir, I beg you.

200
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,244
-Strip her!
-Sir, no!

201
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,496
-Strip!
-No!

202
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,707
-Strip your clothes!
-No! No!

203
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,862
Señor!

204
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,238
Rosing!

205
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,698
I'm glad you're safe.

206
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,408
Are they your children?

207
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,578
Yes, this is Teresita and this is Adelina.

208
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,538
They shouldn't be outside anymore.

209
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,332
The Japanese might see and abduct them.

210
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
Abduct?

211
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,962
Don't you know
they have abducted many women?

212
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,299
They bring them to the garrison
to become comfort women.

213
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,467
They cannot do that to my daughters.

214
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,887
We have Japanese friends in the army.

215
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,264
Just be careful out there.

216
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,765
They spare no one.

217
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
Look!

218
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,119
There's more.

219
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,330
Here.

220
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
Thank God you got back safely, Eduardo!

221
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,378
What is this?

222
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,463
Sir.

223
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,591
Look at what we stole from the garrison.

224
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,509
Here.

225
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm sure this will help us a lot.

226
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,267
The American has made his order clear.

227
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,105
You were only supposed to
observe the garrison, not steal.

228
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,234
What if you were caught and killed?

229
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,948
This is not the time
to show off your bravado!

230
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,450
Forgive me.

231
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,453
Sir Jorge, forgive us.
It won't happen again.

232
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,996
This better not happen again.

233
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,456
You're disobeying our command.

234
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,126
You're lucky the major's not here.

235
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,673
Or you'll certainly be punished.

236
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,902
Sir Jorge is right, Eduardo.

237
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,033
You shouldn't have
put your life in danger.

238
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,248
Remember that you still have
a sister and a fiancée

239
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
waiting for you back home.

240
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,780
Why did you make a hole in the window?

241
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,289
Let go of me!

242
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,166
Let go!

243
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,792
Let go of me!

244
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,347
Sir, have mercy on me! Please!

245
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,266
Help!

246
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,492
Sir!

247
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,592
Miss, is what I think true?

248
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,554
Is this why I'm here?

249
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,651
I found you!

250
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,199
Let go of me! Let go of me!

251
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,789
Please don't!

252
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,360
Let me go!

253
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,534
Miss!

254
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,912
Aren't we going to help them?

255
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,500
What can you do?

256
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,930
Help!

257
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,477
Help! Help!

258
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,523
Go ahead! Get sick of me!

259
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,234
Get sick of me!

260
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,737
-Pigs! Damn pigs!
-My God.

261
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,535
Damn merciless pigs!

262
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,123
Let go of me!

263
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,594
Please don't! Please stop!

264
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,936
-Hey! It's our turn!
-Go ahead!

265
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,948
Will I also end up like them?

266
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,203
Am I also going to suffer
under those Japanese men?

267
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,253
Our guerrillas need us.

268
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,755
So I hope you join us.

269
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,924
COMING UP

270
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,260
What do you want from me, Hiroshi?

271
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:57,097
Did you have something to do
with Teresita Borromeo's arrest?

272
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,852
I don't like Hiroshi Tanaka's tone
and actions towards me.

273
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,022
-What do you want to happen?
-Who is your master?

274
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,526
He's a very brutal man
and the mastermind behind all of this.

275
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,860
Please don't come in!

276
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,448
I have something for you to do.

277
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:20,078
I want Adelina gone from our lives,
as well as the Tanakas.

278
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,872
I've been quiet about this for a while,

279
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,626
that Adelina and Eduardo
still see each other.

280
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,256
She also knows the whereabouts
of her rebellious brother.

281
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,342
-What do you want from me?
-Stupid woman!

282
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,517
