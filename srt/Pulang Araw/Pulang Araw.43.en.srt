1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,502
You also invaded us.

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,630
You victimize our women.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:09,342
And now, you arrest and hurt our men!

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:14,305
What makes you different
from the foreigners who invaded us before?

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,809
He was arrested by our soldiers earlier.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,020
Did you have anything to do with it?

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,813
Are you accusing me?

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,648
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:28,695
If Eduardo is killed by the same soldiers
who abducted him and Tasyo,

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,030
I'll leave.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,906
Hiroshi, I'll leave this place.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,908
-Where will you go?
-To the mountains.

13
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,538
I will join the Filipinos
who are fighting against your army.

14
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,500
Sorry, but this is all we've gathered
for our brave guerrillas.

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,669
Just keep strong.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,630
Don't give the Japanese the satisfaction
of knowing they killed you here.

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,507
I will ask the soldiers for water.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,052
No one will give you anything here
even if you shout.

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,722
We can't just accept our situation here.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,517
Because a lack of hope
is like death itself.

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,727
If we do nothing,

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,647
we will never be
with our loved ones again.

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,652
Are we just going to allow ourselves
to die here without putting up a fight?

24
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,468
We're selling goods! Take your pick!

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,303
Fresh vegetables here!

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,515
Take your pick!

27
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,955
Mama.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,916
That's enough, Carmela.

29
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,960
You fools!

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,966
You know it's unladylike for a woman
to visit a man at his house.

31
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,385
My God, Teresita!

32
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,264
And you, bastard.

33
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,933
Did you drag my daughter into this again?

34
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,311
Mama, she didn't do anything wrong.

35
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,397
I willingly left to go with Eduardo.

36
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,482
What do you mean?

37
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,152
Were you going to elope?

38
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,700
You were going to run away
with that scoundrel?

39
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,332
You and Eduardo are both bastards.

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,878
I'm sure you conspired with each other
to take my daughter away from me!

41
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,172
-Stop! Enough!
-Mama, stop!

42
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,340
Carmela, that's enough!

43
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,259
Why do you always blame me

44
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,553
as if Teresita
doesn't have a mind of her own?

45
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,263
-You dare talk back to me!
-Carmela!

46
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,806
-Mama!
-I said, stop!

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,603
Carmela, isn't it enough
that they came back and didn't run away?

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,234
Teresita, what really happened?

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,569
I'm glad you changed your mind
and came back home.

50
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,820
Dad.

51
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,824
Eduardo was arrested by the Japanese.

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,788
Tasyo too. And we don't know
where they are.

53
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,172
I already went to our colonel
to look for Eduardo.

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,219
No need, Mr. Tanaka.

55
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,973
It's good that Eduardo was arrested.

56
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:30,270
That way, he won't
come near my Teresita again.

57
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,648
Is that what you want for Eduardo, Mama?

58
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,609
Don't you have any sympathy?

59
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,697
What if the Japanese kill them?

60
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
You'll let that happen
to your fellow countryman?

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,107
Pardon me, Mrs. Borromeo.

62
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,779
But why are you so cruel
to Adelina and Eduardo?

63
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,659
Hiroshi.

64
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,875
I am truly grateful
you let us stay in your home.

65
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,628
But I will appreciate it

66
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,633
if you do not interfere with our family.

67
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,247
Moises Santiago!

68
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,540
Come here.

69
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,541
Come with us!

70
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,836
No!

71
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,129
Please, no!

72
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,840
Hey! This is it!

73
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
Hey!

74
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,862
You bastards!

75
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,198
Was that a gunshot?

76
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,408
You're right.

77
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,368
Maybe one of our soldiers shot a Filipino.

78
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,542
Why did you shoot?
They're going to hear us.

79
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,841
Go there and investigate.

80
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,348
Take the two soldiers. Hurry up.

81
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,036
Hush now, Teresita.

82
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,707
My dear.

83
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,463
Stop thinking that something bad
will happen to Eduardo.

84
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,217
That's easy for you to say, Dad.

85
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,971
But Teresita is right.

86
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,142
What if Eduardo is in danger right now?

87
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,689
It's normal to worry or be scared.

88
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,444
But I know how strong your faith can be.

89
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:54,617
Why don't you use
what the Lord has given you?

90
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,826
Prayer.

91
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,413
He promised…

92
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,167
He wouldn't abandon us, right?

93
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,217
Let's put our trust in Him.

94
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,596
Our prayers…

95
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,269
are our only light in this gruesome world.

96
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,897
Let's hold on to our faith.

97
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,026
The Lord will not abandon Eduardo.

98
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,239
Just have faith.

99
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,507
Hold him down!

100
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,177
Grab his gun!

101
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,891
Call for help. Quick.

102
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,274
He's dead. I think he's dead.

103
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,985
We're screwed now.

104
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,071
I knew it.

105
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,781
This was such a stupid idea.

106
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,491
You're going to get us killed!

107
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,662
Find the keys to the cells.

108
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,586
This way, hurry!

109
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,605
Let's go. We need to leave now.

110
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,273
What should we do?

111
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,692
Let's stay here for now.
It's still dangerous outside.

112
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,860
No.

113
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,112
If we don't escape now,

114
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,157
we will only give
the Japanese time to prepare.

115
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,788
We have come this far.

116
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,624
There's no turning back.

117
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,794
We have no choice but to fight.

118
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,423
So prepare your weapons.

119
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,007
I'm sure we'll need them.

120
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,008
Let's go!

121
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,094
What are you waiting for?

122
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,971
Those with weapons, follow us.

123
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,405
What's taking them so long?

124
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,169
Keep moving.

125
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,147
Hello?

126
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,112
Is anyone home?

127
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,784
Is anyone home?

128
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,500
-Good day, Adelina.
-Good day, Mr. Luis.

129
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,002
Did Daddy Johnny send you here?

130
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,673
He was wondering why you didn't make it
to today's morning performance,

131
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,426
that's why he asked me to fetch you.

132
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,805
I'm sorry I couldn't go,
my brother is still missing.

133
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,059
What happened to him?

134
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,759
I feel sorry for my children.

135
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,304
But there's nothing I can do to help them.

136
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,975
I feel like…

137
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,439
this world has turned me
into a useless father.

138
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,364
Our country has been
completely taken over.

139
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:33,080
But I know that you
and your father can help us.

140
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,292
Hiroshi.

141
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,129
I have a favor to ask you.

142
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,968
Please do everything you can
to find Eduardo.

143
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,139
Don't worry, Mr. Borromeo.

144
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,560
I've talked to my father
and we're going to help.

145
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,523
After he gets dressed,
we'll head out soon.

146
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,485
May the Lord bless you, Hiroshi.

147
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,366
I better get going.

148
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,459
During these troubling times,

149
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:24,465
what can a father do to help his children?

150
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,345
So that's why
you didn't come to the theater.

151
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,266
We might not be able to perform
until Eduardo is found.

152
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,352
Adelina.

153
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:42,691
I don't know how to tell you this
without dampening your hopes, but…

154
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,738
if you're caught by the Kempeitai,

155
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,574
that can only end in two ways.

156
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,998
-It's either you're imprisoned or--
-Stop. That won't happen, Mr. Luis.

157
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,752
I still believe God will hear our prayers.

158
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,838
My brother will come back to us alive.

159
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,883
Besides, Hiroshi is helping us.

160
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,053
Who?

161
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,138
Your Japanese friend?

162
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,976
I'm hoping he can help us find my brother.

163
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,522
Don't trust him.

164
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,318
-We need a rope!
-You heard him! Take off your clothes!

165
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,725
Will this rope hold, sir?

166
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,227
I'll go first.

167
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,237
It's fine!

168
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,867
Support him.

169
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,044
-Tasyo, it's your turn!
-Go! We'll be right behind you.

170
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,880
Hurry up.

171
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,853
Mr. Luis.

172
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,731
Hiroshi is my friend.

173
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,818
He's also a close friend of my siblings.

174
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,987
But he's still Japanese.

175
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,950
We don't know what he's thinking.

176
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,329
Whatever happens,

177
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,248
he will choose his country over you.

178
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,542
Adelina.

179
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,337
You must not trust anyone

180
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,965
who helped the Japanese invade us.

181
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,512
That's all. Goodbye, Adelina.

182
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,202
Who's next?

183
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,267
Keep shooting!

184
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,268
Keep shooting!

185
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,480
They found us!

186
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,898
Fall back! They found us!

187
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,778
We're surrounded! We need to go…

188
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,461
-Tasyo! Let's go!
-Sir, don't stop! Run!

189
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,791
Tasyo.

190
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,180
Sir, do you think they escaped?

191
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,683
Or were they all killed?

192
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,399
Maybe you're right, Mario.

193
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,655
I think they killed our men,
including my friend Tasyo.

194
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,578
I will carry this burden
for as long as I live.

195
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,709
I will never forget the faces
of our men and their bravery.

196
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,630
We owe our lives to all of them.

197
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,884
They risked their lives
so we could be free.

198
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,683
That's why we should not waste
their efforts…

199
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,813
in order to repay them.

200
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,653
This is our way of thanking
those who have died for us.

201
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,655
Do you understand?

202
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,910
Yes, sir.

203
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,082
Let's go. We can't stay here.

204
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,802
Captain!

205
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm glad we ran into you.
We really wanted to see you.

206
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,119
How can I help you, Mr. Tanaka?

207
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,414
Help us find Eduardo Dela Cruz.

208
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,082
He was arrested yesterday.

209
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,002
You know him from that report I gave you.

210
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:22,090
My apologies,
but I know nothing about his arrest.

211
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,552
That's impossible, Akio.

212
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,388
You read the report, right?

213
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:35,353
Unless someone else wanted him arrested,

214
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,773
and I think you know who it is.

215
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,149
I know nothing!

216
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,528
Please excuse me. I'm busy.

217
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,080
Father, he's lying to us.

218
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,796
Whoever ordered Eduardo's arrest,
he's definitely someone powerful

219
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,092
because they are making it difficult
for us to find him.

220
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,389
Father, go home without me.

221
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,892
There's someone I need to talk to.

222
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,812
Who?

223
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,225
Colonel, Hiroshi is here to see you.

224
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,270
Again?

225
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,607
I don't want to be disturbed right now.

226
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,942
Dismiss him.

227
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,777
Yes, sir.

228
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:23,188
Sir, master, they won't stop bothering you
until Eduardo is found.

229
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,746
Colonel Yuta's office.

230
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:46,211
I will make sure that,
once they find Eduardo,

231
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,256
he will already be dead.

232
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,220
I will let him know.

233
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,434
Colonel, some prisoners escaped
and caused chaos at Fort Santiago.

234
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,769
You are needed there.

235
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,689
Idiots!

236
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,983
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

237
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,116
Where's the body of Eduardo Dela Cruz?

238
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,367
You imbeciles!

239
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,910
How could you let them escape?

240
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,453
COMING UP

241
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,039
I found out that the Colonel
was behind Eduardo's arrest.

242
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,166
Adelina needs to know about this.

243
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,793
Which prison did they take him to?

244
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,670
How did you know they escaped?

245
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,006
And who wanted them arrested?

246
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,509
Thank you, good sir,
for bringing our son home.

247
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,928
Anybody home?

248
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,889
I already told you. Eduardo is not here.

249
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,266
My father is telling the truth.

250
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,268
The man you're looking for is not here.

251
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,021
Mario was arrested by the Japanese.

252
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,024
Why are you looking for my son here?

253
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,192
-Search the whole house.
-Yes, sir!

254
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,616
