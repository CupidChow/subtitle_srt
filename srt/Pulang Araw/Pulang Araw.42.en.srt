1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,254
Is my father the only reason
you are doing this to us?

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,674
Or maybe you really want to punish me
because of Teresita?

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,844
Keep him safe from harm.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:15,223
And please don't let them
take him away from me.

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,768
Adelina and Teresita are our only hope.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,145
Do you think

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,524
Colonel Yuta would let Teresita
find or see me again?

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,277
Are you saying
we can no longer leave this place?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,778
It's so painful

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,114
that we can't leave.

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,074
We can't look for him.
We can't do anything.

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,618
We must stay strong.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,038
Please tell me where Eduardo was taken.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,414
I really don't know.

15
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,000
Could it be Colonel Yuta?

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,085
What does he want from Eduardo?

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,256
It will be easier for you
to take Miss Teresita for yourself if…

18
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,967
I think you're forgetting
your place, Captain.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,011
Colonel? Are you there?

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,929
You fool!

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:01:00,018
How will the locals trust us
if we are hurting them?

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,479
-Ouch!
-What is this commotion?

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,899
We need to get out of here, Tasyo.
They will kill us.

24
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,776
But how?

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,194
I only came here

26
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,238
because I want to ask you
about my friend Eduardo.

27
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,783
Did you have anything to do with it?

28
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,535
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,455
This place is heavily guarded.

30
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,668
There are armed Japanese everywhere.
How are we going to get out of here?

31
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,677
Eduardo.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,513
Mario Santos!

33
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,353
Mario Santos!

34
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,816
Mario Santos!

35
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,447
I don't want to go!

36
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,991
Have mercy, sir!

37
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,285
Let me go! Help me!

38
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,453
-Enough!
-Help me!

39
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,372
My friends, help me!

40
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,749
Let me go! Have mercy!

41
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,293
Let me go!

42
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,045
Don't be a hero
if you don't want to die here now.

43
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,924
Come on.

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
Tanaka.

45
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,238
Are you accusing me?

46
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,335
Of course not, Colonel.

47
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:09,499
What would I have to do
with Eduardo's capture?

48
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,753
My apologies, Colonel.

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:20,718
But can you help me find out
where they took my friend?

50
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,601
Go home now and get some rest.

51
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,311
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,314
Thank you so much, Colonel.

53
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm just a student.

54
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,218
I'm only a student.

55
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,137
I'm not a guerilla.

56
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,601
Why are you wearing that uniform?

57
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,938
-Let me go!
-Answer me!

58
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,189
Let me go!

59
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,494
Bastards!

60
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,791
Die!

61
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,684
We thought you weren't coming, sir.

62
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,772
We need to leave right away.
And you should too.

63
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,816
Sorry, but this is all we've gathered.

64
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,693
Don't worry.

65
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,030
We'll continue collecting
donations for our soldiers,

66
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,823
for our brave guerrillas.

67
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,205
This is already a big help for us.

68
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,709
We'll go ahead.

69
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,960
Take care.

70
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,505
-You too.
-Thank you.

71
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,382
Marcel, let's go.

72
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,399
-Who is it?
-Adelina, it's me.

73
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,120
Hiroshi.

74
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,163
Hiroshi, any news?

75
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,666
Did you find Eduardo and Tasyo?

76
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,877
Did you find out where they were taken?

77
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,003
Not yet.

78
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,382
But I have already asked
our colonel for help.

79
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,926
He'll help us find Eduardo.

80
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,179
Your colonel?

81
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,223
Colonel Saitoh?

82
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,770
Do you really think
he will help us find Eduardo?

83
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,649
Adelina, I know
you don't trust our colonel.

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,655
But he's the only one I know
in our army with the highest rank.

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,409
Can we at least give him a chance?

86
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,997
Who knows. He might actually help us.

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,126
Do you honestly believe
he's going to look for my brother?

88
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,213
He might even be the reason
why Eduardo was taken in the first place.

89
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,800
Can you stop these accusations, Adelina?

90
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,887
Especially when you don't
have evidence yet.

91
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,514
Let's give him a chance.

92
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,268
Let's wait and see
what our colonel can do.

93
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,689
Adelina.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,318
Adelina, I'm scared.

95
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,488
What if we never find Eduardo?

96
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,107
Move away.

97
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,444
Give him some space to breathe.

98
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,365
Tasyo.

99
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,047
You will live.

100
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,008
Just keep strong.

101
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,929
Don't let yourself die here.

102
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,225
Don't give the Japanese the satisfaction
of knowing they killed you here.

103
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,567
I don't want to die here, sir.

104
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,199
I still want to see my mother and father.

105
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
Adelina.

106
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,126
Always listen to your brother Eduardo.

107
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,421
Be more understanding towards him,

108
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,466
especially with his insults and jokes.

109
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,594
Promise me that, whatever happens,

110
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,763
you will never be apart.

111
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,736
Adelina.

112
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,572
Get some rest.

113
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,408
Try to sleep.

114
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,963
How?

115
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,937
Forgive me if…

116
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
I wasn't able to find Eduardo.

117
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,154
You may be right, Adelina.

118
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,952
I am not yet powerful enough

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,413
to protect the three of you.

120
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,228
If anything bad happens to Eduardo…

121
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,607
If Eduardo is killed by the same soldiers
who abducted him and Tasyo,

122
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,484
I'll leave.

123
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,736
Hiroshi, I'll leave this place.

124
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,367
Adelina, where will you go?

125
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,623
To the mountains.

126
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,672
I will join the Filipinos
who are fighting against your army.

127
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,593
Don't say that, Adelina.

128
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,722
-Don't say such things.
-Why?

129
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,099
Why?

130
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,022
I will fight, Hiroshi!
I will fight with all my might!

131
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,400
I will fight against your country
that is oppressing us now!

132
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,902
Adelina, enough.

133
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,197
Adelina, enough.

134
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,909
I can't bear to hear such things from you.

135
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,917
Adelina.

136
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,338
I won't stop.

137
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,133
I will find Eduardo.

138
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,887
I will do everything to find him,

139
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,806
because I don't want you to do that.

140
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,897
Adelina.

141
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,403
Adelina, I don't want you to leave.

142
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,666
I don't want to lose you, Adelina.

143
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,003
And I don't want us…

144
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,965
to become enemies.

145
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,003
I'm scared.

146
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,684
I'm here for you.

147
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,259
He's hot.

148
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,470
I think he has a fever.

149
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,314
We need water.

150
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,983
Do you have any water?

151
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,612
We need to wipe him down
to bring down his temperature.

152
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,575
Where are we supposed to get water?

153
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,870
We're not even given food or drinks here.

154
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:58,999
What?

155
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,877
No water? No food?

156
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,215
No wonder you're all pale and skinny here.

157
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,886
I will ask the soldiers for water.

158
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,099
No one will give you anything here
even if you shout.

159
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,561
They will kill us by torture,

160
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,857
hunger, and thirst.

161
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,172
Then, join us.

162
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,635
Friends, let's escape.

163
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,638
But how are we going to do that?

164
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,601
The walls are made of thick adobe bricks.

165
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,980
There are no windows here.

166
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,358
And there's only one exit.

167
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,236
Hey, Kimura!

168
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,906
The Kempeitai are always on guard too.

169
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,617
Someone tried to escape once…

170
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,163
-Vicente!
-Shoot him!

171
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,798
Hey, you! Die!

172
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,136
He only ended up dead.

173
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,475
Now tell me, sir.

174
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,520
How can we escape from here?

175
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,399
I don't know yet.

176
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,700
All I know is that

177
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:02,414
we can't just accept our situation here.

178
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,458
And we must not lose hope.

179
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,631
Because to lose hope
is to lose life itself.

180
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,425
Let's find a way.

181
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,427
Yes, let's find a way.

182
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,598
There might be secret passageways
that we don't know of,

183
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,102
or maybe we can dig a hole in the wall.

184
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm telling you,

185
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,483
no one can escape from this place.

186
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,361
The Japanese wouldn't put us here

187
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,031
if they knew there was
a way for us to escape.

188
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,621
In that case,

189
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,168
we'll have to go with my second plan.

190
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,003
What second plan?

191
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,340
We'll fight our way out.

192
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,602
Have you gone crazy?

193
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,647
What chance do we have against them?

194
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,483
They have guns, we don't.

195
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,735
There are many of us.

196
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,656
We can beat them if we come together.

197
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,873
Those of you who have been here long,
what have you observed from the Japanese?

198
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,002
How many of them come in here
and when do they come in?

199
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,674
Usually, two soldiers come every morning

200
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,426
to check if…

201
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,344
If what?

202
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:44,183
…if a prisoner has died
so they can get rid of the body,

203
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,396
or take one prisoner to torture.

204
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,776
I told you, we cannot escape.

205
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,120
So what do you want?

206
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,416
Just let the Japanese continue abusing us?

207
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,130
For them to crush
our dignity and identity?

208
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,344
Are we just going to wait for death?
Is that what you want?

209
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,602
For those who want to join me,

210
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,646
get ready.

211
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
This is what we'll do.

212
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,076
Listen up.

213
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,461
We will wait for the Kempeitai
to come in here.

214
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,678
Come with us!

215
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,681
Me?

216
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,848
Don't! Please, no!

217
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:11,979
Before they can even take
one of us to torture,

218
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:16,191
we will silently disarm the soldiers.

219
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,070
Once we have taken them down

220
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,198
and taken their weapons,

221
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,286
that is our chance to fight and escape.

222
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,792
We won't fire any weapon or make any sound

223
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,796
so we won't be
swarmed by Japanese soldiers.

224
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,340
Once we have done that,

225
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,720
just wait for my signal
so we can all come out.

226
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,038
That's what I thought of.

227
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,584
I think this is the only way
for us to escape.

228
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:24,051
That's easier said than done.

229
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,930
The road is far from here.

230
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,978
And the Kempeitai are all over
the inside and outside this place.

231
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,233
How can we escape
without being seen by the Japanese?

232
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,486
Pablo is right.

233
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,862
If we get caught,

234
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,782
I'm sure they will kill us all.

235
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:56,917
But how will we know
if we don't try, right?

236
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,505
Do you have a better escape plan for us?

237
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,302
What if we succeed?

238
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,889
I know it's going to be dangerous,

239
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,518
but that's the only way I can think of.

240
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,730
To use force.

241
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,234
Even if I know some of you are against it.

242
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:28,198
I want to see
my beloved sister and my fiancée.

243
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,452
I know they are very worried
about me right now.

244
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:39,501
And I know that all of you
want to see your loved ones too.

245
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,346
If we stay here,

246
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,392
we're exhausting what life we have left.

247
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,228
If we do nothing,

248
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:05,277
it's akin to accepting
that we will never be free

249
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,863
and that we will never be

250
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,827
with our loved ones again.

251
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
Are we just going to allow ourselves

252
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:28,675
to die here without putting up a fight?

253
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,724
Or are we going to fight bravely
for our freedom?

254
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,125
Eduardo was arrested by
the Japanese, Tasyo too.

255
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,085
And we don't know where they are.

256
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,880
I already went to our colonel
to look for Eduardo.

257
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,090
COMING UP

258
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,717
No need, Mr. Tanaka.

259
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,510
It's good that Eduardo was arrested.

260
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,013
Is that what you want for Eduardo, Mama?

261
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,016
You'll let that happen
to your fellow countryman?

262
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,809
If we don't escape now,

263
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,647
we will only give
the Japanese time to prepare.

264
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,773
We have come this far.

265
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,483
There's no turning back.

266
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,860
I know how strong your faith can be.

267
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,863
Why don't you use
what the Lord has given you?

268
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,031
Prayer.

269
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,032
Tasyo! Let's go!

270
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,500
