1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,837
I never wanted this
to happen to my sister.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,005
I tried to save her, but…

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,758
I don't need to hear
any explanation from you.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,679
That won't bring back my only child.

5
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,015
What you went through was terrifying.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,725
Didn't they touch you?

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,643
No.

8
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,562
Keep your guard up, Teresita.

9
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,023
What they did to us,
they will do the same to you.

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,818
I've been wondering why
Teresita was abducted.

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,570
That's enough!

12
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,780
I don't like

13
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,744
Hiroshi Tanaka's tone
and actions towards me.

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,871
Take him away from Manila.

15
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,998
Assign him to a different city.

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,001
Didn't I place my letters in my pocket?

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,210
Now they're gone.

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,796
Adelina and Eduardo still see each other.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,716
Why is he suddenly asking
for Hiroshi to be transferred?

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,426
Tell me the truth.

21
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,637
Where's Teresita Borromeo?

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,890
Who is your master?

23
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,351
He's a very brutal man
and the mastermind behind all of this.

24
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,188
Who is he? What's his name?

25
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,066
Don't worry. You'll meet him soon.

26
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,067
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,440
Yuta!

28
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,117
I will still fight for Teresita.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,577
I'll do anything in my power
to protect her,

30
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,957
but not in a way that harms her father.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,459
She is that important to me.

32
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,129
Thank heavens you're here.

33
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,509
How did you find me?

34
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,720
Did Adelina or Papa tell you?

35
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,391
Did she come to you and ask for help?

36
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,894
What matters is you're here.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,357
Are you going to save me
and take me away from this place?

38
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,241
Yuta?

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,329
The Japanese soldiers
are raping the women here.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,791
I met Miss Dolores.

41
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,168
She's like the head housekeeper here.

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,506
She said they won't touch me,
but I don't believe her.

43
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,467
She's right.

44
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,224
The soldiers won't touch you.

45
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,311
How can you be so sure?

46
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,980
Do you know her master?

47
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,149
Who is he?

48
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,026
Was he the one who had me abducted?

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,823
God Almighty.

50
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,079
You're her master?

51
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,459
You…

52
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,755
You had me abducted?

53
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,512
Remember my instructions.

54
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,723
-Am I clear?
-Yes, Leader!

55
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,392
Don't act recklessly.

56
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,979
Someone's coming!

57
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,358
Wait! I'm not an enemy!

58
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,236
Please don't shoot!

59
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,451
You're members of the Ganap Party
or Sakdalistas, right?

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,623
I serve under Colonel Yuta!

61
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,168
He sent me to deliver this letter
to your leader!

62
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,380
Lower your weapons!

63
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,511
What's the message?

64
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,641
He's requesting your help

65
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,894
in locating the Filipino rebels.

66
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,835
What's wrong with you?

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,088
I want to go home.

68
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,507
I'm terrified.

69
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,803
I don't want to die or…

70
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,014
take someone's life.

71
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,229
If you go back home,

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,649
the soldiers will arrest you again.

73
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,281
You can't leave our group anymore.

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,871
Mario, calm down and listen to me.

75
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,082
You're no longer a child.

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,503
You need to grow up,

77
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,382
stay strong, and be brave.

78
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,472
Don't you want to live a long life?

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,059
I do.

80
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,686
I know.

81
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,939
And what are you going to do

82
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,068
once we're finally free?

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,281
I want to be a baseball player.

84
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,119
I want to be as good as Joe DiMaggio.

85
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,372
He's my idol too.

86
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,459
You like baseball too?

87
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,420
All Filipinos do.

88
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,423
Don't worry.

89
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,970
Once we're free from the Japanese,
we'll play a good game of baseball.

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,848
Let's see if you can beat me.

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,565
Stay strong, boy.

92
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,195
We can't cry now.

93
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:52,203
We need to survive
and stay alive for your parents,

94
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,622
for my girlfriend and sister,

95
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,334
and for our countrymen,

96
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,921
so we can freely play baseball again.

97
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,633
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Eduardo.

98
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,861
How dare you!

99
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,615
I was minding my own business,
but what did you do?

100
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,288
You had me abducted
and brought me to this hell!

101
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,707
That's enough.

102
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,375
Why are you doing this to me?

103
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,921
Don't you get it, Teresita?

104
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,219
This is the only way I know

105
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,973
that will make you mine.

106
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,270
We already talked about this.

107
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,567
You politely accepted my rejection.

108
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,572
I thought you understood
that I don't love you!

109
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,910
I still can't understand

110
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,747
why you can't love me.

111
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,752
You know very well
I'm the only man you deserve.

112
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,796
What makes you say that, Yuta?

113
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,677
How can you say that
after what you did to me?

114
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,891
What are you going to do?

115
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,773
Are you going to rape me
like what your men do to the women here?

116
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,275
Let's talk tomorrow.

117
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,070
Get some rest.

118
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,948
Yuta.

119
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,366
Yuta!

120
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,079
Yuta!

121
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,289
Yuta, wait!

122
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,751
Yuta, open the door!

123
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,379
Get me out of here! Yuta!

124
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,967
Open the door!

125
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,053
My family is waiting for me! Yuta!

126
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,573
Yuta, open the door! Yuta!

127
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,158
Francisco.

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,539
Have you reported Adelina?

129
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,002
Yes, I spoke directly with Colonel Yuta.

130
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,878
Good.

131
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,883
Let's just hope he can immediately
get rid of that woman,

132
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,220
so all the bad luck
in my family disappears too.

133
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,518
Here's the money
for your child's medicine.

134
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,064
Thank you very much, Francisco.

135
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,334
Colonel.

136
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,922
Please treat Teresita well.

137
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,718
Keep a close watch on her,

138
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,390
and make sure that no soldier
can get close to her.

139
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,146
I see that the woman's special to you.

140
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,159
Let's make one thing clear, Dolores.

141
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,956
Yes, I allowed you to stay here.

142
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,963
But that doesn't give you a right
to interfere with my life.

143
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,549
My apologies, Colonel.

144
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,468
My apologies.

145
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,569
Marcel?

146
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,327
Didn't I say I'm going to
need more time to think?

147
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,497
That's not why we're here.

148
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,376
A little boy visited our theater.

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,337
He has an important message for you.

150
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
Who is this boy?

151
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,716
This is Juan.

152
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,010
She's the one you're looking for.

153
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:06,392
Are you Miss Adelina?
Are you Mr. Eduardo's sister?

154
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,980
Yes, I am.

155
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,607
How do you know my brother?

156
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,778
-What do you need?
-He has letters for you.

157
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,036
Here.

158
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,183
Papa!

159
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,769
Lito!

160
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,787
Jose…

161
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,164
Jose.

162
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,010
Sir, we need to bury our comrades.

163
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,224
Look for anything we can use to dig.

164
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,558
Quickly!

165
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,771
Sir Jorge.

166
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,067
This is dangerous. We need to leave now.

167
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,402
The Japanese might come back.

168
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,073
They wouldn't think we'd be back.

169
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,871
They would think
we fled and hid like cowards.

170
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,756
How can you be sure, Eduardo?

171
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,343
We're not leaving.

172
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,513
Let's just wait for my fa…

173
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,518
for Major Campbell and Juan.

174
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,357
They left us here.
I'm sure they will look for us.

175
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,067
Eduardo is right.

176
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,238
But keep your eyes and senses sharp.

177
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,202
If they're not here by nightfall,

178
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,122
we'll leave.

179
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,720
Thank you very much, Juan.

180
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,222
Where's my brother?

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,769
I'm sorry, miss. I can't tell you.

182
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,064
But I need to talk to him, Juan.

183
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,151
He needs to know
what happened to Teresita.

184
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,154
So please, tell me where he is.

185
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,405
I need to talk to him.

186
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,423
Miss, I need to go.

187
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,884
No. No.

188
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,971
Tell me where my brother is first.

189
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,316
Don't be afraid of him.

190
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,527
He's a friend of ours.

191
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,529
He won't harm us.

192
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,574
He's Japanese.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,285
His people killed my parents.

194
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,090
Juan, listen to me.

195
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,177
Not all Japanese are bad.

196
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:17,810
Hiroshi is kind,
and he's definitely not a murderer.

197
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,647
So please.

198
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,108
Just tell me where my brother is.

199
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,276
Hiroshi and I need to talk to him.

200
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,128
Who goes there?

201
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,965
Why are you blocking the door?

202
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,059
I'm just making sure, Miss Dolores.

203
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,854
I thought you already
talked with the colonel.

204
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,024
What more assurance do you need?

205
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,861
Why aren't you dressed yet?

206
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,071
What for?

207
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,450
I'm locked up, anyway.

208
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,537
Even caged dogs are bathed.

209
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,582
Come with me. It's time for a bath.

210
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,835
I don't want to! I won't bathe.

211
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,796
And I won't get dressed.

212
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,593
It's better I appear dirty
to those soldiers.

213
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,220
Teresita.

214
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,349
They won't care if you're dirty or smelly.

215
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,644
They'll rape you if they want to.

216
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,065
Just follow his orders,

217
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,109
or I'll be the one to blame.

218
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,489
Come on.

219
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,295
Do I need to call the soldiers
to drag you out of this room?

220
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,438
Come on.

221
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
Come on!

222
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,376
Hi, my name is Hiroshi.

223
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,889
If you bring him along,
I won't tell you anything.

224
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,061
You're a stubborn boy.

225
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,857
In that case, it'll just be me.

226
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,526
I'll bring Marcel along.

227
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
Did you bring your car?

228
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:17,906
I did.

229
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,828
I'll be glad to accompany you
if it's okay with the boy.

230
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,623
What do you think? Are you good with that?

231
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,543
If it's just Marcel and me,

232
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
can you take us to see my brother?

233
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,012
Please. It's really important.

234
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,014
That's fine with me.

235
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,975
But don't follow us, okay?

236
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,769
Hey.

237
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,942
Don't you think

238
00:19:54,818 --> 00:20:00,199
you'll be safer from Japanese soldiers
with me around?

239
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,542
Just stay here.

240
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,796
Marcel and I will handle this.

241
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,977
He won't be coming along.

242
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,854
It's just us three.

243
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,522
Let's go?

244
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,255
Teresita, sit down over there.

245
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,590
Go on.

246
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,730
Are you Teresita?

247
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,024
The one I spoke with last night?

248
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,820
Are you Manuela?

249
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,243
What are you waiting for?

250
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,953
Eat!

251
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,416
Today's menu is special.

252
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,337
Pork adobo for those ravaged by pigs.

253
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,161
Good morning!

254
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,665
What brings you here?

255
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
Let me ask you again.

256
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,466
What do you want from us?

257
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,898
Hiroshi.

258
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,902
-We need to talk.
-Captain.

259
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,159
-We work at the theater, sir.
-The two of us.

260
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,747
What do you want to talk about, Captain?

261
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,625
Why don't we talk inside?

262
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,461
This is important.

263
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,798
Yes, sir.

264
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,971
Adelina, you may take your leave.

265
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,892
Please bring that poor boy

266
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,355
to the nuns at the convent.

267
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,197
Sure.

268
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,491
Poor child.

269
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,577
He's a beggar and an orphan.

270
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,916
Let's go.
The sooner we take him there, the better.

271
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,252
If you'll excuse us.

272
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,796
Marcel.

273
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,817
The Colonel has taken a liking to you.
He'll likely listen to you.

274
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,735
Teresita, can you help us?

275
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,155
Our colonel is a terrible man.

276
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,781
Father, I no longer respect him.

277
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,742
He's nothing but a monster in our army!

278
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,161
Where have you been all night?

279
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,288
No, don't spank me!

280
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,123
I brought your sister with me!

281
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,709
Is that how little you think of women?

282
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,586
We're not trophies or medals

283
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,589
you can brandish on displays
or play dress-up with!

284
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,967
Your dignity is not
the only thing I can take.

285
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,469
I can take your life too.

286
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,054
COMING UP

287
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,936
