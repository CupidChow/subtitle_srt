1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,837
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to our meeting place.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,296
You're alive.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,257
That's all that matters to me, Eduardo.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,970
I don't believe that Eduardo Dela Cruz's
sister doesn't know where he is!

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,014
You're stupid to believe them!

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,224
But the Kempeitai
have already gone to their house.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,770
I will find out the truth myself.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,355
Damn it!

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,191
You will fight the Japanese?

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,401
That's what I want to do.

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,486
To fight the new invaders of our country.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,947
I'm doing this for you.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,326
So that our country
can finally have peace.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,912
He must not know
we met with Eduardo today.

15
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,875
He's not just an ordinary soldier.
He's cunning and ruthless.

16
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,835
Especially to his enemies.

17
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:47,464
PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,800
Weren't you in the ROTC?

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,801
Where are they now?

20
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,636
Last I heard they were in Rizal.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,098
-That's where they're hiding, sir.
-Then that's where we'll go.

22
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,017
Where have you been?

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,310
We were on a stroll.

24
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:05,148
You went on a stroll?
Or did you meet up with Eduardo Dela Cruz?

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,610
That man can never go near them again.

26
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,362
No matter what, Colonel.

27
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,492
If we're done here,
we would like to rest now.

28
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
You're free to leave, miss.

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,087
I promise that I will do everything

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,299
to return home alive
for the two women I love.

31
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
I know you're watching me in heaven, Mom.

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,852
Please look after me, okay?

33
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,525
Just like you would every day
of every single year.

34
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,322
Please keep me safe from harm,

35
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,996
so I can fulfill my promise
to Adelina and Teresita.

36
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,331
And…

37
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,377
may the freedom and light we yearn for

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,965
may not be as distant as the stars.

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,721
We'll take our leave.

40
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:04,350
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. and Mrs. Borromeo.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,025
Allow me to see you out, Colonel.

42
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,340
Thank you, Colonel.

43
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,185
-Right, Mr. Tanaka?
-Yes, Colonel.

44
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,531
Please don't get the wrong idea, Colonel.

45
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,535
Teresita is just like any Filipina maiden.

46
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,497
She's very reserved around men.

47
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:14,837
But you're staying
at her former fiancé's home.

48
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,215
Mr. Tanaka's son.

49
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,305
Their wedding never pushed through.

50
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,015
It was a mutual decision,

51
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,227
but they've remained good friends.

52
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,023
Didn't I tell you not to go out at night?

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,653
We talked about this many times,

54
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,780
but you never listen.

55
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm sorry, Dad.

56
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,285
Tell your sister to eat dinner.

57
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,412
You can rest after.

58
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,957
Hiroshi, get some rest too.

59
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,423
From what I know

60
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,634
and from what she told me,

61
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,097
Miss Teresita is in love
with somebody else.

62
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,853
And I believe that man is Dela Cruz.

63
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,232
No. I will never allow that, Colonel.

64
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,651
As a mother,

65
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,531
I want my daughter to marry a foreigner.

66
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,992
Just like you, Colonel.

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:30,288
Someone who's respected,
honorable, and brave.

68
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,959
Not someone like Eduardo Dela Cruz.

69
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,175
I got so nervous.

70
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,012
For a moment, I thought we were doomed.

71
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,311
Thank you for helping us, Hiroshi.

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,231
Even before your colonel.

73
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,026
For as long as I am able,

74
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,656
I'll always defend you, Adelina.

75
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,461
I have to go to my sister.

76
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,258
Thanks again.

77
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,728
She seems to be a good mother

78
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,940
and a good woman.

79
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,694
She can be a good ally.

80
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,279
Yes, she will.

81
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,699
She's been an ally for some time now.

82
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,843
I hope the next time I visit,

83
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,470
you'll welcome me again
in your humble home.

84
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,473
I hope your daughter does too.

85
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,227
You have my word.

86
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,854
Thank you very much.

87
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,351
Teresita.

88
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,522
Weren't you comforted
by what Hiroshi said earlier?

89
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,320
He helped us not worry
about Eduardo's situation.

90
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,824
He promised he would protect us
no matter what.

91
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,083
But there's still the colonel.

92
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,974
"You went on a stroll?

93
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,020
Or did you meet up
with Eduardo Dela Cruz?"

94
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,236
I hope we never see Colonel Yuta again.

95
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,655
His presence alone irritates me.

96
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,283
And I'm getting sick
just by talking to him.

97
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
Especially after what Eduardo told us.

98
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,999
It's clear we can't trust the colonel.

99
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,881
Colonel, if I may ask,

100
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,095
do you really believe
Teresita Borromeo is not involved

101
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,888
in Eduardo's disappearance?

102
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:27,733
You know very well I'm not a fool
to believe their lies.

103
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,446
In that case,

104
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,325
what should we do to capture the fugitive?

105
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,580
Don't worry about them.

106
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,209
I will take care of Teresita

107
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,920
and Eduardo's sister.

108
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,889
I'll take care of Adelina Dela Cruz.

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,989
You're in favor of the colonel
should he decide to pursue our daughter?

110
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,325
We don't even know the man.

111
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,207
Julio, there's still time
to get to know him.

112
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,794
And besides, what's so bad about it?

113
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
He's a high-ranking official.

114
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,386
They're the next rulers in this country.

115
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,641
We'll have a better life

116
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,935
if they end up together.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,440
Carmela, don't use Teresita.

118
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,445
She is not a vaudeville ticket
you can just give away

119
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,406
in exchange for a good show
or a comfortable life.

120
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,243
Besides, our daughter
has feelings of her own.

121
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,289
Let her find someone she loves.

122
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,544
Following the heart
is not always the answer,

123
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,880
especially in times like these!

124
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,841
Julio, look at where we are now.

125
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,264
We're living on their kindness
because we lost our home.

126
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,392
And what's waiting for us outside?

127
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,895
Japanese soldiers are everywhere.

128
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,898
They're ready to imprison or kill us

129
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,360
if we don't follow their orders.

130
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,322
Julio, this is the Philippines now.

131
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,451
Our country is under their power.

132
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,541
If you don't forget about your pride…

133
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,878
Do you want us to end up like the poor

134
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,465
who only eat sweet potatoes
and bamboo shoots?

135
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,220
Do you hear yourself?

136
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,639
Aren't you ashamed?

137
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,812
You're willing to trade your own child
for such little luxury.

138
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,526
I saw Señora Carmela
escorting Colonel Yuta outside.

139
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,405
I have a feeling
she likes the colonel for you.

140
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,577
But I don't trust that man.

141
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,412
Let her be, Adelina.

142
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,206
I don't like the colonel either.

143
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,002
I don't even think about him.

144
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,259
Eduardo is the only man I care about.

145
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:51,437
It's heartwarming to see and feel
how much you two love each other.

146
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,650
I hope…

147
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,113
once this war ends,

148
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,744
you'll finally marry my brother.

149
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,704
Let's pray for his safety, Adelina.

150
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,665
I'm still against his decision.

151
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,504
I'm sad he'll be away from us.

152
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,048
I understand, Teresita.

153
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,386
I'm worried about my brother too.

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,975
But we can't let sadness
and fear take over our lives.

155
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,063
We need to stay strong,
now more than ever.

156
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,441
We must keep on fighting.

157
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,656
The four of us made a promise, right?

158
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,328
That we would live
for the sake of one another.

159
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,000
I may be cruel and selfish

160
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,170
for not prioritizing
our daughter's feelings,

161
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:03,050
but what's wrong with thinking
and planning for ourselves?

162
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,888
Is it wrong if I'm doing this
for the sake of our family?

163
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,813
Julio, pride won't feed us.

164
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,110
Whether we admit it or not,

165
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,114
our wealth is meaningless now

166
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,952
because we've fallen
into the hands of the Japanese.

167
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,124
And I will not allow us
to stay at the bottom.

168
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,334
Lord.

169
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,049
Thank you so much
for the opportunity You've given us.

170
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,645
We got to see Eduardo because of You.

171
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:47,529
We pray that You'll watch over him
and take care of him for us.

172
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,954
Please keep him safe

173
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,832
wherever he may be.

174
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:15,557
Sir, can we make a fire
to drive the mosquitoes away?

175
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,188
We can't do that, Mario.

176
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,859
We'll make it easier
for the Japanese soldiers to find us.

177
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,030
Just endure a little longer.
Go back to sleep.

178
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,626
My apologies, Adelina.

179
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,798
Are you having trouble sleeping?

180
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,642
How could I sleep?

181
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,190
I may have a soft bed and pillow…

182
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,956
but my brother Eduardo…

183
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,602
Mario.

184
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,980
We're not safe here.

185
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,857
Come on, let's go.

186
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,576
Where could he be right now?

187
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,830
Where is he sleeping?

188
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,253
I'm sure he doesn't have a soft bed.

189
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,383
He doesn't have a soft pillow.

190
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,680
He's probably surrounded by mosquitoes.

191
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,854
Maybe he can't sleep either

192
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,023
since Japanese soldiers
are looking for them.

193
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,034
I apologize, Adelina.

194
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,704
On behalf of my people.

195
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,040
Is that all you can do, Hiroshi?

196
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,045
Are you just going to
keep asking for forgiveness?

197
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,966
What do you want me to do, Adelina?

198
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,017
You can talk to Colonel Saitoh.

199
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,227
And then what?

200
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,814
What do you want me to say to him?

201
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,942
To stop looking for Eduardo?

202
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,322
So he would suspect
my loyalty towards him?

203
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,491
Adelina.

204
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:07,289
Are you asking me
to go against our colonel?

205
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,047
Never mind.

206
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,091
How could you do that, anyway?

207
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,722
They are your people, after all.

208
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:32,105
That's why you and your family
will remain safe

209
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,236
because I'm sure
the Kempeitai won't harm you.

210
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,155
Right?

211
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,242
But us Filipinos…

212
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,081
Our lives are always in danger.

213
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,543
Don't jump to conclusions, Adelina.

214
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,675
The lives of the Filipinos
won't be jeopardized for no reason.

215
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,427
It just so happened that…

216
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,933
that Eduardo's father
is an American soldier.

217
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,020
That's why our colonel is
investigating him.

218
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
But you know very well

219
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,567
they haven't seen each other
in a long time,

220
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:22,364
and you also know he never
treated my brother like a son.

221
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,699
Right?

222
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:31,707
Hiroshi, didn't you see
how my brother looked?

223
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,088
Didn't you see the wounds and bruises
on his face and body?

224
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,965
Didn't you?

225
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:48,098
Was his torture part of the investigation?

226
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,477
He didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,190
He didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,738
But why do your people
treat him like a criminal?

229
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,450
Tell me, Adelina.

230
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,413
What do you want me to do?

231
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,125
Do you want me to rebel
against the colonel?

232
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,338
And encourage my people to do the same?

233
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,174
Is that what you want, Adelina?

234
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,434
I hope…

235
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,690
you see what your people are doing to us.

236
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,906
Don't just let them oppress us

237
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,575
as if your heart has turned into stone.

238
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,163
Because if you do,

239
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,669
you'll lose every bit of love
and sympathy in your heart.

240
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,550
And you'll be turning your back
on our friendship,

241
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,556
with Teresita and my brother Eduardo too.

242
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,413
Sir?

243
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,665
Sir?

244
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,503
I was able to get some mangoes
from the forest.

245
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,089
We have something to eat now.

246
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,800
These will keep us full.

247
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,844
Here, take some.

248
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,263
Mario, why didn't you wake me up sooner?

249
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,182
We shouldn't stay out here this long.

250
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,313
I know you needed to rest, sir.

251
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,235
The truth is, even if we got some sleep…

252
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,363
my body still hurts.

253
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm sure you feel the same, sir.

254
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,460
Enough rest or not, we still need to move.

255
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,383
And we need to be more careful
now that the sun is out.

256
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:32,220
We'll be caught by the soldiers
if we act hastily.

257
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,308
Finish eating so we can go.

258
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,398
Do you want some more, sir?

259
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,610
That's one more thing, Mario.

260
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,696
We shouldn't eat everything

261
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,700
because we don't know
when our next meal will be.

262
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,126
Group the pairs together.

263
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,257
Mama!

264
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,011
That's a lot of canned goods and rice!

265
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,057
Does this mean we can buy
groceries in bulk again?

266
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,393
Teresita, these are gifts
from Colonel Yuta.

267
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,854
He sent these to us.

268
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,276
And by the way, he told us
he'll join us for lunch.

269
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,489
Teresita, I want you to freshen up
before he arrives.

270
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,326
I want you to look nice
and presentable for Colonel Yuta.

271
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,828
It's just a small thing, dearest.

272
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,664
Please.

273
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,458
Be nice to him.

274
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,963
But I don't want to, Mama.
I don't even want to see him!

275
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,799
Why is he coming over?

276
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,051
She's right.

277
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,764
Does he still think we know
about Eduardo's disappearance?

278
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,641
Is that why he's bribing us?

279
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,436
No, Adelina.

280
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,689
My dear.

281
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,318
It's no secret
that Colonel Yuta likes you.

282
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:16,866
He wants to formally court you,
that's why he sent over some gifts.

283
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,432
Someone's coming.

284
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,942
Wait!

285
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,528
Wait!

286
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,950
What do you want, gentlemen?

287
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,203
Please, we are not bad people.

288
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,461
We just want to know where you're headed.

289
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,631
We're going to Rizal.

290
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:19,012
And if it's no trouble,
we would like you to take us there.

291
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:23,808
What happened to you?
Why do you look like that?

292
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,356
The truth is…

293
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,611
the Japanese did this to us.

294
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,279
We barely managed to escape.

295
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,908
Praise be the Mighty Allah.

296
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,161
Hop in, we'll take you there.

297
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,789
Really? Thank you very much.

298
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
Thank you.

299
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,709
My husband, this is wrong.

300
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,255
The foreigners might punish us for this.

301
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,924
Apologies, gentlemen.

302
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,842
We don't want to get involved.

303
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,602
We understand. Apologies, madam.

304
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,608
Forgive us, Allah.
We can't just leave those men here.

305
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,529
We can't just turn our backs
on those in need.

306
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:21,199
We'll disappoint Allah if we do!

307
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,787
One moment, gentlemen!

308
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,336
Hop on.

309
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,005
Thank you very much.

310
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,425
What made you change your mind?

311
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,304
If we abandon you here
and something bad happens to you,

312
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,391
Allah will hold us accountable
all our lives.

313
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,394
Thank you very much for your kindness.

314
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,355
But you need to help and protect us too.

315
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:57,485
I know a way
that will spare us from the Japanese.

316
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,280
-What is it?
-How, madam?

317
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,409
But, Papa…

318
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,662
I don't want Yuta to court me.

319
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:15,128
Papa, can we just tell the colonel
to leave Teresita alone?

320
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,756
No one asked for a suggestion, Adelina.

321
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,050
-Carmela, please.
-What do you know?

322
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,052
You're both still young.

323
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,306
All you think about
is your happiness and freedom.

324
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,475
-That's not true, Mama!
-Really?

325
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,021
Why can't you understand
that our world is changing?

326
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,275
We need to do everything
for us to survive.

327
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:42,906
I'm pretty sure you both know
what the Japanese are capable of.

328
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,745
Now, I want you both to think.

329
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,955
Who will you side with?

330
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,957
The enemies

331
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,668
or the allies of the Japanese soldiers?

332
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,715
Dearest.

333
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,678
I won't force you to like the colonel.

334
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,138
Julio!

335
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,270
But your mother is right.

336
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,360
We need to get along with Colonel Yuta.

337
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,282
As long as our country is at war,

338
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,913
we wouldn't want them
to think of us as their enemies.

339
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,846
I think I would be cheating on Eduardo
if I let Yuta court me.

340
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,057
Teresita, Eduardo will understand
your situation right now.

341
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,060
And it's not cheating
if you don't fall for the colonel.

342
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,353
Here's some friendly advice.

343
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,982
Don't mind whatever's happening
to the two ladies in your home,

344
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,360
and don't you dare attempt
to save Eduardo Dela Cruz.

345
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,988
Our colonel is a dangerous enemy.

346
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,114
Excuse me.

347
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,616
Do you know where the guerrillas are?

348
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,453
COMING UP

349
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,713
