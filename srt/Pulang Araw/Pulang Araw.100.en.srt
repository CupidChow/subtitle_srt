1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>He's already figured us out.</i>

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,338
Keep looking! They haven't gotten far!

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>Find them!</i>

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>- Akio, it's no use.
- Unless I show myself.</i>

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>You must go without me, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>Were you looking for me?</i>

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,431
I received a report

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,184
that you helped Hiroshi
and Adelina escape just now.

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:23,148
<i>You’re the one whole killed Colonel Arata.
Which makes you a traitor</i>

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,861
<i>I will die with honor.</i>

11
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>I can’t leave Adelina and Teresita behind.</i>

12
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,781
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,035
<i>Where's Hiroshi Tanaka?
Have you found him?</i>

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,203
<i>Did he escape the camp?</i>

15
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>What about Adelina Dela Cruz?
Is she gone too?</i>

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>- You're all useless!
- I'll surrender.</i>

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>Not just to free my sister.</i>

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>But to secure Yuta's demise.</i>

19
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,924
<i>That's a powerful poison for rats.</i>

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,011
<i>It can also kill humans and other animals.</i>

21
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>That can kill you through your nose,
eyes, and body.</i>

22
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,733
PREVIOUSLY

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,235
- Teresita?
- Thank heavens.

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,363
You there! Good job capturing Mrs. Saitoh!

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,119
You scoundrel!

26
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>My name is Eduardo Dela Cruz.
A true Filipino.</i>

27
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,003
Let go of him right now!

28
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,882
Don't shoot or I'll kill your officer!

29
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,443
Run, Teresita. Get yourself out of here!

30
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,195
But what about you, Eduardo?

31
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,738
I can take care of myself.

32
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,198
I can't leave you here!

33
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,576
They'll both catch us if you don't go now!

34
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,786
Go!

35
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,043
If anyone goes after her,
I'll blow his head off!

36
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,796
Move away!

37
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,069
Don't be afraid.

38
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,030
It's just me.

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,491
Please help yourselves.

40
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,919
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,757
Thank you.

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,052
Not only for the food.

43
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,430
But also for helping us escape.

44
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,015
Thank you.

45
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,977
Hide here as long as you want.

46
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,605
No one will suspect you're here.

47
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,571
Why did you help us escape?

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,949
What do you want from us?

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,453
I know Luis and Marcel.

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,873
They're your friends, aren't they?

51
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,088
Even though he's imprisoned,
Mr. Julio is still alive.

52
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,257
How did you know?

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,717
We have someone on the inside.

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,594
He confirmed it.

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,433
Yes, Luis and Marcel are our friends.

56
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,488
Are you the spy
they've been talking about?

57
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,408
The one secretly helping us?

58
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,434
Seize him!

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,187
Don't be afraid! Take him down!

60
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,773
If we shoot, we might hit the Lieutenant!

61
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,275
Follow my order!

62
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,610
Just shoot! Take him down!

63
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,989
Hey! You hit the Lieutenant!

64
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,449
You cowards!

65
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,326
Shoot him!

66
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,703
Don't worry about me!

67
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,872
Just take Eduardo and kill him!

68
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,878
Sir!

69
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:52,769
Don't let the Colonel find you again.
I won't be there to save you.

70
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,896
Do you understand?

71
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,234
You're on your own now.

72
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,905
I shall bid you goodbye.

73
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,759
The Lord has not abandoned us.

74
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,518
But I still can't be happy, Sister.

75
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,107
Not until I find out what happened
to Hiroshi and my siblings.

76
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,131
I found our second lieutenant, sir.

77
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,139
Eduardo Dela Cruz killed him.

78
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,849
Yamamoto.

79
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,685
Who is this Eduardo Dela Cruz?

80
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,022
He's a guerilla, sir.
We've been hunting him down.

81
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,402
Our Colonel will be disappointed
once he finds out about this.

82
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,156
That is, if he survives this time.

83
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,366
I believe the Colonel will live.

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,618
I have faith. He'll recover.

85
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,288
Soldiers,

86
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,125
While the Colonel is still recovering,
we'll keep searching for Eduardo Dela Cruz

87
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,878
and the other guerilla groups!

88
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,337
- Yes, Lieutenant!
- Yes, Lieutenant!

89
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
We'll do it for the Colonel!

90
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,322
Where is it?

91
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,455
- Teresita?
- Eduardo.

92
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,332
Thank heavens.

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,348
Run, Teresita. Get yourself out of here!

94
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,641
But what about you, Eduardo?

95
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,643
I can take care of myself.

96
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,103
I can't leave you here!

97
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,480
They'll both catch us if you don't go now!

98
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,691
Go!

99
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,030
My Lord.

100
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,500
My reunion with Eduardo was very painful.

101
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,049
Have mercy on me, Lord.

102
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,432
I can't take this anymore.

103
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,397
Have mercy on me, Lord!

104
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,779
Please make this stop, Lord!

105
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:22,079
We've had enough of this punishment.

106
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,248
Please make this stop, Lord!

107
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,615
These are letters from Adelina.

108
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,718
Adelina!

109
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,845
Adelina, someone broke in!

110
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,722
Adelina!

111
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,477
Sister…

112
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,525
Hiroshi?

113
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,528
Hiroshi?

114
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,487
Hiroshi.

115
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,657
I'm sorry for hurting your boyfriend.

116
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
I thought he was…

117
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,040
My God.

118
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,419
Sister, can you help me carry him?

119
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,254
Sure, I'll help.

120
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,430
Adelina, I'd like to apologize again
for hitting Hiroshi.

121
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,850
Don't blame yourself, Sister.

122
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,185
Get some rest.

123
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,415
Hiroshi?

124
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,333
It's me.

125
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,922
Adelina?

126
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,969
Am I dead?

127
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,431
What are you saying?

128
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,648
Adelina.

129
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm so happy to see you again.

130
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,972
Dear, what happened to you?

131
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,266
Why are you crying?

132
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,272
Please help me.

133
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,193
Please help. I got away from the Japanese.

134
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,778
Please don’t send me back to them.

135
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,739
Please, Sister. Don’t send me back!

136
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,743
Hush now, my dear.

137
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,538
Don't worry, we'll help you.

138
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,710
Hush now.

139
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,258
Tell me.

140
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,468
How did you escape?

141
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,096
Does your head still hurt?

142
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,474
Not anymore, my love.

143
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,063
But who was that?

144
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,315
The one who hit me just now?

145
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,654
That was Sister Manuela.

146
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,156
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,450
She didn't recognize you.

148
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,875
Hiroshi…

149
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,100
Where did you get this?

150
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,854
Adelina, I I found that myself.

151
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,188
And it's all thanks to Akio.

152
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,691
Give that back. I want to read it.

153
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,319
No, you can't. This is mine!

154
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,195
Adelina, my name is on it.

155
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,947
Have a look.

156
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,491
You wrote that to me, right?
So give it back.

157
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,785
- Hiroshi, you can't have this.
- But why…

158
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,540
Adelina, why don't you want me to read it?

159
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,920
When will I be able to read this letter?

160
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,546
When…

161
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,798
I'm dead?

162
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,179
Adelina, our time here can be very short.

163
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,224
So let me read it.

164
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,562
I want to know what's truly in your heart.

165
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,266
I brought you some coffee.

166
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,060
To warm your stomach.

167
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,855
Aren't you hungry?

168
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,315
Do you want me to bring you some food?

169
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,279
Are you still thinking about Teresita?

170
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,574
I had her, Tasyo.

171
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,745
She was there with me.

172
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,540
But fate separated us again.

173
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,420
What kind of torment is this?

174
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,339
That's just how it is.

175
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
Don't you remember what Adelina said?

176
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,929
She told Teresita

177
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,558
that no Filipino is safe
as long as the war continues.

178
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,646
Even love won't stand a chance.

179
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,694
Let's just pray that they're safe,

180
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,448
so we can continue fighting.

181
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,326
You're right.

182
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,956
We need to keep fighting
until we win back our freedom.

183
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,461
Listen up!

184
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,051
From now on, we'll split into two groups

185
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,429
so we can take down more enemies.

186
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,266
We're also looking for new members.

187
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,645
You can invite

188
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:31,110
your friends, acquaintances,
relatives, and siblings

189
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,779
to join our resistance.

190
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,868
The more of us here,
the stronger we become.

191
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,497
And the more enemies we can eliminate.

192
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,503
We fight for our people and our nation!

193
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,463
- Long live!
- Long live!

194
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,508
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live! Love live!

195
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,218
- Long live!
- Long live!

196
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,557
Watch out.

197
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,605
Come, hide.

198
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,358
Hide there.

199
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,059
Watch out!
Another platoon just arrived on the right!

200
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,405
Eduardo, this could be the end for us.

201
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,866
They got us surrounded!

202
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,000
Fortunato!

203
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,507
Teresita, dear.

204
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,801
Did you eat something bad?

205
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,972
She ate the same thing earlier as we did.

206
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,474
My Lord.

207
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,684
Teresita.

208
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,812
Could it be that you're pregnant?

209
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,442
No, that's…

210
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,988
That's impossible.

211
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,698
It can't be.

212
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,117
How is it impossible?

213
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,329
Didn't you say you're the wife
of the Colonel?

214
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:34,793
So it's possible that you're pregnant
with his baby, Teresita.

215
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>Forgive us, Sister,
for entering the church like this.</i>

216
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,562
Do you really think you can betray me?

217
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,815
<i>This man is the one
who killed Julio Borromeo!</i>

218
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,861
Where are they? I want to see them.

219
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,070
Teresita!

220
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,699
<i>- What's your purpose, sir?
- We're looking for a guerrilla.</i>

221
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,660
COMING UP

222
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,875
