1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,461
Eduardo was arrested by the Japanese.

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,464
Tasyo too.
And we don't know where they are.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,717
Did you have anything to do with it?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,221
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,350
-My friends, we will escape.
-But how are we going to do that?

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,020
We will wait for the Kempeitai
to come in here.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,899
Before they can even take one of us
for them to torture,

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,111
we will silently disarm these soldiers.

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,490
Once we have taken them down
and taken their weapons,

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,909
that is our chance to fight and escape.

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,121
Stop thinking that something bad
will happen to Eduardo.

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,248
What if Eduardo is in danger right now?

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,461
The Lord will not abandon Eduardo.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,462
Just have faith.

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
We have come this far.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,256
There's no turning back.

17
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,759
We have no choice but to fight.

18
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,387
I've talked to my father
and we're going to help.

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,638
Hiroshi is helping us.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,973
Don't trust him.

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,394
Whatever happens,
he will choose his country over you.

22
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,440
I think they killed our men,
including my friend Tasyo.

23
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,652
We should not waste their efforts
in order to repay them.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,363
Whoever ordered Eduardo's arrest,
he's definitely someone powerful

25
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,908
because they are making it difficult
for us to find him.

26
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,160
There's someone I need to talk to.

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,745
Who?

28
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:23,625
I will make sure that,
once they find Eduardo,

29
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,376
he will already be dead.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,214
Colonel, some prisoners escaped
and caused chaos at Fort Santiago.

31
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,590
You're needed there.

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,635
Idiots!

33
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,470
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

34
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,088
Colonel, according
to the Kempeitai's report,

35
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,884
the prisoners attempted to
seize weapons and escape.

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,513
Some of them didn't succeed.

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,140
Their bodies are over here.

38
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,160
Where's the body…

39
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,622
of Eduardo Dela Cruz?

40
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,709
Why is he not here?

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,670
Where's the corpse of Eduardo Dela Cruz?

42
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,547
Colonel.

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,049
He…

44
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,052
got away.

45
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,775
The Filipino escaped?

46
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,819
Fools!

47
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,614
You're all useless!

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,909
A Filipino got away from us?

49
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,744
You imbeciles!

50
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,163
How could you let them escape?

51
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,083
Our apologies, Colonel.

52
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,961
We have failed you.

53
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,049
Find those fugitives immediately!

54
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,095
-Yes, sir!
-Especially Eduardo Dela Cruz!

55
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,364
You. Come with us.

56
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,282
Yes, sir!

57
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,424
Teresita, you need to eat.

58
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,473
You haven't eaten since last night.

59
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,687
I've lost my appetite.

60
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,195
Teresita, you must try.
Even just a little.

61
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,199
We can't afford to get sick right now.

62
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,703
I'll feed you.

63
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,223
If Eduardo was here,

64
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,350
do you think he would want you
to starve yourself?

65
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,020
But he's not here.

66
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,317
We don't even know
if we'll ever see him again.

67
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,073
Don't say that.

68
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,993
We need to believe that Eduardo is alive.

69
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,164
That's why we need to stay strong.

70
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,666
For his sake.

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,588
So please, eat.

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,220
Don't make me worry about you too.

73
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,018
I know.

74
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,354
If you eat,

75
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,233
I'll ask Francisco to take us to church.

76
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,194
We'll pray for him together.

77
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,095
It's just me, Hiroshi.

78
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,140
Where are you going in a hurry?

79
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,561
Father, let's talk somewhere else.

80
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,812
Follow me.

81
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,484
Father.

82
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,737
My suspicions were right all along.

83
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,409
I found out that the Colonel
was behind Eduardo's arrest.

84
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,452
Hiroshi.

85
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,788
I have something to confess.

86
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,541
I betrayed Eduardo.

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,085
I betrayed him and Tasyo,

88
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,547
even though they helped your mother and me

89
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,049
when this country turned its back on us.

90
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,430
I shouldn't have put his name on the list.

91
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,933
Father, don't blame yourself.

92
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,644
Eduardo managed to escape.

93
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,856
That's why the Colonel
wants him caught again.

94
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,152
He escaped? And Tasyo too?

95
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,865
I'm not sure what happened to Tasyo.

96
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,369
But I'm certain that Eduardo escaped.

97
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,666
That's why we need to go home
and tell Adelina about this.

98
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,877
-Let's go.
-Wait.

99
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,215
You can't tell them
what you know about Colonel Yuta.

100
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,135
Why not, Father?

101
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,347
Adelina needs to know the truth.

102
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,434
Don't forget that we serve
the Japanese Imperial Army,

103
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,853
and that includes the Colonel.

104
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,234
We cannot disclose any information
about the Japanese army,

105
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,361
so keep your lips sealed.

106
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,531
Let's go.

107
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,817
This is far enough.

108
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm sure we've lost them.

109
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,239
Is this where we part ways, sir?

110
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,619
Why? Where will you go?

111
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm going home, sir.

112
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,342
I want to see and embrace
my mother and father.

113
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,768
I understand, Mario.

114
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,148
But you can't see your family anymore.

115
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,193
That goes for me too.

116
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,449
The Kempeitai are looking for us,
and once they find us,

117
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,869
we will not be the only ones at risk.

118
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,790
Our families will suffer too,
do you understand?

119
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,252
You wouldn't want

120
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,964
your parents to be tortured
by the Japanese, right?

121
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,052
I don't want that to happen, sir.

122
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,847
But I know my parents.

123
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,518
They must be very worried about me.

124
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,357
I can no longer be apart from them
even for another day.

125
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,486
That will only put them in danger too.

126
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,864
I'm sorry, sir.

127
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,283
But I will still go.

128
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,580
Farewell.

129
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,751
Wait.

130
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,761
Please, sir.

131
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,722
Please, don't try to stop me anymore.

132
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,599
I won't stop you.

133
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,478
I'm going with you.

134
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,107
Let's go.

135
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,903
This way.

136
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,207
Adelina.

137
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,087
Where have you been?

138
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,298
Teresita and I just went to church.

139
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,845
Sir Francisco, thank you
for coming with us.

140
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,388
Please, go rest.

141
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,606
Hiroshi, do you have
any news about Eduardo?

142
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,483
He's safe.

143
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,070
Eduardo is safe, Adelina. Teresita.

144
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,699
-My God.
-He escaped from prison.

145
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,659
Thank you, my God.

146
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,999
But where is Eduardo now?

147
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,252
Why hasn't he returned?

148
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
Hiroshi, are you telling the truth?

149
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,136
Which prison did they take him to?

150
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,724
How did you know they escaped?

151
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,102
And who wanted them arrested?

152
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,405
Well?

153
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,699
Why can't you answer?

154
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,369
How did you know that Eduardo is safe?

155
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,915
And Tasyo? Is he alive too?

156
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,085
I don't know, Adelina.

157
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,213
I don't know if Tasyo also escaped.

158
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,965
But my comrades told me

159
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,384
that Eduardo managed to escape.

160
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,805
It's a long story.
Don't ask any more questions.

161
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,309
What's important is that Eduardo is safe.

162
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,776
You're right.

163
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,364
Eduardo is alive, Teresita.

164
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,575
God heard our prayers.

165
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,203
But where is he?

166
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,872
Why hasn't he come to see us?

167
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,962
Teresita, it would be better
if he doesn't come see you

168
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,797
or any of us right now.

169
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,008
Especially since the Kempeitai
are already looking for him.

170
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,429
Good Lord.

171
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,309
Don't worry, Teresita.

172
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,229
Let's keep our spirits up.

173
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,650
I know Eduardo misses us dearly right now.

174
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:25,531
I'm sure that no matter what,
he will come back to us.

175
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:49,430
There are rumors that some prisoners
escaped Fort Santiago.

176
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,518
But they were killed
by the Japanese soldiers.

177
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,231
Do you think…

178
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,235
At daybreak tomorrow,

179
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,405
I will visit Mario again.

180
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,580
Mother?

181
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,541
-Mario?
-Son?

182
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,002
-Father?
-Mario!

183
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,920
My son.

184
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,762
Dad is so happy that Eduardo is safe.

185
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,389
He's glad that he managed to escape.

186
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,601
And how are you so sure about that?

187
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm sure the Japanese
consider Eduardo an enemy right now.

188
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,617
The Kempeitai
are probably looking for him.

189
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,497
Who do you think they will look for first
to find that fugitive?

190
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,832
Won't that be you, bastard?

191
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,296
Once they come here,
you'll drag us all into that mess.

192
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,176
They won't stop
until they find that fugitive.

193
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,221
Our lives will be in danger.

194
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,605
With all due respect, Señora,

195
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,902
if you are not happy
that my brother is safe,

196
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,324
there is nothing more I can do
but pray for your soul,

197
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,910
so it will not burn in hell.

198
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,162
Enough, Mrs. Borromeo.

199
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,374
You will not lay
a single finger on Adelina

200
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,543
now that you're under our roof.

201
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,073
My Lord.

202
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,871
Please protect my family

203
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,125
that is being destroyed by this war.

204
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,504
Especially Eduardo.

205
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,447
Thank heavens, you're safe.

206
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,616
I thought you were already dead.

207
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,455
Son!

208
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,084
Father.

209
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,963
Good evening, sir.

210
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,509
Son, who is your friend?

211
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,387
Father, Mother.

212
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,848
His name is Eduardo.

213
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,018
We escaped together from the Japanese.

214
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,527
In that case, thank you, good sir.

215
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,240
Thank you for bringing our son home.

216
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,991
I'm sure you're both hungry.

217
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,869
Come, join us for dinner.

218
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,416
Anybody home?

219
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,928
Anybody home?

220
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,607
Coming! One moment!

221
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,740
We already went to the home

222
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,621
of Eduardo Dela Cruz,
and he was not there.

223
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,002
We also learned from his neighbors
that you have taken in his sister.

224
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,920
So we believe he might be here.

225
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,594
I already told you. Eduardo is not here.

226
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,724
Sir, my father is telling the truth.

227
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,311
The man you're looking for is not here.

228
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,777
Good evening.

229
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,617
What's the Kempeitai doing here?

230
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,203
How can we help you?

231
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,460
I hope you believe me.

232
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,087
We are your fellow Japanese.

233
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:20,135
We would not keep any secrets from you.

234
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
If you are telling the truth,

235
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,141
allow us to search your house.

236
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,957
We're looking for your son
and his companion.

237
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,252
Surrender them now,
so you won't have any problems!

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,105
The Kempeitai left.

239
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,358
They didn't come in to search anymore

240
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,402
because they believed what my father said,

241
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,405
that Eduardo is not with us.

242
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,617
Thank you very much.

243
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,128
You see?

244
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,923
We were almost put in danger
because of your damn brother!

245
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,593
Don't speak of him that way, Mama.

246
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:48,223
And he would never
want to put us in danger.

247
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,683
Shut your mouth.

248
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,685
I only want one thing.

249
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,816
That you would sever all ties
you have with that man!

250
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,445
Julio! Talk to your daughters!

251
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,786
This time, I agree with Carmela.

252
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
Just listen to her.

253
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,334
It's for your own safety.

254
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,881
Mario was arrested by the Japanese, right?

255
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,844
Why are you looking for my son here?

256
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,098
He said we already captured his son.
I don't think he knows he escaped.

257
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,351
Tell him to open the door and let us in.

258
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:39,274
They want to come in and make sure
your son is not in there.

259
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,527
So open the door and let us in.

260
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,030
But Dad…

261
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,160
we're talking about my brother here.

262
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,498
My own blood, my own family.

263
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,377
Forgive me, but I cannot do that.

264
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,129
I'm sorry, Adelina.

265
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,839
But times are different now.

266
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,386
We have lost the influence
and power we once had.

267
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,346
All of us.

268
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,559
Even now, our very lives
are in the hands of the Japanese.

269
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,895
I hope you understand.

270
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,898
I'm just worried about you.

271
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,297
Wait!

272
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,555
-Search the whole house!
-Yes, sir!

273
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,191
They are not here.

274
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,642
Good sir, our son is really not here.

275
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,188
He hasn't come home since he was arrested.

276
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,618
No! Please, don't!

277
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,179
If I'm right that Eduardo wants to see us,

278
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,723
I think I know where he might be.

279
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:23,063
I am certain Dela Cruz will find a way

280
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:28,276
to see his sister and Teresita again.

281
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,528
Since you are all useless,

282
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,823
I will find out the truth myself.

283
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,659
Where is our colonel going?

284
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,370
He will look for Eduardo
in the Borromeo family, sir.

285
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,330
I just want that traitor dead.

286
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,290
Señora, Japanese soldiers are here.

287
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,416
They're looking for you.

288
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,502
It's almost curfew. We need to leave now.

289
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,504
Why are you in a hurry, Hiroshi?

290
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:52,384
Don't you want to know
who arrested and tortured me and Tasyo?

291
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,638
COMING UP

292
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,561
