PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,880
<i>I'll protect you no matter what,
Mr. Borromeo.</i>

3
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,882
<i>They’ve killed so many people.</i>

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,010
We must take up arms

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,848
and help drive away
our enemies once and for all.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>Get ready.</i>

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>We're attending the birthday party
of my classmate</i>

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,937
<i>from the Japanese Imperial Army.</i>

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>We don't know who else to ask
to perform for those pests.</i>

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>This is a good opportunity.</i>

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>I’ll go with you. We’ll perform for them.</i>

12
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,590
<i>Colonel Saitoh is here.</i>

13
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>I saw him outside.</i>

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,509
I'm nervous, Adelina.

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>If we fail in this mission,
this will surely cost us our lives.</i>

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>Do you know what the Japanese do
to the women they capture?</i>

17
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>They rape them!</i>

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,399
<i>What if that were to happen to me,
what would you do?</i>

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

20
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,904
<i>Why would I accept
a woman tainted by another?</i>

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,656
You're a pig! You're a pig!

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>Lieutenant, this is my lovely wife.
Her name is Teresita.</i>

23
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,080
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

24
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>Everyone, this is my wife, Teresita.</i>

25
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>What a liar.</i>

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,961
He's indeed a wicked man.

27
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,381
<i>You can't fool me with your tears.</i>

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,092
What really happened?

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,429
I'm just worried about Luisa.

30
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,309
I just…

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,311
I just miss her so much.

32
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,731
It hurts…

33
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,111
That's enough.

34
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,028
Enough.

35
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,991
I'll ask my master for help.

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,995
I'm certain my Master Yuta
won't let me down.

37
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,333
Who's Yuta?

38
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,173
He's my master.
I owe him my life and my freedom,

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,719
He's known as the Colonel.

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,055
Colonel Yuta Saitoh.

41
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,641
I work for him.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,065
- Who started this?
- I helped these women escape!

43
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:19,032
If you're thinking of escaping again,
you already know what's going to happen.

44
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,498
If it weren't for my master,

45
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,376
I'd probably be dead by now.

46
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,301
<i>Uncle Lauro is out of the picture.</i>

47
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,054
He has sided with the enemy.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,392
He has sold his own soul to that devil.

49
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,520
<i>He already turned his back on us.</i>

50
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,235
Eduardo was telling the truth.

51
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,991
You've sided with the Japanese.

52
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,745
I'm warning you, Lauro.

53
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:11,417
Don't you ever betray my nephew for Yuta.

54
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,254
Is Eduardo still a guerrilla?

55
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,381
Promise me you won't hurt him.

56
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,389
Don't you dare betray those who fight

57
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:30,937
for the oppressed men and women
under the rule of your disgusting master.

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:40,446
And never let that devil know
that I'm here with you.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,783
But why?

60
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,036
Why do you hate him so much?

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,163
What really happened? Where were you?

62
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,291
Because I know him all too well!

63
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:58,256
That man is Satan on this land!

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,177
- You have no right to disrespect him!
- He dragged us to hell!

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,852
I was one of them.

66
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,481
I was raped by his soldiers!

67
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,817
Yes, Lauro!

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,948
I was one of the women they abducted…

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:34,167
to be a plaything
for his Japanese soldiers!

70
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:26,552
<i>Chasing rabbits</i>

71
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,097
<i>On the mountain</i>

72
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,060
<i>Fishing small carp</i>

73
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,522
<i>By the river</i>

74
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>Such dreams still wander</i>

75
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:47,073
<i>In my mind</i>

76
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>Dreams of the hometown I can't forget…</i>

77
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,455
You're a better singer than her, Teresita.

78
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:02,839
This song has more warmth
whenever you sing it, my wife.

79
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,843
<i>Are my parents well?</i>

80
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,389
<i>Are my friends</i>

81
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,601
<i>Living peacefully?</i>

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,272
Ma'am, would you like one?

83
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,275
Thank you.

84
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,489
<i>I remember</i>

85
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>My hometown</i>

86
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,542
<i>When my dreams</i>

87
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,796
<i>Have come true</i>

88
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,259
<i>I will return</i>

89
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,180
<i>Someday</i>

90
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,353
Mr. Borromeo?

91
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
<i>I'll do what's right.</i>

92
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,620
<i>I'll do everything to bring you home
to Adelina, Mr. Borromeo.</i>

93
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,346
Please enjoy your food.

94
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,934
Filipino food?

95
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,772
- Thank you.
- Thank you, miss.

96
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,758
- Hello!
- Hello!

97
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,678
- Good day!
- Good day!

98
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,514
Good day!

99
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,855
You're getting out of line!

100
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,692
Why did you hit me?

101
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,194
Don't tell me you're one
of those guerrillas?

102
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:37,743
Those fools do nothing
but fight against our true heroes?

103
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,643
Are you also one of the traitors

104
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:07,315
defying our true heroes?

105
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,909
Do you wish to die?

106
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,121
Go ahead! Kill that clown!

107
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,837
Right now!

108
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,339
Kill that clown!

109
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,346
I'm very sorry!

110
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,142
Forgive me, please!

111
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,645
Don't kill me!

112
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,150
Someone's coming!

113
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
Fellow Filipinos!

114
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,908
Don't shoot us, Sir Pablo.

115
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,409
It's just us.

116
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,546
What happened to you?

117
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,219
Uncle here succeeded
in entering the enemy's garrison.

118
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,640
He freed the women
and he even killed a Japanese soldier!

119
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,392
You're really brave.

120
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,310
Long live Eduardo!

121
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,645
- Long live!
- Long live!

122
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,063
No need to praise me.

123
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,066
I don't deserve to be commended
for what I've done.

124
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,904
Minyong, this is for you.

125
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,281
Thanks, Eduardo.

126
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,242
This will help me a lot.

127
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,995
We also brought food for everyone.

128
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,748
Juan. Pablo.

129
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,376
Help me give these away.
I'll just rest for a bit.

130
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,676
Eduardo's such a show-off.

131
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,598
Looks like he wants to show everyone
that he’s more worthy to lead

132
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,225
this group.

133
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:14,567
We should kill traitors who oppose

134
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:21,157
the noble Japanese Imperial Army!

135
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,782
<i>There was a time in our lives</i>

136
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,536
<i>when this game was our favorite.</i>

137
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,914
<i>The rules of the game were simple.</i>

138
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,418
<i>Whoever picks up the most stones wins.</i>

139
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,880
<i>But in times of war,</i>

140
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,593
<i>the game has taken on a different meaning.</i>

141
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>Now, the ball symbolizes our motherland</i>

142
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>and the stones symbolize our people</i>

143
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,608
<i>as we're being gathered as one nation
to defeat the foreign invaders.</i>

144
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,956
Looks like there's an attack nearby.

145
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,714
Pablo, Minyong, Abu, Lito.

146
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,882
Come with me.

147
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,844
- Let's see what's going on there.
- Don't interfere with them.

148
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,515
We have very little ammunition left.

149
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,600
Don't waste any more of it.

150
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,186
But we have people residing around here.

151
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,896
What if they're the ones being attacked?

152
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,859
- Are we just going to let them die?
- We can't save them.

153
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,196
Not every battle is ours to fight.

154
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,032
Then what's the point
of holding these weapons

155
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
if we're only going to choose who to help?

156
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,206
Anyone can come with me!

157
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,126
I refuse to turn a blind eye around here.

158
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,086
Eduardo!

159
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
I am the leader here.

160
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,263
Don't light it.

161
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,536
Why did you change our plan?

162
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,958
You're going to kill me for this?

163
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm still the leader here
and you'll do as I say.

164
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,348
Don't interfere!

165
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,736
No one can make me question my beliefs!

166
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:50,342
Now, Eduardo, I'll show you
who the true leader is.

167
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:06,775
The reason we're here is to defend
our countrymen at any time

168
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,610
with or without ammunition!

169
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,406
No one can tell me what to do.

170
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,449
Not even you!

171
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,202
I repeat!

172
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,039
Anyone can come with me!

173
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,682
Looks like Eduardo is starting to go
after your throne.

174
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,148
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!

175
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,568
We'll be back!

176
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,740
- Enjoy your meal, our heroes!
- Enjoy your meal, our heroes!

177
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,498
Where are you going?

178
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,543
I'm just going to use the bathroom.

179
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,725
Wait for my signal.

180
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,779
Thank the heavens we met again.

181
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,866
I knew it was you.

182
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,910
I have so much to tell you, Adelina.

183
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,580
Forgive me, Teresita.

184
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,957
But we can't talk right now.

185
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,918
You need to leave here, save yourself.

186
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:35,007
We've planted a bomb,
so find a way to get out of here quickly.

187
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,719
Don't take Saitoh with you.
Leave him here.

188
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,763
But when will I see you again?

189
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,099
If we succeed,

190
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
you'll be free.

191
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,857
But if not…

192
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,991
Damn.

193
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,411
Let's get out of here.

194
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>Adelina won't make it out alive anyway.</i>

195
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,793
Who among you imbeciles dared
to bomb this place?

196
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,757
We're not leaving
until we guarantee Adelina's safety.

197
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>Get your guns ready.
I know a way to distract them.</i>

198
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,721
<i>Let me do it.
I want to learn how to shoot.</i>

199
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,806
Die, all of you!

200
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,103
COMING UP

201
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,026
