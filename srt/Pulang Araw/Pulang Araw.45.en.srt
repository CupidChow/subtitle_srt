1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,336
Colonel, according
to the Kempeitai's report,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,423
the prisoners attempted to
seize weapons and escape.

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,425
Some of them didn't succeed.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,802
Where is the corpse of Eduardo Dela Cruz?

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,763
Colonel, he got away.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,641
My suspicions were right all along.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,061
That's why we need to go home
and tell Adelina about this.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,396
-Let's go.
-Wait.

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,399
You can't tell them
what you know about Colonel Yuta.

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,942
Your brother isn't here.

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,862
We don't even know
if we'll ever see him again.

12
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,157
We need to believe that Eduardo is alive.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,576
I'm going home, sir.

14
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,996
I want to see and embrace
my mother and father.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,459
The Kempeitai are looking for us,
and once they find us,

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,335
we will not be the only ones at risk.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,546
Our families will suffer too,
do you understand?

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,133
Where is Eduardo now?
Why hasn't he returned?

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,594
And who wanted them arrested?

20
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,765
Don't ask any more questions.
What's important is that Eduardo is safe.

21
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,393
Those soldiers will not stop
until they find that fugitive.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,645
Our lives will be in danger.

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,731
Our son is really not here.

24
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:09,152
He hasn't come home since he was arrested.

25
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,529
No! Please, don't!

26
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,950
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,257
Please, have mercy. Please.

28
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,050
Sorry to interrupt.

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,345
But these people are old
and cannot even fight us back.

30
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,098
Please show them mercy
and spare their lives.

31
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,746
Thank you.

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,166
Thank you very much.

33
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,255
You're right, sir.

34
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,968
We shouldn't have come back.

35
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,598
I shouldn't have come home.

36
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,150
Your parents are safe now.

37
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,695
Let's go.

38
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,072
We need to get away from here.

39
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,587
But where will we go now, sir?

40
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,395
Let's go.

41
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,695
Why haven't they found him?

42
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:03,451
Nighttime has come,
how is he still missing?

43
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:10,500
Colonel, they've already searched
his home and the homes of…

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,501
Enough!

45
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:17,674
He's bound to meet up with Teresita.

46
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:22,929
The Kempeitai already checked
where the young lady is staying, Colonel.

47
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,100
But Dela Cruz was nowhere to be found.

48
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,229
When we arrived there,

49
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,485
they said he hadn't shown up.

50
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,031
And you believed them?

51
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,120
Are you an idiot?

52
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,261
You're not just a soldier.

53
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,015
You're also a man.

54
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,516
I am certain

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,272
Dela Cruz will find a way

56
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:21,446
to see his sister and Teresita again.

57
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,740
Teresita, forgive me.

58
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,746
I'm disobeying your mother
and our father as well.

59
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,915
I want to find Eduardo.

60
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,211
And I'm sure he wants to see us too.

61
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,632
Adelina, I want to see him too.

62
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,137
But how? Where is he?

63
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,520
Could he be hiding at your aunt's house?

64
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,190
Maybe he's with his biological father?

65
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,901
No, Teresita.

66
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,571
I don't think that's possible.

67
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,866
Auntie Amalia despises Eduardo

68
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,828
just as he despises his own father.

69
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,915
But where could he be?

70
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,969
I can see in your eyes
that you're hesitant to trust me, Adelina.

71
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,850
Yes, I am Japanese.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,269
But I'm not your enemy.

73
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,563
I am a friend.

74
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,484
I want nothing but for Eduardo to be safe.

75
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,240
Adelina.

76
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,661
Look into my eyes.

77
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,123
You will see I'm telling the truth.

78
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,502
I give you my word.

79
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:06,217
I will never do anything to harm

80
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,220
my beloved's brother.

81
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,607
Tell us, Adelina. Where could he be?

82
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,615
If I'm right that Eduardo wants to see us,

83
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,743
I think I know where he might be.

84
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,079
He's probably waiting for us there.

85
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,790
-Where?
-Where?

86
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,092
Sir.

87
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,928
Why are we here?

88
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,852
My mother is buried here.

89
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,442
You still haven't answered my question.

90
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,490
Sir, what are we doing here?

91
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,992
Are we going to hide here?

92
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,852
Someone is coming.

93
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,083
I see a Japanese soldier, sir.

94
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,086
-We've been followed.
-Eduardo?

95
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,588
Eduardo, are you here?

96
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,096
Eduardo?

97
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,353
My God.

98
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,939
Eduardo!

99
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,525
Eduardo…

100
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,578
Hush, my princesses, I'm here now.

101
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,456
There, there.

102
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,808
Hush now.

103
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,730
Mario, come here.

104
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,023
Don't be afraid.

105
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,775
Come here.

106
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:25,124
This is Adelina, my sister.

107
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,503
This is Teresita, the woman I love.

108
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,339
And this is Hiroshi.

109
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,926
He's our childhood friend, a Japanese.

110
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,554
Don't worry, he's a good person.

111
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,017
This is Mario. I was with him in prison.

112
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,978
We escaped together.

113
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,857
Good evening, everyone.

114
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,400
Good evening.

115
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,156
Eduardo, we know what happened.

116
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,742
They said you escaped?

117
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,164
Earlier, the Kempeitai came
to the Tanakas looking for you.

118
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,251
I knew they would do that.

119
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,464
That's why I came here.

120
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,509
I knew that if you wanted to see me,

121
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,262
you'd know I would be here.

122
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,186
I hope…

123
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,482
you will not betray us, Hiroshi.

124
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,280
I'm not a traitor, Eduardo.

125
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,119
If I didn't value our friendship,

126
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,832
I would have married Teresita long ago.

127
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,793
But I didn't, right?

128
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,213
Because I know you love her.

129
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:59,760
Forgive me
if I doubted you before, Hiroshi.

130
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,812
Since the war began,
our hearts have been filled

131
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,522
with doubt and fear.

132
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,859
I hope that no matter what happens,

133
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,531
we keep valuing our friendship
and trust towards each other.

134
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,537
Despite our differences.

135
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
You can count on me.

136
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,709
All of you.

137
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,335
Thank you.

138
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
May I…

139
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,638
have a moment with Teresita?

140
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
I just want to talk to her.

141
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,225
Of course.

142
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,023
Are you hurt?

143
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,445
Teresita.

144
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to our meeting place.

145
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,622
What's important is you're safe.

146
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,627
You're alive.

147
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,715
That's all that matters to me, Eduardo.

148
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
I don't believe

149
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,282
that Eduardo Dela Cruz's sister
doesn't know where he is!

150
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,953
You're stupid to believe them!

151
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,664
But the Kempeitai
have already gone to the house,

152
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,167
and the Tanakas confirmed
he wasn't there--

153
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:01,465
I don't believe that neither
Teresita nor Adelina know anything.

154
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,010
Since you are all useless,

155
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,766
I will find out the truth myself.

156
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,487
Damn it!

157
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,878
Did the Japanese do this to you?

158
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,718
They tortured every single captive.

159
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,845
My God.

160
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,599
You need to get treated, Eduardo.

161
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,896
No. I'll take care of myself.

162
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,024
Hush now.

163
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,908
Teresita, forgive me.

164
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,785
Eduardo, I'm sorry for interrupting.

165
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,872
But I've been meaning to ask.

166
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,875
Where's Tasyo?

167
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,502
Why isn't he with you?

168
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,632
Where is our friend?

169
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,178
He was shot while we were escaping.

170
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,518
And I don't know if he's still alive…

171
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,023
or dead.

172
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,427
You're lucky to have survived, Filipino.

173
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,347
But I assure you…

174
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,685
you will experience extreme suffering

175
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,939
because of your
and Eduardo Dela Cruz's attempted escape.

176
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,818
-Why don't you just kill me?
-I can!

177
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,070
But I can still use you

178
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,282
against your friend.

179
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,301
My God, poor Tasyo.

180
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,390
I feel the same way.

181
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,310
He had nothing to do with this.

182
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,689
I'm the one they wanted to capture.

183
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,318
They only wanted me,
but they also arrested our friend.

184
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,323
My Lord.

185
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,162
If Tasyo is alive or dead…

186
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,249
God, keep him safe.

187
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,133
But why were you arrested?

188
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,721
What did you do against them?
What do they need from you?

189
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,517
Adelina, it's almost curfew.

190
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,561
We need to leave now.

191
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,023
We might need to leave too, sir.

192
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,651
The Japanese are looking for us right now.

193
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,906
There's still time, Mario.

194
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,204
Why are you in a hurry, Hiroshi?

195
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:07,961
Don't you want to know
who arrested and tortured me and Tasyo?

196
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,635
Why, Eduardo?

197
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,305
Who had you arrested?

198
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,350
You've met him.

199
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,813
Who, Eduardo?

200
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,067
Their heartless colonel.

201
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,863
Colonel Saitoh Yuta.

202
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,131
Where is our colonel going?

203
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,426
He will look for Eduardo
in the Borromeo family, sir.

204
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,263
I really hope Eduardo gets caught again.

205
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,807
I just want that traitor dead.

206
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,194
He kept asking me
about my father, about his location.

207
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,822
And when we couldn't answer,

208
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,742
we'd be tortured.

209
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,828
Enough! Please!

210
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,753
He was on the way to killing us.

211
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,385
That's why we attempted to escape.

212
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,390
Many of us were unlucky.

213
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,852
Only Mario and I survived.

214
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,650
I knew that colonel was up to no good.

215
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,282
So be careful.

216
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,950
Especially you, Teresita.

217
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,494
You cannot trust that man.

218
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,045
And you must not let our colonel know
you're aware of what happened.

219
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,549
If by chance you encounter him again,

220
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,179
you must pretend you know nothing
about what happened to Eduardo.

221
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,433
He must not know
we met with Eduardo today.

222
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,147
Of course, Hiroshi!

223
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,943
Do you think we're so stupid
that we'll reveal this to that colonel?

224
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,528
Adelina.

225
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,865
I'm just reminding you

226
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,660
because I don't want any of us
to be in danger,

227
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,330
especially since he's not
just an ordinary soldier.

228
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,960
He's cunning and ruthless.

229
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,171
Especially to his enemies.

230
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
Hiroshi is right.

231
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,979
Don't act any differently
in front of the Colonel,

232
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,316
so we can ensure your safety.

233
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,735
You want to ensure our safety?

234
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,740
Is anyone even safe in times like these?

235
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,996
I don't think so.

236
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,128
All of us can be arrested…

237
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,173
or killed at any moment.

238
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,516
Damn you, Colonel Saitoh.

239
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,521
Damn him and his fellow men to hell!

240
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,990
I apologize for what happened

241
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,993
and for what may still happen.

242
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,620
But believe me.

243
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,081
This is not easy for me either.

244
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,005
For all of us, Hiroshi.

245
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,468
Especially us Filipinos

246
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,220
who are continuously being invaded.

247
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,107
We need to find a place
for you to hide, Eduardo.

248
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,942
Mario too.

249
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,741
Why don't we try to
talk to Maestro Johnny?

250
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,204
Aren't there many rooms in his theater?

251
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,663
Don't bother.

252
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,376
I won't run or hide.

253
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,797
But you have no other choice, Eduardo.

254
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:09,096
Let us find a way to save you.

255
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,349
We can't let them arrest you again.

256
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,851
Just look at your wounds.

257
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,940
You're right, Adelina.

258
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,527
Mario and I have no other choice now…

259
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,324
but to go to the mountains.

260
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,828
We'll join the guerrillas

261
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,622
and fight the Japanese.

262
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,138
What did you say, Eduardo?

263
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,559
You will fight the Japanese?

264
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,936
That's right, Adelina.

265
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,563
That's what I want to do.

266
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,900
To fight the new invaders of our country.

267
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,880
For heaven's sake, Eduardo!

268
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,549
That's extremely dangerous.

269
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,134
Eduardo.

270
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm against this too.

271
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,348
That's not you.

272
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,396
I thought you never wanted to be involved.

273
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,607
Especially in this war, Eduardo!

274
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,818
I don't want trouble. I don't like war.

275
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,030
But what else can I do?

276
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,157
I'm part of it already.

277
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,493
Mario and I.

278
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,583
What do you want?

279
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,379
Would you want us to hide like rats?

280
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,551
You wouldn't be
proud of someone like that, right?

281
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:16,056
But Eduardo, we're worried about you!

282
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,433
Eduardo.

283
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,894
I beg you.

284
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,397
Don't do this.

285
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,567
I don't know what I'd do
if anything bad happens to you.

286
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,780
Eduardo.

287
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,701
Teresita.

288
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,165
Adelina.

289
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,213
I saw my fellow prisoners die

290
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,800
at the camp we were imprisoned in.

291
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,932
Pour it on them.

292
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,684
I said, pour it on them!

293
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,021
Many died there.

294
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,357
Too many.

295
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
We suffered the terror together.

296
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,997
And now, their lives have been stolen.

297
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,250
Tasyo could be one of them now.

298
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:34,843
Mario and I owe our survival
to those who have died.

299
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:49,566
It would be unfair to them
if we become selfish

300
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:56,531
and not fight to gain justice
for them and our country.

301
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,705
Eduardo, I understand.

302
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,918
I understand you.

303
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,715
But you don't know how to fight.

304
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,553
What you want to do is very dangerous.

305
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,681
You're risking your life.

306
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,100
You're risking Mario's life.

307
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,772
Look at who you're taking with you.
He is too young, Eduardo.

308
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,484
What do you know
about shooting or killing?

309
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,569
Have you done that before?

310
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,451
What if you're killed too, Eduardo?

311
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,037
What if you get killed?

312
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,247
Eduardo is right.

313
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,500
They have no choice.

314
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:55,340
I'm sure the Kempeitai won't stop
until they are arrested again.

315
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,552
Eduardo.

316
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,557
I understand your decision
and I respect it.

317
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,187
You have a responsibility to your friends,

318
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:15,402
your people, and your country
to fight against your invaders.

319
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,699
I hope you also understand
my family's decision

320
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,204
to fight for our country too.

321
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,542
Because this is my obligation, Eduardo.

322
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,669
Ours.

323
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,920
To our country.

324
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,007
It's an obligation
I can never turn my back on.

325
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,888
I'm sure the next time we meet, Hiroshi…

326
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,808
we'll be enemies.

327
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,645
But rest assured,

328
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,275
I will still treat you
like a brother and a friend.

329
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,320
Like I told you,

330
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,036
I value our friendship more.

331
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,126
I promise you too, my friend.

332
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,503
That I will treat you the same way.

333
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,435
I see Japanese soldiers, sir.

334
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,353
No matter what happens,
don't be too obvious.

335
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,522
He's not a rightful leader, Hiroshi.

336
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,150
He is interested in Teresita,
but he is heartless.

337
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,820
How can you say that
to our colonel, Adelina?

338
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,573
If you send Adelina away,
I will also leave.

339
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,118
I came back to be with my daughters.

340
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:52,749
And if I need to talk to Colonel Saitoh
to stop pursuing Teresita, I will do it!

341
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:57,337
I'm just taking my chances, sir.
Do you know where the guerrillas are?

342
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,006
Are you joining them
or are you Japanese spies?

343
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,049
No, sir!

344
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,552
We are looking for them
so we can join them.

345
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,721
Colonel, why is this man still alive?

346
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,431
I thought he was executed!

347
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm glad to meet you all
as our new comrades in this war.

348
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,479
Let me just call our leader.

349
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,605
COMING UP

350
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,199
