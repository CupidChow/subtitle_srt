1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,379
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,465
If I find out that you two are lying,

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,720
I won't hesitate
to kill you both where you stand.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,391
What are you doing?

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,184
What do you want with the Borromeos?

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,310
Hiroshi?

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,645
It can't be.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,522
Is Hiroshi our enemy now too?

9
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,733
You know these people?

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,943
You may stay at our home for now.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,653
You will be safer with us.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,947
It's actually better if we live with them,

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,784
so that Eduardo
can't get close to Teresita anymore!

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,287
Is it true that Hiroshi
has sided with them?

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,457
We grew up with him,
so we know he is not a bad person.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,251
I really hope they will be safe
in your house.

17
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,754
Because the moment
something happens to them,

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,255
you're going to pay.

19
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,133
Did I make you pay
for the death of my mother?

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,761
Eduardo, why did you let Adelina
and Teresita go with Hiroshi?

21
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,557
We will do whatever means necessary

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,103
to escape the imminent death
this war will bring.

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,693
Please have a seat, Mr. Borromeo.

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
Good evening, Mr. Tanaka.

25
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,868
Good evening.

26
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,705
Why are they here, Hiroshi?

27
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,168
Dad, I will explain it to you.

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,340
My apologies,
but please excuse me for a moment.

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,930
Dad.

30
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,647
Mama.

31
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,151
I don't feel comfortable with us
being a burden to them.

32
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,823
There's no reason
for you to feel that way,

33
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,076
especially since you and Hiroshi
are going to be married soon.

34
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,080
Mama, could you please stop this nonsense?

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,793
Please, do not argue here.

36
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,128
Save us some face.

37
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,554
Mr. Julio.

38
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,545
We shall consider this a great
debt of gratitude to both you and Hiroshi.

39
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,007
Well then, make yourself at home.

40
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,218
Yes, come. Come along.

41
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,636
Quickly.

42
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,416
I want to find where they took
and imprisoned my father.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,418
-How will you do that?
-Where? How, Hiroshi?

44
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,337
We have many friends.
Especially my father.

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm sure they can help me.

46
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,131
Hiroshi!

47
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,176
How do you know this country
will be in danger?

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,513
How are you connected to the Japanese
who are occupying our country?

49
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,474
I suspect that Hiroshi's father
is a Japanese spy.

50
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,351
I can't be mistaken, Eduardo.

51
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,853
Hiroshi has indeed become
a Japanese soldier.

52
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,273
I thought his father was our only enemy.

53
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,024
He's one of them too.

54
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,902
Can you still bring yourself
to love an enemy?

55
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,742
Adelina.

56
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,996
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,540
It's almost curfew.

58
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,045
Come. I'll take you inside.

59
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,428
Hiroshi, may I ask you something?

60
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,389
What is it, Adelina?

61
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,100
Why?

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,814
Why did you invade our country?

63
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,284
We didn't do anything to yours.

64
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,038
I do not understand.

65
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,540
Why are you tormenting us?

66
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:46,304
That is why the annihilation of
General Douglas MacArthur's

67
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,599
United States Army Forces in the Far East
is our primary objective.

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,564
So that nothing will stand in the way of
expanding our territory here in Asia.

69
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,530
It seems that there's so much
I still don't know about you.

70
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,828
I thought you were just an ordinary
Japanese man living in our country,

71
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,456
but it turns out you had other motives.

72
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,541
No, Adelina.

73
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,211
Please, allow me to explain.

74
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,837
Explain what?

75
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,217
Why you deceived us?

76
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,764
Why you tricked us
into believing you were a friend?

77
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:34,102
When in truth, you're just one of those
who want to destroy our homeland!

78
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,899
Who kill and spread fear
among our countrymen!

79
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,361
Adelina.

80
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,655
You have the wrong idea about me.

81
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,783
No, I know who you are now.

82
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,288
I know who the real Hiroshi is.

83
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,085
Tell me.

84
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,884
Were you just pretending the night
you went to our house and kissed me?

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:14,183
Are your heart and mouth
full of deceit as well?

86
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,652
Your kiss is bitter!

87
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,282
As bitter as the painful secrets
you carry, Hiroshi!

88
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,744
Adelina, I love you.

89
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,708
Adelina.

90
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,006
I love you, Adelina.

91
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,093
That's the truth.

92
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,846
My feelings are true.

93
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,848
As true as the sun rises.

94
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,976
But…

95
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,982
I also have my duties
to my country, to my father…

96
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,985
and to my mother.

97
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,071
I love them too, Adelina.

98
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,492
I love them as much as I love you.

99
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,208
You may see me as an enemy now,

100
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,294
but that is not the truth.

101
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,256
If you only close your eyes,

102
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,467
you will know.

103
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,304
I am but a simple man

104
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,723
who loves you with all my heart

105
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,725
and cherishes you.

106
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,895
On the day the Japanese occupied the city,

107
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:28,776
the people of Manila also began
to experience horrifying changes.

108
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,172
Bow down!

109
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,264
He means you should bow

110
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:04,478
and show respect
to every Japanese soldier you see.

111
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,908
Father is already resting.

112
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,812
Sir, the people here are all innocent.

113
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,814
They're just here to pray.

114
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,086
-Mom.
-Please have mercy on my son.

115
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,838
Dad, Mom.

116
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,258
Mario is only fifteen years old
and he's a very good boy!

117
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,011
Please, not my son. I beg you.

118
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,182
Hey! Leave that old man behind!

119
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,059
No, no, no!

120
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,060
No, don't!

121
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,479
Get them out, quickly!

122
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:38,239
Sir, we're in the house of the Lord.
Please have mercy on these people!

123
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,408
Let's go!

124
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,910
-Mom! No!
-Mario!

125
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,872
Mom! Dad!

126
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,541
-Mario!
-Sir, where are you taking them?

127
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,167
What are you going to do to them?

128
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,922
May God forgive you for what you're doing.

129
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,675
Let's go!

130
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,847
Come here!

131
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,401
Hey!

132
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,111
-Hey!
-Where are you taking me?

133
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,863
-Come!
-Let go of me!

134
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,989
Let go!

135
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,160
Let go of me! Please don't do this!

136
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,287
Hey! Hurry! Get them all on board!

137
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,957
Where are you taking me? Have mercy!

138
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,920
The whole city can hear
the heartbreaking cries of the oppressed…

139
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,054
and the deafening shouts
of the enemy's victory.

140
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,723
Long live our Emperor!

141
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,516
Long live!

142
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,851
Long live!

143
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,481
-Long live!
-Long live!

144
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,398
Hey.

145
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,443
Why are you all huddled here in the dark?

146
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,281
Don't make any noise
or the Japanese might hear us.

147
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
What are you afraid of?

148
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,161
We're in the house of the Japanese.

149
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,669
Adelina, dear, can you come with me?

150
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,131
I want to cook soup
and I love your recipe.

151
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,719
Yes, you, Adelina.

152
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,931
Your recipe for soup is delicious,

153
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,266
so I want to share it with the Tanakas.

154
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,310
So come on, help me cook.

155
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,313
Okay? Please excuse us.

156
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,927
What was that for?

157
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,930
Did you think
I didn't see you with Hiroshi?

158
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,015
You two-faced snake!

159
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,893
Have you no shame?

160
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
You stole my daughter's fiancé!

161
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,522
You skank!

162
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,857
Señora, you're the only one forcing this!

163
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,734
Even my sister doesn't like him!

164
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,029
Don't flirt with someone
who isn't meant for you!

165
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,740
Find a man like you!

166
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,035
Poor and uneducated!

167
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,038
That's the type of man that suits you!
Not Hiroshi!

168
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,999
So remember this.

169
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,626
Stay away from Hiroshi.

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,297
If you don't,
I'll tell his father all about this.

171
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,050
Let's see what Mr. Tanaka will do to him!

172
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,682
Why did you turn on so many lights--

173
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,395
Adelina, my dear.

174
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,191
Why are you crying?

175
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,736
Come on. What happened to you?

176
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,154
My goodness, Julio.

177
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,616
Your impertinent daughter
was talking back to me earlier.

178
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,035
So there, I scolded her!

179
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,370
Is this true, my dear?

180
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,667
Don't lie.

181
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,378
Tell him what you did.

182
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,640
Adelina.

183
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,975
What you did is wrong.

184
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,271
You shouldn't act like this
toward your parents.

185
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,067
You weren't raised to be
rude and rebellious!

186
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,446
Go and apologize to my wife!

187
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,491
Right now!

188
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,253
Please forgive me, señora.

189
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,564
Enough now, Julio.

190
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,733
Enough.

191
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,488
I'm sure she won't do it again.

192
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,658
So let's go.

193
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,202
It's time for us to rest.

194
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,673
Mom, have you talked to Dad?

195
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,134
Will he be coming tomorrow?

196
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,303
Is he going to watch our school program?

197
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm the only one who'll be there, my dear.

198
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,729
You know that your father
is busy with work.

199
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,692
He's always busy.

200
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,821
He hardly ever visits us.

201
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,582
Come here, my dear.

202
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,793
Come, sit here.

203
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,637
My dear.

204
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:41,351
No matter what happens or whatever
shortcomings your father may have,

205
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,773
don't hold any hatred
in your heart for him.

206
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:51,278
Instead, let's try to understand
and love him even more.

207
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:57,534
My dear, sometimes,
the people we love the most

208
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:05,834
are oftentimes the ones
who give us the most pain and sadness.

209
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,422
So whatever challenge
you may face in life,

210
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,174
whatever happens…

211
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,803
always choose to be happy.

212
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,350
We should always see the beauty in life,

213
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:27,898
despite the sadness or pain that we feel.

214
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,736
Can you do that, Adelina?

215
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,949
Come on, give me a smile.

216
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,994
We said we're always
going to choose to be happy, right?

217
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,101
Along with my tears that fell that night,

218
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,062
so too did the tears of women

219
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,149
who were abducted
and imprisoned by the Japanese.

220
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,567
Let go of me!

221
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,781
Have mercy, sir!

222
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,742
Please, help me!

223
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,746
Get out of here!

224
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,836
Get out! Get out!

225
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,798
Miss! Please, help me!

226
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,009
Don't leave me!

227
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,261
No! Please!

228
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,851
Have mercy!

229
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,902
What?

230
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,790
Help!

231
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,273
Help!

232
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
-Adelina!
-Oh, my gosh!

233
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,139
You startled me!

234
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,059
Adelina, please don't get mad.

235
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,727
Forgive me.

236
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,316
Truth is, I've been waiting for you…

237
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,820
so I can give you this.

238
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:33,375
Don't tell me
you still have doubts about me.

239
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,835
It's not that, Hiroshi.

240
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,714
But if possible, please don't
come near me or talk to me anymore.

241
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,508
Especially when Señora Carmela is around.

242
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,221
But why?

243
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,141
Don't tell her I told you this
or she'll be even more mad at me.

244
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,564
She always misinterprets it
whenever she sees us talking

245
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,526
because she is convinced that
you and Teresita should end up together.

246
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,529
I will talk to Mrs. Borromeo, Adelina.

247
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,364
I already said you can't!

248
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,616
Why can't you just do as I say?

249
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,413
From now on, don't ever
come near me or talk to me again, okay?

250
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,206
Promise me that.

251
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,543
Hello? Anybody home?

252
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,629
-Tasyo!
-Adelina!

253
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,467
Good morning, Adelina!

254
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,099
Don't be afraid of Hiroshi, Mr. Luis.

255
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,311
He's not like the other Japanese.
He's a good man.

256
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,860
Well, he came to us
when he learned you left your house.

257
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,822
So I brought him here
because your brother went out.

258
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,742
Huh? Eduardo went out?

259
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,036
Does he have a death wish or something?

260
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,829
I know. I don't understand him either.

261
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,457
You know how stubborn he is.

262
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,751
Oh, Eduardo.

263
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:02,506
My apologies, Mr. Luis,
but what brings you here?

264
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,326
Excuse me, ma'am!

265
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,994
What is it?

266
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,959
My father lives here.

267
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,963
Do you know what happened?

268
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,714
They destroyed it.

269
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,091
The Japanese bombed it.

270
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:51,179
Do you know what happened
to the people who live here?

271
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,934
No, but I'm sure they're all dead.

272
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,484
You're not supposed to die yet.

273
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,616
You haven't accepted me yet.

274
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,539
You haven't acknowledged me
as your son yet.

275
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,509
You're not supposed to die yet.

276
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,666
There is a Japanese officer
who wants to meet you.

277
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,084
They must not find you attractive.

278
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,544
COMING UP

279
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,686
-The criminal you are looking for is here.
-Who are you?

280
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,397
I'm the son of
the helpless woman you killed!

281
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,449
-Liar!
-Do that again and I will kill you!

282
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,161
What did you say, huh? Say that again!

283
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,837
