1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,837
As the year 1941 began…

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,566
We started to
notice the Japanese slowly approaching.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,552
-Long live the Emperor! -Long live!

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,554
But you need to hurry

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,223
because our plan to attack is coming soon.

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,018
I've known Hiroshi since he was a kid.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,187
I'll have him marry my Teresita.

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,689
It's really you, Hiroshi!

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,816
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,152
You've changed a lot.

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,611
You were prettier back then.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,322
I've done what you asked me to do.

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,742
My friends will teach them a lesson.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,662
Is some woman
the reason your son came back here?

15
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,707
No, he's here to help with our mission.

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,667
Then why does he have different beliefs?

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm no longer hoping
for Teresita to love me

18
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,755
or for this love to blossom,

19
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,591
especially since her mother is so evil.

20
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,636
I am a mother who
only wants what's best for Teresita's future.

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,474
Now that her irresponsible
father has returned,

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,185
Teresita's situation will improve

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:05,815
if we agree to marry your son
and my daughter as soon as possible.

24
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,995
Adelina?

25
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,208
-Tasyo? -Have you seen Eduardo?

26
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,544
My brother?

27
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,628
Yes.

28
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,130
Is he not home yet?

29
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,965
I'm afraid not.

30
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,011
I already told you not to
worry. He'll be here soon.

31
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,515
You better go. Your father
must be looking for you.

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,268
Fine.

33
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,854
But when Eduardo gets
home, you better pick me up.

34
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,272
Sure.

35
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,067
- As soon as possible, okay?
- Yes, now be on your way.

36
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,957
Thank you.

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,586
Dad?

38
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,715
Are you sure it's okay
for me to stay here again?

39
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,885
I'm too embarrassed to be around your wife.

40
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,723
I don't want her to think I'm imposing.

41
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,183
There is nothing she can do about it now.

42
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,521
If she kicks you out again,

43
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,107
we'll find another place to stay.

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,442
We'll leave.

45
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,193
Dad!

46
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,240
Now that's settled, do
you have plans for tomorrow?

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,287
- Nothing, Papa.
- I need to grab my things from the hotel.

48
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,498
Do you want to come
along? I'll take you around.

49
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,791
We'd love that!

50
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,877
You can't leave.

51
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,839
We have guests coming tomorrow.

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,842
Good evening, señora.

53
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,059
Mama, who's coming tomorrow?

54
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,853
Come with me, Julio.

55
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,481
We have important matters to discuss.

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,834
Why didn't Mama answer my question?

57
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,005
Don't worry about it, Teresita.

58
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,591
I have something to tell you.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,304
Hiroshi's back and we met.

60
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,556
Oh, Teresita.

61
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,142
He's all grown up now.

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:32,313
He is still very charming and kind.

63
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,818
I thought you weren't interested in him?

64
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,070
That's what you said
when I teased you before.

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm not!

66
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,909
I'm not interested! Not at all!

67
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,329
I'm just happy we saw each other again.

68
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,580
That's all.

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,375
You're the one reading too much into it.

70
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,878
Fine, I was wrong.

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,008
But for goodness sake, Adelina, why
didn't you bring him here with you?

72
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,301
Then I could've seen him too.

73
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:08,433
Don't worry, Teresita. I'm
sure you will see him soon.

74
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,227
I hope so. So we can all be together again.

75
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,442
I know, Teresita. The four of
us used to be so mischievous.

76
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,653
Your mother and Mr. Tanaka hated us for it.

77
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,779
True.

78
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:43,968
I'm surprised you
accepted Carmela's proposal.

79
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:51,309
We need her and her family.
They can help with our mission.

80
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,811
Mission?

81
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,855
What mission?

82
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,487
Honey.

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,033
I don't even recognize you anymore.
You're hiding so much from me.

84
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,454
I'm home.

85
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,500
Get some rest.

86
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,587
We're leaving early to visit the Borromeos.

87
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,506
Really, Father?

88
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,801
I'm glad.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,637
It would be nice to
see my old friends again.

90
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,972
Thank you, Father.

91
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,107
Forgive me, but I won't
come with you tomorrow.

92
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,443
Why not?

93
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,168
What's this nonsense, Carmela?

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,049
You made arrangements to marry
off our daughter to those Japanese?

95
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,347
Julio, what more can
you ask for from Hiroshi?

96
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:17,019
He's educated and his family is well-off.

97
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,855
Don't you want that for her?

98
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,608
I need to talk to Teresita about this.

99
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,738
We don't need her permission.

100
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,241
What do you mean?

101
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,953
This is her life we're talking about.

102
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,831
I don't want her to end up like me…

103
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,876
like us.

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,920
Our marriage was arranged by our parents.

105
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,798
But look at us.

106
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,010
Were we happy?

107
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,056
I won't let Teresita be
forced into that situation

108
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,143
and I won't agree

109
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,104
to marry her off to
someone she doesn't love.

110
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,986
I won't let my plans fall through!

111
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,915
Thank you, Lord.

112
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,503
Hiroshi, my dear friend.

113
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,382
I was very glad to see you again.

114
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,555
Adelina! Are you inside?

115
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,349
Open the door.

116
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,394
Just a moment, Teresita!

117
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,824
What is it?

118
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,785
I heard Mama and Papa arguing.

119
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,371
It seems like Mama already told Papa

120
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,374
that she wants to arrange my marriage.

121
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,917
But Papa is against it.

122
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,337
-Really? -Yes.

123
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,880
That's why I'm so happy.

124
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,010
We finally have an ally in this house.

125
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,305
You're right, Teresita.

126
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,348
Dad cares about us.

127
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,103
But who does Señora want you to marry?

128
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,940
I don't know.

129
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,192
I don't care who he is.

130
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,239
Adelina.

131
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,866
-Yes? -Tasyo is outside.

132
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,203
He said something bad
happened to your brother.

133
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,894
Eduardo!

134
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,020
-Eduardo. -Eduardo!

135
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,190
For goodness sake, Eduardo.
What happened to you?

136
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,738
- Who did this to you?
- That's what I've been asking him earlier.

137
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,116
Don't bother finding out. I
don't want you to get involved.

138
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,785
Especially you, Adelina.

139
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,373
I can't bear to have them
do to you what they did to me.

140
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,209
What's going on, Eduardo?

141
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,712
You're making me worry.
Who did you fight with?

142
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,005
Save that for later, Adelina.

143
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,966
Let's take him to the hospital
first, so the doctor can examine him.

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,176
There's no need for that.

145
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,220
Go home. They might be looking for you.

146
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,846
Please. Let's go to the hospital.

147
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,723
I said, no! One!

148
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,184
-Look at your face! -Two!

149
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,977
-We're just worried about you! -Three!

150
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,605
If you don't want to go to
the hospital, suit yourself.

151
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,946
Tasyo, ask Meding or Yolanda
to give you some ointment.

152
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,949
-I will treat Eduardo myself. -Okay.

153
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,369
And don't you dare do that
counting to me, Eduardo.

154
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,079
You can't intimidate me.

155
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,686
Your future husband is a lucky man.

156
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,523
You possess all the
qualities of an ideal woman.

157
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,694
So when you choose someone to marry,

158
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,532
make sure that he loves you
and he can take care of you.

159
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,498
Why are you pushing me to someone else?

160
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,002
I haven't even thought about marriage yet.

161
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,713
What happened to you, anyway?

162
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,965
Who did this?

163
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,719
You don't need to know.

164
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,262
What's the point?

165
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,660
Ouch!

166
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,272
If you don't trust me, Eduardo…

167
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,444
I don't want you to ruin your
relationship with your family.

168
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,864
Why?

169
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,452
Was it my family who did this to you?

170
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,956
Was it Mama again?

171
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,709
Don't worry about me.

172
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,004
I can handle my own problems.

173
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,633
Eduardo, I made you some soup.

174
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,343
Eat this to get your strength back.

175
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,265
-Ouch. -Go home now, Teresita.

176
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,809
They must be looking for you already.

177
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
Eduardo.

178
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,985
Teresita and Dad want me to
move back to the big house.

179
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,279
You can't move back, Adelina.

180
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,030
Why not?

181
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,367
Papa and I will protect her from Mama.

182
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,744
And how exactly are
you going to protect her?

183
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,705
Was it Mama, Eduardo?

184
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,625
Was she involved in this?

185
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,378
What are you talking about?

186
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,924
- Eduardo, was she involved in this?
- Enough, Teresita!

187
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,927
Take Adelina with you if you want!

188
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,639
But you and Uncle Julio
better take responsibility

189
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,018
once your mother hurts her, understood?

190
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,146
Eduardo…

191
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,648
Where are you going?

192
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,028
Teresita, what happened?
What did you two talk about?

193
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,742
Just stay here, Adelina.
I'll come back for you.

194
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,395
Señora!

195
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,482
Señora!

196
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,822
-Señora! -Hey!

197
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,242
What do you need?

198
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,620
I need to talk to your señora.

199
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,580
Unbelievable. You sure have the nerve, boy.

200
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,583
-Señora! -Hey! Don't come in.

201
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,086
Stop right there!

202
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,757
Señora, let's talk!

203
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,179
Let me through!

204
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,369
Leave the thug alone.

205
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
You…

206
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,213
What are you doing here?

207
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,466
Haven't you noticed my appearance?

208
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,850
The people you paid off did this to me!

209
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,896
Where is the evidence?

210
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,111
Poor you. You're so stupid.

211
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,822
You are uneducated.

212
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,452
That's why your head
is full of crazy ideas.

213
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,704
You know,

214
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,791
I've always wondered why my
daughter wanted to be friends with you.

215
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,419
You are such an uncouth person.

216
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,007
You are even beneath
the spit of lowly people!

217
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,842
You are right.

218
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,305
The gap between Teresita and me is huge.

219
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,019
That's why I am grateful
for the kindness of her heart

220
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,483
because she treated me like
a friend even though I'm poor.

221
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,987
And just like Adelina,

222
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,950
I love your daughter very much.

223
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,960
You really have no shame, do you?

224
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,299
Do you really think I
will let you remain friends,

225
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,177
or even be more than
that, with my daughter?

226
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,514
I know my place, señora.

227
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,477
I will neither try nor pursue this

228
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,398
because I don't want to destroy her future.

229
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,486
I know very well that I
have nothing to offer her.

230
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm happy with what we have now.

231
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
I will keep her away from you.

232
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,585
I will keep her away
from you and your sister!

233
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,582
Do whatever you want!

234
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,876
But keep this in mind.

235
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,842
Don't you ever involve Adelina in this.

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,388
You can have me killed, Mrs. Borromeo.

237
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,685
But the moment I find out you hurt

238
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,438
or get Adelina involved in this mess…

239
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,236
You may think of me as stupid and lowly,

240
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,157
but I will make sure you pay for it.

241
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,243
I will hold you accountable.

242
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,996
Perhaps not through the constabulary

243
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,415
or the court that favors you so much,

244
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,418
but I will make you pay.

245
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,088
You will pay for it, señora.

246
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,508
Don't you dare threaten me.

247
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,163
-Francisco! -Señora?

248
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,123
So useless!

249
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,022
God Almighty.

250
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,527
I admire Eduardo's greatness.

251
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,324
He's the man I want to marry someday.

252
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,038
What a pest! He's so arrogant!

253
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,048
Have you spoken with the Tanakas?

254
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,886
Have you told them not
to come here tomorrow?

255
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,932
They will be coming over, Julio.

256
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,103
And Mr. Tanaka and I will
formalize our agreement.

257
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:17,693
We will set the date for the grand
wedding of Hiroshi and Teresita.

258
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,445
Don't be stubborn with me, Carmela.

259
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,493
I am against your
agreement with the Tanakas.

260
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,412
You will only embarrass yourself.

261
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,000
We will see about that.

262
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,636
Eduardo, where have you been?

263
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,685
Where is Teresita?

264
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,688
She went out. I thought she went after you.

265
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,781
Here comes Teresita now.

266
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,359
The gap between Teresita and me is huge.

267
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,862
That's why I am grateful
for the kindness of her heart.

268
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,363
And just like Adelina,

269
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,116
I love your daughter very much.

270
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,190
Why are you looking
at each other like that?

271
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,113
Did something happen between you two?

272
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,164
Are you ready, Adelina? Let's go.

273
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,714
Eduardo, we'll be heading
back to the house now, okay?

274
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,342
Take care.

275
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,761
Both of you.

276
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,477
Tell that to yourself, Eduardo.
You're the one all beaten up.

277
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,146
And stop getting yourself into trouble.

278
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,730
-Don't… -One!

279
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,190
Let's go, Teresita.

280
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,668
How can your conscience bear
to order people to hurt someone?

281
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,086
Leave him and Adelina alone,

282
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,298
and don't have Eduardo beaten up again

283
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,176
unless you want me to
disown you as my mother!

284
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,469
Do you have boyfriends? Suitors?

285
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,265
-I fancy someone now. -And who is this man?

286
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,476
Adelina, don't entertain just anyone.

287
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,438
Finally! We're reunited again!

288
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,898
Many things have happened,

289
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,568
that's when
I realized I want to give him my heart.

290
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,236
I'm sure that boy must be so happy.

291
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,615
Just don't tell anyone about this, okay?

292
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,491
About what?

293
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,786
COMING UP

294
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,710
