1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,295
There are two women looking for you.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,464
They said they're Teresita's friends.

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,009
This war is meaningless

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,095
now that it's being led by Colonel Saitoh.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,471
Why, Father?

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,266
They did not punish Lauro.
He's still alive.

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:22,897
He was kept alive by the Colonel
so he could find and kill Filipinos.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,735
The Colonel is especially after
your friend, Eduardo.

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,529
They won't stop until I'm caught.

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,823
It's because of Colonel Saitoh.

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,826
Your daughter was one of us, señora.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,121
She was also captured, imprisoned,

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,706
and abused by them.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,042
I'm sure Colonel Yuta
has already punished them all.

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,545
What does the Colonel
have to do with this?

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,382
It was the Colonel
who ordered Teresita's arrest.

17
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,427
We're at war, Eduardo.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,806
That friendship is meaningless now!

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,768
And so is your childhood friend.

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,810
You mean Hiroshi?

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,354
What about Adelina?
What did they do to Adelina?

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:08,651
We need to secure weapons
or anything our guerrillas can use.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,861
I'll take care of it.

24
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,197
Hiroshi, I'm going back to Japan.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,324
But I can't go with you, Father.

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,992
I want to find Eduardo.

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,619
And join forces with them.

28
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:22,582
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,376
Captain Watanabe, sir.

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,800
Another order from the military?

31
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,469
-What is it this time?
-It's the Colonel.

32
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,223
He has ordered us
to capture Adelina Dela Cruz again.

33
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,894
Looks like the Colonel won't stop

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,357
until he gets the head of his rival,

35
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,152
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

36
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,365
He's going to kill anyone

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,619
who dares stand in his way.

38
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,296
There wouldn't be enough time

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,382
if I were to tell you

40
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,468
everything that happened to us.

41
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,850
We're certain we're not
the only women they abducted.

42
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,521
There are many more of us

43
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:14,652
who were abducted
and taken to different camps.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,740
Enough.

45
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,037
I can't bear to hear it all.

46
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,751
Yolanda. Meding. Take care of them.

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,777
I want you both to think.
Who will you side with?

48
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,989
The enemies or the allies
of the Japanese soldiers?

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,952
What kind of life awaits her
if she marries a foreign invader, señora?

50
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
She may live in luxury

51
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,123
with plenty of food and a place to sleep,

52
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,711
but she'll be a prisoner trapped in hell

53
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,880
-with the damn colonel!
-Shut up!

54
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,426
You must get along with the Colonel

55
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:25,723
if you want all of us to live long.

56
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,311
I'm starting to believe

57
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:35,358
there's only one person responsible
for the abduction of my two daughters.

58
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,526
Colonel Saitoh.

59
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,528
He's behind all this.

60
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,030
Don't accuse the Colonel like that.

61
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,575
If Teresita hadn't
sacrificed herself for us,

62
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,995
Lorena and I wouldn't have escaped.

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,418
We don't even know if…

64
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,714
Teresita is still alive or not.

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,968
Because death is the punishment

66
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,972
if they find out you tried
to escape from that hell.

67
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,393
Forgive me!

68
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,408
They're plotting something
against Adelina?

69
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,412
I couldn't understand
what Yuta was saying on the phone.

70
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,875
But I'm sure my sister is in danger,

71
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,504
and there's nothing I can do
to warn or save her.

72
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,841
He's coming.

73
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,765
I have an important trip to Manila.

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,476
If you're thinking about escaping again,

75
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,438
I've left strict orders to my soldiers.

76
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,649
You already know what's going to happen

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,778
if anyone disobeys.

78
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,239
Let's go!

79
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,949
Wait.

80
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,412
There's something I want to tell you.

81
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,665
What is it?

82
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,170
I'll give you what you want.

83
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,425
I'll do everything you want.

84
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,682
But don't you dare hurt my family.

85
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,560
Especially not Adelina.

86
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,148
We can't smuggle
these weapons out of Manila.

87
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,528
They're very strict with men like us.

88
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,698
We'll surely get arrested
at their outposts.

89
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,201
That's why you'll have to deliver

90
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,329
and transport these weapons
to our guerrillas.

91
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,875
The Japanese are less strict
with women like you and Miss Josefa.

92
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,004
But they will still inspect our goods,
won't they?

93
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,758
What if they find out we're carrying guns?

94
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,719
Our lives are at stake here.

95
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,721
So we must be prepared!

96
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,811
Can I trust you'll be true to your word?

97
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
He didn't answer.

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,124
Does that mean Adelina is in danger?

99
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,835
We need to get out of here

100
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,130
for my sister.

101
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,561
Good morning, girls!

102
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,938
You two slept very well.

103
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,442
I don't think we can ever
rest peacefully again.

104
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,693
But yes.

105
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,779
We managed to get some rest.

106
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,406
That's good to hear.

107
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,908
Please, have some breakfast.

108
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,205
Won't the señora join us to eat?

109
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,500
No, she left early this morning.

110
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,378
Eat up.

111
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,926
My God. Japanese soldiers.

112
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,930
Open the door!

113
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,307
The soldiers are here.

114
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,518
Hide! Hide!

115
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,825
-Just a moment!
-Open the door!

116
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,369
Coming, sir!

117
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,997
Good morning, sir.

118
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,125
Good morning, good soldiers.

119
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,669
Where's Adelina?

120
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,881
Bring her out!

121
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,012
She's no longer with us, sir!

122
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,891
Adelina ran away.

123
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,018
-Yes, sir.
-She fought with our señora.

124
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,563
That's why she left us.

125
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,566
And please don't ask us where she is

126
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,360
because we don't know either!

127
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,112
We swear on our lives.

128
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,709
Where are you going?

129
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,006
Good day.

130
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,678
We're bringing goods to the village.

131
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,224
Here's our permit
authorized by your official.

132
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,983
I don't believe these two!

133
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:14,655
Search the whole house and find Adelina!

134
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,577
-They must be hiding her somewhere.
-Yes, sir!

135
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,920
-Inspect their goods.
-Yes, sir!

136
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,978
My God. Inday.

137
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,856
They might find those girls.

138
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,691
We're going to get in trouble!

139
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,819
Meding! Meding, hey!

140
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,535
Let them through.

141
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,958
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

142
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,544
Wait!

143
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,758
Meding.

144
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,760
Meding!

145
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,805
Meding!

146
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,765
Meding?

147
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,768
Meding, Meding.

148
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,562
Meding. Meding?

149
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,898
This is Captain Watanabe.

150
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,317
What do you want?

151
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,464
What are you doing there?

152
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,841
Get out!

153
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,552
Quickly!

154
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,596
Quickly!

155
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,276
Can we leave now?

156
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,194
Lower the chest!

157
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,321
Empty this. I want to be sure.

158
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,960
-Yes, thank you.
-Out!

159
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,462
Understood.

160
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,341
Who are they?

161
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,718
I don't know.

162
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,889
I just saw them hiding under the bed.

163
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,812
Who are these women?

164
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,899
Tell me!

165
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,150
Wait, sir.

166
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,611
Why did you get down? Go back!

167
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,365
It'll be a waste
if you spill it on the ground.

168
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,868
-That's food, sir.
-Shut up!

169
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,121
Pour it out! Hurry up!

170
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,518
-Hey!
-Damn!

171
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,271
Let's go before they come back.

172
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,776
Catch them!

173
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,989
They're from the province, sir.

174
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,535
They're relatives of our señora.

175
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,287
Yes, sir.

176
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,805
Let's go!

177
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,327
We already told you not to come back here!

178
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,872
I really need to speak
with Colonel Saitoh.

179
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,377
No! Leave now!

180
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,295
Get out!

181
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,050
Hold this.

182
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,890
These are real.

183
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,392
This is real gold. Gold.

184
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,727
Very expensive.

185
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,856
These are genuine pieces. Take them.

186
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,316
Take them.

187
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,783
Just let us in.

188
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,370
I need to speak to your colonel.

189
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,457
Okay, but you may go.

190
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,051
Stay here, Francisco.

191
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,552
Be careful, señora.

192
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,639
There's a devil
whose horns need to be cut off.

193
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,525
Wash our uniforms!

194
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,443
Here's more!

195
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,946
Wash those first!

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,541
You're their slave by day.

197
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,335
And their toy at night.

198
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,380
Damn this life.

199
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,431
I thought of a way for us to escape.

200
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,240
When was his corpse brought here?

201
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,368
Less than an hour ago, Colonel.

202
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,499
His face is bashed in.

203
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,420
How can we identify this corpse now?

204
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,799
They can identify him, Colonel.

205
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,552
Good morning, sir.

206
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,722
Or Colonel Saitoh.

207
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,434
Whose body is this?

208
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,103
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

209
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,480
I killed him myself.

210
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,284
And how did you kill him?

211
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,103
Forgive me, Ryo.

212
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,939
And may God forgive me

213
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,070
for what I'm about to do to your corpse.

214
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,364
But I need to do this.

215
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,579
Forgive me.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,876
Pablo.

217
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,053
We wrestled.

218
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:21,266
I got a hold of his gun
and shot him, Colonel.

219
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,393
I'm angry with guerrillas like him.

220
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,022
Their troop mistook
my eldest son for a spy

221
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,315
and killed him.

222
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:33,362
To get my revenge,
I also killed their leader.

223
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,240
And he was that man.

224
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,036
Thank you very much
for your cooperation, but…

225
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,498
how can you be so sure

226
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,418
he is Eduardo Dela Cruz?

227
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,550
I found his cedula in his pocket.

228
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,853
"Eduardo Dela Cruz."

229
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,730
There's no doubt.

230
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,649
That man is Eduardo.

231
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,197
I can finally be at peace.

232
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,578
Farewell, Eduardo Dela Cruz.

233
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,230
What are you doing here, Mrs. Borromeo?

234
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,826
What do you want to talk about?

235
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
Please be honest with me.

236
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,208
Where's Teresita?

237
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,339
Didn't I tell you that I don't--

238
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,050
I don't believe you anymore.

239
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,182
Someone already told me
you had something to do

240
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,643
with my daughter's disappearance.

241
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,561
Now tell me where Teresita is.

242
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,315
And who's the fool who told you that?

243
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,693
Can you bring that person to me?

244
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,113
If you truly had nothing to do with it,

245
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,244
why haven't you found my daughter yet?

246
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,846
Because if you're going
to keep accusing me,

247
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,141
I won't hesitate

248
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,560
to have you arrested and imprisoned

249
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,563
just like your traitorous husband.

250
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,113
Do you have any news from outside?

251
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,366
Do you know if we can still
get out of here alive?

252
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,743
I thought I'd lost you.

253
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,995
I heard you fought
with Dado's group last night.

254
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,164
Sir, we both live in this country.

255
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,665
You don't need to point a gun at me.

256
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,001
Follow that car closely.

257
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,171
-Go!
-Escaping won't be as easy as before.

258
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,923
We need to put ourselves first.

259
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,803
We can think of a way to save
those we'll leave behind later on.

260
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,432
We'll prove to you
that someone here is against us,

261
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,392
and this person will point them out.

262
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,813
Hey! Where are you going?

263
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,900
COMING UP

264
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,364
