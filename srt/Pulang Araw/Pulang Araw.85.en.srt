1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,670
<i>What did the Filipino look like?</i>

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,338
<i>He looks like a foreigner, Colonel.</i>

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>He's also very tall and handsome.</i>

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>Get out of my sight!</i>

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,972
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,058
How did Eduardo die again?

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,477
<i>Why are we still talking about him?</i>

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,440
<i>Forget about him
because he won’t be coming back.</i>

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,108
Teresita's alive.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,652
But Saitoh has her.

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,989
<i>Saitoh has taken her away
from me once more.</i>

12
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,491
<i>Even Dad went to the mountains
out of anger.</i>

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,327
<i>Let's give it up
for the newest member of our group!</i>

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,499
What makes you so sure
the Japanese are the ones

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,001
who did that to Daddy Johnny?

16
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>- Who else could it be?</i>
- What were you discussing?

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,338
Where are you taking us?

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,426
Despite our efforts,
they're abducting even more women now.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,345
<i>I have bad news. It's Daddy Johnny…</i>

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>They killed him too.</i>

21
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>I’m purging the ranks
of the workers and artists,</i>

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>- eliminating the traitors.
- Arrest Adelina at once!</i>

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,354
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>They’ve killed so many people.</i>

25
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,151
We must take up arms

26
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:12,322
and help drive away
our enemies once and for all.

27
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,948
<i>The traitor lives!</i>

28
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,951
Surrender now. You’re no match for us.

29
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>Or we’ll shoot the boy too.</i>

30
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>If you shoot him,
you’ll never know where Auntie Amalia is!</i>

31
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,834
You know where Tanaka Hiroshi is?

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,170
<i>Yes, sir. I know where he's hiding.</i>

33
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,924
<i>We're heading out to look for food.</i>

34
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,468
<i>If it's me you're after, take me.</i>

35
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,928
<i>I’m the one you need, right?</i>

36
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,222
<i>Flee the city, run far from here.</i>

37
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:41,351
I won't be able to help you
if our paths cross again.

38
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,270
<i>A Japanese officer invited us to perform</i>

39
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,439
<i>at a birthday party
of one of their officials.</i>

40
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:51,402
We don't know who else to ask
to perform for those bastards.

41
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,404
This is a good opportunity.

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,535
I’ll go with you. We’ll perform for them.

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,028
Get ready.

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,698
We're attending the birthday party
of one of my classmates

45
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,950
from the Japanese Imperial Army.

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,411
Why do you need to bring me along?

47
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,830
Just go on your own.

48
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,960
You're obligated to come with me.

49
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,963
Miyatake wants to meet you.

50
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,635
Don't embarrass me.

51
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,836
<i>So much has changed
since the war broke out.</i>

52
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,215
Here!

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,552
Over here!

54
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,847
<i>- The people. Their ambitions.</i>
- Over here!

55
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,349
<i>The world.</i>

56
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,851
<i>Everything has changed.</i>

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>But one thing remains the same.</i>

58
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:47,578
<i>Our love for our family.</i>

59
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>Love is what truly connects us all.</i>

60
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:02,343
<i>It never fades, even when paths diverge.</i>

61
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>Our departed loved ones
become our light in the darkness.</i>

62
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,188
<i>They're the reason why we stand and fight.</i>

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,201
I'll protect you no matter what,
Mr. Borromeo.

64
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,457
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

65
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,752
<i>even in the war we're in,</i>

66
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,344
<i>we still strive to succeed
for those we love.</i>

67
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,234
Mr. Borromeo?

68
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,881
Mr. Borromeo?

69
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,853
He's not here!

70
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
He's not here! I think he got away!

71
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,229
<i>Where's your brother?</i>

72
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,605
Where is he?

73
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:48,069
<i>Speak the truth,
so the bullet will take your side.</i>

74
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,072
- Answer me!
- I really don't know.

75
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,095
What is "clown" in Tagalog?

76
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>Pa… Paya…</i>

77
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,393
<i>Payaso</i>, huh?

78
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,765
Colonel.

79
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,851
Miyatake.

80
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,357
Happy birthday, my friend.

81
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,943
Thank you.

82
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,282
Comrades, this is Sergeant West.

83
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,828
He's an American
who trains our guerrilla groups.

84
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,070
Hey, you!

85
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,406
- Fix that properly!
- Yes, sir!

86
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,572
Keep laughing, you devils,

87
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
while you still can.

88
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,580
Soon, you'll be nothing but a memory.

89
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,806
Where have you been?

90
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,942
I was out looking for Luisa.

91
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,404
I still haven't found her.

92
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,408
What happened between you two?

93
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,248
How did you lose her?
You girls just disappeared like ghosts.

94
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,252
We just wanted to visit my husband.

95
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,297
Go home. We'll only get in trouble.

96
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,757
No!

97
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,343
<i>Just run away, my dear.</i>

98
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,763
- I'll go with you!
- I'll find you! I promise!

99
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,432
- Mom!
- If you don't leave this instant,

100
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,850
I'll hit you with my slipper!

101
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,310
<i>Go!</i>

102
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,564
I can't believe you were with Eduardo
this whole time.

103
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,027
If it weren't for you,
I would've killed that bastard!

104
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,532
I told you.

105
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,286
Luisa and I got scared of the Japanese.

106
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,623
That's why we fled the city.

107
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,709
But sadly, we got separated

108
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,505
because of the war.

109
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,885
Mr. Clown, your companion's here.

110
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,059
Why are you so late?

111
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,779
She's a singer and a mistress
of one of the officials.

112
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,282
I think I left my gloves in the bathroom.

113
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,788
She's also a performer.

114
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,165
Tuging and Puging
won't be able to make it.

115
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,793
They suddenly got sick.

116
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,045
It's probably for the best.

117
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,339
Colonel Saitoh is here.

118
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,509
I saw him outside.

119
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,386
Did he recognize you?

120
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,973
They have no idea

121
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,977
tonight will be
the last night of their lives.

122
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,026
What if the Japanese took her?

123
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,736
You too.

124
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,237
My God.

125
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,159
Do you know what the Japanese
do to the women they capture?

126
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,871
They imprison and rape them!

127
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,671
Let go of me!

128
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,185
What if…

129
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,231
If that were to happen to me,

130
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,235
what would you do?

131
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,573
Would you still accept me?

132
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,911
Are you kidding me?

133
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,624
Why would I accept a woman
tainted by another?

134
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,918
That's worse than being betrayed!

135
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,004
Even if I didn't want it?

136
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,973
What's wrong with you?

137
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,226
Are you crying?

138
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,402
I'm just worried about Luisa.

139
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,034
They're waiting for me outside. Excuse me.

140
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm nervous, Adelina.

141
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,595
If we fail this mission…

142
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,515
If something goes wrong…

143
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,977
we'll be in big trouble,

144
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,230
and they won't just lock us up.

145
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,528
This will surely cost us our lives.

146
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,324
We'll end up like Marcel and Daddy Johnny.

147
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,660
These people won't let us live.

148
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,792
If that happens,

149
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,421
our deaths won't be for nothing.

150
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,426
We'll die fighting, Luis.

151
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,639
We can't just accept our suffering.

152
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,393
It's nice to see you here.

153
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,438
But where's your wife?

154
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,273
Yes.

155
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,609
There she is.

156
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,529
Teresita.

157
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,745
He's the friend I told you about.

158
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:04,291
He's my former classmate,
Lieutenant Colonel Daiki Miyatake.

159
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,878
All right.

160
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,380
Enough of that.

161
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,968
Don't worry too much.

162
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,057
It's been so long
since we've been together.

163
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,853
I missed you so much!

164
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,857
Get sick of me!

165
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,817
You pigs!

166
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,319
You pig!

167
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,156
Pig! You damn pig!

168
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,619
- You pig!
- What happened to you?

169
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,247
Why have you changed so much?

170
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:52,131
Pig…

171
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,226
Lieutenant, this is my lovely wife.
Her name is Teresita.

172
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:10,190
I am pleased to meet you, Mrs. Saitoh.

173
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,071
I'm so glad you came.

174
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,534
Pleased to meet you, sir.

175
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,623
I wish you a happy birthday.

176
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,668
Thank you.

177
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,755
Looks like you taught her well, Colonel.

178
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,304
Come, let me take you to your table.

179
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,528
Everyone!

180
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,617
This is my wife, Teresita.

181
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,301
I know Eduardo and his fiancée,

182
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,761
Teresita Borromeo.

183
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:25,307
Is this why you want to keep
Eduardo locked up

184
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,476
despite his innocence?

185
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,357
I guess it would be easier for you
to claim Miss Teresita if…

186
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,235
Hey! I think you're forgetting your place.

187
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
What a liar.

188
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,044
He's indeed a wicked man.

189
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,591
<i>I'll avenge you, Mr. Borromeo.</i>

190
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,303
<i>- Who are you?
- Have our men search the forest.</i>

191
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,847
<i>The enemy might still be hiding there!</i>

192
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,349
This might be our end.

193
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,894
- Looks like there's an attack nearby.
- Anyone can come with me!

194
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,021
<i>I am the leader here.</i>

195
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,191
<i>No one can make me question my beliefs!</i>

196
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,070
<i>- Why did you change our plan?
- Wait for my signal.</i>

197
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,281
COMING UP

198
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,784
<i>Thank the heavens we met again.</i>

199
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,500
