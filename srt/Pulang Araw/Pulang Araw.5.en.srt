1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,969
Japanese cigarettes.

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,513
I'm sure the Japanese killed them.

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,223
Why would they do this?

4
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,896
Are you really asking that?

5
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,862
Do you think they have a reason for it?

6
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,075
They're monsters!

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,996
The next time I see a Japanese,
I will kill them.

8
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,278
My dear sister.

9
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,366
I am once again worried for your safety.

10
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
Evil spares no one.

11
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,124
Man or woman,
no one is safe during these times.

12
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,171
May the Lord always protect you.

13
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,427
I cannot understand why the Lord
allows evil and chaos

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,514
to exist in this world.

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,426
The Japanese might come back.

16
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,679
We don't have time to bury them.

17
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,390
They are our fellow Filipinos.

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,684
Fellow humans.

19
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,771
So it is only right
that we give them respect.

20
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,743
Eduardo!

21
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,416
Juan, what are you doing here?

22
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,169
Why did you leave Mario's parents?

23
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,796
Why did you leave me with them?

24
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,215
I've been looking for you for days.

25
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,676
It's a good thing I found you again.

26
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,932
Didn't you hear what I said before?

27
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,811
You cannot come with us.
Do you want to die?

28
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,897
I won't die.

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,149
I'm good at hiding.

30
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,736
And if anyone should die,
it's those evil Japanese.

31
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,614
Especially the ones who killed
my mother and father.

32
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,992
So don't just give me away to anyone.

33
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,828
No matter where you go,
I will always find you.

34
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:22,428
What sin has a child like Juan committed
to be orphaned at such a young age?

35
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,014
Is it because of this war?

36
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,977
I can't think of
any other reason, Adelina.

37
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,814
None, but I blame the greedy people,

38
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,234
who started this chaos and war.

39
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,116
Do you agree to my plans?

40
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,911
Are you sure about this, señorita?

41
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,373
What if your husband finds out?

42
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm sure he'll despise us.

43
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,921
I can go to jail for this.

44
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,011
No one will know if neither of us talks.

45
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,892
Make this happen tonight.

46
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,021
Just make sure no one sees you.

47
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,759
Dad.

48
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,679
Was Auntie Amalia telling the truth?

49
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,016
That my mother was a dancer on stage?

50
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,986
Didn't Filipina tell you before?

51
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,823
Mom was very secretive, Dad.

52
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,245
She never really talked about you.

53
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,081
Yes.

54
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,461
Your mother was also an excellent dancer.

55
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,800
We first met in vaudeville.

56
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:30,556
She might be the most beautiful muse
I had ever seen.

57
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,695
She had sad eyes.

58
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,367
Perhaps that's why
I fell for her so quickly.

59
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,580
A tragic woman…

60
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,127
abandoned by her first love
after getting her pregnant.

61
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,674
We became close since then.

62
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,678
And then, you came.

63
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,603
I just wanted to help her.

64
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,024
Make her happy again.

65
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:29,198
But I didn't know I'd cause her…

66
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
more pain.

67
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,000
Did you love my mom, Dad?

68
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,460
Yes.

69
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,922
I loved her very much.

70
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,217
Especially when…

71
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,762
she gave birth to you.

72
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,557
If that's the case,

73
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:01,022
why didn't you come to her wake
or even her burial?

74
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,201
And I meant not to go, dear.

75
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,830
Because…

76
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,920
I didn't want to see my Filipina…

77
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,465
lifeless.

78
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,553
I wanted to remember her…

79
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,433
alive and well.

80
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,401
So that she'll always be…

81
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,534
alive in my mind and my heart.

82
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,639
My father's tears washed away
all the pain I felt towards him.

83
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,644
I understood then that my father
truly loved my mother.

84
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,925
Papa.

85
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,346
Why are there constables here?

86
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,069
What can I do for you?

87
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,239
They have bad news.
They've been waiting for you.

88
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,327
May I know why you're here?

89
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,455
It saddens me to inform you
that your theater burned down last night,

90
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,791
but we have yet to find the cause.

91
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,465
I'm glad it burned down.

92
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:19,303
Now, your father won't be able
to find another mistress.

93
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,391
Teresi--

94
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,245
We're already investigating
if this was intentional or not.

95
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,205
We will look into this matter thoroughly.

96
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,706
We'll go ahead.

97
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,269
Dad…

98
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,051
Ten years before
the Japanese invaders arrived,

99
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,183
my father already died in the war of life.

100
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,726
Dad!

101
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,837
Dad…

102
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,052
No.

103
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,638
Tell your father, Teresita,

104
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:55,185
that I cannot allow him to sell the lands
I inherited from my ancestors!

105
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,271
But I am your husband.

106
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,066
Whatever you have is mine too.

107
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,195
Where are the titles? The documents?
Where did you hide them?

108
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,823
He won't get anything from me.

109
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,080
Carmela, I'm begging you.

110
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,459
This is also for our livelihood.

111
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,131
The cost of rebuilding
the theater is no joke.

112
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,385
That's why I really need your help.

113
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,359
Carmela.

114
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm begging you.

115
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,113
Show some mercy.

116
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,456
This is the only livelihood I know.

117
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,127
I gave my whole life and heart

118
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,464
to my art.

119
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,134
And I know you understand that.

120
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,641
Have pity on me. Help me save the theater.

121
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,352
Carmela.

122
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,797
I hope you can help me.

123
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,645
It's a hefty sum,
and I don't have that amount of money.

124
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,377
Teresita, it's Hiroshi.

125
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,238
Teresita, I can't speak English very well.

126
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,739
You talk to him.

127
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,733
Thank you very much.

128
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:14,838
That night, a deeper admiration
for this foreigner grew in me.

129
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,801
Just like my brother Eduardo,
he also had a good heart.

130
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,771
Teresita!

131
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,232
Dad is over there.

132
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,362
Papa!

133
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,158
Dad.

134
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,037
The Lord has answered
our prayers of aid for you.

135
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,833
Aid?

136
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,169
What aid?

137
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,630
Hiroshi came here.

138
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,385
He wanted to give you some money,
including his necklace.

139
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,179
Isn't he very kind, Dad?

140
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,976
With this huge amount,
you can build your theater again.

141
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,893
Right, Teresita?

142
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,865
You're really…

143
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,037
You're really still naive.

144
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,963
This meager amount is not enough!

145
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,137
Dad…

146
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,472
Leave me alone for now.

147
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
I want to be alone.

148
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:28,472
Since that day,
my father's hope and vigor never returned.

149
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:34,853
It seems my father also died
when his theater burned down.

150
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,589
Come. Come here.

151
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,509
Hide here.

152
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,669
Look out! Another troop
has arrived on our right!

153
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,931
Eduardo, I think we're going to die here.

154
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,183
They have us surrounded.

155
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,276
Fortunato!

156
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,119
Adelina, my dearest sister.

157
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,331
It looks like my wish will not be granted.

158
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,751
We may not be able
to see each other again.

159
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,611
I promise we will work hard,

160
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:53,200
so we can rebuild Papa's theater one day.

161
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,744
COMING UP

162
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,084
Oh, my! Is that all you can show me?

163
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,629
You're just copycats of Katy Dela Cruz.

164
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:11,718
Within ten hours, the war in Hawaii
will reach the Philippines.
