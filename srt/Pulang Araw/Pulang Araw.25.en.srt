1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,253
"I love Adelina"?

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,629
Really?

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,214
Ouch!

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,258
I know why he kissed you.

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,010
-Can't we just forget about…
-Hiroshi loves you too!

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,514
Why are you still here?
Aren't you suspended?

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,642
I'd like to hand over
my resignation letter.

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,102
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,854
Where is the colonel?

10
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,272
We've been looking for him.

11
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,151
Perhaps, he continued his plan to leave.

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,696
To monitor the situation outside.

13
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,492
Our air force will soon be flying here
to the Philippines, Lieutenant Colonel.

14
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,828
What wonderful news.

15
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:43,001
Now, I am ready to slaughter
the American and Filipino enemies.

16
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,420
I accept and support your marriage.

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,549
-I have no objections…
-How can I marry him when he loves you?

18
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,384
I'm calling off the wedding.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,344
I will withdraw from the agreement myself.

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,472
Aren't you going to marry her?

21
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,725
I would rather die with honor
than die a liar.

22
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,060
We need to protect you.

23
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,441
You scared me, Chikara.
I thought you were going to shoot him.

24
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,568
My sister loves you.

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,362
And please don't think you will die here.

26
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,697
Thank you, my friend.

27
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,765
I know why he kissed you.

28
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,560
-Can't we just forget about…
-Hiroshi loves you too!

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,770
I will withdraw from the agreement myself.

30
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,022
But what about Dad's property?

31
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,609
Would you let the Tanakas take it back
and Dad get hurt again?

32
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,444
What about you and Hiroshi?

33
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:38,032
We both know
I'm not marrying him out of love.

34
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,383
Come on. I thought
we were leaving, Eduardo.

35
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,720
You can go if you want.

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,308
My friend.

37
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,061
Aren't you being too protective
of our boss?

38
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,901
What will you do once the constabulary
arrives and takes them away?

39
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:20,033
And didn't you say Hiroshi warned you
that someone wants to kill you?

40
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,744
What if they come here,
find you, and kill you?

41
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,912
What will you do then?

42
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,789
If that's the case, then so be it.

43
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,834
Teresita won't cry for me, anyway.

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,253
What about your sister?

45
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,589
Hiroshi asked me a favor.

46
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,383
I cannot just abandon

47
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,595
the parents of Teresita's husband-to-be.

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,638
I'm staying here.

49
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,892
Suit yourself.

50
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,561
Your love is something else.

51
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,564
Poor you.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,373
Papa.

53
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,000
Aren't we going to see your friend?

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,504
I thought you said
he could help us with Hiroshi.

55
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,243
A constable gave this to me.

56
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,204
Out of pity.

57
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,999
Let's share it.

58
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,667
Here.

59
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,921
-Here.
-Thank you very much.

60
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,006
No problem.

61
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,179
Yuki. You should eat.

62
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,022
Everyone, gather round.

63
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,316
Let us share this bread.

64
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,527
Here you go.

65
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,447
Here you go. Go on.

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,781
Here you go.

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
Here you go.

68
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,203
Here you go.

69
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,650
Here. Please eat.

70
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,907
Something to fill your stomach.

71
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,330
Thank you.

72
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,165
When we get out of here,

73
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,961
I will take my family to Tom's Dixie.

74
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,757
I will order delicious food
no matter the cost.

75
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:30,223
Brother, I will cook ramen
for the two of us.

76
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,227
Just thinking about it
makes my mouth water.

77
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,563
Indeed.

78
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,691
And you, sir?

79
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,197
What will you do once we get out of here?

80
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,825
I will go to Adelina.

81
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,831
I will embrace her tightly
and never let her go again.

82
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,042
That's the first thing I will do.

83
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,546
For you and your Adelina?

84
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,321
General…

85
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,032
MacArthur.

86
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,327
You're so weak!

87
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,140
It is to our army's advantage

88
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,769
that General MacArthur is indecisive.

89
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,783
At this very moment,

90
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,204
our brave air force

91
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:21,834
is on its way to this country.

92
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,233
Forgive me for interrupting,
Lieutenant Colonel.

93
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:51,030
But let's wait for our colonel to return
before you decide.

94
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,536
When will he return?

95
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,789
Our time is running out.

96
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,085
Does he want the war to reach us here

97
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,796
and we're just standing around?

98
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,719
-Gather round!
-Yes, sir!

99
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,931
Allow me to share
our next course of action.

100
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,780
The Japanese are no longer in this house.
The constabulary has taken them.

101
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,701
-If that's true, why won't you let us in?
-Of course.

102
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,537
I'm the caretaker here,

103
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,207
so I can't just leave
my master's house unattended.

104
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,336
Comrades, we are fellow countrymen.

105
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,009
So please, leave at once
instead of causing more trouble.

106
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,428
Let's go, everyone.

107
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,308
That's right.

108
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,227
My Lord.

109
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,521
I almost peed my pants.

110
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,191
-Uncle.
-Eduardo.

111
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,277
You're still here?

112
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,740
Well, Eduardo wouldn't leave our boss.

113
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,576
I'm already so hungry, I'm going to faint.

114
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,870
If that's the case, then go home.

115
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,581
My friends and I
will take care of this place.

116
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,374
No need, Uncle.

117
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,253
We can handle it.
I don't want to bother anyone else.

118
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,005
He's not just anybody. He's your uncle.

119
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,965
Come on, I'm getting really hungry.

120
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,969
Son, trust me.

121
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,014
I won't neglect your masters.

122
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,644
Even if it means dying here,
I won't just surrender them.

123
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,520
You see?

124
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,400
-You better get going.
-Let's go.

125
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,737
Let's go. We'll be back soon.

126
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,865
I'm really hungry. Let's go.

127
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,992
Thank you.

128
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,702
-Take care.
-We will.

129
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,296
This is the house I was talking about.

130
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,840
The Japanese couple are inside.

131
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,843
I'm sure we will get a lot from this.

132
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
I'm sorry, Julio.

133
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,107
But I can't help you with Hiroshi.

134
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,656
But Hiroshi is innocent

135
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,036
I understand, dear.

136
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,457
DR. JUAN G. NOLASCO
MAYOR OF MANILA

137
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,418
But, mayor…

138
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,675
Mayor, they're in a terrible place now.

139
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,761
We also need medical treatment for…

140
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,141
my sister's fiancé.

141
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,103
He was hurt before he was arrested.

142
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,982
Give me the full name of this Hiroshi
and the camp he's in.

143
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,527
I will immediately send for
a doctor to treat him.

144
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,905
That's all I can do for now.

145
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,076
We will accept it, mayor.

146
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,370
Thank you very much.

147
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,746
Eduardo!

148
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,751
-Adelina.
-I thought you were at the Tanakas.

149
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,129
Uncle Lauro is there now.

150
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,131
He and his friends
are watching over the couple.

151
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,300
Have you found Hiroshi?

152
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,263
He's in Intramuros, Eduardo.

153
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,183
Inside the American camp.

154
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,477
I'm glad you found him.

155
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,606
How was he, Teresita?

156
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,609
Are you heading home?

157
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,905
Why don't you ride with us?
So we can tell you what happened.

158
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,701
Move over a bit, Adelina. Give them space.

159
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,080
No, it's okay, Uncle.
Our place is not that far.

160
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,291
-We'll just walk, you go ahead.
-Eduardo, get in.

161
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,544
I said, we're fine.

162
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,463
We'll be off. Take care.

163
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,896
Are you still upset with Teresita?

164
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,401
I guess she really had your hopes up, huh?

165
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,245
Unbelievable.

166
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,080
What are we going to tell the Tanakas?

167
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,125
That we couldn't do anything
to free Hiroshi?

168
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,006
Why aren't you eating? Aren't you hungry?

169
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,385
Then again, who can eat peacefully
at a time like this?

170
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
I know.

171
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,187
Teresita, get ready.
We will go to the Tanakas.

172
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,648
I want to know how they're doing.

173
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,567
The wedding's off, Mama.

174
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,196
I'm backing out.

175
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,536
What nonsense is this, my dear?

176
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,788
She's just joking, señora.

177
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,167
Teresita, I've decided, haven't I?

178
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,836
What decision?

179
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
Why are you deciding for her?

180
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,592
Adelina has nothing to do
with my decision, Mama.

181
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,930
I changed my mind.

182
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
I hope you and Papa can forgive me.

183
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,398
Come here. Talk to me!

184
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,611
Don't force her anymore, Carmela.

185
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,240
I agree with our daughter's decision.

186
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,952
There will be no wedding.

187
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:02,127
No child of mine will sacrifice
their happiness for me.

188
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,555
The theater will mean nothing

189
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,142
if you sacrifice yourselves for it.

190
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,188
Please, Carmela.

191
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,774
I beg you.

192
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,152
Don't hope for this wedding
to push through.

193
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,570
I won't have it.

194
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,129
We already had an agreement.

195
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,674
Are you prepared to sever
our friendship with them?

196
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,302
-That's what I told Teresita.
-Enough, Adelina!

197
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,764
Don't force Hiroshi on me!

198
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,726
My decision is final!

199
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,980
The wedding is canceled!

200
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,026
Does honor mean nothing to you?

201
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,779
Our friendship with their family
will be ruined!

202
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,365
Do you think I will allow this?

203
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,575
Carmela!

204
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,413
Are we really going to prioritize
our shame, all those other people,

205
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,291
over the happiness of my children?

206
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,918
I don't care about your bastard child!

207
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,170
I have decided!

208
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,882
This conversation is over!

209
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,718
There will be no wedding!

210
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,441
Our message has been sent.

211
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,780
Good. Thank you.

212
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,043
They're here.

213
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,384
Our army has arrived.

214
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,731
Adelina.

215
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,988
That was loud.

216
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,700
Where did that come from?

217
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,633
Dad, look!

218
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,469
Where is that smoke coming from?

219
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,432
God.

220
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,184
What is happening?

221
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,436
God Almighty.

222
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,231
The war has reached our country.

223
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,520
I'm scared, Hiroshi.

224
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,275
I'm sure we'll be blamed
for what's happening.

225
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,542
You are so evil, Uncle.

226
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,878
I know what you did
at the house of the Tanakas.

227
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,507
You and your friends.
You broke into their home and robbed them.

228
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,303
Perhaps, it is better
to let Adelina talk to Hiroshi.

229
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,807
COMING UP

230
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,559
Even if Adelina and Hiroshi
are really the ones in love?

231
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,477
Be quiet!

232
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,521
Our country is already at war.

233
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,066
Don't tell me we're at war
in this house too.

234
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,944
I don't care if I get beaten up or die.

235
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,445
I will avenge my mother.

236
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,949
How did you know this country
would be in danger, Hiroshi?

237
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,243
Is it because of your father's friends?

238
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,245
Or is it because of your father himself?

239
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,623
Would you dare betray
the people precious to you?

240
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,875
Hiroshi, what is the truth?

241
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,919
Are you really a friend,

242
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,671
or are you one of our enemies?

243
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:54,057
