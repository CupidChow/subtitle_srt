1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,211
Do you still remember the lot

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:06,172
where your father's
burned-down theater is?

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,091
What does that have to do with Mr. Tanaka?

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm going to sell that lot to him.

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,678
Are you married?

6
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,096
No, ma'am.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,473
I will have him marry my Teresita.

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,519
I will rebuild my theater right away.
I'll take you back from Johnny.

9
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,857
Dad, we no longer own the lot
the theater stood on.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,485
You sold my lot and theater?

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,362
You should have just killed me!

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,032
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,786
Teresita Borromeo?

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,913
I will marry her to my son.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,709
They won't have a choice
but to side with us and cooperate.

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,336
You made arrangements to marry off
our daughter to those Japanese?

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,924
I won't agree to marry her off
to someone she doesn't love.

18
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,094
Fulfill your dreams
from when we were children.

19
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,929
Didn't you want to be a doctor?

20
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,433
-I will fight in life. I promise.
-I want to give him my heart.

21
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,351
I'm sure that boy must be so happy.

22
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,605
Get dressed.
Our guests will be arriving shortly.

23
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,691
Finally! We're reunited again!

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,235
Let's go upstairs, so we can talk.

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,862
Don't follow.

26
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,614
Stay here, Adelina.

27
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,033
-I'll stay here with…
-No.

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,161
I need you there. Let's go.

29
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,267
Teresita, choose whatever you like.

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,852
I'll have this one, Mama.

31
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,741
-Hiroshi, give these to them.
-All right.

32
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,273
Hiroshi.

33
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,193
But before we drink the sake…

34
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,238
Mr. Tanaka.

35
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,910
I think it's time to tell the kids
about our agreement.

36
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,078
-You are right.
-Yes.

37
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,542
You tell them, Carmela.

38
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,590
Mrs. Borromeo, what is this agreement?

39
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,009
Hiroshi.

40
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,680
Your father…

41
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,350
and your mother, Teresita…

42
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,311
want you to marry each other.

43
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,772
What?

44
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,493
This is the reason

45
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,371
why we're gathered here today.

46
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,042
But, forgive me for saying…

47
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,294
Mr. Tanaka.

48
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:20,426
But I won't let my daughter marry
a man she doesn't love.

49
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,850
So, Hiroshi…

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,312
Mr. Tanaka, you may leave.

51
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,773
This gathering is over.

52
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,818
-Let's go, Teresita.
-Wait, Julio.

53
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,695
Enough, Mama.

54
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,741
The head of our family has decided,
and we must respect that.

55
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,995
I will not marry Hiroshi.

56
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,166
I agree, Teresita.

57
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:03,219
But, Julio, Mr. Tanaka is willing
to return to us,

58
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,848
to you, the land
where your burned-down theater is,

59
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,685
if you agree for our children to marry.

60
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,377
Mr. Tanaka, please.

61
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,597
Please, Mr. Tanaka.

62
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
Dad.

63
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,482
Don't try to impress them
with such things.

64
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,441
Silence!

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,945
It will be embarrassing for us
if they back out.

66
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,325
Consider the dowry
they're offering, Julio.

67
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,581
Dad…

68
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,418
Mr. Tanaka.

69
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,593
But I cannot trade Teresita's freedom.

70
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,137
Thank You, God Almighty.

71
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,728
Are you out of your mind, Julio?

72
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,357
Will you really let go of the chance
to reclaim that property?

73
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,361
I endured for ten years!

74
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,322
Being away from my daughters

75
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,119
to save up money and rebuild my theater.

76
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:57,333
I wasn't here to see Teresita
and Adelina grow up in those ten years!

77
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,293
And this is what I come home to?

78
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,881
You sold my land and theater?

79
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,759
My only legacy for my children?

80
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,553
You should have just killed me!

81
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,681
Yes, Carmela, you're right.

82
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,183
But not at the expense of my daughter.

83
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,860
Mr. Tanaka, I want to reclaim my land…

84
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,546
In that case,
I won't agree to this wedding.

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,298
You've embarrassed us enough!

86
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,735
Are you out of your mind, Julio?

87
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,362
Our friendship with the Tanakas
will be ruined,

88
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,823
and you will never get back your land!

89
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,998
Mr. Tanaka!

90
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,459
Hiroshi…

91
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,389
Please come back.

92
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,402
Teresita.

93
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,697
Why are you asking them to come back?

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,825
Hiroshi, it's okay.

95
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,578
-You can go home.
-Be quiet, Adelina!

96
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,875
Teresita.

97
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,129
Adelina.

98
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,094
We know how important
that land is to our father.

99
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,432
That's where his heart is.

100
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,979
It's his soul.

101
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,026
So I'm agreeing to it.

102
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,823
I will marry Hiroshi.

103
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,705
In exchange for my father's land.

104
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,264
Teresita.

105
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,100
You made the right decision.

106
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,353
Thank you, my dear.

107
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,612
But…

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,616
didn't you tell me something earlier?

109
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,995
Haven't you promised yourself
to someone else?

110
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,081
Remember?

111
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,919
If I go back to school,

112
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
will you wait for me?

113
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,051
Forget I asked.

114
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,470
-I know…
-I'll wait for you.

115
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,430
Really?

116
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,557
I'll wait for you

117
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,018
no matter what happens.

118
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,156
Think carefully
about your decision, Teresita.

119
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,410
And don't hurt other people.

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,622
Who is she referring to, Teresita?

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,879
It's impossible
that you're seeing another man, right?

122
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,258
Excuse me, Mrs. Borromeo.

123
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,220
But let's not force Teresita.

124
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,181
No, Hiroshi.

125
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,266
I'm just trying to
reason with my daughter.

126
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,478
Who is more important to you?

127
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,898
Those other people or your father?

128
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,778
Don't use me
against our daughter, Carmela.

129
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,909
I accept this agreement.

130
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,664
I just want our land back…

131
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,499
for my father.

132
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,010
Teresita, listen to me.

133
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,890
I know the land is important to us…

134
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,436
especially to Dad.

135
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,899
But even so, it's just a piece of land.

136
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:20,030
It's not right to sacrifice yourself
just for that.

137
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,452
Adelina.

138
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,664
Try to put yourself in my shoes.

139
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,044
I have the opportunity
to return to our father

140
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,797
the land he cherishes the most.

141
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,551
When it was destroyed by the fire,

142
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,139
we witnessed how our father
was devastated by it…

143
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,144
when we were children, and even now…

144
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,065
Wouldn't you sacrifice yourself

145
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,361
in exchange for our father's happiness?

146
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,790
Here's a list of the documents you need.

147
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,585
Proof that you completed
intermediate school.

148
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,505
Thank you, sir.

149
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,757
I will gather all these immediately.

150
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,802
When can I go back to enroll?

151
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,473
You must pass the test first.

152
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,727
Here are the test papers and a pencil.

153
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,939
Let's go over there.

154
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,955
My dear.

155
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,791
You don't have to choose me.

156
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,341
I have decided, Papa.

157
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,595
Mr. Tanaka.

158
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,268
I'm agreeing to this marriage.

159
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,026
You make me so proud, my dear.

160
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,856
Adelina.

161
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,084
Sir, I stopped going to school
a long time ago.

162
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,213
I'm out of practice. Can I just…

163
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,842
come back another day to take the exam?

164
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,428
I need to review my old books.

165
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,890
To be honest,
I shouldn't have given you a chance.

166
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,018
We finished giving the exams last month.

167
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,355
I only felt sorry for you

168
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,149
because I was like you.

169
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
I was a little older
when I started college.

170
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,197
So if you really want to study,

171
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,115
answer and pass the exam today.

172
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,577
Have you changed your mind already?

173
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,249
No, sir. I will answer and finish it.

174
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,544
I'll leave you to it.

175
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,181
God Almighty.

176
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,142
This test is so difficult.

177
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,109
God Almighty.

178
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
Guide me.

179
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,990
Please help me pass this test.

180
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,742
Have mercy on me.

181
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,414
This is for my future

182
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,624
with Teresita.

183
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,836
Thank you. Amen.

184
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:09,570
My dear, I know you'll resent me
because you accepted this agreement.

185
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:20,289
But everybody goes through
arranged marriages, my dear.

186
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,254
This is a good tradition among our kind.

187
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,925
The union of two affluent families,

188
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,305
so we can work together
to unite our livelihoods

189
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,223
and our businesses.

190
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,100
Enough with your excuses, Carmela.

191
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,352
You got what you wanted.

192
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's end this conversation.

193
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,275
Shall we?

194
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,394
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

195
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,856
Cheers.

196
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,196
-Adelina?
-It's really you, Hiroshi!

197
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,035
I bought that
because I remembered someone.

198
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,373
I will never forget
the happy moments of our childhood.

199
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,965
Goodbye, Hiroshi.

200
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,992
Lieutenant Colonel Saitoh.

201
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,704
Welcome!

202
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,415
This way.

203
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,967
Please get in.

204
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,316
Start the car.

205
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,198
Let's go.

206
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:36,832
I cannot wait to invade
this American-allied country.

207
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,306
Teresita, if you're in love
with someone else,

208
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,642
you should not sacrifice yourself.

209
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,270
The person you need
to be concerned about is my brother

210
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,981
-because he will be hurt the most.
-Mama!

211
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,234
Why don't we have Adelina
marry Hiroshi instead?

212
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,405
What use is a bastard to the Tanakas, huh?

213
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,615
-I'm in love with someone else.
-Who is it?

214
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,826
Teresita's sister.

215
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,203
I would like to know her better.

216
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,501
You're like a protruding nail
that can be easily hammered.

217
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:26,089
Just like someone who will turn his back
on his family, country, and Emperor.

218
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,802
COMING UP

219
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,767
