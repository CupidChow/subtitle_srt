1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,005
Colonel Arata will not leave us
all of a sudden.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,257
I think something bad happened to him.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,052
And you suspect
the lieutenant colonel is behind it?

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,347
The foul odor is coming from here,
Lieutenant Colonel.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,641
There's already chaos outside,

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,353
and yet here you are slacking off.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,022
Eduardo, what's wrong with you?

8
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,190
I'm sorry, Hiroshi.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,693
Your father was arrested earlier.

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,736
He's not here, sir.

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,155
I feel at ease knowing he is safe.

12
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,740
Along with my mother.

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,283
Your mother is gone.

14
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,743
She passed away.

15
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,244
She died earlier.

16
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,372
-Who killed my mother?
-It was Uncle Lauro.

17
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,665
My uncle.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,334
I trusted you!

19
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,920
But I didn't think
you would be one to betray them.

20
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,465
-I didn't want this to happen.
-Leave.

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,425
I don't want to see you right now.

22
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,095
Day and night, they keep attacking us.

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,473
We're truly helpless against the Japanese.

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:01,561
We're also helpless against the conflicts
coming into our lives and relationships.

25
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,064
I don't care if I get beaten up or die.

26
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,234
I will avenge my mother.

27
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,612
PREVIOUSLY

28
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,364
Really?

29
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,783
Hiroshi got mad at my brother?

30
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,703
You can't blame him.

31
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,081
Lauro is your uncle.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
Let's just understand Hiroshi.

33
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,922
He was probably shocked by what happened.

34
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,177
But Eduardo did nothing wrong.

35
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,100
I hope Eduardo is doing okay.

36
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm sure his guilt is eating him up.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,397
That's true.

38
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,859
I also feel bad for Eduardo.

39
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,718
Sir Julio is right.

40
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,138
Forget about Hiroshi.
Don't think about it too much.

41
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,016
What's important is your Uncle Lauro
is behind bars now,

42
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,226
and you didn't let him get away
with what he did.

43
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,272
I hope Hiroshi understands that as well.

44
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,400
Eduardo?

45
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,777
Anyone home?

46
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,571
It's me, Meding!

47
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,907
Eduardo?

48
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,078
It's you.

49
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,792
Señorita, I'll just wait downstairs.

50
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,796
Please don't take long,
your parents might look for you.

51
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,174
Yes, thank you.

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,866
You should come inside.

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,327
I won't be staying long.

54
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,122
I wanted to see how you're doing.

55
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,959
Why?

56
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,378
Papa told us…

57
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,298
what happened when you met with Hiroshi.

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,219
Are you going to hate me
since your fiancé is mad at me?

59
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,847
Eduardo, please let me talk first.

60
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,684
I just wanted to calm you.

61
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,394
Adelina is worried about you.

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,524
We don't want you to blame yourself
because you did nothing wrong.

63
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,903
That's all I wanted to say,
that's why I came here.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,408
I'm sorry if I spoke out of line.

65
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,327
Can you…

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,498
explain what happened to Hiroshi
when you meet him?

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,589
I think you should go now.

68
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,384
Before anyone sees you here
and gets the wrong idea.

69
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,179
It wouldn't be proper for you
to be seen with me.

70
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,560
So Adelina hasn't told you.

71
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,355
There will be no wedding.

72
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,443
What?

73
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,572
Why?

74
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,408
I thought you wanted me to go home.

75
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,828
I see no reason to explain any further.

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,915
Teresita, wait!

77
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,958
What…

78
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,222
I can't believe it.

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,685
Something good came out
of everything that happened.

80
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,357
Thank you for this early
Christmas gift, my God.

81
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,685
Why are you looking at me like that?

82
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,147
Yamada, you're right.

83
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,777
My only allies right now are my own kin.

84
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,489
So I need your help.

85
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,158
Help?

86
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,540
With what?

87
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,317
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,736
What do you want?

89
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,406
My stomach hurts.

90
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,867
What?

91
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,455
My stomach hurts,
I need to use the restroom.

92
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,582
Unbelievable. Can't that wait?

93
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,085
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,878
Come here!

95
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,746
Make it quick.

96
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,164
Thank you very much.

97
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,138
Thank you very much for your help.

98
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,682
Be quiet and carry on with your plan.

99
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,705
I don't want to hear about
America's arrogance anymore.

100
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,001
Everyone.

101
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,295
Get some rest.

102
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,635
Lieutenant Colonel,
why hasn't our colonel returned yet?

103
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,639
Could it be that he has been captured
by the enemies?

104
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:45,728
Lieutenant Colonel, aren't you
going to order us to look for the colonel?

105
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,565
They're right, Lieutenant Colonel.

106
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,154
We need to find out
what happened to our colonel.

107
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,626
There's chaos outside.

108
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,714
I won't let any of you

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,093
go out and look for him.

110
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,678
Not a single one!

111
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,935
You need to rest and gather your strength

112
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,689
while we wait for
our entire army to arrive!

113
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,621
Why doesn't he want to send someone

114
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,834
to search for our colonel?

115
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,756
Because there might be no one to look for.

116
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,804
It could be possible that our colonel

117
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,058
has been killed by our lieutenant colonel.

118
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,602
Captain.

119
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,187
How can you be sure of this?

120
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,764
I hope he doesn't get discovered.

121
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,768
But where did he get his clothes?

122
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,899
Hey, where are you going?

123
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,699
I said, where are you going?

124
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,489
Damn it! Answer my question!

125
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,289
I'm just getting some fresh air,
my friend.

126
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
I'll also get food for us.

127
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,460
All right, but be quick.

128
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,972
Captain, hurry up.

129
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,485
There are no dead animals
or people around here.

130
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:08,616
Your suspicions about
our lieutenant colonel could be wrong.

131
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,410
He has nothing to do
with the disappearance of our colonel.

132
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,287
Be quiet.

133
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,335
Captain, let's stop this.

134
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,921
We might catch
the attention of our enemies.

135
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,963
Let's leave now.

136
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,818
What?

137
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,946
You attacked a constable?

138
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,744
Serves him right. They're animals.

139
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,831
Are you insane?

140
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,918
What if he wakes up?

141
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,505
You'll drag all of us
into this mess you've made.

142
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,851
Reyes!

143
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,186
Reyes, wake up!

144
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,896
-Reyes!
-Reyes, what happened?

145
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,523
Why are you lying down there?

146
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,276
There were prisoners
who attacked me and took my uniform!

147
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,737
Damn it! Someone got away!

148
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,947
Find them!

149
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,039
Who is it?

150
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,750
Which one? Identify them!

151
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,210
-This one!
-Him?

152
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,504
-This guy beat me up!
-Take him!

153
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,675
Let me go! Let me go!

154
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,185
Who is it?

155
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,980
Who did you help escape? What's his name?

156
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,325
It's Eduardo's friend!

157
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,662
Hiroshi is the one who escaped!

158
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,671
Who killed my mother?

159
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,757
It was Uncle Lauro. My uncle.

160
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,814
There he is.

161
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,239
Dado, what do you want?

162
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,074
Why are you here?

163
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,664
Even if you search our home,

164
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,333
you will not find Hiroshi here.

165
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,379
Why are you looking for Hiroshi?

166
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,215
He said he escaped early this morning.

167
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,133
They haven't found him yet.

168
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,220
Would you like to go inside our home?

169
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,057
I can guarantee you
that you won't find anything here.

170
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,936
There's no need for that.
But if that Japanese shows himself,

171
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,230
notify our station right away.

172
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,987
One moment, Dado.

173
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,866
What crime did Hiroshi do,
as well as the other Japanese civilians

174
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,161
for you to treat them like criminals?

175
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,498
Nothing, right?

176
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
They just happened to be Japanese.

177
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,919
But is that all, Dado?

178
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,341
For you to think
they're a danger to everyone?

179
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:46,013
Adelina, I don't have time
to argue about an order I did not make.

180
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,141
It was the Commonwealth government.

181
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
So I bid you all goodbye.

182
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,354
Be careful, son.

183
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,450
Be careful with your words, Adelina.
It might put you in danger.

184
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,909
Why, Eduardo?

185
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,454
What do you want me to do?

186
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,123
To stay silent
while these injustices are happening?

187
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,877
You don't need to stay silent,
but be careful, my dear.

188
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:21,048
You cannot win every battle.

189
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,553
Especially when it involves the law
or an order from our leaders.

190
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,181
Don't scold Adelina anymore.

191
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,517
She was right to ask Dado those questions.

192
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,938
I can't blame Hiroshi for escaping.

193
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:42,319
I just don't know if I should worry
or be happy with what he did.

194
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,946
Where could he be right now, Teresita?

195
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,908
Let's not talk about him here.

196
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,576
Francisco!

197
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,871
-Get the car.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,333
Eduardo, you should come with us.

199
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,877
Today is the funeral of your boss' wife.

200
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,378
All right, Uncle.

201
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,798
Let's go.

202
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,943
Here come the Japanese planes again.

203
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,028
No, those are American warplanes.

204
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,906
Good thing America
still hasn't abandoned us.

205
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,824
I hope they succeed.

206
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,994
Due to our coordinated attacks yesterday,

207
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,124
the strength of the American Far East
Air Force was cut in half.

208
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,793
Our superiority in the air
has been established.

209
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,754
I suspect that Hiroshi's father
is a spy for the Japanese army.

210
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,840
If Eduardo's suspicion is correct,

211
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,176
shouldn't you forget
about your feelings for Hiroshi?

212
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,970
I am Hiroshi Tanaka.

213
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,933
I'm ready to offer my life and service
for the sake of Japan's glory.

214
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,601
Long live the Emperor!

215
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,311
-Long live!
-Long live!

216
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,604
COMING UP

217
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,736
