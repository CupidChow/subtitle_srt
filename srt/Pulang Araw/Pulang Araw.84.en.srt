1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,335
You fools!

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>What did the Filipino look like?</i>

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>He looks like a foreigner, Colonel.</i>

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,136
<i>He's also very tall and handsome.</i>

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,263
<i>Stay with friends or relatives for now.</i>

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,514
<i>But what about Teresita?</i>

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,392
- What's her last name?
- Borromeo, sir.

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>She's a former vaudeville actress.</i>

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:23,064
- Where are you taking me now?
- To a safer place.

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,941
<i>Just get in the car.</i>

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,902
<i>- I have to go back for her.
- Sir!</i>

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>If you want to join us,
I want to see how you fight.</i>

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,788
Nakamura. How did I get here?

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,915
Apparently, a woman helped you get here.

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,169
But the nurses don't know who she is.

16
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,547
I really don't know.

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,594
Daddy Johnny? Sir!

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,555
If you won't take me in, just let me go.

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,767
Let's give it up
for the newest member of our group!

20
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>We need to reach the cemetery, Juan.</i>

21
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>Hiroshi or Adelina might show up.</i>

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>- Eduardo!
- Adelina?</i>

23
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>How did Eduardo die again?</i>

24
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>Why are we still talking about him?</i>

25
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>Forget about him
because he won't be coming back.</i>

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,500
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,255
Didn't I tell you before?
Stop refusing me.

28
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,800
Understand?

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,219
Are you headed to the cemetery?

30
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,637
I've already been there.

31
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,098
Initially, I thought no one would come.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,475
That I'd be waiting there all alone.

33
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,144
Adelina, I saw her.

34
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,314
Teresita's alive.

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,861
But Saitoh has her.

36
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,492
Where did you see them?

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,454
At an abandoned garrison.

38
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,958
I guess the Colonel got scared
because I broke in…

39
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,461
and freed the women they've imprisoned.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,549
If only I knew that Teresita was there,

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,094
I never would've left without her.

42
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,471
But it's too late.

43
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,349
She's gone.

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,187
Saitoh has taken her away
from me once more.

45
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,107
Enough, Eduardo.

46
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,526
Don't blame yourself.

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,828
Colonel.

48
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,916
Any news, Lieutenant?

49
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:34,047
I'm here to tell you that I'm purging
the ranks of the workers and artists,

50
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,716
eliminating the traitors among them.

51
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,054
Does that mean
you've also captured Adelina Dela Cruz?

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,765
I already knew

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,101
Saitoh took her from us.

54
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,812
But we couldn't do anything.

55
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,816
Even Dad went to the mountains
out of anger.

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,365
But I still believe that one day,

57
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,159
Saitoh will be punished.

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,454
I'll be the one to make him pay.

59
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,666
I'll make sure

60
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,710
he'll face judgment in my hands.

61
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,425
Who is Adelina Dela Cruz?

62
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,719
She's an ally of Marcelo.

63
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,305
They're good friends.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,018
I'm sure she's in on it
since her late brother is a guerilla

65
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,855
and her lover is a traitor to our forces.

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,193
You must arrest Adelina at once.

67
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,152
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,918
Sir, we need to go back now.

69
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,547
Let us take you home.

70
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,009
There's no need. Don't worry about me.

71
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,596
There's just one more thing
you need to know.

72
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,266
Tasyo is alive.

73
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,644
And just like you,
he's also fighting back.

74
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,524
Tasyo?

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,067
Is that true?

76
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,113
Sir, we have to go now.

77
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,621
In God's time, you will see him again.

78
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,458
Take care, Eduardo.

79
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,172
You too, Adelina.

80
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,804
Goodbye. Let's go, Juan.

81
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,787
Adelina.

82
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
I guess Tugo and I got lucky.

83
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,940
I mean, Tuging.

84
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,067
They didn't try to hurt us.

85
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,362
Unlike Marcel and Daddy Johnny.

86
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,198
Puging.

87
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,326
What makes you so sure
the Japanese are the ones

88
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,246
who did that to Daddy Johnny?

89
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,455
Who else could it be?

90
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,207
Good evening.

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,335
What were you discussing?

92
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,672
You guys tell her.

93
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,467
- You tell her.
- Please.

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,483
Where are you taking us?

95
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,152
Help us!

96
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,991
- Help us!
- Where are you taking us?

97
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,495
Despite our efforts,
they're abducting even more women now.

98
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,168
What do they really do
to those women, sir?

99
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,839
I'll tell you next time. Let's go.

100
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,104
Auntie Yolanda.

101
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,149
Where's Luisa? Has she eaten?

102
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,111
Yes, dear. In fact, she ate a lot today.

103
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,905
That's good to hear.

104
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,329
I forgot to tell Eduardo
our cousin was staying with us.

105
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,413
Adelina?

106
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,082
What are you murmuring?

107
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,795
Listen, I have bad news.

108
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,173
What is it?

109
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,425
It's Daddy Johnny…

110
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,304
He's dead.

111
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,099
They killed him too.

112
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,650
Those bastards!

113
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,742
My God!

114
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,918
I'm going to kill them.

115
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,772
<i>Life is a gamble, Adelina.</i>

116
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,318
<i>Where we, the poor and the weak,</i>

117
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,490
<i>are just pawns of those in power
who sit above us.</i>

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,085
I'm coming!

119
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,753
What the hell?

120
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,171
God Almighty.

121
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,550
The devils are here.

122
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,849
Adelina.

123
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
They've killed so many people.

124
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,367
Even the innocent.

125
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:28,127
Nando, I need you to gather
our comrades in the city.

126
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,839
- I have a plan.
- What are you going to do?

127
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:39,639
We can't just sit here and gather intel,
weapons, and funds anymore.

128
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,643
Our country's situation is deteriorating.

129
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,771
We must take up arms

130
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,775
and help drive away
our enemies once and for all.

131
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,331
- What a surprise.
- The traitor lives!

132
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,957
Surrender now.

133
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,626
You're no match for us.

134
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,753
Or we'll shoot the boy too.

135
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,382
If you shoot him,
you'll never know where Auntie Amalia is!

136
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,551
Where is she?

137
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:22,807
If you try to shoot us,
you'll never see your family again.

138
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,977
Put down your guns! Don't fire!

139
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,275
Now, tell me. Where's my family?

140
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,369
Life is getting harder in our country.

141
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:48,082
Especially here in the city.
People are starving.

142
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,503
And not just food,
we're running out of oil too.

143
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,297
<i>That's why there are no vehicles
on the streets,</i>

144
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,926
<i>except for carriages and trucks
of the Japanese military.</i>

145
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,054
There are rumors that the Japanese
are hoarding our oil,

146
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,472
claiming it as their own.

147
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,809
That's why prices are skyrocketing.

148
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,855
- Even our money is worthless.
- It has no value.

149
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,483
Just like how they treat our people.

150
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,861
<i>They arrest our men</i>

151
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,281
<i>and the Makapili point them out,
even the innocent.</i>

152
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,367
No one comes back alive.

153
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:28,622
They continue to oppress us
and make our lives difficult.

154
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,085
That's why we need to be more ruthless

155
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,549
in seizing their supplies,
especially their weapons.

156
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:44,096
The more they pressure us,
the more we'll fight back.

157
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,520
Is there anyone here
who fears for their life?

158
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,900
Because if so, you're free to leave.

159
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,820
I do. I fear for the lives of my children.

160
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,826
We're staying. We want to fight.

161
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
Anyone else?

162
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,251
Adelina?

163
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,170
- Adelina?
- Auntie Yolanda.

164
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,296
Adelina.

165
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,633
Why are you here?
Did something happen to Luisa?

166
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,718
I came to warn you.

167
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,472
Please don't come home for now.

168
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,059
The Kempeitai are searching for you.

169
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,564
Okay, Auntie.

170
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,691
You may go home.

171
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,779
Take Luisa to the church we always go to.

172
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,700
Seek shelter there.
That's where I'll look for you.

173
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,997
I'll go on ahead.

174
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,045
Adelina.

175
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,632
How will you carry out your plan
when the Kempeitai are out to get you?

176
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,303
The plan won't change.

177
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,847
We'll still fight.

178
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,653
Commander.

179
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,699
We're heading out to look for food.

180
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,579
Have you seen Celso?
He hasn't been around lately.

181
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,999
Celso?

182
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,793
He's just around there somewhere.

183
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,712
We'll get going now.

184
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,499
Good day, sir.

185
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,711
I'm here to speak
with Lieutenant Nakamura.

186
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,296
What is it?

187
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,049
I just happened to find this.

188
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,763
Colonel.

189
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,022
You know where Tanaka Hiroshi is?

190
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,901
Yes, sir. I know where he's hiding.

191
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,976
If Daddy Johnny was still alive,

192
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,688
he'd probably be pissed at us
for hiding this here.

193
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,750
But even so,

194
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,421
I'm certain he'd be proud of us.

195
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,048
Especially you.

196
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,848
Let's go.

197
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,500
Hide, Mr. Borromeo.

198
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,304
We can't die just yet.

199
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,516
Our family's waiting for us.

200
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,354
<i>If you just close your eyes, you'll know</i>

201
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,108
<i>that I'm just a man
who deeply loves and cares for you.</i>

202
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,695
<i>Please don't hate me.
You'll only break my heart.</i>

203
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,657
<i>Be safe, Adelina. Take care of yourself.</i>

204
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,911
<i>I don't want to die, Adelina.
I don't want to perish in this war.</i>

205
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>I still wish to see you again.</i>

206
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,416
<i>- Will I ever see you again?
- That's also my wish, my love.</i>

207
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,005
No harm must come to us.

208
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,013
If it's me you're after,
then leave these people alone.

209
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,393
Take me instead.
I'm the one you need, right?

210
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,397
Not now, Adelina.

211
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,777
I owe you my life,
and this is my way of repaying you.

212
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,785
Help me.

213
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,205
I'm a friend of Hiroshi.

214
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,375
Please help. Let's take this man
to the hospital. Hurry.

215
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,298
But next time we meet, I won't let you go.

216
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,385
So consider this a warning.

217
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:01,306
Flee the city, hide, run far from here.

218
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,104
I won't be able to help you
if our paths cross again.

219
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
Let's go.

220
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,535
Adelina. Luis. I'm so glad you're here.

221
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,619
Yes, indeed.

222
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,877
Over there! Hurry up!

223
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,163
We're just about to leave.
Adelina, let's go.

224
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,290
Wait.

225
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,211
We came here
because we're looking for a performer.

226
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,631
A Japanese officer invited us to perform

227
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,549
at a birthday party
of one of their officials.

228
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,386
Of course, we couldn't say no.

229
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,138
They might lock us up again.

230
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,684
The problem is,
the performers we knew kept refusing us.

231
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:34,316
We don't know who else to ask
to perform for those bastards.

232
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,860
We're not interested in that right now.

233
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,320
Our apologies. Let's go.

234
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,157
I can do it. Let me.

235
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,534
What? Is that a death wish, Adelina?

236
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,537
Death wish? Why would you say that?

237
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,668
We won't do anything
to anger those soldiers, anyway.

238
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,877
He's right.

239
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,171
I'll handle this, Luis.

240
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,715
This is a good opportunity.

241
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,428
I'll go with you. We'll perform for them.

242
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,099
- Thank you!
- Adelina! You saved us!

243
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,063
Do you know what the Japanese do
to the women they capture?

244
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,815
They rape them!

245
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,735
If that were to happen to me,
would you still accept me?

246
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,447
Are you kidding me?
That's worse than being betrayed!

247
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,616
- Long live Eduardo!
- Long live!

248
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,994
Eduardo's such a show-off.

249
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>Looks like he wants to show everyone
he's more worthy of leading this group.</i>

250
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,252
COMING UP

251
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,905
