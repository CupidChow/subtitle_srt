1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,335
<i>What happened to you?</i>

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>Only Juan and I survived
after the enemies surrounded us.</i>

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,631
Don't move!

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>Thankfully, another guerrilla unit
rescued us.</i>

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>They're the reason we're still alive.</i>

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,349
<i>Is Hiroshi not back yet?</i>

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,809
<i>Not yet.</i>

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,227
The traitor is over here!

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,939
<i>Please don't abandon me.</i>

10
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,693
I still want to see the woman I love.

11
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>I couldn't be wrong.</i>

12
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,905
<i>You are going to be a mother.</i>

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>I don't want to bear and give birth
to the child of a devil.</i>

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>This is God's will.</i>

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,163
No, you're wrong. This isn't God's will!

16
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>Why am I being punished
for something that wasn't my fault?</i>

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,043
<i>They failed to capture Eduardo Dela Cruz.</i>

18
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>And what about my wife?</i>

19
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,216
<i>My apologies, Colonel.
But she's still not found.</i>

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,343
<i>They represent the number
of our fallen comrades</i>

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>since I began fighting.</i>

22
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,306
This is my way of remembering them.

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,559
<i>He told me he was just going out
to get us food and clothes,</i>

24
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>Could he be in trouble?</i>

25
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>I know it's dangerous outside,
but God will not abandon him.</i>

26
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>Adelina. Teresita.</i>

27
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>Wherever you are right now,</i>

28
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,404
<i>wait for me.</i>

29
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>I have yet to keep my promise.</i>

30
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>We will meet again.</i>

31
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>These Filipinos will pay
for what they did to me.</i>

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,248
I will punish them all with death!

33
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>Where are they headed?</i>

34
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,959
<i>Where else?</i>

35
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,879
<i>They're looking for the Colonel's wife.</i>

36
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,673
<i>If Hiroshi is still not back
before the night ends,</i>

37
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,967
<i>I'll go look for him.</i>

38
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,346
PREVIOUSLY

39
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,805
This was where Adelina, Teresita,
and I used to pray.

40
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,059
I…

41
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,977
I didn't know that.

42
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,356
You know I'm not really
the religious type.

43
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,772
Forgive us, Sister,
for entering the church like this.

44
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,526
There's no need to apologize.

45
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,196
Everyone is welcome to pray
at this church.

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
I hope you'll stay inside.

47
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,742
Haven't you heard the news?

48
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:49,205
The Japanese are stricter now,
especially toward men.

49
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,457
I worry that

50
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,587
the Japanese soldiers might see you
as members of the guerrilla.

51
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,256
That's precisely why…

52
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,466
That's why we won't be staying long.

53
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,344
Goodbye, Sister. Let's go, Tasyo.

54
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
Yes, right.

55
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,934
We still have some work to do
in the mountains.

56
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,852
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

57
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,981
Wait, gentlemen. Have you had breakfast ?

58
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,025
Why? Are you going to feed us?

59
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,151
Tasyo, that's embarrassing.

60
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,279
What's the big deal?
It's been so long since we last ate.

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,614
Besides, I'm starving.

62
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,617
Sister, do you have more food to spare?

63
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,703
We'd like to take it to our com…

64
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,830
Family.

65
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,708
They also haven't eaten in days.

66
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,377
Why, of course.

67
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,048
- Come, follow me.
- Thank you, Sister.

68
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,052
Don't be shy now.

69
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,929
We haven't eaten in ages.
My stomach's been growling so much

70
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,905
- You're back.
- I couldn't find him, Sister.

71
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,075
There's no news about him anywhere.

72
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,411
Where could he be?

73
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,540
Adelina.

74
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,292
You went out?

75
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,551
Didn't I tell you I'd come back?

76
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,681
Ouch.

77
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,308
Why? What's wrong?

78
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,354
Someone shot and wounded me.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,024
That's why I couldn't return right away.

80
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,236
I didn't know.

81
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,737
I'm sorry, my love.

82
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:50,743
But I brought us clothes and food.

83
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,830
Here, Adelina.

84
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,500
He was able to get your clothes
from Mr. Johnny's house.

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,169
We can finally change into these and eat.

86
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,257
Thank you.

87
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,899
Your food is ready, my dear.

88
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,485
Thank you, Sister.

89
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,904
I'll eat that later.

90
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,949
It's not good for you to skip meals.

91
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,284
Come now.

92
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,619
- Just a small bite.
- No, thank you.

93
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,881
My dear, I understand
what you're going through.

94
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,301
But please don't blame the child
you're bearing

95
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,262
from all the pain that man has given you.

96
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,516
God has His reasons.

97
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,478
We might not understand it now,

98
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,982
but I believe He did this
for your own good.

99
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,318
Very well.

100
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,736
I'll leave you for now.

101
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,156
We have new visitors downstairs.

102
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,826
Sister Maria suspects
that they might be guerrillas.

103
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,289
Guerrillas?

104
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,124
I hope they truly are.

105
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,127
For all we know,
they might just be bad people.

106
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,796
We can't just trust anyone these days.

107
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,132
Even if they're Filipinos.

108
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,718
Where are they? I want to see them.

109
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,929
Teresita, don't go out!

110
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,888
Wait!

111
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,308
You two seem really hungry.

112
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,769
Thank you, Sister.

113
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,106
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but where are you from?

114
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,445
- We're from Santa Cruz.
- Yes.

115
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,367
We're so sorry for troubling you.

116
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,286
Don't worry.
Once we're done, we'll leave right away.

117
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,290
Sister, about the food you said
we can take home…

118
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,084
Tasyo. Enough.

119
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,544
What? We need food.

120
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,797
- We have to take some back for our…
- Just eat, so we can leave,

121
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,883
- I'm very sorry.
- Sister.

122
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,178
Pack some food for these boys to take.

123
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,429
Give them everything we have.

124
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,431
I'm sure they've got plenty of company.

125
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,849
Yes, Sister.

126
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,644
Thank you, you're very kind.

127
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,770
It's my pleasure.

128
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,989
- Eduardo.
- Teresita's here!

129
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,158
Eduardo.

130
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,427
Bless the Lord Almighty.

131
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,179
You got away from those soldiers.

132
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,100
And I'm beyond grateful to see you safe.

133
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,521
God is truly on our side.

134
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,067
Thanks to these Sisters.

135
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,861
To Sister Maria.

136
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,780
They led me back to you, Teresita.

137
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,451
Wait.

138
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,454
What's your relationship with Teresita?

139
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,122
Do you know each other?

140
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,665
They're lovers, Sister.

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,502
They were supposed to elope,

142
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,005
but we got caught by soldiers.

143
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,548
What's wrong?

144
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

145
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,551
<i>What did I do, sir?</i>

146
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,806
When Eduardo escaped,
the Japanese then took Teresita away.

147
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
Then, they never saw each other again.

148
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,729
- Adelina! Adelina!
- Teresita!

149
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,856
<i>- Adelina! Adelina!
- No! No!</i>

150
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>- Teresita!
- Adelina!</i>

151
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,278
Teresita, how have you been?

152
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,155
- What happened to you?
- Tasyo, enough.

153
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,657
What?

154
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,830
Tasyo…

155
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,793
Sister Maria, can you please
leave us for a moment?

156
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,381
Eduardo and I need to talk.

157
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,092
Very well, then.

158
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,301
Come on.

159
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,018
If you need anything,
we're just in the other room.

160
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,187
Okay.

161
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,738
Just one more bite.

162
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,201
Excuse me.

163
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,291
Teresita.

164
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,546
I know you're safer here with the nuns,

165
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,508
but I don't want to be apart
from you anymore.

166
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,678
I'm taking you to our base.

167
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,349
If you're there,
I can guarantee your safety.

168
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,352
I can watch over you.

169
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,687
Protect you.

170
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,692
You'll be safer with my fellow guerillas.

171
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,196
I'm sure they'll be glad
to welcome you in our group.

172
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,032
So, come with me.

173
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,333
Why do you seem hesitant?

174
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,304
Colonel, your wife is not inside
the organizer's house.

175
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,391
If that's the case,
let's continue the search.

176
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,979
We will search the entire Metro Manila
if that's what it takes to find her!

177
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,147
Yes, sir!

178
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,872
Isn't this what you want?

179
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,875
For us to be together?

180
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,212
That's all I ever wanted.

181
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,427
But things are different now.

182
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,892
I'm no longer worthy of your love.

183
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,232
Forget about me, Eduardo.

184
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,750
Are you the nuns
the only ones staying here?

185
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,629
Isn't there supposed to be a priest
in every parish?

186
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,465
Yes, Father Guiriba resides here.

187
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,884
But he's not here right now.

188
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,803
He's at the neighboring parish.

189
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,807
The parish priest there
called him over for help.

190
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,353
Are you breaking up with me, Teresita?

191
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,940
Why?

192
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,995
Much has happened

193
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,249
since I was taken to Yuta's camp.

194
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,673
If you only knew what they did to me…

195
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,510
I know.

196
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:56,020
I know what those disgusting soldiers
did to our poor women.

197
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,194
I know very well what you had to endure
in the hands of that damned Colonel.

198
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,700
You don't have to tell me
what happened, Teresita.

199
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,290
That reason is not enough

200
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,669
to make me love you less.

201
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,843
But, Eduardo…

202
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,140
that's not the only thing that happened.

203
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,563
- Long live, Mr. and Mrs. Saitoh!
<i>- I'm married to Yuta.</i>

204
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,649
<i>We're husband and wife.</i>

205
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,031
Is there anyone else with you?

206
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,284
The other one is outside.

207
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,709
I know very well
that you were only forced to marry him.

208
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,296
I know it wasn't your choice to make.

209
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,799
Yes, he forced me to marry him.

210
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,303
So I can save a child…

211
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,183
from being raped
by his good-for-nothing soldiers.

212
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,395
You seem to still resist me.

213
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,238
I'll do what you want.

214
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,657
I'll marry you.

215
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
To me, that marriage is fake.

216
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,706
God didn't bless your union.

217
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,419
How could the Lord bless
such a demonic man like Yuta?

218
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,966
That's why I must take you away
before he finds you again.

219
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,802
But it's too late, Eduardo.

220
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,892
What he did to me bore fruit.

221
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,527
I'm carrying the child of the devil.

222
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,970
I know who you are.

223
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,640
You're Adelina Dela Cruz.
The Japanese are looking for you.

224
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,441
Do you really think you can betray me?

225
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,652
Hiroshi, help!

226
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,073
I didn't come here for money!

227
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,450
I know your father

228
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,828
and I know who killed Julio Borromeo.

229
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,458
Who? Who?

230
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,170
I was raped every single day.

231
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm no longer a pure woman.

232
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,058
Especially now that I'm carrying…

233
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,395
his damned child.

234
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,193
How can I be with you?

235
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,907
How can I bear to show you

236
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,912
the growing life in my womb…

237
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,502
carrying another man's child?

238
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,809
I don't want to hurt you.

239
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,857
So the best thing for us…

240
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,862
is to forget each other.

241
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,535
No.

242
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,955
No, Teresita.

243
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,918
I can't abandon and leave you again.

244
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,632
I've faced so many hardships.

245
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,135
I've faced so many battles.

246
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,431
I've killed so many enemies
just to find you.

247
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,892
I can never turn my back on you.

248
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,561
I don't think I can.

249
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,109
It's time to stop, Eduardo.

250
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,033
Don't you understand?

251
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:14,129
What happened to you
is not easy to accept.

252
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,132
But you never wanted this
to happen, right?

253
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,602
I don't mind if you're pregnant.

254
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,607
I still won't turn my back on you.

255
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,652
We'll work it out together.

256
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,322
We'll take care of that child together.

257
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
Eduardo.

258
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,791
Are you hearing yourself?

259
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,297
This is not just anybody's child.

260
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,303
It's Yuta's.

261
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,390
The devil himself.

262
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,309
I don't even know how to accept his child.

263
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,187
- So how could you?
- I'll try, Teresita.

264
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,731
I can try. We can always try.

265
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,693
We'll make it work.

266
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,865
Adelina!

267
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,076
Adelina, who's that man?

268
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,661
Remember me, Hiroshi?

269
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,290
Good thing you caught a soldier.

270
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,003
<i>If you want to join us,
I want to see your skills in fighting.</i>

271
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,005
<i>I want you to defeat Celso.</i>

272
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>I will never lose to a Japanese.</i>

273
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,096
Celso.

274
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,433
What are you doing here?

275
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,395
Who killed my father?

276
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,479
Tell me!

277
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,356
You're looking at him.

278
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,318
This man…

279
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,156
is the one who killed Julio Borromeo!

280
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,792
<i>Colonel Saitoh is there.
He's looking for you, Teresita.</i>

281
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,712
<i>You need to leave now,
and take these weapons with you!</i>

282
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:23,258
<i>Just like this war, Adelina,
the unexpected will happen.</i>

283
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,721
<i>And now that we've witnessed
what it has done to our lives,</i>

284
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:32,309
<i>only time can tell if we survive or not.</i>

285
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,270
<i>Let's go, Eduardo.
There are too many of them.</i>

286
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:41,026
COMING UP

287
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,694
Teresita?

288
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,947
Teresita!

289
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,744
