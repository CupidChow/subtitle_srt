1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,128
-What happened?
-I escaped from the garrison

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,505
the Japanese kept us in.

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,007
I just can't believe

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,342
you're a victim in this too.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:13,555
Are you really not going to let me see
or speak to my daughter?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,022
Go to hell.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,025
Uncle Lauro is out of the picture.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,694
He has sided with the enemy.

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,031
He has sold his own soul to that devil.

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:36,536
No foreigner will ever love our country!

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,582
Yuta, where's my mother’s body?
I want to see her.

12
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,960
-I won't allow it.
-She’s still my mother, Yuta!

13
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:49,174
Despite being abandoned by the Americans,
the Filipinos kept fighting.

14
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,884
Why is there no one here?

15
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,262
Armies who opposed the Japanese
continued to increase in number.

16
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:59,017
Blood and tears flooded
the Pearl of the Orient.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,520
The theater continued
and it served as a secret office

18
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,317
and a hideout for spies like me
who continue to help the guerillas.

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:13,156
PREVIOUSLY

20
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,703
Are you mocking and insulting our army?

21
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,916
Arrest them!

22
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

23
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,268
Listen up. The Japanese soldiers are here.

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,062
They're here. Keep this away.

25
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,690
Help me. Adelina.

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,734
Hurry.

27
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,309
Good thing Juan managed to come back.

28
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,939
Did he deliver your letter to your sister?

29
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,576
We’ve already attacked
numerous camps, Eduardo.

30
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,163
But there's still no sign of your fiancée.

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,708
Could it be…

32
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,295
that she’s dead?

33
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,678
Hope is all I have left.

34
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,598
Are you going to take that away too?

35
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,699
I don’t know about that, sir.

36
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,954
But I know the people that work here.

37
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,123
They’re all very trustworthy.

38
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,628
It seems you don’t know
your employees very well.

39
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,466
It has come to our attention
that one of your people is a spy.

40
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,435
Look at the people around you, Eduardo.

41
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,272
Every one of us has lost a loved one.

42
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,733
Parents,

43
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,528
spouses, children,

44
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,282
siblings, and friends.

45
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,120
We can't deny the reality

46
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,082
that we could still lose more of them.

47
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,930
Even if Teresita is gone,
I'm still going to fight

48
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,977
for our country and people.

49
00:05:55,938 --> 00:06:00,526
So don’t take away the hope I still have.

50
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:08,326
I know and believe Teresita is alive.

51
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,786
I'm sure we’ll find her.

52
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,081
Along with all the women like her.

53
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,375
We're going to free them
from those monsters!

54
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,437
Bring the Filipino in!

55
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,617
What's that?

56
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,453
A Makapili.

57
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,958
They're traitors
who report to the enemies.

58
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:02,213
We'll prove to you that someone here
is against us,

59
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,425
and this person will point them out.

60
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,031
-Teresita!
-What is it?

61
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,537
Forgive me, Colonel.

62
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,458
Alicia, what is it? Do you need anything?

63
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,669
Teresita, I'm bleeding.

64
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,049
I already have my period.
What should I do?

65
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,639
Alicia, that just means
you’re a woman now.

66
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,517
We should be more careful, okay?

67
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,395
Wait here, let me get you something.

68
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,078
Yuta, she's just 12 years old.

69
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,750
She's far too young to endure
your disgusting soldiers.

70
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:36,140
Who among them are traitors
to the Japanese Imperial Army?

71
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,893
Point them to us!

72
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,577
Arrest this man at once!

73
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,079
Who are you?

74
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,206
Let me go, wait, please!

75
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,334
A Filipino against his own people?

76
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,460
You traitor!

77
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,587
Wait!

78
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,631
-Take him away.
-Wait!

79
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,993
If you say no,

80
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,459
I won’t think twice about handing her over
to my soldiers tonight.

81
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,177
Marcel's in danger.

82
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,596
What's going to happen to them?

83
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
Our audience is waiting!

84
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,187
Get on the stage! Hurry!

85
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,773
Quickly!

86
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,906
Luis. Adelina.

87
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,785
I think it's time
you look for a different office

88
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,413
for the work you're doing.

89
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,790
I don't want the crew to get involved.

90
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,042
We understand. Our apologies.

91
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,002
Luis.

92
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:40,468
I think it's best you two hide for now.

93
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,053
We don't know
what's going to happen to Marcel.

94
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,931
They might torture him
and force him to talk.

95
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:51,228
What if he mentions the two of you
and the soldiers arrest you?

96
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,024
It's safer to stay away until we're sure.

97
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,735
-What about Luisa?
-I’ll take care of her.

98
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,653
-Now, go.
-Thank you.

99
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,571
Adelina.

100
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,499
Colonel, apologies for the intrusion.

101
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:17,463
They're looking for you at Fort Santiago.

102
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,306
I see you’re still stubborn.

103
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,114
I accept.

104
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,329
I'll marry you.

105
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,545
As long as you set Alicia free right now.

106
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,092
And let me personally take her
back to her family

107
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,846
so I can ensure
you keep your end of the bargain.

108
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,016
Bring a lot of soldiers.

109
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,645
They will accompany Teresita.

110
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,981
She might try to escape.

111
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,816
Yes, sir!

112
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,598
Show me your bag!

113
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,767
Found anything?

114
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,937
All clear!

115
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,483
I'm still wondering
who's the man behind the mask.

116
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,360
The one you call a Makapili.

117
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:08,073
The Japanese are using our people
to conquer and terrorize us

118
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,201
because they know we won't submit to them.

119
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,332
I’m sure Marcel knows that man.

120
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,921
He was a wearing a disguise,
which meant we might know him too.

121
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,846
Let’s go.

122
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,996
Alicia.

123
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,751
Don’t forget what I told you, okay?

124
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,296
Take care of yourself out there.

125
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,138
I want you to warn your family,
your parents.

126
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,434
I need you to move far away.

127
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,437
Somewhere they can’t follow you.

128
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,107
Okay.

129
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:29,071
Thank you so much
for your care and kindness.

130
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,532
But…

131
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,953
are you really going to marry the Colonel?

132
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,385
Alicia.

133
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,847
Don’t worry about me.

134
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,061
What’s important is you're free and safe.

135
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,606
I'll never forget you.

136
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,194
Thank you very, very much.

137
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,904
Yes, sir. This won't happen again.

138
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,323
This won't happen again, sir.

139
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,136
-Sir, thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

140
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:20,891
Lock them up.

141
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,267
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir!

142
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,186
-Let’s go!
-Yes, sir!

143
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,981
Thank you, sir.

144
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,746
Go.

145
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,125
Go home to your parents.

146
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,341
Mom! Dad!

147
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,302
-My dear!
-I’m home!

148
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,887
Thank heavens.

149
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,022
Let’s go.

150
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,923
Why don't we have a chat, Marcelo?

151
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,555
Who are your other comrades?

152
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,185
I don’t know what you're talking about.

153
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,581
I’m telling the truth.

154
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,543
I don’t know anything.

155
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,879
Spare me.

156
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,844
You know nothing, you say?

157
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
We have a witness.

158
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,901
This person knows you very well.

159
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,074
Do you also know him, Marcelo?

160
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,291
Now do you know

161
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,587
how we captured Sergeant Diosdado Reyes?

162
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,049
Don’t worry.

163
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,887
We'll still find more donations
for our soldiers, our brave guerillas.

164
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,597
This is a huge help to us.

165
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,938
I saw this poster on the street.

166
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,858
Are the Japanese
planning to arrest Hiroshi too?

167
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,360
-Have you heard anything from Hiroshi?
-No.

168
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,321
I don't even know where he is.

169
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,823
-Stop! Why are you outside?
-Come with us!

170
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,118
Now!

171
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,953
Thank you for your help, miss.

172
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,414
It means a lot that you came with us.

173
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,875
You should thank Colonel Marcos Agustin.

174
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,336
What’s happening? Why are there gunshots?

175
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,796
Please, let’s take a different route!

176
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,214
We're going to get killed here!

177
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,591
Let’s get out of here!

178
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,927
Eduardo!

179
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,346
COMING UP

180
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,228
