1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,002
Where are we headed now?

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,963
<i>To the nearest garrison.</i>

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,549
- Teresita might be there.
<i>- I saw Eduardo again.</i>

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>- Isn't he dead?
- That's what I thought too.</i>

5
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,429
But I'm sure I wasn't mistaken.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,556
<i>I wish I could see you tomorrow.</i>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,141
You and my father must find me.

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>Please save me
before I'm wed to the devil.</i>

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>The priest is getting impatient.
Bring her down already.</i>

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,858
<i>Marcel is dead.</i>

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>And we will avenge his death.</i>

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>We're going to storm Fort Santiago.</i>

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>That's not going to be easy.</i>

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,951
Tasyo?

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,329
<i>What's important is
he's still out there fighting.</i>

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>The Lord is kind.
I know we'll meet again one day.</i>

17
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>Looks like they're hiding women
in that garrison, Juan.</i>

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>I'll get inside that garrison.</i>

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,508
<i>Maybe Teresita's inside.</i>

20
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Teresita Borromeo,</i>

21
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:59,017
do you take Yuta Saitoh
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,020
Don't embarrass me.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,272
- Where are the other women?
- One of them is outside.

24
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,983
Yes. Yes, Father.

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>Sir! Let's go!</i>

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,987
Long live!

27
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>I don't want to die yet.</i>

28
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,826
I am a friend of Hiroshi.

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,952
<i>Adelina.</i>

30
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,456
- Sir, he has the key!
- Get it! Quick!

31
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>The women…</i>

32
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,794
- The women escaped.
- Useless!

33
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>Go after them!</i>

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,421
<i>- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!</i>

35
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,511
PREVIOUSLY

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,056
Help! Please help. Let's take this man
to the hospital. Hurry.

37
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,704
Hurry.

38
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,008
You're safe now.

39
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,053
Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,474
You have no idea what we went through

41
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,935
in the hands of those Japanese soldiers.

42
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,188
Thank you for saving us.

43
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,190
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,568
May the Lord bless you, kind sir.

45
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,362
You're welcome.

46
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,782
Tell us.

47
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,744
What did those cruel soldiers do?

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,913
You don't need to know, Juan.

49
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,084
Don't return to your homes just yet.

50
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,755
Stay with friends or relatives for now.

51
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,049
You can just send word to your families.

52
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,676
Those soldiers might come for you again.

53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,806
We can stay at my uncle's place
if you like.

54
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,560
My cousins can keep us safe.

55
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,145
But what about Teresita?

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,733
Teresita?

57
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,901
Who's Teresita?

58
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,197
She was the woman we left behind.

59
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,452
- What's her last name?
- Borromeo, sir.

60
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,663
She's a former vaudeville actress.

61
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,591
I have to go back for her.

62
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,013
Sir!

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,275
Hiroshi.

64
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,163
I'm glad you're still alive.

65
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,045
I see you've finally switched sides.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,801
Have you heard anything from your father?

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,349
I haven't talked to my father
for some time now, Mr. Borromeo.

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,813
I just hope he returned to Japan safely.

69
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,400
Mr. Borromeo.

70
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,902
Why are you here?

71
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,072
How did you end up joining them?

72
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,701
When I found out the truth

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,625
about my eldest daughter's
kidnapping by Colonel Saitoh…

74
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,172
The Colonel locked her up
in a garrison in Bulacan.

75
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,799
And in that garrison,

76
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,844
Teresita was raped by the Colonel.

77
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,598
…I made it my goal to kill him.

78
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,227
I need to borrow your gun.

79
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,021
Gun?

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,536
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,501
And you?
What are you doing here at this hour?

82
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,420
I asked you first.

83
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,303
Are you here to kill our colonel too?

84
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,180
Just like your wife?

85
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,140
What?

86
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,185
What did Carmela do?

87
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,021
I wish I could tell you to just ask her,

88
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,149
but I'm afraid it's too late.

89
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,610
Because she's dead.

90
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,114
What?

91
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,534
Don't make me repeat myself.

92
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,953
You heard me right.

93
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,622
Your wife is gone.

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,749
You're a widower now!

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,543
Are you telling the truth?

96
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,629
How did you know?

97
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,049
How did Carmela die?

98
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,885
I was the first to shoot her.

99
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,306
It was the Colonel who ended her life.

100
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,896
She really thought she could barge in
and take the Colonel's life.

101
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,733
Her false bravado was all for nothing.

102
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,403
Now,

103
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,824
if you came here to finish
what your wife started…

104
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,200
Damn you!

105
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,293
Wake up, Julio!
You never loved Carmela, anyway.

106
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,378
So why are you so angry?

107
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,806
After that night,

108
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,394
I wandered far and wide.

109
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,316
I was looking for a group to join,

110
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,110
so I can fight as well.

111
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,862
That's when my feet led me here

112
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,865
to these guerrillas.

113
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,579
Mr. Borromeo.

114
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,332
Can you take me in too?

115
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,418
I'd like to join your group.

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,798
- Please take me in.
- We don't accept your kind here.

117
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,887
We can never trust someone like you.

118
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,765
Over here, Commander.

119
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,526
Gentlemen.

120
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,280
Believe me, I am not an enemy.

121
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,658
Right now,

122
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,161
the Japanese Imperial Army
sees me as a traitor.

123
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,704
Commander.

124
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,708
I know the decision is still up to you.

125
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,005
But I can tell you with full confidence

126
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,007
that I trust this boy.

127
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,676
They're not to be trusted.

128
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,099
You can join our group

129
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,810
if you prove yourself to us.

130
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,521
In what way, Commander?

131
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,534
Colonel.

132
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,871
Every single woman is gone.

133
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,000
They've all escaped.

134
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,128
Colonel!

135
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,422
Colonel.

136
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,802
We couldn't find the women.

137
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,018
You fools!

138
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,618
What did the Filipino look like?

139
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,168
He looks like a foreigner, Colonel.

140
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,547
He's also very tall

141
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,507
and handsome.

142
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,723
Why did you let them escape?

143
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,475
You're all useless!

144
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,107
Get out of my sight!

145
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,985
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

146
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,499
What happened, Yuta?

147
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,419
How did they escape?

148
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,385
Take this.

149
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,845
I want you two to fight.

150
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,139
What?

151
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:28,437
If you want to join us,
I want to see how you fight.

152
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
Your task is to defeat Celso.

153
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,986
But, Commander…

154
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,408
we don't need to fight.

155
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,743
I will never lose to a Japanese.

156
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,625
We don't need to fight, Celso.

157
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,005
Get in!

158
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,299
Where are you taking me now?

159
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,593
To a safer place.

160
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,220
Just get in the car.

161
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
<i>Adelina.</i>

162
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,897
<i>Life is indeed a game.</i>

163
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,359
<i>We all take risks to win.</i>

164
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,950
I hope I've proven myself, Commander.

165
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,179
<i>We all fight for ourselves.</i>

166
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,808
Hiroshi!

167
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,694
<i>Whoever wins the game
will make the decision.</i>

168
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,529
What are you waiting for?

169
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,156
Kill him.

170
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,870
Commander!

171
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,333
Obey my order. Kill him.

172
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,612
<i>But what if your opponent in this game…</i>

173
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,912
<i>is truly powerful?</i>

174
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>What if he holds all the cards
to defeat you?</i>

175
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,906
Sir, I really don't know
what you need from me.

176
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
Isn't that right?

177
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,478
I really don't know.

178
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,692
I didn't even know
he was against your army.

179
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,321
It's the truth!

180
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,749
- I really didn't know.
- You can't fool me!

181
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,210
You run this place.

182
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,130
You must know something.

183
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,059
What are you waiting for?

184
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,436
Kill him!

185
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,869
I won't kill anyone here, Commander.

186
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,791
If you won't take me in, just let me go.

187
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,008
Let's give it up
for the newest member of our group!

188
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,397
Welcome aboard.

189
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,491
You've passed the test.

190
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,952
Good work, Hiroshi.

191
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,156
Daddy Johnny?

192
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,783
Sir?

193
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,751
Sir?

194
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,052
Sir?

195
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,096
Daddy Johnny?

196
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,936
Sir?

197
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,272
Sir!

198
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,074
Daddy Johnny!

199
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,210
Colonel.

200
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:11,340
We'll be outside if you need us.

201
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,719
Thank you.

202
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,731
Eduardo Dela Cruz is dead.

203
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,401
<i>He was killed by your fellow Filipinos.</i>

204
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,779
- Teresita, are you there?
- Eduardo?

205
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,407
<i>- I saw his body with my own eyes.</i>
- Eduardo!

206
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,910
<i>And you will never see him again.</i>

207
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,124
Are you hungry?

208
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,836
I can send some food for you.

209
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,925
No need. Thank you.

210
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,223
You're lucky, Captain.

211
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,975
You survived.

212
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,730
Nakamura.

213
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,441
How did I get here?

214
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,320
Apparently, a woman helped you get here.

215
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,782
But the nurses don't know who she is.

216
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,002
It was Adelina.

217
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,637
Sir.

218
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,473
It's the sirens.

219
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,518
We must head back to camp right away.

220
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,770
We need to reach the cemetery, Juan.

221
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,607
Hiroshi or Adelina might show up.

222
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,401
We're almost there.
It's not too far, let's go.

223
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,031
- Eduardo!
- Adelina?

224
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,552
I have something to ask you.

225
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,643
How did…

226
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,606
Eduardo die again?

227
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,289
Why are we still talking about him?

228
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,836
Forget about him
because he won't be coming back.

229
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,786
Didn't I tell you before?
Stop refusing me.

230
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,080
Understand?

231
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,683
Commander, we're heading out
to look for food.

232
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,312
<i>Have you seen Celso?
He hasn't been around lately.</i>

233
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,565
You know where Tanaka Hiroshi is?

234
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,483
Yes, sir. I know where he's hiding.

235
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,236
What a surprise. The traitor lives!

236
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,447
Surrender now. You're no match for us.

237
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>Our country's situation is deteriorating.</i>

238
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,035
We must take up arms

239
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:12,331
and help drive away
our enemies once and for all.

240
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,416
You must arrest Adelina at once.

241
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,501
COMING UP

242
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,300
