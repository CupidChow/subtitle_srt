1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:04,212
I found a house that we can use

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:08,299
as our headquarters
once we occupy this city.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,719
Teresita will be in good hands

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:17,434
if we agree now to marry our children
as soon as possible.

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,102
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,980
I've come to accept
and support your marriage,

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,023
-and I have no objections--
-How can I marry him

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,734
when he's in love with you?

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:30,071
We must celebrate this event,

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:36,953
for the whole city of Manila
will be soaked in blood.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,538
I suspect

12
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,707
that Hiroshi's father is a Japanese spy.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,752
It's a good thing
I called off our wedding.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,546
I would never want to be part of a family…

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,465
a family of enemies.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,383
There's a new country in charge,

17
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,888
so we need to show the Japanese
we can cooperate with them.

18
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,265
Mr. Hiroshi, you are a good person.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,935
May you not be changed by anger
because of what happened to your family.

20
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,937
Do you think the Japanese
are going to hurt us too?

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,481
Who knows?

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,817
I want you to know
that nothing has changed.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,361
I still love you even now.

24
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,031
But you don't have
to give me this, Eduardo.

25
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,492
Is your heart no longer for me?

26
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,953
Apologies for wasting your time
with my confession, Teresita.

27
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,206
Why do you think that way, my love?

28
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,251
You took away the fear and sorrow
in my heart, Teresita.

29
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,589
You've made me very happy
despite everything happening around us.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,343
What is this, Teresita?!

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,054
You insolent man!

32
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,597
Mama!

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,934
Mama, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,853
But I still love Eduardo.

35
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,356
So please, I'm begging you, let us be!

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,233
That's enough!

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,697
I will never allow my daughter
to be with someone like you!

38
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,493
So end whatever relationship
you have, right now!

39
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
Get out!

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,206
Get out of my house!

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,208
Get out!

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,334
Mama…

43
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,670
Even if you drive Eduardo away,

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,047
you can no longer change my mind!

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,967
That will never change, Mama!

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,971
I will love no one else, only Eduardo!

47
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,307
-You wretched girl.
-That's enough, señora!

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,392
-Have mercy on your daughter!
-Please, enough!

49
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,727
Let go of me!

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,937
Leave my house, or else…

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,064
mark my words, Eduardo,

52
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,816
this will not end well!

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,359
Eduardo, go now.

54
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,652
I'll take care of my sister.

55
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,121
I'll deal with my brother!

56
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,539
-Get out!
-Señora, enough!

57
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,260
I'm telling you, Teresita,

58
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,432
I would rather die than see you
with the man I despise the most!

59
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,008
Are you all right? Are you okay?

60
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,599
I didn't expect this.

61
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,269
I didn't know you and my brother
already had an understanding.

62
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,109
I'm so happy for you, Teresita.

63
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,866
But you know this won't lead anywhere
because of the señora, don't you?

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,951
Adelina…

65
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,830
The war has come.

66
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
We no longer have control over our lives.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,839
And now, even our hearts?

68
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,219
That's why I will no longer
fear my mother.

69
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,015
I won't let her dictate
my life any longer.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,268
I will fight…

71
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,230
Eduardo and I will fight for our love.

72
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,071
That's all I wanted to hear
from you, Teresita.

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,866
Thank you.

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,578
For my brother's sake, thank you so much.

75
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
But you won't be the only ones fighting.

76
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,419
I will fight too.

77
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,133
And I'm certain even our father will be
ready to fight for you and Eduardo.

78
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,246
Teresita really said that?

79
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,332
Yes, Eduardo.

80
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,668
This time, my sister is truly ready
to fight for you.

81
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,340
Thank God!

82
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,178
Congratulations, Eduardo,
to you and Teresita.

83
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,430
May you both…

84
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,891
overcome all the challenges that you…

85
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,311
that we will all face.

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,232
There's no challenge
we won't overcome, Tasyo.

87
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,818
Not even the señora…

88
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,737
can stop the love Teresita and I have,

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,825
and neither can the Japanese
stop us from loving our country.

90
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,829
Wait here while I buy some liquor

91
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,332
so we can celebrate
our getting back together.

92
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,291
Wait here.

93
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,972
Oh, Adelina, why do you seem so quiet?

94
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,982
I don't want to ruin the little happiness
my brother is feeling, Tasyo.

95
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,530
But I also know that the señora

96
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,491
will do everything in her power
to separate them.

97
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,416
The uniform suits you well.

98
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:49,177
I'm genuinely pleased that you're ready
to serve and aid our country.

99
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,221
I am Japanese, Dad.

100
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,600
And what you said to me before is true.

101
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,895
I have a duty to our country.

102
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,690
I need to seek justice for my mother.

103
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:08,654
If your mother were here,
she would surely be pleased.

104
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,708
It's good I came.

105
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,544
I had a feeling you would be here.

106
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,964
Thank God you're both safe.

107
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,295
Colonel!

108
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,258
-What is it?
-Our transport has arrived.

109
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,759
Very good.

110
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:18,266
It's time to cleanse all the filth
and corruption

111
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,979
that America brought to this country.

112
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,481
Everyone, let's go!

113
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,358
Yes, sir!

114
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,704
Eduardo is a good kid. He's reliable.

115
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,332
I'm sure he won't hurt you.

116
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,168
Don't worry about your mother,

117
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,007
especially in these times of
hardship and uncertainty.

118
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,135
Whatever your decision may be,

119
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,013
I will support you.

120
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,101
As long as it makes you happy.

121
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,771
Adelina was right.

122
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,191
Thank you, Papa.

123
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,661
I'm sorry for what happened to you,

124
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,374
especially to Mrs. Haruka.

125
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,970
Why are you speaking ill of my friend,
Mrs. Borromeo?

126
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,890
Do you still call Eduardo a friend?

127
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,852
After his uncle took your mother's life?

128
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,398
Now that the Japanese Imperial Army
is here,

129
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,612
punishment awaits those people.

130
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,702
What do you mean, Mr. Tanaka?

131
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,750
Sorry, Mrs. Borromeo,
but what exactly is your purpose here?

132
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,036
If… if that's the case…

133
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:50,376
may we resume Hiroshi and Teresita's
postponed marriage?

134
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,473
Now that the Japanese are poised to win

135
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,851
and are the new rulers of our country,

136
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,603
I see no reason not to proceed with--

137
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,648
Pardon, Mrs. Borromeo.

138
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,609
But I thought Teresita
had already made her decision.

139
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,320
It is not up to my daughter to decide.

140
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
Your father and I
already had an agreement.

141
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,620
So, Mr. Tanaka, forgive me

142
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,584
if I am determined
to marry your son to my daughter.

143
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,882
But Hiroshi and Teresita's marriage
is the only way

144
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
to save my daughter from Eduardo.

145
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,641
I really cannot allow my daughter
to be with a man like that.

146
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,269
That's why I'm begging you,

147
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,356
so you can help me save Teresita.

148
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,612
Hiroshi and Teresita's marriage
is the only way

149
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,575
to secure my only child's
future and safety.

150
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,369
Mrs. Carmela.

151
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:14,418
I am a man of my word,

152
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,925
so our agreement will still proceed.

153
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,721
I will not marry Teresita.

154
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
Sit down!

155
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,402
But, Father, we are still
in the midst of a war,

156
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,197
so it is not yet appropriate
to discuss such matters.

157
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,867
Especially since I still have
duties I need to fulfill.

158
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,746
Don't embarrass me
in front of Mrs. Carmela.

159
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,041
Forgive me, Father.

160
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,503
But there will be no wedding.

161
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm sorry, Father.

162
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,358
It seems Hiroshi has given me
a new problem, Mr. Tanaka.

163
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,737
They really

164
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,908
won't stop until our country
is completely destroyed.

165
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,830
My only prayer is that
we won't be hit by a bomb

166
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,917
and that we remain safe at all times.

167
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,341
My child, God is merciful.

168
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,344
He will not abandon us.

169
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,808
My God!

170
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,687
Do you know about the terrible events
we encountered in Santa Cruz?

171
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,357
Several buildings are burning.

172
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,108
They were apparently hit by a bomb.

173
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,612
You knew it was dangerous,
yet you still went out.

174
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,780
Where did you go?

175
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,989
To the Tanakas.

176
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,952
They are there, safe and sound.

177
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,456
My God, thank you, Hiroshi is safe.

178
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,334
Stop it, they don't need your prayers!

179
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,919
Watch your words!

180
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,545
And why? What are you going to do?

181
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,630
Ma…

182
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,465
Papa…

183
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,051
Please, stop fighting.

184
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,726
Mama, why did you go to the Tanakas?

185
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,230
We just discussed something important.

186
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,028
And what important matter is that, Mama?

187
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,575
It's about you and Hiroshi.

188
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,620
Your upcoming wedding.

189
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,429
Manila Hotel.

190
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,474
The former home of
American General MacArthur.

191
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,281
Who would have thought

192
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,411
it would fall into our hands?

193
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,499
Perhaps General Homma
is already waiting for you, Colonel.

194
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,296
You're right.

195
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,011
Yes, it will be a great honor

196
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,639
to meet him.

197
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,145
Wait for me here.

198
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,313
Yes, sir!

199
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,919
The attitude you have shown
Mrs. Carmela was disrespectful.

200
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,507
Forgive me, Father.

201
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,888
But you know
why I don't want to marry Teresita.

202
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,934
Because of Adelina.

203
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,397
But you are already engaged,
so there is nothing you can do

204
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,777
but accept our agreement
with the Borromeos.

205
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,170
Mama! Haven't I told you my decision?

206
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,843
And isn't my decision more important?

207
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:02,141
Carmela, you will not interfere
with our daughter's happiness.

208
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,976
And I definitely won't agree

209
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,063
to marry her to a Japanese
who wants to invade our country!

210
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,410
It's a good thing our flag is already

211
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:26,081
at the house of the Borromeos.

212
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,254
Are you not thinking, Julio?

213
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,381
We need the Tanakas all the more now!

214
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,091
I don't care!

215
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,599
About whoever brings sorrow
to our country and our daughter's heart!

216
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,060
You know the people
who live in that house?

217
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,770
Yes.

218
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,108
In that house lives
the most beautiful Filipina

219
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,028
I have ever laid eyes on.

220
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,280
I have already decided.

221
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,619
And you will obey
the decision of the only head

222
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,330
of this household.

223
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,000
Yolanda!

224
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,752
Make me some tea!

225
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,005
Let's go!

226
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,924
Come on!

227
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,355
Papa.

228
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,816
Thank you very much for defending me.

229
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,157
You are truly a good parent.

230
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,953
-Unlike the other one.
-Quiet.

231
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,416
Keep quiet for now, Adelina.

232
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,045
Mama might take her anger out on you.

233
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,341
Señor!

234
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,801
The Japanese are here!

235
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,219
They are already inside!

236
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,939
Francisco, hide my daughters.

237
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,984
Let's go, señoritas.

238
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,902
One moment! Dad, what about you?

239
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,529
Don't worry about me.

240
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,655
Let's go.

241
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,864
I will handle this.

242
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,535
Carmela, stay behind.

243
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,953
Help me talk to them.

244
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,914
You're really willing
to put me at risk, Julio?

245
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,695
You have no respect
for the officers and soldiers

246
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,655
of the honorable Japanese Imperial Army!

247
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,638
That is how you show respect to us!

248
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,434
Where are your other companions
in this house?

249
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,148
Only my wife and I live here.

250
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,566
Liar!

251
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,902
How dare you lie to us?!

252
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,365
I have been observing you even before,

253
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,910
so I know there are others who live here.

254
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,330
Where are the young ladies?

255
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,956
Your daughter?

256
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,002
Please believe me.

257
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,171
They are not here.

258
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,216
We don't know where they are.

259
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,011
Julio.

260
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,475
It's impossible that you let
your daughters leave in times like these.

261
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
Please believe me.

262
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,313
They are not here.

263
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,784
These Filipinos are really
imitating the West.

264
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:35,122
One of these days,
we will enter and clean up their theater.

265
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,918
We will get to know their artists
so that we can use them

266
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,171
for the changes
we will make in this country.

267
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,800
Search the whole house!

268
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,801
Yes, sir!

269
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,553
Is it true that Hiroshi
is now one of them?

270
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,930
I can't be mistaken, Eduardo.

271
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,932
Hiroshi is now a Japanese soldier.

272
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,935
COMING UP

273
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,068
Adelina is right.

274
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,154
You are one of the enemies now.

275
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,543
