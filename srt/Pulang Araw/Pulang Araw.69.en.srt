1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,253
What happened to you? Who did that to you?

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,255
I was ambushed by a rabid animal.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,841
It's none of your business, so don't ask.

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,385
I need to know which camp Teresita is in.

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,803
I need to find her.

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,888
I'll go back to the Colonel

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,433
and kill that bastard myself.

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,436
Search every forest and mountain

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,565
until they find all the enemies.

10
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,028
Especially Eduardo Dela Cruz.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,780
"I am ordering Adelina
and the entire Borromeo Family

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,826
to go to Plaza Santa Cruz
to speak to their fellow Filipinos.

13
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,664
I want them to convince their people
to stop resisting our troops,

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:45,587
and encourage everyone
to side with the Japanese Imperial Army."

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,757
It's just so hard to accept
that foreigners aren't our only enemy now,

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,759
but even fellow Filipinos.

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,761
How can they betray our country?

18
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,597
You may sit down and join me.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,016
No, thank you. I already had lunch.

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,727
-Did you poison this?
-Eat.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,273
How can she act that way
toward the man who raped her?

22
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,860
Teresita won't be the only one
to save herself with what she's doing.

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,154
We'll be saved as well.

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,239
I don't like this either, Dad.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,200
But I don't want to be locked up again.

26
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,368
Let's cooperate with them.

27
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,578
Clap!

28
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,956
I'm on a mission, Dad.

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,209
To help save our country.

30
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,752
PREVIOUSLY

31
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,136
If you use your head,

32
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,640
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

33
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,768
Colonel.

34
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,771
We're sorry to disturb you.

35
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,277
But may we lie with the women now?

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,364
Go ahead. Do what you want.

37
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,338
-What did they say?
-Don't mind them.

38
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,549
Come to my room.

39
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,468
Not until you tell me what they said.

40
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:06,102
They just want to rest with the women.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,438
I won't come with you.

42
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,650
I don't want these soldiers
to torment the women here.

43
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,446
You already know this, Teresita.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,494
My men have needs,
so don't concern yourself with them.

45
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,413
-Come on!
-Fine.

46
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,917
I won't go. I won't let you touch me.

47
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,588
I want to love you.

48
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,466
So please,

49
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:41,095
prove to me you're not the villain
everyone thinks you are.

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,853
I know that…

51
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,941
despite who you are to these people,

52
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,071
you still have some good in you.

53
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,492
That's the Yuta I want to know…

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,204
and love.

55
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:26,307
The next to speak is someone you all know.

56
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,772
She's none other
than Miss Adelina Dela Cruz.

57
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,651
Or better known as Chinita!

58
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:54,252
There's punishment waiting
for traitors like them.

59
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,879
Let's go.

60
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,638
No wonder she won't join us.

61
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,517
You're a traitor to our country, Adelina.

62
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,524
Good day, everyone!

63
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,826
May I…

64
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,080
say something first?

65
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,540
Dad.

66
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,292
Sit back down.

67
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,127
Go.

68
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,558
It's true.

69
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,643
It's true that

70
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,688
many Japanese

71
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,150
are good-hearted.

72
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,654
Some of them

73
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,533
can still be our friends.

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,704
I don't want to generalize,

75
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,415
but many of them

76
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:23,549
are like wolves in sheep's clothing.

77
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,058
My God. Julio.

78
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,436
Especially those

79
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,023
who hold power and have weapons.

80
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,026
Eduardo was arrested by the Japanese.

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,698
They bring them to the garrison
to become comfort women.

82
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,534
Where is my daughter?

83
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,912
She was abducted by Japanese soldiers.

84
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:57,500
They're just pretending
to have noble intentions.

85
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,879
My God. Julio.

86
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,590
But it's all lies!

87
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,393
Let go of me!

88
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,113
Hey!

89
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,239
Stop this instant!

90
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,535
Let go of the women!

91
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,336
Women, go to your rooms.

92
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,964
Don't worry.

93
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,425
No one will touch any of you.

94
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,805
I knew it.

95
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,860
What are you still waiting for?

96
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,821
Get out of my sight!

97
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
Yes, sir!

98
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,589
I have done what you wanted.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,137
Now, follow me to my room.

100
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,145
The truth is,

101
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,151
this war is between two powerful nations
that want to conquer us!

102
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,737
Stop! Hey!

103
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,698
America and Japan…

104
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,784
they just want to conquer us!

105
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,705
We only got involved
in this destructive war!

106
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,999
-Julio, don't get us into trouble!
-So…

107
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,377
-Enough of this!
-They're so evil!

108
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,713
They're killing our men,

109
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,674
-they're abducting our women…
-Dad.

110
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,718
…and they are stealing
our country from us!

111
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,804
Dad!

112
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,185
Dad!

113
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,770
Dad!

114
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,731
Dad!

115
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,611
Dad!

116
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,406
Help me!

117
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,200
Please help us take him to the doctor!

118
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,677
No one will help anyone who opposes
the Japanese Imperial Army!

119
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,350
Dad? Dad, please get up.

120
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,352
I'll take you to the hospital.

121
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,521
-Let's go.
-Adelina.

122
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,607
Forgive me.

123
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,069
Forgive me.

124
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947
I…

125
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,035
I've been a worthless father.

126
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,204
I'm so weak.

127
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:55,112
I'm not brave like Eduardo.
I don't have the courage to fight.

128
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,157
Forgive me.

129
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,950
Don't say that, Dad.

130
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,412
You're an admirable man.

131
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,000
You have made me so proud.

132
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,045
If only Teresita was here…

133
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,549
I want to see her one last time.

134
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,344
Don't say things like that.

135
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,764
You'll live, okay?

136
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:27,603
You'll still see Teresita
and we'll all be together again, okay?

137
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,438
Dad?

138
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,660
Dad…

139
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,163
Dad?

140
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,083
No, no!

141
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,085
Señora!

142
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,628
Señora, please help me!

143
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,840
Let's take him to the doctor! Señora!

144
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,348
Why don't we just end
your father's suffering?

145
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,017
No, please!

146
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,768
No!

147
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,649
Akio.

148
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,068
Captain.

149
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,076
Please don't kill my father!

150
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,583
Even for the sake of Hiroshi,

151
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,212
who's Japanese and your friend!

152
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,508
I'm begging you! Don't kill my father!

153
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,425
Please!

154
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,308
Get him up.

155
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,061
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry up!

156
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,191
Wait.

157
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,735
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

158
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,862
Be careful! Dad!

159
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,322
Be careful…

160
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,241
Please.

161
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,536
Dad!

162
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,956
Akio!

163
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,462
I'm begging you.
Please let me come with my father.

164
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,673
Just try it!

165
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,513
Let this be a lesson to all of you!

166
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:14,687
If you cooperate, we'll be good friends.

167
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:22,194
But if you resist and fight,
we'll be your worst enemies.

168
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,824
The decision is yours!

169
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,564
Close the door when you leave.

170
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,687
What do you mean?

171
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,148
Is Hiroshi back?

172
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,694
He came back
to accompany Adelina Dela Cruz.

173
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,782
That's why the Colonel was very angry.
They were detained overnight.

174
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,368
But don't worry.

175
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,790
Hiroshi has been released and sent
by the Colonel to a camp in Pampanga.

176
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,139
Which camp was he sent to, Lieutenant?

177
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,226
I can't tell you.
That's highly confidential.

178
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:05,816
Even to me who served in our Army?

179
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,827
I can't tell you
because that's the Colonel's order!

180
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,954
So don't look for him anymore.

181
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,998
That's what he gets
for crossing the Colonel.

182
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,963
What does my son
know about warfare, Lieutenant?

183
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,633
He wasn't trained for that.

184
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,013
He'll only die there.

185
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,729
Enough of your sentiment, Tanaka!

186
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,691
The Colonel has made his decision.

187
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,651
We're in the middle of a war.

188
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,114
We're going to need many soldiers

189
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,493
who are ready to kill
and die for our Emperor!

190
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,152
Teresita.

191
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,781
We'd like to thank you for saving us.

192
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,783
Because of you,

193
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,411
we slept peacefully tonight.

194
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,539
Thank you, Teresita.

195
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,584
What's wrong, Teresita?

196
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,421
Did the Colonel do anything to you?

197
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,383
You shouldn't ask anymore, Lorena.

198
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,930
Teresita, you need to understand

199
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,352
that your charm is your weapon
against that damn colonel.

200
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,691
So do whatever it takes
so he'll heed your every word.

201
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,237
But what about Teresita?

202
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,366
Can we really accept
her sacrifice for our sake?

203
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
My son…

204
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,725
is not trained for combat.

205
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,397
Do you want him to die?

206
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,069
What have I done

207
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:03,952
for you to do this to my only son?

208
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,370
Don't cry for him!

209
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,666
If Hiroshi does die,

210
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,172
he will be hailed a hero!

211
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,163
Where is your respect?

212
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,012
Carmela.

213
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,855
I don't know, Tanaka.

214
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,652
Captain Watanabe shot Julio.

215
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,364
The soldiers took him away from us.

216
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,427
That's the garrison
I've ambushed with Sir Lucas

217
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,389
without your permission.

218
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,022
This place is heavily guarded, Eduardo.

219
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,608
Your plan is very dangerous.

220
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,698
Even if we ever get in,
we will never get out alive.

221
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
I'll handle it.

222
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,500
Leave this to me.

223
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,170
What are you going to do?

224
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,247
Hey! Do you have a cigarette?

225
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,167
I'm asking if you have a cigarette.

226
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,754
Who are you?

227
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,720
Lieutenant, our troops are ready.

228
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,390
Take Lauro with you
to look for Eduardo Dela Cruz.

229
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,268
Filipino bastards! Kill them all!

230
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,812
Where are they going?

231
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,481
They are being called to a camp.

232
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,149
Looks like they have a mission.

233
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,319
Do you have any herbal cough medicine?

234
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,405
I'm not feeling well these days.

235
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,657
I'm sick of this.

236
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,742
You can count on me, Sir Louis.

237
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,204
My mind is set on becoming a spy
for the guerrillas.

238
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,331
COMING UP

239
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:43,213
