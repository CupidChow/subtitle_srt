1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,384
Rosing, have you seen Miss Myla
and her son anywhere?

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:15,390
<i>I know where to find Adelina Dela Cruz
and Teresita Borromeo.</i>

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>- Where are they?</i>
- Does this mean you forgive me?

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>How can I not?</i>

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,105
You shouldn't have come here anymore.

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,650
<i>Don't you want me to meet the man
who killed our father?</i>

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,111
<i>If you truly believe I'm guilty,</i>

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>you can punish me in any way you want
if that will give you peace in your heart.</i>

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,910
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,177
If you're going to kill Hiroshi
for revenge, then shoot me too.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you,
but our new guests are missing.</i>

12
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>I've been looking all over for them,
but they're not here at all.</i>

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>Looks like they have all escaped
before we came here.</i>

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>You lied to me!</i>

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,611
<i>Your courage, your love for our country…</i>

16
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>Those things make you worthy
of appreciation.</i>

17
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>Not just as a son.
But as a citizen of our motherland.</i>

18
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,452
- Eduardo.
- He's still an enemy.

19
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,830
<i>I'm here to find food for Adelina.</i>

20
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,124
How can I be sure
you're telling the truth?

21
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,503
Then come with me!
Teresita is also with us.

22
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>Officers, deploy your units now.</i>

23
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>We must fight back.</i>

24
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Kill the Americans.</i>

25
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>Don't show mercy to Filipinos
who are against us.</i>

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,264
- Yes, Colonel!
- Yes, Colonel!

27
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,351
How much longer can we hold on?

28
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,899
Hiroshi?

29
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,280
You startled us. Where have you been?

30
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,533
Did you bring us food?

31
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,326
Yes, I did.

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,637
Wait, let me check the convent.

33
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,140
- We might have some food there.
- No, don't leave.

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,311
The Japanese Imperial Army
has taken over the city.

35
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,314
They're on a rampage outside,
it's too dangerous.

36
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,816
Let's just eat what we can right now.

37
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,153
I saw Eduardo.

38
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,739
- How was he?
- Did you tell him we're together?

39
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:23,703
I can tell he wanted
to come with me to see you.

40
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,956
But he's in the middle of a battle
right now with his troops.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,086
Rosing.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,838
Take a look, everyone.

43
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:39,302
We have plenty of food here
that we can cook.

44
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,687
What's that? Why does it smell?

45
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,565
<i>This type of bran is called</i> "sisid rice".

46
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,779
A Filipino diver who survived
a Japanese shipwreck

47
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,198
during the American war discovered it.

48
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>It's rice that has nearly turned black
from decay and odor.</i>

49
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,710
<i>Filipinos were compelled
to eat this for survival.</i>

50
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,379
This is still edible.

51
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,257
<i>We just need to wash this multiple times</i>

52
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>and dry it under the sun
to get rid of the odor.</i>

53
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>Then we can cook it and eat.</i>

54
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,810
Let's get to work.

55
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,353
I feel like I'm about to throw up.

56
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,562
Come on.

57
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,065
Thank you.

58
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,448
<i>But that was not the end of our problems.</i>

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,620
<i>As the Americans made their way to Manila,</i>

60
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,499
<i>the Filipinos continued
to suffer even more.</i>

61
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,222
Colonel, I have a question.

62
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,268
Shouldn't we follow
General Yamashita to Baguio?

63
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,146
Most of our troops had already left.

64
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,316
We're the only ones left in the city.

65
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,652
We must advance.

66
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,237
No!

67
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
General Iwabuchi

68
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,955
has chosen to stay in Manila.

69
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,459
He's prepared to defend this city

70
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,671
to the last man.

71
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,758
And so are we.

72
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,801
Forgive me, Colonel.

73
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,970
But only death awaits us here.

74
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
We're staying in Manila!

75
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,395
We'll defend this city until we die!

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,982
Colonel, is that really the reason?

77
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,277
Or is it because of Teresita?

78
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,199
Are you really going to sacrifice us
for a woman who has never loved you?

79
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,016
Is there anyone else

80
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,770
who wants to follow his steps?

81
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,522
- Not us, Colonel!
- Not us, Colonel!

82
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,733
- We'll obey your command.
- Good.

83
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,904
Kill anyone in your sight.

84
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,324
If we die here,

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,078
the Americans and Filipinos will win.

86
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,790
We can't allow that to happen!

87
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,958
Yes, sir!

88
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>Countless of our people have died.</i>

89
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,779
<i>Most of them were innocent.</i>

90
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:34,954
<i>There was bloodshed all over the country.</i>

91
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>No one could escape death.</i>

92
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,681
<i>The children of this nation
continued to fight day and night.</i>

93
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,287
Be quiet.

94
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,169
Hiroshi.

95
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,172
The shooting isn't over yet.
Where are you going?

96
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,759
Adelina, I can't hide
like a coward forever.

97
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,637
I want to help the guerrillas.

98
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,973
- Hiroshi, don't leave us.
- Please stay.

99
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,105
Take my gun.

100
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,150
Use it if necessary.

101
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,362
Hiroshi, please don't leave.

102
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,239
Adelina, just take it.

103
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,450
You'll die out there, Hiroshi.

104
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,994
Please, just stay. Don't leave us.

105
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,330
Don't worry, Adelina.

106
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,708
I'll come back for you, I promise.

107
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,051
Just take it.

108
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,267
No…

109
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,188
I got to go, Adelina.

110
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,774
Come back, okay? Promise me.

111
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,776
I promise.

112
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,745
<i>The moment I let go of his hand,
I knew something bad was going to happen.</i>

113
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,544
<i>That I might never see Hiroshi again.</i>

114
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,931
Don't back down!

115
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,849
Attack!

116
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,645
Attack!

117
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,505
My husband!

118
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,508
Wake up!

119
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,702
Long time no see, Colonel.

120
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,913
Remember me?

121
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
Hail Mary, full of grace,

122
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,111
the Lord is with you.

123
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,322
Blessed are you among women,

124
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,158
and blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

125
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,411
<i>During these times,</i>

126
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>our prayers have become
our only refuge and strength.</i>

127
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,962
Hail Mary…

128
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,840
<i>Everyone kept praying for the war to stop,</i>

129
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,302
<i>hoping that there's still a God
who listens from above.</i>

130
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,598
<i>We need a God who will save us
from this tragedy and ruin,</i>

131
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,810
<i>so the last of us
can still stand and fight…</i>

132
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,319
<i>for the sake of ourselves,</i>

133
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,906
<i>of our loved ones, and our country.</i>

134
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,793
You probably thought
you would reign over this land forever.

135
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:37,548
Now, taste the wrath of the people
who will not bow down

136
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,091
or be oppressed by anyone!

137
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,820
Eduardo!

138
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,778
This is for all the suffering you caused!

139
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,868
For all our comrades you've killed!

140
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,000
Saitoh!

141
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,511
Go, Eduardo! Chase him!

142
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,952
We need to evacuate!

143
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,205
We're no longer safe here!

144
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,957
That's not possible!

145
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,251
We have nowhere else to escape!

146
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,254
We're going to get shot
if we step outside!

147
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,714
So let's just stay here!

148
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,303
Adelina's right!

149
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,263
Let's all stay here together!

150
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,140
No one leaves!

151
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,517
God Almighty!

152
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,979
Please don't abandon us!

153
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,649
Save us all!

154
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,027
My God!

155
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,949
Teresita.

156
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,955
Do you remember
when we used to perform vaudeville?

157
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,958
Wasn't it such a happy time?

158
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,462
We brought joy to our audience.

159
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,923
Didn't we?

160
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,554
Let's sing again, Teresita.

161
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,017
But this time,

162
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,395
we'll perform to calm everyone down.

163
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,484
Come on! Sing with me, Teresita!

164
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,428
<i>Amidst death and war,</i>

165
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>through countless trials,</i>

166
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,727
<i>Teresita and I remained
vaudeville performers.</i>

167
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,744
<i>But instead of performing on stage
like we always do,</i>

168
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,872
<i>we sang on a battlefield.</i>

169
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,007
Father, forgive me.

170
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,638
I won't be coming home anymore.

171
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,115
<i>In these times,
our voice became our weapons.</i>

172
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,784
<i>It kept us sane, and it gave us hope.</i>

173
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,870
<i>It can never kill us.</i>

174
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,289
<i>Unlike those weapons
the soldiers use outside.</i>

175
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>It is said that the battle in Manila
was the most brutal</i>

176
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:33,719
<i>and darkest chapter in the history
of the entire Asia-Pacific.</i>

177
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,097
<i>And that's true.</i>

178
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:42,978
<i>Because for the last 29 days,
the war continued to haunt us.</i>

179
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,442
<i>So many innocent people lost their lives.</i>

180
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,834
<i>So many innocent dreams were crushed
when all they wanted was to stay alive.</i>

181
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:16,261
<i>Manila became a city engulfed
by unthinkable violence.</i>

182
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>We were reminded of the wounds of war,</i>

183
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:24,186
<i>which can never be healed
in those who witnessed them.</i>

184
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,259
Damn it.

185
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,437
There are people here.

186
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>If there's one thing I regret, it's you.</i>

187
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:21,118
<i>I should've killed you long ago.</i>

188
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,703
<i>Even if you kill me now,</i>

189
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,165
<i>my country loathes you so!</i>

190
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>You're not going anywhere, Teresita!</i>

191
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,794
<i>I won't let you leave me again.</i>

192
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,255
- Teresita, get away from him!
- Eduardo?

193
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,134
COMING UP
