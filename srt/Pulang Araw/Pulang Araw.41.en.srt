1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,420
How about we run away together?
Let's elope.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,714
Why don't you put Eduardo in jail,

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,882
so no one can come
between you and Teresita?

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,634
It's going to happen soon.

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,219
Where are Eduardo and Tasyo?

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,264
The Japanese soldiers
arrested them earlier.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,018
Have mercy on my brother.
Save him and Tasyo.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,478
I was afraid this was
going to happen, Eduardo.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,730
They might kill us.

10
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,273
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,483
Come with me.

12
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,319
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,325
Yes, sir.

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,959
Where is your father hiding?

15
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,754
I don't know where he is!

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,883
I've never been with my worthless father!

17
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,843
Hiroshi, what does Eduardo have to do

18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,096
with someone who never had
any relationship with him?

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,557
But he is still
an American military officer, isn't he?

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,518
So if that's the only reason
he was invited by my fellow soldiers…

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,729
Get his companion and bring him here.

22
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,689
Why are you still outside?

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,274
I just came from a mission.

24
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,734
Sir, what? Hey!

25
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,361
Tie him up. Do the nail pricking on him.

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,781
Tasyo!

27
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,324
Tasyo!

28
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,120
Enough! Enough, please!

29
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,247
Tasyo!

30
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,333
Enough!

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,126
It hurts, I can't take it anymore!

32
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,461
I can't take it anymore!

33
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,633
-I can't…
-Tasyo!

34
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,181
Why don't you just go to his house
if you're looking for him?

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,226
Enough!

36
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,985
I'm going to ask you this time.

37
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,240
Your friend here doesn't want to confess.

38
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:45,498
Do you know
where his American father is hiding?

39
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,126
Sir, we don't know where he is.

40
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,463
Sir, I really don't know.
Please, believe me.

41
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,507
We don't even know him.

42
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,052
Please, sir…

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,847
-Just stop.
-Sir.

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,515
-Sir…
-That's enough!

45
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,852
-Sir, please. I'm telling the truth.
-Colonel, please. Enough of this.

46
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,021
-I really don't know.
-That's enough.

47
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,981
-Sir, I beg you.
-Stop it.

48
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,357
Please have mercy!

49
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,403
Please, stop.

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,115
Enough!

51
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,577
Why don't you just go to the house
of the person you're looking for?

52
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,247
I bet you know where he lives, don't you?

53
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,043
He's no longer there.

54
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,798
The American cowardly fled his home.

55
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,427
We've got information…

56
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,558
that he's leading a group against us.

57
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:50,146
I want to know where they are
and where they're hiding.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,898
I can't answer that, Colonel!

59
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,402
I haven't spoken to my father
since I was a kid.

60
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,279
Believe me or not!

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,621
Watanabe, continue.

62
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,057
Is this just about my father?

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,352
Is my father the only reason
you are doing this to us?

64
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,565
Or maybe you really want to punish me
because of Teresita?

65
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,265
Mom.

66
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,521
Please look after Eduardo in heaven, okay?

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,861
Keep him safe from harm.

68
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,578
And please don't let them
take him away from me.

69
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,353
Teresita is going to kill me with worry.

70
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,607
As soon as those girls arrive,
I'll punish them myself.

71
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,650
Father!

72
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,361
-Father.
-Hiroshi.

73
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,406
Where are Adelina and Teresita?

74
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,700
They're at Eduardo's house.

75
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,536
They're safe.

76
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,248
What are they doing there?

77
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,668
I'll explain later.
Just don't worry anymore.

78
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,713
Father, can I talk to you
in private, please?

79
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,507
Hiroshi…

80
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,969
What's going on?

81
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,846
Not here, Father.

82
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,229
Please excuse us.

83
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
Let's go, Father.

84
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,777
Where are they going?

85
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,155
Don't worry about them.

86
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,198
Worry about our daughter!

87
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,914
Please believe us.

88
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,670
We really don't know anything.
We have no reason to protect his father.

89
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,549
Sir, an American constabulary
killed my father when I was a child!

90
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,719
Even back then, we already hated them!

91
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,346
We have no reason to protect them!
We hate them!

92
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,807
All they do is abuse us!

93
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,809
Our country, our people!

94
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,022
We shouldn't be going through this!
You shouldn't be doing this to us!

95
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,191
We hate them too, sir!

96
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,612
You should despise those Americans.

97
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,867
They changed your culture and beliefs.

98
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,370
They made you believe you are inferior

99
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,958
and they are the superior race.

100
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,044
That's why you imitate them…

101
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,672
with your backward mindset.

102
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,719
Acting like little Americans…

103
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,473
with no real identities.

104
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,893
You don't fight back,
despite being abused.

105
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,562
You're no different from them.

106
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,274
You also invaded us.

107
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,488
You victimize our women.

108
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,407
And now,

109
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,622
you arrest and hurt our men
for baseless reasons!

110
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
What makes you different

111
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,506
from the foreigners who invaded us before?

112
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,176
You have no respect!

113
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,180
You insolent fool!

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,107
Don't stop until I say.

115
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,738
Enough! We don't know anything!

116
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,284
Sir, please stop!

117
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,868
Eduardo…

118
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
I remember that rosary.

119
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,322
Your brother gifted this to me.

120
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,994
I always carry it with me.

121
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,125
I knew it.

122
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,503
That's Mom's rosary.

123
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,181
Adelina, forgive me.
Do you want to have it back?

124
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,474
No, not at all.

125
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,309
No, Teresita.

126
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,897
Mom gave this to Eduardo.

127
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,691
If he gave it to you,

128
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,112
you are now its rightful owner.

129
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,621
Thank you.

130
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,295
Take good care of it, okay?

131
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,507
Don't let it break.

132
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,427
There's a superstition that, if it breaks,

133
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,432
you'll be separated and estranged
from whoever gave it to you.

134
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:36,612
But I'm sure that in your care,
it will never happen.

135
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,878
What's happening
to your brother right now?

136
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,632
It's so painful

137
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,801
that we can't leave.

138
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,095
We can't look for him.
We can't do anything.

139
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,431
Teresita.

140
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,933
Teresita. Look at me.

141
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
Hush now.

142
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,440
We must stay strong.

143
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,485
Let's pray that Eduardo gets home safe

144
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,321
so we can be with him again.

145
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,614
Okay?

146
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,828
How are you feeling?

147
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,997
Ouch.

148
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,094
You're lucky you survived the torture
those Japanese did to you earlier.

149
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,272
Yes, we weren't the only ones captured.

150
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,568
There are many other prisoners
in the cells.

151
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,114
You know,

152
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,826
I think…

153
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,499
Adelina and Teresita are our only hope.

154
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,004
Don't you think
they're looking for us right now?

155
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:06,095
There's no doubt they're looking for help
to find us.

156
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,389
Right?

157
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,892
Do you think…

158
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,313
Colonel Yuta would let Teresita

159
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,276
find or see me again?

160
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,364
Are you saying…

161
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,868
we can no longer leave this place?

162
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,241
Hiroshi, what are we going to talk about?

163
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,661
Eduardo and Tasyo were arrested.

164
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,040
Perhaps the Kempeitai did it.

165
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,416
Father.

166
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,377
Do you know where they are?

167
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,756
I don't know anything.

168
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,175
Why are you asking me?

169
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,219
Please stop pretending.

170
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,723
We knew this was going to happen, right?

171
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:38,228
Especially since you betrayed Eduardo.

172
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,815
Please, I'm begging you.

173
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,194
Please tell me

174
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,697
where Eduardo was taken.

175
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,242
I really don't know.

176
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,966
Go home. And don't blame the innocent,

177
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,884
or we'll all get into a fight here!

178
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,682
The Japanese are no longer here.
We kicked them out.

179
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,976
-Go, off with you.
-We need to protect you.

180
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:22,022
I still owe Eduardo a debt of gratitude.

181
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,863
Even though his stepfather…

182
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,162
killed your mother.

183
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,460
I saw how Eduardo defended us

184
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,797
from those who wanted
to capture us back then.

185
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,384
So why would I want him to be caught?

186
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,641
If that's the case, who could be…

187
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,913
Could it be Colonel Yuta?

188
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,375
Why are you accusing him?

189
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,879
What does he want from Eduardo?

190
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:39,475
Colonel, it seems that the two Filipinos

191
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,895
really know nothing.

192
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,024
No.

193
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
They must not be freed.

194
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,908
They will remain imprisoned here.

195
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,745
Especially Eduardo Dela Cruz.

196
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
I know Eduardo

197
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,335
and his secret fiancée…

198
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
Teresita Borromeo.

199
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,804
With all due respect, Colonel,

200
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,891
but is that the reason

201
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,605
why you want Eduardo to remain imprisoned

202
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,318
despite his innocence?

203
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,737
Come to think of it, Colonel.

204
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,697
It will be easier for you

205
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,910
to take Miss Teresita for yourself if…

206
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,453
Hey!

207
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,208
I think you're forgetting
your place, Captain.

208
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,007
Forgive me, Colonel.

209
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,390
It won't happen again.

210
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,729
Damn you.

211
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,886
Colonel?

212
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,895
Are you there?

213
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,675
Colonel?

214
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,022
Colonel?

215
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,238
Colonel!

216
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,370
You fool!

217
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,872
Stupid fool!

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,418
What are you saying?

219
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,046
Are you stupid?

220
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,308
Enough, please!

221
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,855
Don't meddle here, translator!

222
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,276
How will the locals trust us

223
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
if we keep hurting them?

224
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,200
We can't earn their trust like this.

225
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,995
Why are you meddling here?

226
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,887
The Japanese are also heartless.

227
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,308
They're just like the Americans.

228
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,560
They only care about their own country.

229
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,522
They have no compassion
for the country they invaded.

230
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,864
Don't let them hear you.
They might come back for us.

231
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:18,003
We need to get out of here, Tasyo.
They will kill us.

232
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,675
But how?

233
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,939
Well? Where's your courage now?

234
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,609
You're so lame.

235
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,908
Ouch!

236
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,701
Ouch!

237
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,119
What is this commotion?

238
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,418
-Apologies, Colonel!
-Apologies, Colonel!

239
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,766
Why are you here again, Tanaka?

240
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,353
Everyone else, return to your posts!

241
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,354
Yes, sir!

242
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,445
Apologies, Colonel.

243
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,282
I only came here

244
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,869
because I want to ask you
about my friend Eduardo.

245
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,498
Eduardo Dela Cruz, Colonel.

246
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,293
He was arrested by our soldiers earlier,

247
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,756
and I think the Kempeitai did it.

248
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,218
Apologies for what
I'm about to ask, Colonel.

249
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,223
But did you have anything to do with it?

250
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,151
Two soldiers come every morning

251
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:10,407
to check if a prisoner has died
or take one prisoner to torture.

252
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,200
My friends, help me!

253
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,036
Don't be a hero
if you don't want to die here now.

254
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,372
COMING UP

255
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:29,801
If Eduardo is killed by the same soldiers
who abducted him and Tasyo,

256
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,636
I'll leave.

257
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,805
-Where will you go?
-To the mountains.

258
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,309
I will join the Filipinos
who are fighting against your army.

259
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:42,189
They will kill us
by torture, hunger, and thirst.

260
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,774
Then join us, friends.

261
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,901
We will escape.

262
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,202
