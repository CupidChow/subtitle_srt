1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,795
<i>It's so easy to eliminate the guerrillas.</i>

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>They confess pretty easily
once they're captured.</i>

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,303
<i>Who are your other comrades?</i>

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>I won't betray my people!</i>

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>- Bad news.
- What is it, Nando?</i>

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>- Marcel's dead.</i>
- Those bastards!

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>I have something for you.</i>

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>I saw this poster on the street.</i>

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>- Have you heard anything from Hiroshi?
- No. I don't even know where he is.</i>

10
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>Now!</i>

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,037
<i>What's happening? Why are there gunshots?</i>

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>Please, let's take a different route!</i>

13
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>- We're going to get killed here!
- No! Our men need us!</i>

14
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,252
Eduardo!

15
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>Your brother's alive?</i>

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,631
Then the Japanese were lying
when they told everyone he's dead?

17
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,718
Eduardo's very much alive, Luis.

18
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>- I saw Eduardo again.
- Isn't he dead?</i>

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,600
That's what I thought too.
But I'm sure I wasn't mistaken.

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,603
We might get a full moon tomorrow
or the next day.

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>I was hoping to see my sister again.</i>

22
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>Take me to the guerillas.
I want to talk to them.</i>

23
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>Why are you outside?</i>

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,611
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,490
- I'm not your enemy.
<i>- Everything's all set.</i>

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,201
A priest will come tomorrow
to officiate our wedding.

27
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,162
- Yuta, maybe we can…
<i>- We've already talked about this.</i>

28
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,291
It would be more favorable for you
to marry me right away.

29
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,921
PREVIOUSLY

30
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,171
If you lower your gun,
we won't hurt your comrade.

31
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,215
Just let us go, please!

32
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,177
Put down your gun
or I'll kill him right before your eyes!

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,680
Lower your gun!

34
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,268
Shove it farther away!

35
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,696
Teresita.

36
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,742
I wish I could see you tomorrow.

37
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,249
Where are you, Eduardo?

38
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,132
You and my father must find me.

39
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,638
Please save me

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,436
before I'm wed to the devil.

41
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,587
What are you doing here, Luis?

42
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,589
Where's Dado?

43
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,175
We bring important news.

44
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,968
He's no longer part of our group.

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,347
We don't know if that guy's dead or alive.

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,348
So what's the news?

47
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,357
Marcel is dead.

48
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,652
The Japanese killed him.

49
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,657
And we will avenge his death.

50
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,743
We're going to storm Fort Santiago.

51
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,079
That's not going to be easy.

52
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,291
There are too many enemies.

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,043
We're no match for them.

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,712
Who are you?

55
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,641
Forgot me already?

56
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,854
Tasyo?

57
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,126
Celso, where's the Commander?

58
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,669
I don't know.

59
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,507
So you caught the Japanese soldier.

60
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
That's enough, Celso!

61
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,472
Your men abducted my wife!

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,809
I'm asking for forgiveness
on their behalf.

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,438
Not all Japanese are bad.

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,734
- There are also good ones.
- That's not true.

65
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,154
- You're all the same!
- Don't touch him!

66
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,661
I know him.

67
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,873
Mr. Borromeo.

68
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,720
Warm yourself up before you leave.

69
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,430
Thank you.

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,774
I still can't believe it, Tasyo.

71
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,902
You survived!

72
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,073
Eduardo will be thrilled to hear this.

73
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,576
But you don't know where he is, do you?

74
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,706
Never mind.

75
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,502
What's important is
he's still out there fighting.

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,091
The Lord is kind.
I know we'll meet again one day.

77
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,184
Adelina?

78
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,520
The carriage is here.

79
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,064
It's time to go.

80
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,235
We better get going, Tasyo.

81
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,072
Are we still going to see
each other again?

82
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,157
Why? Miss me already?

83
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,579
You haven't changed one bit.

84
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,705
Just kidding.

85
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,958
My jokes are all I have left.

86
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,379
We also have to go.

87
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
We're heading back to the mountains.

88
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,510
So…

89
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,638
pray for us, Adelina.

90
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,557
For all of us.

91
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,771
That once this war finally ends,
we can all see each other again.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,609
Be careful out there.

93
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,987
And yes.

94
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,907
I believe we will all
see each other again.

95
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,287
Let's go.

96
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,831
Adelina.

97
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,634
- Bye.
- Bye.

98
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,067
You can just leave me here, Eduardo.

99
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,445
Where are you going, Auntie?

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,656
I don't know.

101
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,493
To our old house, I guess.

102
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,622
I'll find out where Luisa and Lauro are.

103
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,209
And you?

104
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,086
We can take care of ourselves.

105
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,715
Let's just meet here on the third day.

106
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,385
- Be careful, okay?
- You too.

107
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,645
Uncle, where are we headed now?

108
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,984
To the nearest garrison.

109
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,695
Teresita might be there.

110
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,405
Let's go.

111
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,791
Where's Teresita?

112
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,795
The priest is getting impatient.
Bring her down already.

113
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,837
Yes, sir!

114
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,218
She's here. They're on their way down.

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,533
You're so beautiful, Mrs. Saitoh.

116
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,079
I'm not your wife yet.

117
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,291
You will be in a while.

118
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,668
Come on.

119
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,716
My bride is here.

120
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,427
Let's start my wedding!

121
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,864
Let's check inside.

122
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,909
We'll be back.

123
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,311
Help. Help me.

124
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,357
Help me.

125
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,068
Help me.

126
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,528
Hey! What are you doing?

127
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,223
Looks like they're hiding women
in that garrison, Juan.

128
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,101
But first, I need to get you away.

129
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,520
Go back to the store we passed by earlier.

130
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
Wait for me there.

131
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,904
- What are you going to do, sir?
- I'll get inside that garrison.

132
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,989
Maybe Teresita's inside.

133
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,007
Adelina!

134
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,927
Adelina.

135
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,763
What took you so long?

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,350
For a second,
I thought you've abandoned me.

137
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,522
Luisa, that will never happen.

138
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,360
Ma'am Yolanda, is Daddy Johnny here?

139
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,947
He went to the theater last night.

140
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,785
He said he'd be home soon,
but he's still not here.

141
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,581
We've been worried sick all night.

142
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,876
You're right, it's already morning.

143
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,505
Luis, why don't you go
check on Daddy Johnny?

144
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,048
Go.

145
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,810
Adelina.

146
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,231
Luisa and I haven't eaten.

147
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,901
There's no food left here.

148
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,405
You know how food is rationed these days.

149
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,450
I couldn't even leave the house.

150
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,327
Luisa would be all alone.

151
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,750
Fine, I'll take care of it.

152
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,187
<i>Eduardo and I will fight for our love.</i>

153
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,398
I knew I made the right choice
when I chose you.

154
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>Thank you for being honest, Teresita.</i>

155
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,655
<i>I'll marry you right away
so no one else can take you from me.</i>

156
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,790
Enough with the words and sermons.

157
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,084
We don't need that anymore.

158
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,964
- Yes, Colonel.
- Get to the point and be quick!

159
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,257
Forgive me.

160
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,677
Let's go straight to your wedding vows.

161
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,682
Shouldn't we go back
to the wedding ceremony?

162
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,475
Who'll stand guard here?

163
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,270
The women might try to escape.

164
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,524
That's impossible. The gate is locked.

165
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,735
You go. I'll stay here.

166
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,002
Colonel Yuta Saitoh, do you take

167
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:25,007
Teresita Borromeo
as your lawfully wedded wife?

168
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,946
Do you promise to love,

169
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:53,035
respect, and care for her
until death do you part?

170
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,245
Yes, Father.

171
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,622
I do.

172
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,583
Teresita Borromeo,

173
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:06,006
do you take Yuta Saitoh

174
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,967
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

175
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,720
And do you also promise to love him

176
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,473
and care for him until death do you part?

177
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,994
Teresita.

178
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,247
Don't embarrass me.

179
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,625
Answer him now.

180
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,219
Sir.

181
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,390
- I knew you'd help me.
- Is this all of you?

182
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,478
- Where are the other women?
- One of them is outside.

183
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,028
Teresita.

184
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,364
<i>She's surrounded by soldiers.</i>

185
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,992
We can no longer help her.

186
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,870
Let's go, before they come up here.

187
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
Hurry up!

188
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,406
Sir! Let's go!

189
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,538
Yes.

190
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,541
Yes, Father.

191
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,355
Let's go.

192
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,401
Long live the newlyweds!

193
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:36,907
- Long live!
- Long live!

194
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,576
Long live!

195
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,485
Help me.

196
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,950
I don't want to die yet.

197
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,335
I am a friend of Hiroshi.

198
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,636
Adelina.

199
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,852
No! Don't hurt me!

200
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:53,192
Are you going to cooperate
with the Japanese Imperial Army or not?

201
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,944
Dad!

202
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>Dad!</i>

203
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,411
Please, I'm begging you.
May I please go with my father?

204
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,039
You just try!

205
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,386
Hurry up!

206
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,395
- Sir, he has the key!
- Get it! Quick!

207
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,544
Long live!

208
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,755
- Long live!
- Long live!

209
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,549
Long live Colonel Yuta and his wife!

210
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,886
- Long live!
- Long live!

211
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,140
Colonel!

212
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,937
The women…

213
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,482
- The women escaped.
- What?

214
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,069
How did they escape?

215
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:23,407
A Filipino man helped them.

216
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,076
- He was able to get inside.
- Useless idiot!

217
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,578
Go after them!

218
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,122
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

219
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,626
Arrest all of them!

220
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,213
And bring that damn man to me!

221
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,674
This way!

222
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,810
<i>What did the Filipino look like?</i>

223
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,770
<i>He looks like a foreigner, Colonel.</i>

224
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,149
<i>He's also very tall and handsome.</i>

225
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,361
You can join our group
if you can prove yourself to us.

226
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,492
- I really don't know.
- You can't fool me!

227
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,871
<i>You run this place.
You must know something.</i>

228
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>- Eduardo!</i>
- Adelina?

229
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,877
COMING UP
