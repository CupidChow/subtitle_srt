1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,752
Your parents are safe now.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,921
Let's go. We need to get away from here.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,799
But where will we go now, sir?

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,427
Are you an idiot?

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,766
I am certain Dela Cruz will find a way

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,603
to see his sister again.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,649
I think I know where he might be.
He's probably waiting for us there.

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,445
-Eduardo!
-Eduardo…

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,406
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to our meeting place.

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,159
What did you do against them?
What do they need from you?

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,702
Their heartless colonel.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,121
He kept asking me about my father.

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,166
And when we couldn't answer,
we'd be tortured.

14
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,169
He was on the verge of killing us.
That's why we attempted to escape.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,923
Many of our men were not fortunate.
Only Mario and I survived.

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,633
Where's Tasyo? Why isn't he with you?

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
He was shot while we were escaping.

18
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,513
And I don't know if he's still alive.

19
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,141
-Why don't you just kill me?
-I can!

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,104
I can still use you against your friend.

21
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,900
Mario and I have no other choice now,
but to go to the mountains.

22
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,777
I know you're not like that.

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,698
Mario and I owe our second life
to those who have died.

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,911
It would be unfair to them
if we become selfish.

25
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,039
I understand your decision
and I respect it.

26
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,040
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm sure the next time we meet,
Hiroshi, we'll be enemies.

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,090
But rest assured, I will still treat you
like a brother and a friend.

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,175
Like I told you.

30
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,219
I promise too, my friend.

31
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,176
The girls went out again?

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,345
It's already late!

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,347
Where could they be?

34
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,641
I don't know.

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,602
They shouldn't be out at this time.

36
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,069
My daughter's stubbornness
will be the death of me!

37
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,612
Señora?

38
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,115
Señora, there are Japanese soldiers here.

39
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,366
They're looking for you.

40
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,795
Adelina.

41
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,382
Teresita.

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,886
Please.

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,765
You heard what Hiroshi said.

44
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,603
To serve one's country,

45
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,564
in any way or action,

46
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,108
is an obligation.

47
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,155
I know we're all against this war.

48
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,617
But me,

49
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,245
I'm no longer afraid

50
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,625
to fight for our freedom.

51
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,922
Eduardo.

52
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,092
This is no ordinary fight.

53
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,763
This is not a baseball game.

54
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,599
You can't just go home
and have a good laugh after.

55
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,935
Lives are at stake here.

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,478
Yours.

57
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,607
Exactly, Adelina.

58
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,569
If I can give my all in baseball,

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,325
I can do the same
for our struggling country.

60
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,627
You're not listening to us, Eduardo.

61
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,465
You two don't understand me.

62
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,595
I understand and appreciate your concern.

63
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,143
But I have to do this.

64
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
There's not a single Filipino

65
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,944
who's not willing to serve
and fight for their country,

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,489
especially in hard times like these.

67
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,245
Let's hope this war won't last long.

68
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,874
It won't even take a year

69
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,963
because I know the Americans
wouldn't abandon us.

70
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,592
You'll see.

71
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,513
I'll be back.

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,143
We'll be together soon.

73
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,650
I'm not just doing this for our country,

74
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,195
but also for Tasyo…

75
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,491
and my safety.

76
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,786
I'm doing this for you.

77
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,124
So that…

78
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,337
our country can finally have peace.

79
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,274
Fine, I won't stop you.

80
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,820
But promise me…

81
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,656
promise me

82
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,036
you'll come back to us alive.

83
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,088
It seems you've made up
your mind, Eduardo.

84
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,683
Teresita is right.

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,979
Promise us.

86
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,734
You must give us your word.

87
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,740
You'll leave us alive.

88
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,161
And you'll come back alive.

89
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,332
Promise us, okay?

90
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,380
My princesses.

91
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,345
I promise…

92
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,975
that I will do everything

93
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:22,525
to return home alive
for the two women I love.

94
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:34,579
Don't forget to write to us,
so we know you're safe.

95
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,038
She's right.

96
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,293
We want to be sure you're safe,
wherever you are.

97
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,297
Don't forget to write to us, okay?

98
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,258
I promise.

99
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,676
I promise.

100
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,931
I'll stay alive and write to you.

101
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,956
So this is how it feels.

102
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:32,094
When we were kids,
everything was just so simple.

103
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,140
But now,

104
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,061
the world has changed.

105
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,234
You're joining the guerillas now, Eduardo.

106
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,572
And we'll stay here
and work at the theater.

107
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,121
We'll be going our separate ways.

108
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,126
My heart is aching.

109
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:12,510
I can't explain
this emptiness I'm feeling.

110
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,066
How about we make a pact?

111
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,737
Whenever there's a full moon,

112
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,073
we'll meet here.

113
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,117
Not just to see each other,

114
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,455
but to make sure we're alive and safe.

115
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,835
I agree.

116
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,339
I'll come here every full moon.

117
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,343
Not as a member
of the Japanese Imperial Army,

118
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,974
but as a true and loyal friend.

119
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,693
No matter where I may be,

120
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,530
I'll make sure to return here

121
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,033
even for just a short while.

122
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,227
Everyone.

123
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:51,776
I don't mean to interrupt,
but it's almost curfew.

124
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,329
We have to go.

125
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,749
You should go home too.

126
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,753
Take care, my friend.

127
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,548
You too, my friend.

128
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,387
Let's all stay safe for each other.

129
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,227
Eduardo.

130
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,752
Goodbye.

131
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,862
My Lord.

132
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,619
Please watch over my brother
and his companion.

133
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,873
Fix yourselves up.

134
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,251
They must not find out who we met with.

135
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,344
This is just like performing on stage.

136
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,599
What people see is not the same
as how we really feel.

137
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,677
Let's rest for a while, sir.

138
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,492
Are you crying, sir?

139
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,916
It hurts…

140
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,671
and it's hard to part ways
with the people you love.

141
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,757
You're still lucky.

142
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,720
You got to say your goodbyes.

143
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,807
Unlike me, sir.

144
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,396
Where are we headed now?

145
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,164
Weren't you in the ROTC?

146
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,918
Where are they now?

147
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,964
Last I heard they were in Rizal.

148
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,675
That's where they're hiding, sir.

149
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,511
Then that's where we'll go.

150
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,430
Good.

151
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,768
I'll tell them what the Japanese did to me

152
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,896
and my parents.

153
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,900
Someday,

154
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,861
I'll have my revenge.

155
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,744
Colonel.

156
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,747
Our children have arrived.

157
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,770
Mario, we're not joining the war
to get revenge.

158
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,772
Why not, sir?

159
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,192
We've done nothing wrong,
yet they imprisoned us.

160
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,737
We can't even return to our families.

161
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,367
They must pay for what they've done.

162
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,162
Listen to me.

163
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,960
We're joining the war

164
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:50,843
so no one has to experience
what we're going through right now.

165
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,184
If we defeat the Japanese
and drive them out,

166
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,148
they won't harm our countrymen ever again.

167
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,318
And once that happens,

168
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:13,240
we can finally go home to our families,
peacefully and without worry.

169
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,284
Isn't that what we want?

170
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,090
That's all I want.

171
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,763
To go home to my sister…

172
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,933
and the woman I love.

173
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,205
My daughters. Hiroshi.

174
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,625
Colonel Yuta has been looking for you.

175
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,796
Colonel.

176
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,133
It's almost curfew.

177
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,805
Where have you been?

178
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,393
We were on a stroll, Colonel.

179
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,650
We've been informed

180
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:35,489
that Eduardo escaped from prison.

181
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,867
We know.

182
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,164
The Kempeitai came here earlier.

183
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,336
-You didn't know, Colonel?
-Teresita.

184
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,760
You went on a stroll?

185
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:03,225
Or did you meet up with Eduardo Dela Cruz?

186
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,168
Curfew has started.

187
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,715
The Japanese soldiers
will start patrolling soon.

188
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,927
That means we can't go any further.

189
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:46,143
We better rest for now.
We're already tired anyway.

190
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,564
But where will we rest?

191
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,733
How old are you again?

192
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,860
Fifteen, sir.

193
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,529
You're still young.

194
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,492
But it's like you've gotten older
because of the torture.

195
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,204
Our imprisonment…

196
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
The beatings we've experienced…

197
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
As much as we hate them,

198
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,462
we'll carry these memories forever.

199
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,133
This is only the beginning, Mario.

200
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,678
I'm telling you.

201
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,473
Now that we're at war,

202
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,019
you can never go back
to the way you were before.

203
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,397
You must be strong,

204
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:38,612
because our old lives are gone.

205
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:45,077
In prison, we slept on cold floors.

206
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,455
Here, we sleep on the ground.

207
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,137
What about you, sir?

208
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,931
Aren't you going to sleep?

209
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,559
My troubled mind won't let me.

210
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,399
And we need to take turns sleeping
so there's always someone keeping watch.

211
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,654
Go ahead and rest.

212
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:26,201
We'll head out tomorrow
once the Japanese patrols end.

213
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,682
Why won't you answer?

214
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,491
Did you meet with Eduardo?

215
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,842
So be careful.

216
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,385
Especially you, Teresita.

217
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,387
You cannot trust that man.

218
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,767
And you must not let our colonel know
you're aware of what happened.

219
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,977
If by chance you encounter him again,

220
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,939
you must pretend you know nothing
about what happened to Eduardo.

221
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,859
Why are you looking for Eduardo?

222
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,699
From what I know,
he didn't do anything wrong.

223
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,745
That's why he shouldn't go back to prison.

224
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,956
Teresita!

225
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,919
Don't talk back to the colonel.

226
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,178
Apologize right now.

227
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:21,525
Colonel, we did not meet up with anybody.

228
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:27,948
I would never betray our country
by condoning the wrong.

229
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,455
I can attest they didn't meet with
Eduardo Dela Cruz

230
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,083
because I was with them the whole time.

231
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:44,881
That man can never go near them again.

232
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,968
No matter what, Colonel.

233
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,144
Do you need anything else?

234
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,732
If we're done here,
we would like to rest now.

235
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,238
You're free to leave, miss.

236
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:36,641
As a mother,
I want my daughter to marry a foreigner.

237
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,518
Someone like you, Colonel.

238
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,729
She can be a good ally.

239
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,857
Yes, she will.
She's been an ally for some time now.

240
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,580
Don't just let them oppress us

241
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,790
as if your heart has turned to stone.

242
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,626
Because if you do,

243
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,086
you'll be turning your back
on our friendship.

244
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,838
We need to keep moving.

245
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,132
And we need to be more careful
now that the sun is out.

246
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,678
We'll be caught by the soldiers
if we act hastily.

247
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,431
What must we do to catch the fugitive?

248
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:20,018
Don't worry about them.

249
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,729
I will take care of Teresita

250
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,981
and Eduardo's sister.

251
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,943
I'll take care of Adelina Dela Cruz.

252
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,778
COMING UP

253
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,701
