1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,420
If you use your head,

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,632
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,761
Despite who you are to these people,
you still have some good in you.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,390
I don't want to generalize,
but many of them

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:21,271
are like wolves in sheep's clothing.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,607
Women, go to your rooms.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,025
Don't worry.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,569
No one will touch any of you.

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,904
They're killing our men,

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,407
-they're abducting our women…
-Dad.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,617
…and they are stealing
our country from us!

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,536
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,205
-If you cooperate,
-Dad!

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,000
-we'll be good friends.
-Dad!

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,003
-Dad!
-But if you resist and fight,

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,172
-we'll be your worst enemies.
-Dad.

17
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:52,302
Teresita, you need to understand
that your charm is your weapon.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,012
But what about Teresita?

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,141
Can we really accept
her sacrifice for our sake?

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,726
What does my son know about warfare?

21
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,147
He wasn't trained for that.
He'll only die there.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,982
This place is heavily guarded, Eduardo.

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,944
Even if we ever get in,
we will never get out alive.

24
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,614
I need to know which camp Teresita is in.

25
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,657
I need to find her.

26
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,285
Hey! Who are you?

27
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,175
I'm worried about Julio, Mr. Tanaka.

28
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,513
I know we've been arguing a lot,

29
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
but he's still my husband.

30
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,732
I apologize for what happened to you

31
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:35,113
and for the actions of Captain Watanabe

32
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,452
and his men against you.

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,630
My apologies, Mr. Tanaka.

34
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,676
I would like to go to my room now.

35
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,381
Who are you?

36
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,968
My apologies. Is there a problem?

37
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,971
Do you know this soldier?

38
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,015
He's not answering me.

39
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,818
You're leaving?

40
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,781
Where are you going?

41
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,494
Anywhere. Somewhere far away.

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,915
Living with a Japanese suffocates me.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,335
Why?

44
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,879
What has Mr. Tanaka done to Julio?

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,299
Do you still expect me to respect him

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,886
when every now and then,
I'd see him welcome Akio

47
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:27,392
or any Japanese soldier
that visits his house?

48
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,649
I don't think I can hold back
from killing those damned Japanese myself.

49
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,650
Hey.

50
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,610
Adelina, watch your mouth!

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,117
I don't give a damn
about what they think of us, señora.

52
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,500
You saw what they did to my father.

53
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,171
To your husband.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,510
They shot him.

55
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:10,435
They shot my father
without any hesitation!

56
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,187
And where will they take him?

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,192
How can we be sure
they'll take him to a hospital?

58
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,738
What if they just let him die?

59
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,281
How can they be so cruel?

60
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,366
They don't even have an ounce of pity!

61
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,618
Adelina!

62
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,080
That's why you need
to be careful with your words.

63
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,627
If you keep provoking them like that,
you'll only get us killed.

64
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,133
I can't stay here any longer.

65
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,935
But you can't leave, Adelina.

66
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,732
Julio and Teresita are gone.

67
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,776
And now, you're leaving too?

68
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,657
This is a first, señora.

69
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,578
-You want me to stay?
-Of course.

70
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,707
You're the only one
who can help me find Teresita.

71
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,131
Have you ever thought
that this was all your fault?

72
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,261
Dad already told you

73
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,768
that the damned Colonel was the one
behind my sister's disappearance!

74
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,978
But you didn't listen!

75
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,064
You didn't believe him!

76
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,983
Don't accuse the Colonel like that.

77
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:51,077
You saw how cruel the Japanese can be.

78
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,995
And what?

79
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,082
You're still turning a blind eye?

80
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,046
Are you going to wait
for Teresita to be killed in front of you

81
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,589
before you come to your senses?

82
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,311
-Teresita.
-Lorena.

83
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,903
Teresita, you don't have
to sacrifice yourself for us.

84
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,905
Especially when you're also suffering.

85
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,241
Lorena, don't worry about me.

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,079
There's nothing else to sacrifice
because they already got what they wanted!

87
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:40,209
But that doesn't mean we're giving up.

88
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,050
Tell them to get ready.

89
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,887
I'll take advantage of Yuta being here.

90
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
I'll use him.

91
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,687
I'll find a way for us to escape.

92
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,530
You'll never raise your hand
against me again.

93
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,866
Señora.

94
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,247
If you still want to get along
with those Japanese, fine!

95
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,252
But you will not force me
because I despise them!

96
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,173
Fine.

97
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,552
Get out.

98
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:37,350
Get out and leave this place,
you ungrateful wench!

99
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,686
I took you in.

100
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,688
I fed you.

101
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,735
But now when I need your help
and ask you to stay,

102
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,904
you act all high and mighty?

103
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
Fine, get out.

104
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,997
Get out. I don't want to see
your face in this house!

105
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,415
Get out!

106
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,750
I really will

107
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,586
because I can no longer stand you.

108
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,673
I've endured you for so long.

109
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,717
But now that Dad and Teresita are gone,

110
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,054
there's no reason for me
to stay here with you!

111
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,849
You're despicable. Get out!

112
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,534
My God.

113
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,038
They're all gone.

114
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,794
I'm all alone now.

115
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,357
He's my friend.

116
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,069
He's half-Japanese, half-German.

117
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,865
And he's deaf-mute.

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,578
He can't speak or hear,

119
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,165
but he's a very capable soldier.

120
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,337
So please, don't worry about it.

121
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,257
Okay.

122
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,973
Thank you, Ryo.

123
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,266
What are you doing here?

124
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,310
Why did you come in here?

125
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,355
Let's not talk here.

126
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,690
Let's go.

127
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,668
Why are you here, Filipino?

128
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,169
Where's the Colonel?

129
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,757
I have new information
about Eduardo Dela Cruz.

130
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,080
She's gone.

131
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,333
She left.

132
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,255
Mr. Tanaka.

133
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,511
I'm glad she left.

134
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:05,391
Luck is finally on my side
now that the bastard's gone.

135
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,691
What Julio went through pains my heart.

136
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,777
I'm afraid that

137
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,489
his life may be even in greater danger

138
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783
now that he's in the hands
of the Japanese.

139
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,205
If they don't kill him,
I'm sure they'll imprison him.

140
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,583
I thought so too.

141
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,501
Daddy Johnny.

142
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,507
Adelina.

143
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,094
We are sorry
for what happened to your father.

144
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,813
Let's go.

145
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
Let's prepare for our program.

146
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,538
Just a moment.

147
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:14,960
Marcel.

148
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,464
Sir Luis.

149
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,718
You saw what happened at the plaza.

150
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,096
We also witnessed

151
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,351
how you sided with Carmela
and the Japanese.

152
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,770
We were forced to.

153
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,816
It was a direct order from Colonel Saitoh.

154
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,278
I was imprisoned, Marcel.

155
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,866
He found out I met with Eduardo

156
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,618
and that I know where he is.

157
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,538
He told me he would release me
on one condition,

158
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,625
and that was to convince
the locals to side with them.

159
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,380
You shouldn't have come here.

160
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,881
What if I didn't recognize you?

161
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,551
It's too dangerous,
and now you've gotten me involved.

162
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,136
I'm looking for my fiancée
who was taken by your soldiers.

163
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,766
Do you have any women here, Ryo?

164
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,934
No.

165
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,644
None.

166
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,105
There are no women here.

167
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,358
Don't you dare cover up
for your comrades, Ryo.

168
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,861
We both know they're up to no good.

169
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,154
Not in this camp.

170
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,323
We don't have women here.

171
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,826
Then give me a list of your camps.

172
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,745
You!

173
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,831
Yes, Lieutenant.

174
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,834
Where is Ryo? I have an order for him.

175
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,255
But why would I put
our own army in danger, Eduardo?

176
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,425
You should leave before anyone notices.

177
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,761
I won't be able to protect you
if that happens.

178
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,851
I need the list of your camps.

179
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,897
How shameless of them.

180
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,276
I wouldn't wish for any father like mine

181
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,404
to be deprived of justice
and suffer under our enemies,

182
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,201
including women and men
who are being abducted,

183
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,037
tortured, and imprisoned.

184
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,041
I'm sick of this.

185
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,670
You can count on me, Sir Louis.

186
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,798
I accept your offer.

187
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,804
My mind is set on becoming a spy
for the guerrillas.

188
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,737
-Where is he?
-He was just here a while ago.

189
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,407
He was with the deaf-mute soldier.

190
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,452
Which deaf-mute soldier?

191
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,122
A new soldier arrived earlier.

192
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,500
Ryo said he was deaf-mute.

193
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,543
They were together a while ago.

194
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,420
Adjutant!

195
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,381
Come here this instant! Adjutant!

196
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,885
Yes, Lieutenant.

197
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,698
Do we have a deaf-mute soldier
around here?

198
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,242
We don't have a soldier like that here!

199
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,161
What do you mean there's none?

200
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,497
I came face to face with him earlier.

201
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,583
I keep a detailed record of everyone here.

202
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,712
I'm certain that none
of our soldiers are deaf-mute.

203
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,463
You're useless!

204
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,965
Soldiers!

205
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,302
We've been infiltrated!

206
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,304
-Find the enemy now!
-Yes, sir!

207
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,824
Are you sure about this, Adelina?

208
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,784
What we do is dangerous.

209
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,663
The Japanese stole
everyone I've ever loved.

210
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,043
I'm all alone now.

211
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,504
It's time I fight back.

212
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,549
But before you begin,

213
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,343
we need to test you first.

214
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,310
What are you three whispering about?

215
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,859
I was wondering about where she'll stay.

216
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
She's staying with me.
That was the agreement from the start.

217
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,159
Now that's settled,
I need to talk to someone now.

218
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,505
Adelina.

219
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,298
Listen to Luis.

220
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,093
Follow his instructions to avoid trouble.

221
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,676
Hurry up!

222
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,530
-Wait!
-Move!

223
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,489
-Why?
-Move!

224
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,040
Hey!

225
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,764
Damn it!

226
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,685
He's on the other side!

227
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,984
After him!

228
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,156
You, climb up! Hurry!

229
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,475
Let's go.

230
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,935
Wait.

231
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,816
Do you have any troops
keeping watch at Fort Santiago?

232
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,654
I want to know what they did to my dad.

233
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,490
Is he being treated and locked up?

234
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,034
Or is he dead?

235
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,079
I want to know.

236
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,249
Do we have people there?

237
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,335
We'll take care of it.

238
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,129
We will.

239
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,340
Let's go.

240
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,561
Dad.

241
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,438
Eduardo.

242
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,776
Wherever you and Teresita are,

243
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,616
I'll fight for you too.

244
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,045
How will Teresita sneak us out?

245
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,589
She didn't say.

246
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,466
She told me she would handle it.

247
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,052
But I'm worried about her.

248
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,888
What if she fails again?

249
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,974
Don't say that.

250
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,686
She needs to succeed.

251
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,191
Tell the others
that no one sleeps tonight.

252
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,360
Just make sure to keep this quiet.

253
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,653
Okay.

254
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,966
He's getting away!

255
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,932
Grenade!

256
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,201
No, I'm all right.

257
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,286
Let's go.

258
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,965
Filipino bastards!

259
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,884
Kill them all! Make them pay!

260
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,389
December 8, señor.

261
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,807
What's your mission?

262
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,308
Love for the Philippines.

263
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,434
Be careful with this.

264
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,978
This is very important.

265
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,522
This will be a big help to our guerrillas.

266
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,024
Hey, kid! Stop!
I have something to ask you.

267
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,068
Hey! Stop!

268
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,069
You monsters!

269
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,281
They may want me to die here,
but you cannot die too.

270
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,117
Die, you bastards!

271
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,451
Damn you, Colonel!

272
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,996
The devil is sleeping soundly.

273
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,373
We can't miss this chance.

274
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,334
Before the sun rises tomorrow,
we'll go on a journey.

275
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,670
We'll check every garrison,

276
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,840
and we will free these women
from the grasp of our enemies.

277
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:30,927
You're worse than a traitor!

278
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,597
You deserve to die.

279
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,558
COMING UP

280
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,356
