1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,171
You've realized the Japanese
were never truly our friends.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,131
You're right.

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:10,844
Now, both of my siblings have been hurt
because of them.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,388
I'm beginning to despise them.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,352
-Please stop!
-They won't touch you.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,647
Don't listen to their screams
and cries for help.

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,399
My child is sick.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,902
And I need money to buy medicine,
can you lend me some?

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,195
On one condition.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,072
I have something for you to do.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,827
I want Adelina gone
from our lives as well as the Tanakas.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,663
I can't stop thinking
about what they might do

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,041
to your sister.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,917
Papa.

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,127
Adelina.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,170
Hiroshi.

17
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,338
Eduardo, my love.

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,758
Where are you?

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,594
Help me.

20
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,554
Why did I dream about Teresita?

21
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,389
God Almighty.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,016
I hope my princesses are safe.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,394
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,520
Don't thank me.

25
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,814
That man wasn't afraid of me.

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,107
He's afraid of our master.

27
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,735
-Who is your master?
-You'll meet him soon.

28
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,196
It seems that her arrest was a secret.

29
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,822
And for what reason?

30
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,699
You better ask the Colonel.

31
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,910
He'll know the answer to that.

32
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,836
Señora.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,340
I never wanted this
to happen to my sister.

34
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,301
Please believe me.

35
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,595
I tried to save her, but…

36
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,022
I don't need to hear
any explanation from you.

37
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,820
That won't bring back my only child.

38
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,368
Welcome back, Colonel.

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,499
Mrs. Borromeo called earlier.

40
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,671
She's asking for help because her daughter
was abducted by our soldiers.

41
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:39,093
Mr. Hiroshi Tanaka is also
waiting for you inside, Colonel.

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,733
Colonel.

43
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,362
Leave us.

44
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,947
Yes, sir!

45
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,954
What do you want from me, Hiroshi?

46
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,625
Do you know where Teresita Borromeo is?

47
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,171
Did you have something to do
with her arrest?

48
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,427
I had fun!

49
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,475
Takeda!

50
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,519
I feel great!

51
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm exhausted.

52
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,382
Can you hear me?

53
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,623
I can hear you.

54
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,967
Are you accusing me, Tanaka?

55
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,556
Are you insulting a colonel?

56
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
No, sir.

57
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,893
Forgive me.

58
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,395
I was only asking.

59
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,856
I know what happened to Teresita.

60
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,153
I heard about it at the theater
where she was performing.

61
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,739
Don't worry.

62
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,117
I have already taken care of it.

63
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,995
I don't know…

64
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,624
what to say.

65
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,461
What's your name?

66
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,881
Manuela.

67
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,093
Manuela.

68
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm Teresita.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,810
Teresita?

70
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,482
What a beautiful name.

71
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,027
You're named after a saint.

72
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,322
Are you the new girl
they brought in today?

73
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,116
Yes.

74
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,291
I know…

75
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,253
no words can ease your pain.

76
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,513
I saw what they did.

77
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,269
I heard everything.

78
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,778
What you went through was terrifying.

79
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,622
I wanted to help you, but…

80
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,210
there was nothing I could do.

81
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,838
How could she say that?

82
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,769
Teresita.

83
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,605
Why are you acting so innocent?

84
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,399
Didn't they touch you?

85
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,779
Don't tell me those soldiers
didn't lay a hand on you.

86
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,365
Teresita.

87
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,325
Answer me.

88
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,745
Answer me.

89
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,332
Didn't they rape you?

90
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,502
By God's grace,

91
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,964
no.

92
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
Good for you.

93
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,392
Good for you, Teresita.

94
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,146
Looks like God loves you more than us.

95
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,277
Keep your guard up, Teresita.

96
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,118
What they did to us,

97
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,370
they will do the same to you.

98
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,625
Maybe not now,

99
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,004
but they will do the same to you.

100
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,180
You're a powerful man.

101
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,019
Just one word from you
and our soldiers will search everywhere

102
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,729
just to find her.

103
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,858
Colonel, she's been missing
since this morning.

104
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,985
It's getting late!

105
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,907
What do you mean?

106
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,620
That I'm a worthless colonel?

107
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,414
Forgive me, Colonel.

108
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,460
But Teresita's family is very worried.

109
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,337
I can't even face them.

110
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,383
I thought you said
we're not the bad guys here.

111
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,471
We shouldn't betray the Filipinos.

112
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,768
Our mission is to help them
and free them from the Americans.

113
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,688
Or did I misunderstand, Colonel?

114
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,818
I've been wondering why
Teresita was abducted

115
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,573
and why there are Filipinos
who are still locked up and tortured!

116
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,742
That's enough!

117
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,125
That will stop the bleeding for now.

118
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,215
I didn't know you knew first aid.

119
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,679
I've always wanted to be a doctor

120
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,267
ever since my mother died of tuberculosis.

121
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,190
I was going to medical school,
but the Japanese came.

122
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,861
They destroyed my dreams.

123
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,116
You should get some rest.

124
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,868
Thank you very much, Eduardo.

125
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,334
Tanaka.

126
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,838
Don't you dare doubt our army

127
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,966
or our mission in this country.

128
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,678
My apologies.

129
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,309
I only want to find Teresita
and bring her back to her family.

130
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,897
I told you, I'll take care of it.

131
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,984
Now, leave!

132
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,992
Thank you very much, Colonel.

133
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,225
Look. We have an intruder.

134
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,233
Please don't shoot. I'm not here to fight.

135
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,235
You disobeyed the law!

136
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,812
Colonel, you called.

137
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,819
I don't like

138
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,533
Hiroshi Tanaka's tone
and actions towards me.

139
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,869
Why, Colonel?

140
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,330
What did he do?

141
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:01,340
That lad has too many Filipino friends.

142
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,303
What do you want me to do?

143
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,226
Take him away from Manila.

144
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,230
Assign him to a different city.

145
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,983
Anywhere is good

146
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,485
as long as it's far from here.

147
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,155
Away from his father,

148
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,491
and especially,

149
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,622
away from the Borromeos and Adelina.

150
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,357
Adelina.

151
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,651
Where have you been?

152
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,779
-I went to the Colonel.
-What did he say?

153
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,699
Is he going to help us?

154
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,286
Or is he going to give us false hope
just like Akio?

155
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,123
Adelina, you need to trust me.

156
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,044
I won't stop until I find Teresita.

157
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,129
I'll make sure she'll come back.

158
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,589
I'll make that happen.

159
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,716
I want to trust you, Hiroshi.

160
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,426
But how?

161
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,638
How are you going to find her

162
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,142
and bring her back to me?

163
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,813
I'm sick of promises.

164
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,233
I'm tired.

165
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,031
I no longer trust the Japanese

166
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,410
or anyone of the same nationality
as my sister's abductors.

167
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:00,084
Adelina, please don't blame me
for what happened.

168
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,337
Adelina, I'm not a bad person.

169
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,589
You know that.

170
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,842
I'm your ally, not your enemy.

171
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,096
I'll do anything for you, my love.

172
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,224
Please don't hate me.

173
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,310
You'll only break my heart.

174
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,521
So please, Adelina.

175
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm not your enemy.

176
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,442
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,256
Colonel, just a moment.

178
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,261
Colonel, we're sorry to bother you.

179
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,139
What is it?

180
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,230
And you, Filipino.

181
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,192
Why are you here?

182
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,529
Do you still remember me?

183
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,824
I'm Mrs. Borromeo's personal driver.

184
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,952
I came here because…

185
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,209
I want to report
that Adelina has been lying to you.

186
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,004
What did she do?

187
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,257
Tell me.

188
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,470
The war has just started.

189
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,558
But I've already lost so much, Hiroshi.

190
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,105
Forgive me for blaming you

191
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,735
and forgive me for thinking this way
about your people.

192
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:54,740
Because now, I don't know
who they will take from me next.

193
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm the one who should
feel ashamed, Adelina.

194
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,871
Please forgive them.

195
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,748
Forgive all of us, my love.

196
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,925
Hiroshi, I don't know anymore.

197
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,177
Will it be my father?

198
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,762
Or me?

199
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:24,061
Who among us is going to be
their next target?

200
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,528
I've been quiet about this for a while,

201
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,449
that Adelina and Eduardo
still see each other.

202
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:43,997
She knows the whereabouts
of her rebellious brother.

203
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,881
Why are you only telling me this now?

204
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,092
Forgive me, Colonel.

205
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,639
At first, I thought
she would change her ways.

206
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,351
That she would eventually
confess and cooperate.

207
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,105
But she's no different from her brother.

208
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,276
She's also strongly against
the Japanese occupation.

209
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:24,079
Colonel, would you like me to order
Adelina Dela Cruz's arrest right away?

210
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,270
Adelina.

211
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,899
Don't say such things.

212
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,028
No one's going to be arrested.

213
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,405
Not your father.

214
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,867
And not you. I won't let that happen.

215
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,834
But what will you do if it does happen?

216
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,009
How can I depend on you
when you can't even do anything?

217
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,806
If you did,

218
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,102
you would've brought my sister home.

219
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,021
So tell me.

220
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,235
How can I depend on your words?

221
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,988
Adelina, please.

222
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,658
You're just scaring yourself.

223
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,495
And don't cry anymore, my love.

224
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,090
I am terribly worried, my love.

225
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,264
No one is going to take you away from me.

226
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,565
And no one is going to keep us apart.

227
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,006
Good evening, Mrs. Borromeo.

228
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,635
Good evening, Hiroshi.

229
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,486
Do you have any news about my daughter?

230
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm sorry,

231
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,575
but I'm going to sleep.

232
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,384
You are ordered by our colonel
to talk to Hiroshi, Captain.

233
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
I don't understand.

234
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,058
Why so soon?

235
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,897
Why is he suddenly asking
for Hiroshi to be transferred?

236
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,986
Let's just follow our colonel's order.

237
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:12,909
Looks like our colonel is
hiding a lot from us.

238
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,121
Yamamoto.

239
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,874
Tell me the truth.

240
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,171
Where's Teresita Borromeo?

241
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,214
I don't know.

242
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,133
Why are you asking me about her?

243
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:34,055
Because I don't believe that our colonel
doesn't know where she is

244
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,600
and where she was taken by our soldiers.

245
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,229
Are you accusing our leader, Captain?

246
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,447
Miss Dolores?

247
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,491
Is that you?

248
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,587
Please don't come in!

249
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,554
Colonel Yuta?

250
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,901
We need to leave now.

251
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,444
The Japanese might come back.

252
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,571
They wouldn't think we'd be back.

253
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,408
They would think
we fled and hid like cowards.

254
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,702
Are you Miss Adelina?

255
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,372
Are you Mr. Eduardo's sister?

256
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,291
-Yes, I am.
-He has letters for you.

257
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,169
Please treat Teresita well.

258
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,297
I see that the woman's special to you.

259
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,259
You have angered our colonel, Hiroshi.

260
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,554
He has asked me to assign you to Pampanga.

261
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,015
COMING UP

262
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,897
