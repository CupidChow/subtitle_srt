1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,336
We're staying at another person's place?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,340
How is that different
from staying with the Tanakas?

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,593
If you just have an open mind, you'll see…

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,638
that even our countrymen can help us.

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,390
Colonel Saitoh?

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,434
Eduardo, wake up!

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,977
We're leaving.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,187
Don't let the Japanese catch you.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,647
You must come back alive.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,108
Prepare something delicious to eat

11
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,070
because we have an important guest coming.

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,157
Teresita, isn't this the car
of that demonic colonel?

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,327
-Aren't you supposed to be in prison?
-I really want to see my family.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,039
But your family never comes home anymore.

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,540
Where are they?

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,583
You're in hell.

17
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,668
So prepare yourself.

18
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,838
If you can find a way to get Julio
out of the picture,

19
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,717
I can easily arrange her marriage to you.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:01:01,311
Your suggestion is an insult to my honor.

21
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,938
I can't believe the colonel rejected
your mother's proposal.

22
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,357
Where did Eduardo go?

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,194
They left. He's on a mission with Lucas.

24
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,946
-Why didn't they bring me along?
-It's too dangerous.

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,659
If they make a mistake,
they could be in danger and get caught.

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,623
Mrs. Borromeo is not
a good wife and mother.

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,043
I don't want to associate myself
with her anymore.

28
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,921
I have a better plan in mind.

29
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,382
We're still fortunate
because we have the theater

30
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,637
as a brief escape from this harsh reality.

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,014
Tell them that the sisters are here.

32
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,976
They can make their move now.

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,812
PREVIOUSLY

34
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,573
I'm sure those Japanese we saw
are the ones who did this.

35
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,116
I know Ryo.

36
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,619
-That boy is kind.
-Kind?

37
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,371
There's no such thing
as kindness nowadays.

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,047
Let's go.

39
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,635
I'll come back for you.

40
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,180
I'll give you a proper burial.

41
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,612
Beloved

42
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,492
I adore you with my soul

43
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,873
You resemble

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,419
A fragrant flower

45
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:37,008
Cleanse me thoroughly

46
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,721
With your great beauty

47
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,893
You remind me of a beautiful fountain

48
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:52,023
You give me happiness

49
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,986
Like a blissful Eden

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,241
Your abode

51
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,525
Hey! Follow him!

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:36,943
Don't move!

53
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,820
Don't move!

54
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,494
Don't you just love it
when people clap for us?

55
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,788
They must've really liked us,

56
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,790
You're right.

57
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,334
I wish we didn't have to go home.

58
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,842
Apologies, ladies, but…

59
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,553
Teresita, the Japanese soldiers
are looking for you.

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,596
Why?

61
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,900
Pack your things
and get the hell out of here!

62
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,610
Which one is Teresita Borromeo?

63
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,280
That's her!

64
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,491
-Hey! Why me?
-Wait!

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,743
-Wait!
-What did I do?

66
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,079
Let go of my sister!

67
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,709
-Let her go!
-Adelina!

68
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,794
Please let my sister go, I beg you!

69
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,463
She hasn't done anything wrong!

70
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,465
-Don't touch me!
-Adelina!

71
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,467
-Adelina!
-Come with us!

72
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,024
What exactly are we here for, Sir Lucas?

73
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,027
We need more weapons.

74
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,407
We also need to figure out
how to attack that garrison.

75
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,249
But how?
That place is surrounded by soldiers.

76
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,920
That's why we'll just observe for now,

77
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,758
so we can pick up on their movements.

78
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,475
This is our chance.
Looks like everyone's leaving.

79
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,230
Eduardo, we were only ordered to observe.

80
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,609
We need to return to base and report back.

81
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,444
That's all we're doing here.

82
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,032
If we come back here with them, what then?

83
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,536
Their soldiers will already be back.

84
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,875
Sir Lucas, we need guns and food.

85
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,712
This is a good chance for us to get in.

86
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,881
Let's not delay it.

87
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,242
Teresita!

88
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,910
-Teresita!
-Hold her!

89
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,789
Teresita…

90
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,792
Adelina!

91
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,085
-Teresita!
-Adelina!

92
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,420
-Adelina!
-No!

93
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,546
-Adelina!
-Please!

94
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,506
-Teresita!
-No!

95
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
Teresita!

96
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
Adelina, no. Don't.

97
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,398
-Adelina!
-Teresita!

98
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,402
Let go of me!

99
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,238
Help me!

100
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,615
Help me!

101
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,159
Adelina! Adelina!

102
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,245
Let go of me!

103
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,623
Help me!

104
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,541
Help me!

105
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,002
-Teresita!
-Adelina!

106
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,921
Shut up or I'll shoot you!

107
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,422
Teresita!

108
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,259
Adelina…

109
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,489
Adelina!

110
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
Marcel!

111
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,167
-Adelina! Adelina!
-Teresita!

112
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,336
-Adelina!
-Teresita!

113
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,047
Adelina!

114
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
Wait! Let me go!

115
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
Let me go! Stop the truck!

116
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,511
Teresita!

117
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,972
Teresita!

118
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,933
Please, not my sister!

119
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,768
Not my sister!

120
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,647
Teresita!

121
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,651
Adelina!

122
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,027
Adelina!

123
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,322
Adelina! Adelina!

124
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,261
Hey! Wait for me!

125
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,211
My beloved Adelina and Teresita,

126
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,757
I'm currently in the middle of a mission.

127
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,928
And for the second time,
I'm deeply worried for my life.

128
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,269
But I swear,
I'll take great care of myself

129
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,483
to fulfill my promise to return alive
for the two of you.

130
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,338
I hope you'll also fulfill your promises.

131
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,303
Please take good care of yourselves,
and do your best to keep safe.

132
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,900
Replace one of our guards at the gate.

133
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,819
I'll just take a quick nap.

134
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,487
Okay.

135
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:07,810
Even now, I already long to see
the full moon once again.

136
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,482
That's how much
I want to see you two again.

137
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,702
Rest up, I'll take care of things here.

138
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,619
Okay.

139
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,676
Adelina. Teresita.

140
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,806
Do you remember playing hide-and-seek
when we were kids?

141
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,559
Odd one out, you're it!

142
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,563
-What? Seriously?
-You're it!

143
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
-Ready to play?
-Ready!

144
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,816
-Let's play.
-You're it!

145
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,113
Hide-and-seek
The moon is bright

146
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,908
Not behind, not in front

147
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,537
When I count to ten
You should all be hidden

148
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,247
One!

149
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,082
Run, run!

150
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,250
Two!

151
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,543
Three!

152
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,129
Four!

153
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,339
Five!

154
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,800
Six!

155
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,344
Seven!

156
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,805
Eight!

157
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,932
Nine!

158
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,601
Ten!

159
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,865
It seems like our lives now
are just like that game.

160
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,367
Teresita. Adelina.

161
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:16,290
But unlike before,
our seeker was a friend and a playmate.

162
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,061
Now, we're sought-after by our enemies…

163
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,979
Got you, Eduardo!

164
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
…in this life's game of hide-and-seek.

165
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,043
One.

166
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,712
Two.

167
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,035
Hey! Wake up!

168
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,870
What happened to you?

169
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,795
You just arrived and you're leaving again?

170
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,048
I'm just going to fetch
Teresita and Adelina.

171
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,175
We won't be long.

172
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,304
When we return,
we can move to Johnny's place.

173
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,889
Adelina?

174
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,352
What happened?

175
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,479
Why are you crying?

176
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,492
Where is Teresita?

177
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,665
Why isn't she with you?

178
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,259
Don't scare me like that, Adelina.

179
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,762
Where's my daughter?

180
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,311
-She's gone.
-What…

181
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,897
What do you mean she's gone?

182
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,777
She was abducted by Japanese soldiers.

183
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,739
We couldn't do anything.

184
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,575
We weren't able to help her.

185
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:03,123
And we don't know where they took her.

186
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,382
Take him down!

187
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,740
Shut up or I'll hurt you!

188
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,873
We have a new meal tonight.

189
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,712
And she looks delicious!

190
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,556
Let me go! Let go!

191
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,854
If you disobey again,
you won't just get a slap from me!

192
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,105
Bring her inside!

193
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,608
Bring her inside!

194
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,236
Bring her inside!

195
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,937
Yes, I will inform our colonel
as soon as he arrives.

196
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,529
Stop crying.

197
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,115
I'm sure…

198
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,826
Colonel Saitoh will help us.

199
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,787
This is both your fault!

200
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,791
This is why I didn't want Teresita
to perform at the theater,

201
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,543
but you condoned her!

202
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,507
And now, you even let
my daughter get abducted?

203
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,887
Teresita shouldn't have been in danger.

204
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,972
It should've been you, Adelina!

205
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,726
They should've abducted you,
not my daughter!

206
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,269
Stop pointing fingers!

207
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,273
No one wanted this to happen.

208
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,155
Let's just pray that nothing bad
happens to Teresita.

209
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,824
What's going on here?

210
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,082
You don't need to bow to us.

211
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,210
Why are you crying, Adelina?

212
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,920
What happened to you?

213
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,344
Put this on the stove later.

214
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,064
Good afternoon, sir.

215
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,360
Where are we?

216
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,158
Why did you bring me here?

217
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,000
Can you please answer me?

218
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,675
What are we doing here?

219
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,310
Yes, she is.

220
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,605
Why, miss?

221
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,901
What do they want from me?

222
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,869
Come with me.

223
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,387
You're so selfish.

224
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,515
This is the only time I asked for help,

225
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,934
and now you're turning me down?

226
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,396
Auntie, I'm sorry. I'm short on cash too.

227
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,649
If only you had been nice to us before.

228
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,817
What did you say?

229
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,778
I said, I haven't received my salary yet.

230
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,946
I have nothing to give you.

231
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,532
You're so useless, Eduardo.

232
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,202
What about you, Adelina?

233
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm sure you have money.

234
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,123
I don't have a job,
I can't lend you anything.

235
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,250
Do you think I'm stupid?

236
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,421
You live with your rich father,
but you don't have money?

237
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,173
That's impossible!

238
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,551
Why are you asking them for money?

239
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,805
Who is this meddling woman?

240
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,809
Auntie, she is Teresita.

241
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,352
My half-sister.

242
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,357
You're Carmela's daughter?

243
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,192
You're all grown up now.

244
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,113
Here, Auntie. Just take that.

245
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,989
That's all I have now.

246
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,867
I'll give you some more
once I get my salary.

247
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,251
The war truly spares nobody.

248
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,294
Whether rich or poor.

249
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,133
Who would have thought
we would meet here in hell?

250
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,095
Do you want to be slapped
by the soldiers again?

251
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,266
What really is this place?

252
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,604
What are we doing here, Auntie Amalia?

253
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,240
You don't know?

254
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,118
You don't know anything?

255
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,249
You will damn this place.

256
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,625
Be quiet!

257
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,546
And you.

258
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,215
Don't ask too many questions.

259
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,550
Just come with me.

260
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,344
Hurry now.

261
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,907
If she only knew
what happens in this hell.

262
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,798
The American has made his order clear.

263
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,093
You were only supposed to
observe the garrison, not steal.

264
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,095
We'll ask him for help, Hiroshi?

265
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,555
What do you want from me?

266
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,349
Why are they here, Hiroshi?

267
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,269
Where are Miss Teresita and Adelina?

268
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,523
Didn't you know that Teresita
was abducted by Japanese soldiers?

269
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,151
Which Japanese soldier arrested her?

270
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,238
Adelina, I will do everything
to find Teresita.

271
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,073
I hope you do find her.

272
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,783
Because if you don't,

273
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,661
consider me one of the many
enemies of your country.

274
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,122
COMING UP

275
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,540
They are being raped!

276
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,087
Go ahead! Get sick of me!

277
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,129
Pigs!

278
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,923
Aren't we going to help them?

279
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,766
