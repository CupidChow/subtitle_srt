1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,045
Sir Julio, do you have
any news from outside?

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,382
Do you know if we can still
get out of here alive?

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,177
We made the enemies believe
it was your corpse.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,763
Who among the soldiers did you speak with?

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,224
The one they call Saitoh-taisa.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,436
We need to leave now
while there are fewer guards outside.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,273
Where is she? Can I see her?

8
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,483
You can't.

9
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,821
If she's safe like you said,
then why can't I see her?

10
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,407
Just don't look for her anymore.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
I need to keep tailing Saitoh.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,037
Tasyo.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,956
He's the only one
who can lead me to Teresita.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,791
Are you really not going
to change your mind?

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,293
Just come with me.

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,171
This country is too dangerous for you.

17
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,797
Don't worry about me.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,966
I can take care of myself.

19
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,760
I know where our daughter is.

20
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,928
-Wait!
-And I know what happened to her.

21
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,266
What happened to her?
Where is she? Is she safe?

22
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:03,396
I want you to meet
Sister Manuela and Lorena.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,148
How is she?

24
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,694
Teresita's in her room
and she's doing well, Colonel.

25
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,907
PREVIOUSLY

26
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,202
My God.

27
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,831
Did they really do all that to you?

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,667
We're telling the truth.

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,547
That's exactly what happened to us
in that house.

30
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,060
Where is this house you speak of?

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,354
It's in Bulacan.

32
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,440
But we don't know where it is.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,113
We don't know
how to get back there to show you.

34
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,910
We can't remember anymore
because we were rushing to escape.

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,999
We were terrified of being followed
by the Colonel's soldiers.

36
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,216
I'm sorry for startling you.

37
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,427
My name is Teresita.

38
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,597
Miss, is this place what we think it is?

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,809
Is this where young women like us
are violated by the Japanese?

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,980
Is that why we're here, miss?

41
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,232
Are they going to do the same to us?

42
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,115
Don't worry.

43
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,367
As long as I'm here,

44
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:27,165
I'll do everything I can to help
and protect all of you.

45
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,170
Thank you. We'll trust you on that.

46
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,888
The devil's here. He's looking for you.

47
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,818
Damn you, Saitoh.

48
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,240
I knew he had my sister
all this time, but…

49
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,162
I'm so angry at what he did to you.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,584
Johnny?

51
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,338
Johnny? Anyone home?

52
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,173
Johnny?

53
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,759
Johnny?

54
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,556
Señora? What brings you here?

55
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,185
I'm with someone.

56
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,775
Dad.

57
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,806
Please, come in.

58
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,394
Julio!

59
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,146
You got out!

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,064
Thank God!

61
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,735
My friend, thank you so much.

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,488
I didn't know you had company.

63
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,907
-It's…
-Yolanda?

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,909
What brings you here?

65
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,661
Sir.

66
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,249
Julio.

67
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,379
Your questions will have to wait.

68
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,300
I'd like to talk to Adelina for a moment.

69
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:11,204
You look even more beautiful
than the moon, Teresita.

70
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:43,069
There's no more reason for you to resist.

71
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,198
Especially now that…

72
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,327
Eduardo is gone.

73
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,377
Has Sister Manuela told you
about Teresita?

74
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,337
Yes, señora.

75
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,092
I don't know how I'm going to tell Dad.

76
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,055
-Have you told him anything yet?
-You should tell him.

77
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,228
-Where's Eduardo?
-I don't know.

78
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,773
Find him. Send someone to look for him.

79
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:28,448
And tell Eduardo to do everything he can
to find and save Teresita.

80
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,411
Here, take these.

81
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,714
I'm passing these on to you and Julio.
You can trade all my jewelry.

82
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,008
And Eduardo too.

83
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,430
Give some to him,
so he can help his fellow guerillas.

84
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,391
This will be a big help to them.

85
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,435
Thank you.

86
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,937
That's right.

87
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,441
You heard it right.

88
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,321
Eduardo Dela Cruz is dead.

89
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,201
He was killed by your fellow Filipinos

90
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,997
who side with our army.

91
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:28,090
I saw his body with my own eyes.

92
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,345
And you will never see him again

93
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,850
because I got rid of him.

94
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,445
Adelina.

95
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
I hope you and Eduardo can forgive me

96
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,122
for everything I've done.

97
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,755
I was blinded by my hatred
towards your mother

98
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,717
that I didn't see
the kindness of your heart.

99
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,891
You don't need to explain, señora.

100
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,937
I understand.

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,444
So cry.

102
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,156
Go ahead!

103
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,952
Cry all you want!

104
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,542
Mourn that man's death!

105
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,681
Thank you.

106
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,391
I have to go.

107
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,685
I won't say goodbye to your father.

108
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,646
But you can't go out at this hour, señora.

109
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
You might get arrested.

110
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,650
Just spend the night here with us.

111
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,737
I can't, I need to be somewhere.

112
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,366
And if by chance I don't come back…

113
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,830
If you ever see Teresita again,

114
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:28,002
please tell her I regret everything

115
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,338
I did to her.

116
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,592
I'm asking for your forgiveness.

117
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,181
And please tell her I love her so much.

118
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:49,523
Señora, you're making me nervous.
Where are you going?

119
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,278
Señora, you're making me nervous.
Where are you going?

120
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,321
Señora!

121
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,909
Señora, wait!

122
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,702
Señora!

123
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,830
Señora…

124
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,589
Who would have thought…

125
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,553
your lover would pass away so soon?

126
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,102
I'm glad he's gone.

127
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,649
He deserved it.

128
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,656
You're horrible.

129
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,828
I hope you die too!

130
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,086
Forgive me, Colonel.

131
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:57,925
I can't find Amalia anywhere.
I think she ran away.

132
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:05,224
Where's Amalia, Teresita?

133
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,934
I don't know!

134
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,564
Search for her in the entire camp.

135
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,191
Yes, sir!

136
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,696
If she's not found,

137
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,951
I'll punish all the women here.

138
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:30,958
And you'll be witness
to the horror that awaits them.

139
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,345
Where are you going?

140
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,598
Taking a dump. Wanna join me?

141
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,031
Where's Teresita Borromeo?

142
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,493
Is she inside with your colonel?

143
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,120
Nod if you understand me.

144
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,290
Nod!

145
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,683
Haruto! Did you shoot?

146
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,727
-What happened?
-It's Haruto.

147
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,525
Haruto, was that you?

148
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,819
Haruto, where are you?

149
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,247
Adelina!

150
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
Hiroshi?

151
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,800
You're alive.

152
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,017
Are you still not done crying?

153
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,604
Stop it this instant!

154
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,856
It doesn't please me anymore.

155
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,651
You have no heart.

156
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,822
You don't understand

157
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,701
how painful it is
to lose someone you love!

158
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,706
Your tears will not bring him back.

159
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,668
I'm the one

160
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,046
who truly loves you.

161
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,314
You love me?

162
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,819
You don't even know how!

163
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,823
You're not just selfish,

164
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,993
you're such an evil man too!

165
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,787
No matter what you do,

166
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,792
you will never replace
or even measure up to Eduardo!

167
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,966
Don't wait for me to get sick of

168
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,762
your so-called affection for me.

169
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,265
I can hand you over to my soldiers.

170
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,978
You want my men to take turns with you?

171
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:49,198
Colonel, Amalia is nowhere to be found.

172
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
The woman has escaped.

173
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,339
Thank you, Lord. I'm free.

174
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,555
Please guide me back to my daughter, Lord.

175
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,369
My soldiers could not find Amalia.

176
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,124
That just means she escaped.

177
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,379
So where could she be?

178
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,467
I don't know!

179
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,055
I'll make sure you'll pay

180
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,392
for Amalia's escape.

181
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,858
Let all our soldiers know

182
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,945
they can take any of the women here.

183
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,572
Except for Teresita.

184
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,743
Go ahead, beat them if they resist.

185
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,120
That's their only use here!

186
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,864
She's a woman, sir.

187
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,202
She's not Japanese.

188
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,710
Colonel, we bring bad news.

189
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,547
Someone killed Haruto.

190
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,715
Who?

191
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,467
We don't know, sir.

192
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,137
We found him shot in the head.

193
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,597
Where's his body?

194
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,558
Take me to him!

195
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,685
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

196
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,626
I thought I'd lost you.

197
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,965
I heard you fought
Dado's group last night.

198
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,302
I didn't know he was the one
who attacked us.

199
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,934
It was all thanks to my father.
He saved us, Adelina.

200
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,811
You mean Mr. Tanaka?

201
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,189
Where is he? Is he with you?

202
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,025
I left him at the pier, Adelina.

203
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,570
He's going back to Japan.

204
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,325
He's about to board his ship now.

205
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,587
Why?

206
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,672
You're a traitor.

207
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,508
You're the real traitor.

208
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,619
-What happened to him?
-Let's help him!

209
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,207
-Hurry up!
-Be careful!

210
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,044
And the moment he arrives in Japan,

211
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,423
I'm certain he'll do everything
to throw the Colonel behind bars.

212
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,804
That's good news.

213
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,599
I hope he succeeds, Hiroshi.

214
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,771
Come inside.

215
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,564
Dad's here too.

216
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,566
Your father has been set free?

217
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,860
Yes.

218
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:42,074
He's safe, Hiroshi.
That's why I'm very happy.

219
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,494
-Let's go.
-My apologies.

220
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,165
As much as I want to, I can't stay here.

221
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,043
Our colonel's going to look for me.

222
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,129
They must not find me.

223
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,175
-What happened?
-I know better now, Adelina.

224
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,302
You're right.

225
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,597
We shouldn't have invaded your country.

226
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,558
My situation is difficult, Adelina.

227
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,520
I need to turn my back on my country

228
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,605
and ally with yours.

229
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,066
You mean…

230
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,360
Where's Eduardo, Adelina?

231
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,320
Do you know where he is?

232
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,114
Take me to his camp.

233
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,831
I'm not going as his enemy,
but as his ally.

234
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,598
Did you catch whoever did this

235
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,144
to Haruto?

236
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,104
No, sir.

237
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,064
Where did you find him?

238
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,525
In the tall grass, sir.

239
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,845
Those bastard Filipinos!

240
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,603
Bury him.

241
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,067
Don't worry.

242
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,530
We will…

243
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,409
avenge Haruto!

244
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
-Yes, sir!
-Thank you, Colonel!

245
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,797
Get ready.

246
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,133
-It's almost nightfall.
-What's going to happen?

247
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,762
Whoever's not doing anything right now
may take any of the women.

248
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,181
-I have a favor to ask you.
-What is it, my friend?

249
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,183
I need to borrow your gun.

250
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,852
Where's your damn friend, Captain?

251
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,314
-Where's Hiroshi?
-He's gone, Colonel.

252
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,941
He abandoned his post and his men.

253
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,400
Traitor!

254
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,402
Teresita? Are you there?

255
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,320
COMING UP

256
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,030
-Eduardo?
-Teresita, open the door.

257
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,073
Eduardo?

258
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,288
