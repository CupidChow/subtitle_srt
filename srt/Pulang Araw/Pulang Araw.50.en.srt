1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,378
Juan? Why are you following us?

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:07,465
My mom and dad were killed like animals.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,217
That's why I despise the Japanese.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,306
Please take me with you.
I want to avenge their deaths.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,392
You're going against the Japanese?

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,811
You're going to follow Eduardo
in the mountains?

7
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:24,607
We just want to ask
if we can spend the night.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,608
Come in.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,193
She is Mrs. Panlilio.

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,320
She's a radio broadcaster.

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,698
Can we really trust them?

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,617
Hiroshi, do you really believe
Colonel Saitoh is an honorable man?

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,787
Despite our colonel's faults,

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,416
I still believe he's honorable enough

15
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,209
to respect your family's decision.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,004
After what my brother said…

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,883
Your colonel hurt my brother.

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,678
Since then, I stopped believing
that your colonel is an honorable man.

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,559
How can you say that
about our colonel, Adelina?

20
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,269
There's a huge possibility

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:06,107
that their friendship is more important
to him than our camaraderie.

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,154
Hiroshi better not make
the mistake of siding with them

23
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,407
because I will not think twice

24
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,787
about taking the lives of his friends.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,165
If you send Adelina away,
I will leave too.

26
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,668
She'll just destroy
your relationship with your son.

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,170
I'm glad you managed to escape.

28
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,256
But where are you headed now?

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,466
To the guerrillas!

30
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,592
-Juan!
-Juan!

31
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,344
I know where they are

32
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,805
because my son is one of them.

33
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,556
PREVIOUSLY

34
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,563
You made me so proud

35
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,568
when I saw you wear this uniform
for the first time.

36
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,903
Father.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,865
Can I ask you something?

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,617
Of course, my son.
You can always talk to me.

39
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,704
Father, do you think

40
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,042
our intentions for this country are good?

41
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:55,758
I've seen injustices committed
by our soldiers

42
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:01,347
and people here say
that we're not their liberators.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,226
That we're just like
any other selfish invader.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,563
I don't know what to believe anymore.

45
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,274
I understand your concerns.

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,447
It's only natural for you to question

47
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,242
and seek the truth.

48
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,954
But what is the truth, Father?

49
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,750
The truth is, I talked back
to your mother again.

50
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,129
I just…

51
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,718
couldn't hold back when she told
Mr. Tanaka to throw me out.

52
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,848
Adelina, I'm not mad.

53
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,561
It's only right for you
to defend yourself.

54
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,898
We're the same.

55
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,693
I've been defying my mother too.

56
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,279
That's true.

57
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,994
We really are sisters, Teresita.

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,250
What else could possibly happen to us
in the days to come?

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:17,757
Can we still live a life
where your mother is the only villain,

60
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,968
and not the Japanese?

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,848
Keep your voice down,
the Tanakas might hear you.

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,520
But I'm sure

63
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,526
that as long as we're at war,

64
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,238
we can only dream of a peaceful life.

65
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,826
No family, no lovers,

66
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,995
not a single Filipino will be happy.

67
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:53,876
There's no honor or peace in a country
that is constantly invaded by foreigners.

68
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,299
Hiroshi.

69
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,345
We want to help our neighboring countries

70
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:09,976
achieve real freedom and prosperity.

71
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,273
The Americans have been controlling
this country for so long.

72
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,360
It's time for the Filipinos

73
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,072
to control their own destiny.

74
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,536
But, Father, how can you be so sure

75
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,080
that our motives are sincere and pure

76
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,460
when our soldiers are the ones
committing atrocities?

77
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:42,425
I admit that our soldiers
are harsh and cruel,

78
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,596
but they don't define

79
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,725
the honorable intentions of our emperor.

80
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:56,564
The measure of our mission
lies in the positive changes

81
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,358
we aim to implement in this country.

82
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,949
We are not invaders
like the Americans, son.

83
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:14,332
We're allies and friends of this country.

84
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,044
Listen to me, Hiroshi.

85
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,381
Cast your doubts aside.

86
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,553
Continue doing good

87
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,306
and uphold our honor.

88
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,625
Mr. Ramon, I don't want
to take Juan to the mountains.

89
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,003
But…

90
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,800
I don't know where to leave him,
or what to do with him.

91
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,802
I admire the boy's courage.

92
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,720
But you're right.

93
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,142
He's far too young to fight.

94
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,730
The problem is, he's all alone now

95
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,483
and he doesn't know
where his relatives are.

96
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,445
I can take him to the nuns in Baguio.

97
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,324
I'll return there after my research here.

98
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,970
You're truly amazing, miss!

99
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:56,058
I still can't believe the person
I used to just hear on the radio

100
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,519
is here right before my eyes.

101
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,650
It's getting late.

102
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,530
You should rest and get some sleep.

103
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,619
You traveled a long way, haven't you?

104
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,204
Yes, Ms. Panlilio.

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,039
But…

106
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,878
have you seen Mr. Eduardo and Mr. Mario?

107
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,881
Aren't they going to rest too?

108
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,342
I'll go tell them it's time to go to bed.

109
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,803
Juan.

110
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
Mr. Eduardo?

111
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,600
Mr. Mario?

112
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,520
They're not here anymore.

113
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,273
They already left for the camp.

114
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,359
They left without me?

115
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,321
A youngster like you
shouldn't be in the guerrilla.

116
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:58,412
That life is not yours to live.

117
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,582
But this is the only life I have.

118
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,881
But you can still find a new family.

119
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,636
I will take you with me
when I return to Baguio.

120
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,305
I promise

121
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,227
I'll help you find the perfect family.

122
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,771
A family where you can be happy.

123
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,621
Hide.

124
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,795
I think I heard something.

125
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,926
Ouch!

126
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,553
Hey!

127
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,807
-Juan.
-You brat!

128
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,064
Don't move.

129
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,150
-Stay put.
-Hey!

130
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,320
Stop wasting your bullets on a kid!

131
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,534
This is not some childish game!

132
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,120
You idiots!

133
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,429
I wonder what Eduardo is doing right now?

134
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,226
I think my worry is going to kill me.

135
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,898
Not to mention the problems
we're currently facing.

136
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
There you go again.

137
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,744
Be strong.

138
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,790
Teresita, no matter what happens,

139
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,879
no matter what trials or challenges
come our way, we must never give up.

140
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,425
Our faith is the only thing
we can hold on to right now.

141
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
We must have hope.

142
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:08,227
We can't let our problems or enemies
get the best of us.

143
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,440
We must keep fighting.

144
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
And never, ever back down.

145
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,198
Juan?

146
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,825
Juan?

147
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,705
Where did that boy go?

148
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,875
What if he got shot?

149
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm sure he wasn't.

150
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,131
I heard him run off
as soon as the shots were fired.

151
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,885
But a person can still run
even after being shot, sir.

152
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,598
-You're so selfish!
-Juan, Juan!

153
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,099
Juan.

154
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,477
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,478
Forgive me.

156
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,731
You should be glad I saved you!

157
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,568
Thank you for saving us,
even though we left you behind.

158
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,279
Thanks, kid.

159
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,242
Well? Are you going to
take me with you now?

160
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,876
Honestly, I'm still against this.

161
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,466
But we're very lucky you saved us earlier.

162
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,352
Adelina, what am I going to do…

163
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,607
if you're no longer by my side?

164
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,401
You must promise me

165
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,697
we'll always be together.

166
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,909
I need you.

167
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,163
You and Papa.

168
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,752
Promise me…

169
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,842
you won't abandon me.

170
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,804
I can never do that to you.

171
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,973
Never.

172
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,392
I never will.

173
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,998
Are we still far from the guerrillas, sir?

174
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,419
Go rest if you're tired.

175
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,774
What are you doing here?

176
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,570
Are you bandits or guerrillas?

177
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,530
Answer us!

178
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,115
What are you doing here?

179
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,200
Lower your weapons!

180
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,247
He's my father.

181
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,877
Pablo!

182
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,837
My son!

183
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,344
I wish I could embrace my parents too.

184
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,472
I miss my father very much.

185
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,309
You're such a bad father.

186
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,603
You got my mother pregnant
and abandoned us.

187
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,023
Come to think of it,
when did you ever become a father to me?

188
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,611
I wish the Japanese
would arrive soon and kill you

189
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,446
because you're such a bad father!

190
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,289
My son, these are my companions.

191
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,501
Eduardo, Mario, and Juan.

192
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,837
They would like to join your camp.

193
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,468
I recognize those clothes.

194
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,137
Your father lent them to us.

195
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,684
Are you ready to die
and kill for our country?

196
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,353
I will kill all the Japanese soldiers!

197
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,192
Mario and I were stripped of our rights
to live freely.

198
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,153
We have witnessed

199
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,824
how the Japanese act cruelly
towards our people.

200
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:39,581
That's why we have no other desire
but to fight for our country

201
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,501
until we all achieve our freedom.

202
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,355
Did your father leave early?

203
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,483
Too bad I wasn't able to talk to him.

204
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,987
-Where did he go?
-He went to our garrison.

205
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
He has work there.

206
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,240
Why, Carmela?

207
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,285
What do you want from Mr. Tanaka?

208
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,203
Why do you have to know?

209
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,625
So you and your daughters
can gang up on me again?

210
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,809
My God.

211
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,771
They're back.

212
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,652
Señor!

213
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,988
Señor!

214
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,202
The spawn of Satan is here.

215
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,621
Who is it, Yolanda?

216
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,457
It's Colonel Yuta.

217
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,459
They're outside.

218
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,474
God Almighty.

219
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,852
Julio, Teresita, I beg you.

220
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,355
Don't put our family in danger!

221
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,025
Don't embarrass us
or anger the authorities.

222
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,985
Here he comes.

223
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,621
Good morning, Colonel.

224
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,791
Good morning, Tanaka.

225
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,089
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Borromeo.

226
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,528
Why doesn't he see me as his son, Mom?

227
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,738
Don't we look alike?

228
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,744
Yes, you resemble him.

229
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,038
But he's a worthless, neglectful father.

230
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,958
Don't you ever be like him.

231
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,607
Sir, did you get some sleep?

232
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,034
Are you thinking about your sister
and your fiancée?

233
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,620
Not just them.

234
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm thinking about my father too.

235
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,711
Because of him,

236
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,048
Tasyo and I got arrested and tortured.

237
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,175
Where is your father hiding?

238
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,303
I don't know where he is!

239
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,931
Where is your father?

240
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,808
Even now,

241
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,273
my father is still the reason why
I'm suffering so much.

242
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,068
I understand, sir.

243
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:42,032
But whatever his sins
and shortcomings are,

244
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,451
he's still your father.

245
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,623
That's what hurts the most.

246
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,756
Despite his faults,
I still respect and love him.

247
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,760
And even if I'm older,

248
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,224
I still want him to accept me as his son.

249
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
But I don't think that will ever happen

250
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:17,651
because I don't know
if he's still alive, or dead.

251
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,989
I hope he's safe like us, sir.

252
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,954
I hope so too, Mario.

253
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,417
Mr. Eduardo!

254
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
Our comrades are awake now.

255
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,089
They're looking for you.

256
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,674
Their camp is not too far from here.

257
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,509
Come on!

258
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,886
Let's go.

259
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,281
Please accept these gifts
I brought for you.

260
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,784
Gifts or bribes?

261
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,251
You shouldn't have,
but thank you very much.

262
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,379
Carmela, leave me and the Colonel for now.

263
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,968
I want to speak to him alone.

264
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,303
Julio.

265
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,096
Of course.

266
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,806
You!

267
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,267
-Wait for me downstairs.
-Yes, sir!

268
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,442
Go on, Mr. Borromeo.

269
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,738
What are we going to talk about?

270
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,443
Alberto!

271
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,072
-Mario!
-I'm glad to see you here.

272
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,535
Sir, this is Alberto.

273
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,454
He was my classmate
and colleague in the ROTC.

274
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,707
I'm happy to see him here.

275
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,545
Comrades!

276
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:46,508
Meet Eduardo and Mario.

277
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,760
And that little boy is Juan.

278
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,346
They are our newest members.

279
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,268
Let me just call our leader.

280
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,066
I'm glad to meet you
as our new comrades in this fight.

281
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,334
"Kill the Borromeos.

282
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,254
They are traitors
who are helping the Japanese."

283
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:28,508
Johnny and I have decided
that we will stay with him.

284
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,010
Why are you leaving?

285
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,304
Adelina, why are you leaving us?

286
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,765
Mrs. Borromeo is not
a good wife and mother.

287
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,935
I don't want to associate myself
with her anymore.

288
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,772
Instead, I have a better plan in mind.

289
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,482
Teresita Borromeo, come with us!

290
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,483
Why?

291
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,651
Adelina!

292
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,945
Please, not my sister!

293
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
Where did Eduardo go?

294
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,574
He's on a mission with Lucas.

295
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,826
-Why didn't they bring me along?
-It's too dangerous.

296
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,329
If they make a mistake,
they could be in danger

297
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,998
and get caught, which means…

298
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:04,085
COMING UP

299
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,967
