00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,421
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,880
Have the Americans came back?

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,924
<i>Is this true, Lord?</i>

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,635
<i>Are we really going to be free
from our enemies?</i>

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>Sho Ichigo Sakusen?</i>

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>I'm with someone
you'll be very happy to see.</i>

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>Teresita.</i>

8
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>Have you become a nun?</i>

9
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>We've lost so many lives.</i>

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>Would we still wish to live on?</i>

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>From all the pain
and heartbreaks we've suffered?</i>

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,376
<i>We're still trying our best to survive.</i>

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>And that's because we want to witness
our country's freedom.</i>

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,049
<i>Teresita, where are you?</i>

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>Have you completely forgotten about me?</i>

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>Where are you going?</i>

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>I can't rest until I've spoken to Adelina.</i>

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>Only Teresita holds my heart.</i>

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,478
<i>No one can take her place.</i>

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,272
<i>I just hope she's safe with her child.</i>

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,941
What happened to your pregnancy?

22
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,568
<i>Gone.</i>

23
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,986
<i>I bled and miscarried</i>

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>before I can return to the convent.</i>

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,754
You're not at fault.

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,881
You're not at fault.

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,433
But is that the reason
why you became a nun?

28
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,022
Do you blame yourself
for what happened to you?

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,317
I'm completely broken.

30
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,949
I'm no longer someone
Eduardo can be proud of.

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,205
I will only bring shame to him.

32
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,261
Teresita.

33
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,888
Listen to me.

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,266
What you said is not true.

35
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,895
Eduardo understands you.

36
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,317
I know he knows you're not at fault,

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,322
and he's more than ready
to accept you with his whole heart.

38
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,949
You never shouldn't have
run away from him.

39
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,789
Stay strong, my dear sister.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,587
Freedom is within our reach.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,968
You're my only family now.

42
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,892
I only have you and Eduardo.

43
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,524
If I lose either of you,
I wouldn't know what to do.

44
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,070
I might even curse God.

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,364
So, please.

46
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,494
I beg you, let's stay alive
for as long as we can.

47
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,150
We can't stay here any longer.

48
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,944
We need to leave.

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,536
This way.

50
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,926
You can't go back to the convent
right now, Teresita.

51
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,847
I'm sure there are plenty
of soldiers outside by now.

52
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,392
You can stay here until morning.

53
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,812
Do you want to rest?

54
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,482
Adelina.

55
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,780
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in a long time.

56
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,621
There's always so much on my mind.

57
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,134
I understand, Teresita.

58
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,014
It's the same for me.

59
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,812
I also couldn't sleep at night
out of fear.

60
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm scared that the Japanese soldiers
might find us here.

61
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:09,869
The lives of everyone here rest
on the shoulders of Sister Manuela and me.

62
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,007
I'm exhausted, Teresita.

63
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,678
I'm so tired.

64
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,604
I keep putting on a brave face,
but I'm so exhausted deep inside.

65
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,159
Adelina.

66
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,918
We'll survive anything that comes our way.

67
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,382
We're together now.

68
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,058
And once the guerrillas and the Americans
defeat the Japanese,

69
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,273
we'll demand justice
for the deaths of our Mama and Papa.

70
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,321
Yuta is not the only one
that needs to be punished.

71
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,366
But also the one who killed our Papa.

72
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,204
We'll ask Eduardo.

73
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,002
He can help us find Papa's killer.

74
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,644
Why, Adelina?

75
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,901
Do you know who killed our father?

76
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,364
Who?

77
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,935
I spoke to him, Teresita.

78
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,064
He didn't mean to do it.

79
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,861
Who did it?

80
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,865
Who are you? Introduce yourself.

81
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm Haru Akiyama, sir.

82
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,744
Imperial Japanese Army, Infantry Regiment

83
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,830
under the Colonel Ichiro Adachi.

84
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,583
Who is he, Adelina?

85
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,924
Teresita, believe me.

86
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,594
It was an accident.

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,061
Adelina, give me a name.

88
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,187
Who was it?

89
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,533
Our friend…

90
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,287
Hiroshi.

91
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,343
What happened to you?

92
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,597
- Where are your comrades?
- They're all dead, sir.

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,725
They were all killed by the guerrillas.

94
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,043
<i>Don't attack, just surrender!</i>

95
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,630
<i>You're Japanese too?
Are you the traitor who joined the enemy?</i>

96
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,922
<i>Shame on you!</i>

97
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,799
<i>You have no honor!</i>

98
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>You will all die!</i>

99
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,845
I'll kill you all, starting with you!

100
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,768
Someone like me,

101
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,271
who knows right from wrong,
has greater honor.

102
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,481
You're despicable!

103
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,608
You're a disgrace to our nation!

104
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,153
Enough with the accusations!
Which unit and camp are you from?

105
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,540
I'll kill you!

106
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,179
We were right to trust you, Hiroshi.

107
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,266
You've proven yourself
to be a Japanese with a Filipino heart.

108
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,435
Thank you, Sergeant.

109
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,814
We can still make use
of their uniforms, Nando.

110
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm the only one
who survived from our group.

111
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,405
So please help me.

112
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,825
I wish to return to our camp
in Manila immediately.

113
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,289
They were attacked at their camp.

114
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,709
The enemies had them surrounded.

115
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,753
Many of us died.

116
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,296
The enemies were prepared.

117
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,465
They had weapons we didn't have, Adelina.

118
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,758
Smoke filled the air.

119
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,969
It was hard to see anything.

120
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,138
I was terrified for my life.

121
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,098
I panicked, Adelina.

122
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,975
When I saw him,

123
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
I didn't know he was Mr. Borromeo.

124
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,731
I didn't realize that I shot
and killed your father.

125
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,695
Believe me.

126
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,824
Even I was angry with him before.

127
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,788
But he truly wasn't at fault, Teresita.

128
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,832
He didn't mean to kill him.

129
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,378
I believe him and I hope you do too.

130
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,796
How can you be so sure?

131
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,384
Because Hiroshi is our friend.

132
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,928
Isn't he?

133
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,099
Let him ride with us.
He might get killed here.

134
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,601
Thank you very much.

135
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,436
Let's go! No time to waste!

136
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>But he's still Japanese.</i>

137
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,379
Just like Yuta.

138
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,093
They're our enemies, Adelina.

139
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,807
They're nothing but traitors,

140
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,393
bastards,

141
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,104
liars, hypocrites…

142
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,232
That's who they are.

143
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,192
So how can you be so sure

144
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,987
that Hiroshi didn't intend
to kill our father?

145
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,464
I don't know

146
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,217
if I can ever forgive you, Hiroshi.

147
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,095
<i>Maybe only time will tell.</i>

148
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>Listen to me, dearest.</i>

149
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,936
Unfortunately, even the people we love…

150
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:21,110
Those people can hurt us
or make us sad sometimes.

151
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,736
That's why

152
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,158
don't entrust your happiness on others.

153
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,037
We should decide our own happiness.

154
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,293
No matter what challenges come your way,

155
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,503
whatever happens,

156
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,173
always choose to be happy.

157
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,096
To live is a beautiful blessing,

158
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:55,436
despite the sadness or the pain.

159
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,191
Adelina, are you all alone?

160
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,278
Has Teresita left?

161
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,874
She's in my room.

162
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,043
I told her to rest.

163
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,977
She's very angry with Hiroshi.

164
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,776
She wouldn't accept
that Hiroshi killed our father.

165
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,405
And she doesn't believe
that it was all an accident.

166
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,785
What about you? Do you believe him?

167
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,332
I wouldn't have
come back here if I didn't.

168
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,380
My heart knows
that Hiroshi is telling the truth.

169
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,140
We've been through a lot, Adelina.

170
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,686
We've seen

171
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:24,858
all the bad a person can do
to their own kind.

172
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,905
Our hands may be tainted with blood.

173
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,160
But we still have goodness in our hearts.

174
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,747
Though wounded,

175
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,459
there's still room for forgiveness.

176
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,213
Don't worry about Teresita.

177
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,843
She was just driven by her emotions.

178
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,971
But we know your sister.

179
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,058
She will forgive him one day.

180
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,146
Now get some rest.

181
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,716
Don't make any wrong moves.

182
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,635
I'll kill you!

183
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,054
Who is this man?

184
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,773
Hiroshi?

185
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,238
Lower your weapons. Pedro.

186
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,497
Go, leave us.

187
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,423
I knew you'd be here.

188
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,300
My suspicion was correct.

189
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,846
What happened to you?

190
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,974
Why do you look like that?

191
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,685
Have you sided with the enemies again?

192
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
No, Adelina.

193
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,440
I just wore this

194
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,652
to avoid any suspicion.

195
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,330
Forgive me for waking you, Sister.

196
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,960
Why isn't Adelina asleep yet?

197
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,380
A Japanese soldier
has just arrived outside.

198
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,382
I think your sister knows him.

199
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,344
I heard his name is Hiroshi.

200
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,477
I've traveled far, Adelina. Very far.

201
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,938
Just to see you again.

202
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
Do you still hate me?

203
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,198
Have I completely lost you, Adelina?

204
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,534
Because I'm…

205
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,287
still the same.

206
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,583
Yo're still the woman I truly love.

207
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,071
COMING UP

208
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,745
I know where to find Adelina Dela Cruz
and Teresita Borromeo.

209
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,122
<i>I will tell you where they are.</i>

210
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,250
Find them this instant! Quickly!

211
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,960
<i>- Go!</i>
- Stop!

212
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,169
Lower your weapon.

213
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,879
<i>Eduardo, what are you doing?
That's Hiroshi!</i>

214
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,047
<i>He's still an enemy.</i>

215
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,431
