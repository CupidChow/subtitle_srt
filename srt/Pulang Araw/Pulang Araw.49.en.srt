1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,838
I know a way that will spare us
from the Japanese.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,342
I think I would be cheating on Eduardo
if I let Yuta court me.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,302
I really don't want to face him.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,973
Teresita, think of it
as performing on stage.

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,059
You need to entertain the audience
no matter who they are.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,187
-They're not armed.
-You're free to go. Move!

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,939
Do you think

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,192
the Japanese will be extending
their stay in our country?

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,405
I'm just having doubts
about our friendship, Colonel.

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,242
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,581
He likes Teresita.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:49,048
On her behalf, I welcome your intention
to court my daughter.

13
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,509
We've arrived in Rizal.

14
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,928
Take this,
so you'll have something to eat.

15
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,430
Where is our colonel?

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,057
Here's some friendly advice.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,851
Don't you dare attempt
to save Eduardo Dela Cruz.

18
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,353
Our colonel is a dangerous enemy.

19
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,564
Ouch!

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,649
Juan? Why are you following us?

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,152
You're going to the rebel camp,
aren't you?

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,779
I'm going with you.

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,990
You abandoned us for a long time.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,910
How can I expect you
to act differently from your wife,

25
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:22,082
who's willing to marry off her daughter
for our safety?

26
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,084
I won't let them ruin my life.

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,003
We will follow Eduardo to the mountains.

28
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,674
I would rather die in this war

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,010
than let my mother marry me off to Yuta.

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,930
What did you say, Teresita?

31
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,016
They murdered my parents!

32
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,312
-Mom.
-Yes?

33
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,689
You forgot the puto.

34
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,358
Oh, my. You're right.

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,901
Can you get them inside?

36
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,027
Sure, Mom.

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,408
Is this carriage yours?

38
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,160
Good evening, sir.

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,329
You have to surrender this to us!

40
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,416
Confiscate the carriage!

41
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,086
-Come back!
-Give us our carriage!

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,006
Sir, please don't do this to us!

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,221
You monsters!

44
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,108
Mom! Dad!

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,237
Help us!

46
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,491
My mom and dad were killed like animals.

47
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,369
That's why I hate the Japanese.

48
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,623
Please take me with you.

49
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,418
I want to avenge their deaths.

50
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,380
Take me with you! Please!

51
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,343
Please take me with you, sir.

52
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,806
Please, take me with you.

53
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,434
You're going against the Japanese?

54
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,064
You're going to follow Eduardo
in the mountains?

55
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,276
How did you even know
he's in the mountains?

56
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,949
Does this mean you lied?

57
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,284
Did this bastard tell you to?

58
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,247
That night you came home late,

59
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,292
did you meet up with that man?

60
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,962
Would our answers…

61
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,216
change your mind, Mama?

62
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,472
You're forcing me again
to marry a man I don't love!

63
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,932
Who do you love, then?

64
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,393
That criminal?

65
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,272
What kind of life will you have with him?

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,315
Are you going to take up arms too?

67
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,819
Do you want to be seen as an enemy

68
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,571
and be hunted down
by Japanese authorities?

69
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,618
What kind of life awaits her
if she marries a foreign invader, señora?

70
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,038
She may live in luxury

71
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,000
with plenty of food and a place to sleep,

72
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,212
but she'll be a prisoner trapped in hell

73
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,964
-with the colonel!
-Shut up!

74
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,385
But I'm not surprised.

75
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,930
Why would you consider her feelings

76
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,517
when the colonel
can shower you with gifts?

77
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:15,773
When he can buy you the mansion
his people stole from you

78
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:21,529
while they torture and kill
your countrymen?

79
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,948
-Insolent brat!
-Stop, Mama!

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,325
What's going on here?

81
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,037
What are you arguing about?

82
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,788
This bastard…

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,461
She's trying to convince our daughter
to flee to the mountains!

84
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,256
To be with Eduardo.

85
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,008
You know where Eduardo is?

86
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,596
We will look for him, Papa.

87
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,435
We will scour every mountain
until we find him!

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,937
You're not leaving, Teresita.

89
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,190
You can't stop me anymore, Mama!

90
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,611
Unless…

91
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,491
you stop forcing me
to marry Colonel Saito!

92
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,330
Are you testing me, Teresita?

93
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,625
Let me remind you, child.

94
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,587
I am still your mother

95
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,964
and you will obey me!

96
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,675
From this day on,

97
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,263
I forbid any of you
from leaving this house.

98
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,306
Do you understand?

99
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,851
Especially you, Teresita.

100
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,780
Well, Juan?

101
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
Are you getting tired?

102
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,534
I can still manage, sir.

103
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,538
But can we rest for a bit?

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,374
It's getting dark again, sir.

105
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,920
We need to find a place to rest.

106
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,096
I know where we can stay for the night.

107
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,308
Let's go.

108
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,939
That's enough, Carmela.

109
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,316
Don't take away their freedom.

110
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,447
Our country has already fallen
into the hands of the Japanese.

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,198
We're their parents.

112
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,160
Do we have to control them too?

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:38,875
Make them prisoners in their own home,
the only place where they have freedom?

114
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,502
How are we any different
from the Japanese?

115
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,256
What made you change your mind?

116
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,761
-Was it your bastard?
-No!

117
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,934
I came back to be with my daughters.

118
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:03,024
Adelina, Teresita, and my theater
are precious to me.

119
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,403
And there's nothing I won't do for them.

120
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,241
And if I need to talk to Colonel Saitoh

121
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,911
to stop pursuing Teresita, I will do it!

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,085
You're going to provoke the colonel?

123
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:34,138
How can I get our house back
if you don't support me?

124
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,185
Am I the only one
looking out for our family?

125
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,272
I don't care if he gets mad!
He can punish me if he wants to!

126
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,485
But you will not force Teresita
to marry that colonel.

127
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,154
I still have the final say

128
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,534
because I am the head of this family!

129
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,304
Anyone home?

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,641
Hello?

131
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,362
Good evening, sir.

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,115
We're sorry to disturb you at this hour.

133
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:21,787
We just want to ask
if we can spend the night.

134
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,433
Good evening, Adelina.

135
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,856
Is my father home?

136
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,532
Why the long face, Adelina?

137
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,119
What seems to be the problem?

138
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,041
It's the señora.

139
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,297
She allowed Colonel Saitoh
to court my sister.

140
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,136
Even though Teresita told her
she could never love the colonel.

141
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,185
Fortunately, our father was against it.

142
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,192
But now, I'm worried about him.

143
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,947
Make yourselves at home.

144
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,615
Come inside.

145
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,580
Thank you very much, sir…

146
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,915
Ramon.

147
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,460
And you? What are your names?

148
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,462
I am Eduardo.

149
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,632
This is Juan, and he's Mario.

150
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,761
Come in.

151
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,106
She is Mrs. Panlilio, my guest.

152
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:17,403
And just like you,
she's also seeking shelter for the night.

153
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:25,161
You sound just like the lady
we listen to on the radio.

154
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,495
That's her, son.

155
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,248
She's Mrs. Valeria Panlilio.

156
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,667
She's a radio broadcaster.

157
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,002
Is that really her?

158
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,611
I have some clean clothes for you.

159
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,529
I hope they fit.

160
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,324
Those are my son's.

161
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,501
We can't possibly borrow
your son's clothes.

162
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,045
Where is he now?

163
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,635
I think you should wash up first.

164
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,597
-We'll fetch you some water.
-I'll come with you.

165
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,600
Thank you.

166
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
Sir.

167
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,070
Can we really trust them?

168
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,910
What do you think, Hiroshi?

169
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,080
Will this cause the colonel
to be upset with my father?

170
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,624
I can't say, Adelina.

171
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,418
I can't speak for our colonel.

172
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,507
But I know he'll remain a gentleman

173
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,469
because he is an honorable soldier.

174
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,762
Honorable?

175
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,685
Hiroshi, do you really believe that?

176
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,356
Adelina.

177
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,526
Our colonel can be cruel,

178
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,446
but he has done far more
good deeds for our country.

179
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,076
We're not all evil, Adelina.

180
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,619
You shouldn't see us that way.

181
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,539
If you say your people are good,

182
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:39,753
why are you trying to invade
a country that isn't yours?

183
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,215
To free you from the Americans, Adelina.

184
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,553
Is that still not clear to you?

185
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
You wanted to free us?

186
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,231
I think I might have forgotten
the meaning of that word, Hiroshi.

187
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,906
You wanted to free us
from those greedy Americans…

188
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,869
so you can conquer us yourselves?

189
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm sorry, but I can't see the difference.

190
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,176
Why are we arguing
about this again, Adelina?

191
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,265
Adelina, do what is best for you.

192
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,976
But believe me.

193
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,229
Despite our colonel's faults,

194
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,733
I still believe he's honorable enough

195
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
to respect your family's decision.

196
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,828
Hey, Watanabe.

197
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,710
How well do you know Hiroshi Tanaka?

198
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,882
I used to play with him
when we were still kids.

199
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,928
That's all there is to it.

200
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,846
If that's the case,

201
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:19,061
you haven't tested the man's loyalty.

202
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,063
I don't think so.

203
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:30,155
Especially after what my brother said.

204
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,202
Your colonel hurt my brother.

205
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,875
Since then, I stopped believing
that your colonel is an honorable man.

206
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,842
Adelina.

207
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,721
Adelina.

208
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,266
I know you're upset.

209
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,021
But Eduardo is against our country.

210
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,066
Can you blame the colonel if…

211
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,655
If they imprison, hurt,
and kill innocent Filipinos…

212
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,580
who only want to live freely
and peacefully in our own country?

213
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,665
Really?

214
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,671
Adelina, I don't want to argue
about this anymore.

215
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,676
I'm only sure of one thing,

216
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,304
and that is his father's loyalty.

217
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,640
Chikara Tanaka is a hero.

218
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,685
He wholeheartedly served our country,

219
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,857
even before we started
invading the Philippines.

220
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,903
Didn't the four of us promise that,

221
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,199
no matter what happens,
whatever our beliefs may be,

222
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,243
we will always remain friends?

223
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,706
I'm holding on to that promise.

224
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,209
So, please.

225
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,794
Enough.

226
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,346
You're right.

227
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,936
Besides, why am I even hoping
for your colonel's heart to change

228
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,358
when he is the very reason
why our countrymen are suffering?

229
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,820
Think about it.

230
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,867
Is there even justice
in this rampaging war we're in?

231
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
Right?

232
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,913
He's not a rightful leader, Hiroshi.

233
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,000
He is interested in Teresita,
but he is heartless.

234
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:54,383
How can you say that
about our colonel, Adelina?

235
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,604
There is no guarantee

236
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,943
that Hiroshi will be loyal like his father

237
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,950
since he seems to be really good friends
with Teresita and Adelina.

238
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,583
What will happen if they convince him

239
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,086
to rebel against us?

240
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:37,759
It is a disgrace to say such things
about our colonel!

241
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,722
Father.

242
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,685
I apologize for what Adelina has said.

243
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,188
Please understand her.

244
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,482
She doesn't seem to know
who our colonel really is.

245
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
Hiroshi.

246
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,404
Talk to your friend.

247
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:02,409
Our colonel may not be perfect,
but we must respect him.

248
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,582
That shouldn't surprise you
anymore, Mr. Tanaka.

249
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,293
Adelina?

250
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,772
You've seen what she did
to my family, right?

251
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,986
And now, she is destroying
my relationship with Teresita.

252
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,405
With all due respect, señora,

253
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,202
but you're the one destroying
your relationship with her.

254
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:51,250
All you do is force her
to all sorts of men, and for what?

255
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,294
For power and luxury?

256
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,339
Your words only sound sweet

257
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,384
to those people you want to use,

258
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,553
like Colonel Saito and Mr. Tanaka.

259
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,684
Enough, Mrs. Borromeo.

260
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,854
You don't need to hurt her.

261
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
You have a point, Colonel.

262
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,444
Hiroshi grew up in this country with them.

263
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,781
There's a huge possibility

264
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:28,620
that their friendship is more important
to him than our camaraderie.

265
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,209
Hiroshi better not make
the mistake of siding with them

266
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,922
because I will not think twice

267
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:44,428
about taking the lives of his friends.

268
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,601
Enough, Hiroshi!

269
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,321
We are not her people, Mr. Tanaka.

270
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:15,667
My daughter Teresita
and my husband Julio are my only family.

271
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Think about it.

272
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:25,886
That woman
shouldn't even be welcomed here.

273
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,556
She will only destroy our peace!

274
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,353
That bastard deserves

275
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,524
to be kicked out of your home!

276
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,992
If you send Adelina away,

277
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,244
I will leave too.

278
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,121
Are you crazy?

279
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,250
You're going to throw your life
for that woman?

280
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,420
I mean it, Father.

281
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,009
I will only stay here if Adelina stays.

282
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,285
Thank you very much.

283
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,541
Thank you very much, Father.

284
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,820
She'll just destroy
your relationship with your son.

285
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,656
Believe me.

286
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,298
Tell everyone about what happened
to my parents, Ms. Panlilio.

287
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,426
I want everyone to know
how evil the Japanese are.

288
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,179
My condolences, Juan.

289
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,015
But the truth is,

290
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,061
I have heard a lot
of heartbreaking stories

291
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,731
similar to yours.

292
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,776
Your story is no different from theirs.

293
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,990
Many people have been abducted
by the Japanese soldiers.

294
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,658
I'm glad you managed to escape.

295
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,828
But where are you headed now?

296
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,996
To the guerrillas!

297
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,122
-Juan!
-Juan!

298
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,464
What's wrong, sir?

299
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,090
It's the truth.

300
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,969
We're looking for the rebels
who are fighting against the Japanese.

301
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,388
We want to join them.

302
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,187
In that case, you came to the right place.

303
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,814
I know where they are

304
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,276
because my son is one of them.

305
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,537
Mr. Eduardo? Mr. Mario?

306
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,207
They're not here anymore.

307
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,042
They already left for the camp.

308
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,627
They left without me?

309
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,087
I think I heard something.

310
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,758
Father, do you think our intentions
for this country are good?

311
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm sure that as long as we're at war,

312
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,931
we can only dream of a peaceful life.

313
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,475
No family, no lovers,

314
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,227
not a single Filipino will be happy.

315
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,020
Leave me and the colonel for now.

316
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,689
I want to speak to him alone.

317
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,858
What are we going to talk about?

318
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,402
COMING UP

319
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:17,284
