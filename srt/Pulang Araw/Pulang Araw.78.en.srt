1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,919
Did they really do all that to you?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,672
We're telling the truth.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,674
Where is this house you speak of?

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,009
It's in Bulacan.

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,430
I'll do everything I can
to help and protect all of you.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,099
I don't know how I'm going to tell Dad.

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,144
You should tell him.
I'm passing these onto you and Julio.

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,437
And Eduardo too.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,398
So he can help his fellow guerillas.

10
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,233
Where's Teresita Borromeo?

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,111
Is she inside with your colonel?

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,989
There's no more reason for you to resist.

13
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,658
Eduardo Dela Cruz is dead.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,036
I won't say goodbye to your father.

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,204
But you can't go out at this hour, señora.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,332
I can't, I need to be somewhere.

17
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:46,379
I can't find Amalia anywhere.
I think she ran away.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,259
She's a woman, sir. She's not Japanese.

19
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,677
You mean Mr. Tanaka?

20
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,095
Where is he? Is he with you?

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,597
I left him at the pier, Adelina.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,766
-Why?
-You're a traitor.

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,934
He's going back to Japan.

24
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,313
Someone killed Haruto.

25
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,190
Where's his body?

26
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,399
Take me to him!

27
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,525
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,322
Did you catch whoever did this to Haruto?

29
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,490
No, sir.

30
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,824
Don't worry.

31
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,285
We will avenge Haruto!

32
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,912
Yes, sir!

33
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,499
PREVIOUSLY

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,750
Eduardo's going to be happy
once he finds out.

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,134
But I don't know where his troops are now.

36
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,429
Last I heard, they were in Rizal.

37
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,516
But they might not be there anymore.

38
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,773
That sound. Why is it blaring again?

39
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,317
I'll find Eduardo, Adelina.

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,155
I can't stay much longer.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,114
Wait.

42
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,826
Will I see you again?

43
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,871
That's also what I want, my love.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,623
But nothing is certain right now.

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,917
So please stay safe.

46
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,927
Stay safe.

47
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,656
It's just me.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,366
We heard everything.

49
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,246
Get ready.

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,375
-It's almost nightfall.
-What?

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,253
What's going to happen?

52
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,263
You'll stay in my room tonight.

53
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,152
And whatever you hear,

54
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,697
don't cry too loud.

55
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,952
So the soldiers won't hear you.

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,037
Okay.

57
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,289
Why, Teresita?

58
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,917
What's going to happen to us?

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,336
Just be brave.

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,467
God is the only one
you can hold on to tonight.

61
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,543
How do you know my daughter?

62
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,380
Where were you together?

63
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,511
Sir Julio.

64
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,142
I think I'll just let Adelina tell you.

65
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,436
I already told her everything.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,732
We'll go ahead.

67
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,817
Let's go, Lorena.

68
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,132
What really happened to your sister?

69
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,095
Why does it seem

70
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,558
so difficult for all of you
to tell me the truth?

71
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,231
You were right all along, Dad.

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,487
Colonel Saitoh was the mastermind
behind Teresita's disappearance.

73
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,286
The Colonel locked her up
in a garrison in Bulacan,

74
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,625
but Sister Manuela doesn't know
where it is exactly.

75
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,339
And in that garrison…

76
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,473
Teresita was raped by the Colonel.

77
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,689
While his soldiers did the same
to Sister Manuela

78
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,819
and the countless other women
they had abducted.

79
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,283
Sister Manuela and Lorena
escaped with Teresita's help.

80
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:59,127
But they don't know how she is now.

81
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,132
They don't know if she's still alive

82
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,010
or if the Colonel killed her.

83
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,390
Those soldiers should've just killed me…

84
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,396
if this was going to happen.

85
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:36,998
Dad!

86
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,416
Dad.

87
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,585
Dad.

88
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,044
Please calm down.

89
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,797
I don't want you getting hurt.

90
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,718
Please sit down.

91
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,570
Have a drink.

92
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,479
Where's Carmela?

93
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,320
She left immediately after we spoke.

94
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,449
She didn't tell me where she was going.

95
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,120
Dearest.

96
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,123
Can you…

97
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,461
call your Uncle Johnny?

98
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,506
I want to talk to him.

99
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
Okay, Dad.

100
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,720
Please finish your drink.

101
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,734
I'm not one of them.

102
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,528
Please stop crying.

103
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,947
I just have a question.

104
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,743
Do you know a girl named Teresita?

105
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,705
Yes.

106
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,542
She's one of the women we met here.

107
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,710
Where is she?

108
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,297
I think she's in her room.

109
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,219
Julio.

110
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
You were looking for me?

111
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,308
Adelina, my dear.

112
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,228
I'd like to have a word
with your uncle if it's all right.

113
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
-Dad?
-I want to talk to him alone.

114
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,694
You sure you're okay, Dad?

115
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,827
-I'll go on ahead.
-You may go, dear.

116
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,288
Hey.

117
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,296
My friend.

118
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,635
-I have a favor to ask you.
-What is it, my friend?

119
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,513
I need to borrow your gun.

120
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,766
My gun?

121
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,645
I know you're hiding one.

122
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,190
I need it.

123
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,115
Where's her room?

124
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,784
We don't know.

125
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,997
We just got here.

126
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,044
Sir, whoever you are,

127
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,090
please help us.

128
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,261
I'm scared of what
the Japanese will do to us.

129
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,517
Please save us, sir.

130
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,564
-Please, sir.
-Save us.

131
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,983
Please save us.

132
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,277
Dry your tears.

133
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,237
Don't worry.

134
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,448
I'll come back for you.

135
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,783
I promise.

136
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,384
Whoever's not doing anything right now,

137
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,930
may take any of the women.

138
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,390
Let's go!

139
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,518
Teresita?

140
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,354
Teresita, are you there?

141
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,649
-Eduardo?
-Teresita, open the door.

142
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,068
Eduardo?

143
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,822
Teresita. Yes, it's Eduardo.

144
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,199
Open the door.

145
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,910
There's a key to your left.

146
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,286
It's by the wall.

147
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
Where's Dad?

148
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,796
Your father just left.

149
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,548
He left?

150
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,592
Why did he leave? He can't just do that.

151
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,553
He'll get caught.

152
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,179
Your dad knows that.

153
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,349
But I couldn't stop him.

154
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,646
Did he say where he's going?

155
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,524
I bet

156
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,947
he's going to seek revenge for…

157
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,449
what they did to your sister.

158
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,817
Eduardo?

159
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,995
You won't be able to rest now, Teresita.

160
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,003
Because all you'll hear
are the cries of these women.

161
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,094
Do whatever you want.

162
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,346
I leave them to you.

163
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,437
I thought

164
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,941
I heard Eduardo.

165
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,487
I really thought he came.

166
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,783
But I was wrong.

167
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,745
What are the soldiers doing outside?

168
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,832
Why are the women begging?

169
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,211
Just cover your ears.

170
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,757
Don't listen.

171
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,579
Colonel!

172
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,000
You're all useless!

173
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,966
Where are the soldiers you told me about
over the phone?

174
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,094
They're all here.

175
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,017
Colonel, good evening.

176
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,315
Where's your damn friend, Captain?

177
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,527
Where's Hiroshi?

178
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,155
He's gone, Colonel.

179
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,742
He abandoned his post and his men.

180
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,414
Colonel.

181
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,793
It was Private First Class Sugawara

182
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,587
who reported it to us.

183
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,385
Private First Class Sugawara?

184
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,224
Who among you is Sugawara?

185
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,352
That would be me, Colonel!

186
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:29,817
What happened to your camp?

187
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,905
Our camp was attacked
by Filipino guerrillas.

188
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,246
We thought

189
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,125
we were all going to die there, Colonel.

190
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,211
But help came.

191
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,463
That's how we survived.

192
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,133
The enemy probably thought

193
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,427
we called for backup,

194
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:02,349
but it was only Chikara Tanaka.

195
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:08,105
I thought Tanaka was a real hero.

196
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,692
But I was wrong.

197
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,404
I heard his conversation with Hiroshi!

198
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,574
It's only right that you go back to Japan,

199
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,202
so you can report
everything the Colonel has done

200
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,164
to our Prime Minister.

201
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,752
They're no longer happy
with our army, Colonel.

202
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,755
Traitor!

203
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,051
We've been betrayed

204
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,722
by Hiroshi and his father!

205
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,142
Master, how's the woman?

206
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,440
It's me! It's Eduardo!

207
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,608
Sir Jorge!

208
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,694
I know where Teresita is.

209
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,488
-Teresita, are you there?
-Eduardo?

210
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,782
It's Eduardo. Open the door.

211
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,327
There's a key to your left.

212
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:44,368
The women there are being raped
and abused by our enemies.

213
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,204
I'm going to need your help.

214
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,375
It's time we attack the Colonel's garrison

215
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,294
and free Teresita from his grasp.

216
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,592
There's something
I need to show you first.

217
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,472
Lieutenant, what happened to Tanaka?

218
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,436
Did you follow the order
I gave you over the phone?

219
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,356
Yes, Colonel.

220
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,025
Tanaka has been taken care of.

221
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,485
He was killed earlier.

222
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,999
Excellent work, Lieutenant.

223
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,876
You have proven

224
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,214
your loyalty.

225
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,844
And Hiroshi?

226
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,180
Where is he?

227
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,312
Nobody knows where he is, Colonel.

228
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,566
Have our men look for him.

229
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,818
Arrest him at once.

230
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,989
And if he resists, kill him.

231
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,283
Am I clear?

232
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,327
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

233
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,001
This is what the Japanese soldiers
did to our women.

234
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,878
We must do everything to save them.

235
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,756
We can't beat them alone.

236
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,716
We're going to need help
from the other groups.

237
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,385
Now we wait, Eduardo.

238
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,804
We'll attack as soon as
those bastards get here.

239
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,976
Is this how you repay me
for my loyalty to you

240
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,436
and your army?

241
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,273
COMING UP

242
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,950
