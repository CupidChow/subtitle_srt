1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,878
I'll release Adelina tomorrow morning.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,047
But on one condition.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,342
I would like to take a bath
and change into clean clothes.

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,512
I was hoping to wear something
the Colonel would like.

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:17,100
Why not escape?
Find Eduardo. Join the rebels.

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,977
I'll go with you if you want.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,104
Long time no see, stupid colonel.

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,148
Forgive me, Eduardo.

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,775
What I am about to do disgusts me.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,694
But I'm left with no choice.

11
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:32,073
I know you wanted to abduct her.
Now, where is she?

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:36,786
Even if you search the entire camp,

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,205
you won't find her.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,503
My rabid soldiers will surely enjoy

15
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,297
her entire body.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,216
People are not useless and stupid.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,931
That's why Colonel Saitoh
cannot hide his sins for long.

18
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,350
What happened here?

19
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,519
Hey! Yamamoto!

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,854
Anyone!

21
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,481
Come here! Hurry!

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,899
Something bad happened!

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,942
Good morning, Colonel.

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,986
Who did this to you?

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,323
That Filipino rascal.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,704
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

27
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,289
PREVIOUSLY

28
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
Get up.

29
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,091
It's time.

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,642
Please, Akio.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,520
Don't hurt her.

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,898
Please don't do anything to her.

33
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,026
Let's go, Miss Dela Cruz.

34
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,490
Don't worry about me.

35
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,325
Take care, okay?

36
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,411
You too, my love.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,630
Let's go, Tanaka. The car is ready.

38
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,348
Someone's coming.

39
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,018
Please don't shoot!

40
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,270
It's just us.

41
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,529
Where have you been?
Where did you get your clothes?

42
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,948
I was right.

43
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,953
Colonel Saitoh abducted Teresita.

44
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,080
You went to see him?

45
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:33,129
I need to know which camp Teresita is in.
Mr. Jorge, I need to find her.

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,925
If you won't join me,

47
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,595
I'll leave the group and go on my own.

48
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,180
Let me go with you.

49
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,182
I'll go where you go.

50
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,060
Count me in too, sir.

51
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,062
I'll join you too.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,231
Me too.

53
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,735
Sir, we don't even know
where Major Campbell is.

54
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,697
We're just waiting here for nothing.

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,505
Let's go inside.

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,883
We'll discuss your plan there.

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,136
When I find her,

58
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,766
I'll go back to the Colonel

59
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,937
and kill that bastard myself.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,697
I'm beginning to be convinced

61
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:47,161
that there's only one person responsible
for the abduction of my two daughters.

62
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,127
Colonel Saitoh.

63
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,256
He's behind all this.

64
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,470
Julio, don't accuse the Colonel like that.

65
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,724
Mr. Tanaka and I saw him last night.

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,894
When I approached him,
he just passed by and avoided me.

67
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
What do you think that means?

68
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,315
Come on, Carmela.

69
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,569
Are you still going to defend the man
you respect so much?

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,281
Señor!

71
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,408
She's here.

72
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,576
Adelina's back home!

73
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,485
Thank goodness you're home.

74
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,381
He managed to infiltrate our base

75
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,721
because of your stupidity!

76
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,516
Forgive me, Colonel.

77
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,770
I'll reprimand the soldiers immediately.

78
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,064
No.

79
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,699
Contact every garrison and outpost

80
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,453
inside and outside of the city.

81
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,748
Mobilize them

82
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,254
to search every forest and mountain…

83
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,222
until they find all the enemies.

84
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,811
Especially Eduardo Dela Cruz.

85
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:27,113
And if they don't find him
within 24 hours,

86
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:33,744
we'll arrest Adelina Dela Cruz again

87
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,790
to force him out of hiding.

88
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,876
Yes, Colonel!

89
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,978
The Colonel is releasing Adelina.

90
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,231
But on one condition.

91
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,197
Condition?

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,782
What condition?

93
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,463
"I am ordering Adelina
and the entire Borromeo Family

94
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:31,010
to go with Captain Akio Watanabe
to Plaza Santa Cruz

95
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,139
to speak to their fellow Filipinos.

96
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:41,312
I want them to convince their people
to stop resisting our troops,

97
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:48,903
and encourage everyone
to side with the Japanese Imperial Army."

98
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,239
Forgive me, Lieutenant.

99
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,452
But I cannot do that.

100
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,625
If you don't comply,
Adelina will be returned to prison

101
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,170
and no one will be able to help her.

102
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,047
Not even Hiroshi.

103
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,010
He's currently being
transported out of Manila

104
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,763
to his new assignment.

105
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,935
So the decision is in your hands.

106
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,566
I will follow the Colonel's orders
with all my heart.

107
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,152
But will this bring my daughter back?

108
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,615
Are they going to release her?

109
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,909
I am not here for that.

110
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,037
I am here because of a letter
from our colonel.

111
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,083
Mr. Borromeo and Adelina.

112
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm asking you this.

113
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,592
Will you cooperate with
the Japanese Imperial Army or not?

114
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,272
You're still not done?
Hurry up, the Colonel is…

115
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,950
Colonel. What happened to you?

116
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,994
Are you hurt?

117
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,245
Shut up!

118
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,626
Where's Teresita?

119
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,171
She's here!

120
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,896
Nobody cooked the rice?

121
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,991
Let's first find out
if they're guerrillas like us.

122
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,287
-Isn't that cooked? I'm getting hungry.
-It's almost ready.

123
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,916
No.

124
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,920
Uncle Lauro is here.

125
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,297
Sir Ramon was right.

126
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,469
They're enemies.
They side with the Japanese.

127
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,905
Teresita.

128
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,957
Have you had lunch?

129
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,879
If not, come follow me.

130
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,633
I'll prepare your meal.

131
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,819
Why is she suddenly
so friendly to the devil?

132
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,159
I think I know.

133
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,203
But let's talk later.

134
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,500
May the Lord watch over her.

135
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,649
Damn it! It's the guerrillas!

136
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,865
Let's go!

137
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,868
Move!

138
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,922
Eduardo, that's enough!

139
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,175
They're too far away.
You're just wasting your bullets.

140
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:31,101
It's just so hard to accept
that foreigners aren't our only enemy now,

141
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,106
but even fellow Filipinos.

142
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,862
How can they betray our country?

143
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,087
What happened to you?

144
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,882
Who did that to you?

145
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,846
I was ambushed by a rabid animal.

146
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,562
It's none of your business, so don't ask.

147
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,982
Please eat.

148
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,572
Thank you for this meal.

149
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,542
You may sit down and join me.

150
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,546
No, thank you.

151
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,049
I already had lunch.

152
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,282
Did you poison this?

153
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,243
What?

154
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,829
Damn woman!

155
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,500
I am not stupid.

156
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,256
You don't want to eat with me
because you poisoned it.

157
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:30,095
You want to take revenge, is that it?

158
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,974
Admit it!

159
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,582
Damn.

160
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,085
I'm wounded again.

161
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,965
Eduardo got me good.

162
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,220
Eduardo Dela Cruz was there.

163
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,597
He's the man we're after.

164
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,016
That shameless traitor!

165
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,561
Let's move.

166
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,356
I need to inform
Colonel Saitoh about this.

167
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,268
What are you waiting for?

168
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,646
Eat.

169
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,732
I don't know why Teresita
suddenly became like that.

170
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,737
She started treating
that Devil Colonel nicely.

171
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,411
How can she act that way
toward the man who raped her?

172
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,165
Perhaps that woman listened to my advice.

173
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,127
What advice?

174
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,798
-To just accept it?
-To ensnare the devil.

175
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,552
I assure you

176
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,434
Teresita won't be the only one
to save herself with what she's doing.

177
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,644
We'll be saved as well.

178
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:30,854
You're very beautiful, Teresita.

179
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:00,926
My father, as we all know,
became the mayor of Manila.

180
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,054
He was Don Mauricio Pontevedra.

181
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,934
The goodness of my deceased father
towards all of you

182
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,147
is similar to Japan's intentions for us.

183
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,695
I hate this.

184
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,033
Especially with what's happening
to you and Teresita.

185
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,036
They want to unite us Asians

186
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:34,876
to cooperate for a progressive continent.

187
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,879
I don't like this either, Dad.

188
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,342
But I don't want to be locked up again

189
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,470
or killed.

190
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,016
So I ask you.

191
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,436
Let's cooperate with them.

192
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm on a mission, Dad.

193
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,817
To help save our country.

194
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,405
Let's cooperate with them,

195
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,451
so we can live in peace and unity.

196
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,786
Thank you very much!

197
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,291
Why is no one clapping?

198
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,917
Clap!

199
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,629
Clap!

200
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,224
I never thought
you would be a soldier now.

201
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,062
We can't really refuse
if they asked for our service.

202
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,774
I think our colonel wants
to embarrass me in this camp

203
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,568
and to put you in danger
as your worthless leader.

204
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,111
Kenji, we'll all die together.

205
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,906
Hey! Do you have a cigarette?

206
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,826
-Who are you?
-Women, go to your rooms.

207
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,661
No one will touch any of you.

208
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,331
I have done what you wanted.

209
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,625
Now, follow me to my room.

210
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,252
Julio and Teresita are gone.

211
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,004
And now, you're leaving too?

212
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,800
Are you going to wait for Teresita
to be killed in front of you

213
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,885
before you come to your senses?

214
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,512
COMING UP

215
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,435
