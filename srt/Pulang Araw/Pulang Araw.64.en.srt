PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,427
-This letter is useless!
-Dad!

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,012
-Dad!
-Let me in!

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,306
-Please don't hurt us, sir!
-Let me in!

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,851
Just let him in already!

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,769
-Adelina.
-Where are you taking me?

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,895
-Adelina!
-Julio!

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:25,191
You and your sister are now the same.

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,654
Looks like your fate
will be one and the same too.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:34,159
I need to use the restroom.
I can't hold it in anymore.

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,287
Teresita is finding a way
for us to escape!

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,496
How?

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,706
I don't know.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,750
But she already left
with the Devil Colonel.

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,918
She might be planning something for us.

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,464
Teresita!

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,009
Truth is, I didn't do anything.

18
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,804
You're siding with someone
from the rebels,

19
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,724
and that makes you an enemy.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,434
Adelina?

21
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,853
Follow that car just now.

22
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,688
Hurry!

23
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,315
Colonel, over here!

24
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,108
I found her!

25
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,279
Yuta.

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,191
Eduardo!

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,986
Where are you going?

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,740
Sir Jorge sent me on an errand.

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,953
Eduardo, look who we ran into.

30
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,331
My father has an important
message for you.

31
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,627
Someone's looking for all of you.

32
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,045
Especially you, Eduardo.

33
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,382
He wants to kill you.

34
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,426
Who are these people?

35
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,970
They're members of Ganap.

36
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,681
They side with our enemies.

37
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,350
His name is Lauro.

38
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,146
I think he's one of the group's leaders.

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,816
And he wants you dead.

40
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,028
It came straight from Mr. Tanaka.

41
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,823
You and your friends!
You broke into their home and robbed them.

42
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,576
And as if that wasn't enough,
you even murdered Mrs. Tanaka!

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,411
Eduardo, shut up! That's not true!

44
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,746
He's my uncle.

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,415
Is he your relative?

46
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,168
Why does he want to kill you?

47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
The devil is back.

48
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,391
Get out! Out!

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,440
Let me go, Colonel!
I beg you! Don't put me back here!

50
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,234
Please!

51
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,195
-Shut up!
-Let me go!

52
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:02,992
You only proved to me
that you cannot be trusted.

53
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,496
Stop crying!

54
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,762
Lorena!

55
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,643
-Hold this!
-Yes, sir!

56
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,985
Please just let me go, Colonel!
Please, I'm begging you.

57
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,654
No! You're coming with me!

58
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,658
No! I'll stay right here!

59
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,744
Please! I won't escape again!

60
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,414
I don't believe you.

61
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,124
Now, follow me!

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,043
Let me go!

63
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,297
Help! Anyone!

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,631
Please save me!

65
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,095
Don't get involved. You'll only get hurt.

66
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,974
Help!

67
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,895
Help me!

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,857
Help me! Help me!

69
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
I trusted you.

70
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,575
But you made me look like a fool
in front of my men!

71
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,749
Please, it won't happen again.
I promise I won't try to escape again.

72
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,625
Please, Colonel.

73
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,880
You think I'll let this go?

74
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,552
Don't come any closer!

75
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,764
I'm begging you!

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,397
I respected you.

77
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,152
I treated you like an esteemed woman.

78
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,240
But you've shown me

79
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,911
that you don't deserve
to be treated that way.

80
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,715
I will make you regret this day.

81
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,886
You made me look like a fool
in front of everyone!

82
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,140
You ungrateful bitch!

83
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,571
The more you resist,
the more you'll get hurt.

84
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,713
We'll be in trouble if we stay.

85
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,466
Teresita is one of us now.

86
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,303
The Colonel has violated her, hasn't he?

87
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,013
I told you.

88
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,475
Teresita can't do anything to save us.

89
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,059
You just won't listen!

90
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,354
Looks like you were right all along.

91
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,442
I don't think we'll ever be free.

92
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,110
Don't say that.

93
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,239
Lorena, don't lose hope.

94
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,450
The Lord is merciful.

95
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,119
There's no God, Manuela!

96
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,915
How many times do I have to tell you that?

97
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,082
Shut up.

98
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,294
Our fate is what's keeping us alive.

99
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,671
Are you going to take that
away from us too?

100
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,342
Please stop fighting.

101
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,594
We only have each other.

102
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,179
You shouldn't be arguing like this.

103
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,056
So, please. Stop.

104
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,308
Please, stop.

105
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,254
There's no reason for you to cry.

106
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,841
Especially now that I know…

107
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,013
this isn't the first time
you've been intimate with a man.

108
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,683
Isn't that right?

109
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,646
Nevertheless,

110
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,440
there's no need for you to worry.

111
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,236
I will take responsibility for you.

112
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,461
I despise you!

113
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,342
You and your demonic soldiers!

114
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,180
I pray you all die!

115
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,480
And if that happens,

116
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,484
I'll die happily

117
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,989
because I own you.

118
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,289
You monster!

119
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,002
You monster!

120
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,553
You monster!

121
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,778
You monster!

122
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:32,024
I stopped by your first base,
but you already left.

123
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,529
Fortunately, I bumped into my son
and Alberto on the way.

124
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,781
Sir.

125
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,868
Aside from the Japanese troops
looking for us,

126
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,329
what else is happening down there?

127
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,997
It's terrible, Jorge.

128
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,668
The information I've gathered is grim.

129
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:56,882
The enemy garrison
was invaded and attacked

130
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:02,012
by two of our own a few days ago.

131
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:11,397
Those two Filipinos stole
from their enemies.

132
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,822
That's why the Japanese
are retaliating severely.

133
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,576
You're coming with us!
Long live the Emperor!

134
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,994
Please have mercy!

135
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,371
My God!

136
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,956
Line up properly!

137
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,374
Face us!

138
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,334
Look at them closely, Maegawa.

139
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,337
Which of these men dared to steal from us?

140
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,298
Lieutenant, it's not them.

141
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,050
None of these men are the intruders.

142
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,596
Cut their heads and hang them
from the trees to serve as a warning.

143
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,097
Get on with it!

144
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,391
-Get up!
-Why, sir?

145
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,476
Where are you taking us?

146
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,269
But they haven't done anything wrong.

147
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,146
Why are we going to kill them?

148
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,356
This will serve as a warning to them!

149
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,610
So they will be scared
to infiltrate our base.

150
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,032
These soldiers are cruel.

151
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,243
It's like they have no soul.

152
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,413
The next morning,

153
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,416
the villagers were shocked
by what they saw.

154
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,003
Help! My God!

155
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,220
These are the consequences
of your arrogance, Eduardo.

156
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,016
This is how ruthless our enemies are.

157
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,604
Not only are they killing our men,

158
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,860
they are also abusing and mistreating
our wives and children.

159
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,365
They strip them of their dignity.

160
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,954
Just like what those monsters did
to my beloved family.

161
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,251
Now, Eduardo…

162
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:01,090
Do you understand
why I want you all to live long?

163
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,678
All of you!

164
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:11,725
All of us must live

165
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,648
so we can avenge our loved ones!

166
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:25,114
The lives, dignity, and honor
that were taken by our enemies!

167
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,401
Get down, Adelina.

168
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,112
What are you going to do to me?

169
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,365
Get down!

170
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,164
Akio.

171
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,876
Officer. Sir Akio.

172
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,340
Whatever crime I've committed against you…

173
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,721
Whatever it is you think I did wrong,
please forgive me.

174
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,598
I won't do it again.

175
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,018
Please. Please, Akio.

176
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,855
Didn't we used to play together?

177
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,650
Akio?

178
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,237
Perhaps you can help me here.

179
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,239
Even just this once.

180
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,795
What's your purpose here?

181
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,466
They're here to drop me off.

182
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,761
Let us inside.

183
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,806
I can't.

184
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,061
I can only let in officers
and their guests.

185
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,399
In that case, I will go in by myself.

186
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,168
Thank you very much for your help.

187
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,837
I will never forget it.

188
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,758
You may go now.

189
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,984
Please, Sir Akio.

190
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,572
I don't want to be here. Let me go home.

191
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,742
Let's go!

192
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,080
-No!
-Hold still!

193
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,581
Don't hurt me!

194
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,250
Don't give me a hard time!

195
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,086
I don't want to be imprisoned here.

196
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,678
-Let me go, Akio!
-Why did you hurt her?

197
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,015
-Hiroshi.
-Adelina.

198
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,326
Hiroshi! What are you doing here?

199
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,454
Aren't you supposed to be in the province?

200
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,292
Why is Adelina here?

201
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,837
What do you want from her?

202
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
Why can't you speak?

203
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,636
Why did you bring her here?

204
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,269
They barged into your house
and ordered me to be arrested.

205
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,066
My love, didn't you show them my letter?

206
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,402
I did!

207
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,779
But he just tore it!

208
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,702
I thought we were friends, Akio.

209
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,913
You didn't even respect my words.

210
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,043
You shouldn't interfere.

211
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:36,258
Surrender Adelina to us and leave!

212
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,844
No.

213
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,808
Until you tell me
why you're arresting her,

214
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,686
I won't leave.

215
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:56,445
Is this why you assigned me
to a different location?

216
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,658
You did that on purpose
so you could arrest her.

217
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,995
Why?

218
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,373
Who ordered you?

219
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,375
Who?

220
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,170
Why, Hiroshi?

221
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,634
Are you going to disobey our colonel?

222
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
Colonel Saitoh?

223
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,059
He ordered you to arrest her?

224
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,477
Yes.

225
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,694
Sir!

226
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,325
What are you doing here?

227
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,078
Where are you going? I'm coming with you.

228
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,538
You can't. Stay here.

229
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,250
I need to leave before the troop wakes up.

230
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,418
But where are you going?

231
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,047
I'm going to find Colonel Saitoh.

232
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,675
What? I thought you said--

233
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,888
As long as the leader of
our enemies is alive,

234
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,977
as long as they are not made
to pay for their abuses,

235
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,188
their evilness will not stop.

236
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,609
So let me be. Go back inside.

237
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,737
-But, sir…
-One.

238
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,780
Fine.

239
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,865
Just be careful, okay?

240
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,034
Go.

241
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,203
Join the others.

242
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,710
Akio, I want to face our colonel.

243
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,799
The Colonel has assigned you

244
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,761
to work in the province.

245
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,847
Leave this instant!

246
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,105
I won't leave.

247
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,150
I'll accompany Adelina.

248
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,612
You're directly disobeying
the Colonel's orders.

249
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,782
Do you want to be punished
for your stubbornness?

250
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,956
Go ahead and accuse me
of whatever offense you want.

251
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,251
But I won't leave Adelina.

252
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,254
You bastard!

253
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,633
Hiroshi!

254
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,302
Hiroshi…

255
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,264
Don't interfere or you'll only get hurt.

256
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,099
Let go of her!

257
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,982
Hiroshi! Please, don't hurt him.

258
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,445
Please, don't hurt him.

259
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,576
How can you be so cruel?
What have we done to you?

260
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,079
You will not hurt her.

261
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,164
Yamamoto!

262
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,793
That's enough. Let him be.

263
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,296
Captain, are you letting him go
with Adelina?

264
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,924
That's not our colonel's order!

265
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886
That is my order as your captain.

266
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,554
Take them both inside.

267
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,432
Let's go!

268
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,063
Follow Captain Akio!

269
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,193
Hiroshi, you'll be in danger.

270
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,738
Then so be it,
as long as it's for your sake.

271
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,838
He's setting you aside for himself.
It seems the devil has fallen for you.

272
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,132
If you use your head,

273
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,761
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

274
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,890
Start the car right now!

275
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,770
Listen to me, Adelina.

276
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,522
I know what they might do to you.

277
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,149
Prepare yourself.

278
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,694
Bring them both to me.

279
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,154
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

280
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,614
God, please watch over me.

281
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:15,829
COMING UP

282
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,711
