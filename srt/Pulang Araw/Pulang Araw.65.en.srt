1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,752
What about Tasyo? Why isn't he with you?

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,005
We were escaping when he got shot.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,465
I don't know if he's still alive.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,010
There are people looking for
all of you, especially you.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:14,180
Their leader wants to kill you.
A man named Lauro.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,765
Uncle Lauro.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,976
I trusted you,

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,396
but you made me look like a fool
in front of my soldiers!

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:27,402
You've shown me that you don't
deserve that kind of respect.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,738
Teresita has become just like us.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,159
The Colonel has violated her, hasn't he?

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,370
There is no salvation for us here.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,248
Not only are they killing our men,

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,669
they are also abusing and mistreating
our wives and children.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,547
Why did you hurt her?

16
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,466
What do you want from her?

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,886
Are you going to disobey
the order of our colonel?

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,096
As long as the leader of
our enemies is alive,

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,308
as long as they are not made
to pay for their abuses,

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,268
their evilness will not stop.

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,436
I will accompany Adelina.

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,939
PREVIOUSLY

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,192
Go ahead and accuse me
of whatever offense you want.

24
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,611
But I won't leave Adelina.

25
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,696
Hiroshi, you will only be in danger.

26
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,283
Then so be it,
as long as it's for your sake.

27
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,918
Do you need anything, Colonel?

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,006
I am entrusting Teresita to you.

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,676
Watch her closely.

30
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,472
She must not leave this house.

31
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,893
Because, if she escapes again,

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,066
your life and the lives of the women here

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,902
will be the price.

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,739
Is that clear?

35
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,992
Yes, Colonel.

36
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,688
You shouldn't be doing this
just for a woman, Hiroshi.

37
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,983
She's not worth
losing your comfortable life for.

38
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,903
Just close the gate.

39
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,172
Tasyo.

40
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,610
Forgive me.

41
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,867
I failed you.

42
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,736
I don't know how.

43
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,282
But they found out that I know
where Eduardo's group is hiding.

44
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,994
Perhaps they had you and Marcel followed.

45
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,760
My God.

46
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,515
Hiroshi, they might arrest Marcel too.

47
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,311
Adelina, could you not think about
anyone else for now?

48
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
It's truly not possible.

49
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:45,988
Even if it's not Julio Borromeo,
at least allow me to enter for a moment.

50
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,366
Chikara Tanaka.

51
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,536
It's even more impossible
for you to enter.

52
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,830
The Captain forbids it.

53
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,168
Mr. Tanaka, what are they saying?

54
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,724
I said no!

55
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,685
Hurry up and leave!

56
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,203
Hiroshi.

57
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,373
You shouldn't have
gotten involved in this.

58
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,838
This will ruin your life,
your career, your reputation…

59
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,467
even your father's standing
among your people.

60
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,927
Never mind me.

61
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,347
I'm used to hardship and suffering.

62
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,850
But you?

63
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:04,150
You must have lost your mind,
doing all this for me.

64
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,656
Go now, while there's still time.

65
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,701
Talk to Akio again.

66
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,245
Tell him you regret it.

67
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,082
Beg for forgiveness!
Save yourself, Hiroshi.

68
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,627
I've already made my decision, Adelina.

69
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,046
Have you really lost your mind?

70
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,841
It's wrong to sacrifice yourself for me!

71
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,052
Don't you understand that, Hiroshi?

72
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:52,323
My love, I'm willing to face
any punishment…

73
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,160
as long as I'm with you.

74
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,248
So don't cry, my love.

75
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,500
What are you doing here, Juan?
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

76
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:50,715
You need my help. Just let me.
I'm not a burden to you!

77
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,929
Fine, fine. You're such a kid.

78
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,939
See? I told you you'd need my help.

79
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,359
But why are we doing this?

80
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,490
We need transportation, so we'll wait.

81
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,577
That way, we can reach
Colonel Saitoh quickly.

82
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,287
Let's go.

83
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,517
It's just me. What's wrong with you?

84
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,146
Oh, my Lord, Amalia,
we thought it was the soldiers.

85
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,775
It's a miracle the demons
haven't climbed up yet.

86
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,659
Why aren't the beloved
minions of Satan here yet?

87
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,413
Usually, by this time of night,
those monsters are all lined up outside.

88
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,632
Most of them left.

89
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,094
They said they have a mission.

90
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,972
I hope they all die on that mission.

91
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,059
Watch your mouth, Amalia.

92
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,645
The guard might hear you.

93
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,066
It'd be fine if you were the only one
who would be punished.

94
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,577
Lorena, how is Teresita?

95
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:49,333
She doesn't want to leave her room.
She's still crying.

96
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,669
I understand her.

97
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,215
On my first night here,
I also cried and cried.

98
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,552
I just wanted to die.

99
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,804
Enough, let's not talk about it.

100
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,808
Maybe it's better if we just pray.

101
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,146
Prayer is not what Teresita needs.

102
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,700
Come, let's just pray.

103
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,885
Get moving!

104
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:09,455
Leave now, Tanaka, if you don't
want to get locked up here too.

105
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,873
I understand.

106
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
Mr. Tanaka…

107
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
Get lost!

108
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,389
Stop that.

109
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,475
Your crying won't do or change anything.

110
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,272
Do you really think I just want to cry?

111
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:22,695
Do you think I want to keep
thinking about how I was violated?

112
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,282
In my entire life,

113
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,537
I have never felt
so disgusted with myself!

114
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,092
You can cry about it now,
but don't cry forever.

115
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,221
Be strong.

116
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,810
Remember this, they only took our bodies.

117
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,774
Not our spirit, so don't give that up.

118
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,193
Especially your sanity!

119
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,572
We cannot lose our minds here.

120
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,535
You're actually lucky,
only one Japanese soldier raped you.

121
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,583
Unlike us,
who have been violated by different men

122
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,921
on the many nights
we've been imprisoned here.

123
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,509
So, you're still more special than us.

124
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,553
Use your head.

125
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,061
Women can still fight, especially you.

126
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,400
Fight? With what weapon?

127
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,197
Sir. Someone's coming.

128
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,333
Karyas, Dondi! Get down! Help me!

129
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,091
Hurry! Friends, help us!

130
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,342
Let's go, let's go!

131
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,012
-Take to the other side.
-Okay.

132
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,430
One, two, three!

133
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,475
They're Filipinos, sir.

134
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,688
Can we ride with them?

135
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,023
Let's go!

136
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on, hurry up!

137
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,446
Let's approach them.

138
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,536
They're too many, Juan.
It's hard to trust them.

139
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
Yuta likes you, doesn't he?

140
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,723
He wants to possess you.

141
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,435
He's setting you aside for himself.

142
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,187
It seems the devil has fallen for you.

143
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,485
Use that to your advantage.

144
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,572
If you use your head,

145
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:17,244
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

146
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,300
Why did you allow Hiroshi to go
with Adelina to the prison cell?

147
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,847
He can't be stopped, Colonel.

148
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,852
He really wants to protect the lady.

149
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,737
In that case…

150
00:17:53,572 --> 00:18:00,537
bring them here
and present both of them to me.

151
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,916
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

152
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,404
Hiroshi, get out.

153
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,041
Start walking.

154
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,711
Listen to me, Adelina.

155
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,798
I know what they might do to you.
They are very brutal.

156
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,509
So prepare yourself.

157
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,262
You too.

158
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:01,974
Shut up!

159
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,641
Colonel.

160
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,480
Sit down.

161
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,541
Don't just stare at us like that.

162
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,336
What do you want from me?

163
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,543
What a waste.
We could have had a ride by now.

164
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,224
According to Akio…

165
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:15,565
you are saying you don't know
where your brother's camp is.

166
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,861
I don't, sir.

167
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,368
Are you sure?

168
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,832
You really don't know
where your brother is hiding?

169
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:40,173
Because we already know where his camp is.

170
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,014
In fact,

171
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,767
my soldiers went there.

172
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,942
Come! Over here! Hurry!

173
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,030
Someone was here.

174
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,658
No one is in sight.

175
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,201
They were here earlier!

176
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:13,290
However, they were unlucky because
Eduardo Dela Cruz had already escaped.

177
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,209
And so had his group.

178
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,725
Now, tell me…

179
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,233
where did they move camp?

180
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,082
Colonel, please calm down.

181
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,835
Please don't hurt Adelina.

182
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,505
Shut up!

183
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,638
Thank you very much
for letting us ride with you.

184
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,682
Thank you for trusting us.

185
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,809
You're welcome.

186
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,563
We even helped a Japanese,
so why wouldn't we help our countrymen?

187
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,943
What? They are evil! Why did you help him?

188
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,821
Not all of them are evil, son.

189
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,490
The one who hitched a ride
with us earlier seemed nice.

190
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,200
He's still young.

191
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,203
He looks about the same age as you.

192
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,374
He asked us nicely
to drop him off at Fort Santiago.

193
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,377
The Japanese have turned that place
into their camp.

194
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,131
Is he a soldier?

195
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,341
A Kempeitai?

196
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,304
I don't know,
but he is wearing their uniform.

197
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,935
He made us follow a car
that had a young lady

198
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,187
who seemed to have been
arrested by Japanese soldiers.

199
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,732
I think he wants to save that young lady.

200
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,403
But I'm not so sure.

201
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,947
That's how I read the situation.

202
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,501
That is one of the answers
I hate the most.

203
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,548
"I don't know."

204
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,264
Where are they?

205
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,684
I said I don't know.

206
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,569
Colonel, Adelina and her brother
haven't seen each other in a long time.

207
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,740
Hiroshi!

208
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,784
I did not tell you to stand.

209
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,914
I only asked you

210
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,377
to tell me where your brother is hiding.

211
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,048
Colonel, I'm begging you.

212
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:14,596
Even if Adelina knows something…

213
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,602
no one would want
their family to be in danger.

214
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,521
I hope you understand that!

215
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,115
You really don't want to confess, miss?

216
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,206
It's just so hard to accept
that foreigners aren't our only enemy now,

217
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,124
but even fellow Filipinos.

218
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,502
How can they betray our country?

219
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,005
I don't know why Teresita
suddenly became like that.

220
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,384
She started treating
that Devil Colonel nicely.

221
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,552
Perhaps that woman listened to my advice.

222
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,972
-What advice?
-To ensnare the devil.

223
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,433
It's true that many Japanese
are good-hearted,

224
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:07,440
but many of them are like
wolves in sheep's clothing.

225
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,942
-Shut up!
-Hey!

226
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,821
COMING UP

227
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,701
Where did you take her?

228
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,541
