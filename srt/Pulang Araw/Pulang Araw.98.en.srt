1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>They'll only release her
if Eduardo or I surrender.</i>

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:08,299
<i>He's just using Adelina to force Teresita
and Eduardo to surrender?</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>I’m giving you until tonight to come back.</i>

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,974
<i>Or else, something bad
will happen to Adelina.</i>

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>I'm sorry,
but I'm going to need your help.</i>

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>I must save my sister.</i>

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,938
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,358
<i>Adelina, why is that soldier
looking at us?</i>

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>I know Akio.</i>

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,823
<i>He's not a greedy man like Saitoh
who will do anything to get what he wants.</i>

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,866
<i>Drink it.</i>

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>That has poison.</i>

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>- You got me there, Colonel.</i>
- Why, Akio?

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>Is there a reason for me
to take your life away?</i>

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,002
<i>I'll do as you say, Yuta.</i>

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,336
I'll surrender.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>I'm glad you made the right decision.</i>

18
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,801
<i>You have nowhere else to go, but to me.</i>

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,678
Are you sure about your decision?

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,474
You’ll be in great danger
if you surrender to the Japanese.

21
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,225
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>This is the only way to stop Yuta
once and for all.</i>

23
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,982
<i>That's a powerful poison for rats.</i>

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,777
It can also kill humans and other animals.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>Can you really die by just inhaling this?</i>

26
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,155
<i>Yes, miss.</i>

27
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>That can kill you through your mouth,
nose, eyes, and body.</i>

28
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,871
<i>Even just by a drop.</i>

29
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,806
Everyone, leave us.

30
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,060
I want to be alone with my wife.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,562
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

32
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>This is what I'll use to kill
the most hated man of this nation.</i>

33
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,879
<i>The moment I stab him with this,</i>

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,590
<i>the poison will seep into his blood</i>

35
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,885
<i>causing him to lose his life.</i>

36
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,933
What a brilliant plan.

37
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,978
I'm sure that poison is deadly enough
to do the trick.

38
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,773
In that case,

39
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,401
I’ll surrender.

40
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,782
Not just to free my sister.

41
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,287
But to secure Yuta's demise.

42
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,280
Take off your uniforms!

43
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,338
Don't be fooled!

44
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,715
They won't kill us!

45
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,429
Don’t test our patience.

46
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,889
Please spare us!

47
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,226
Don’t kill us! I have a family!

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,687
- Spare us!
- I’m sorry.

49
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,649
Put away your guns!

50
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,319
Use your machetes!

51
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,707
This is for the all lives you took away!

52
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,168
Lord.

53
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,046
Forgive us all.

54
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,435
Yamamoto.

55
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,358
Do you understand what I want you to do?

56
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,694
Yes, Colonel.

57
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,071
I'll do as you say.

58
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,282
Good.

59
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:12,038
Make sure not to mention this to anyone.

60
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,044
Especially not to Captain Watanabe.

61
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,758
He's not to be trusted.

62
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,636
Yes, Colonel.

63
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,287
<i>- Who started this?
- It was me.</i>

64
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,668
<i>You’re worse than a traitor!</i>

65
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,133
You won't be able to rest now, Teresita.

66
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,386
You'll hear the cries of these women.

67
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
Captain, with all due respect.

68
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,921
But did you have a fight with the Colonel?

69
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,839
Why do you ask, Lieutenant?

70
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,051
He gave me an order just now.

71
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,720
Did you two have a disagreement?

72
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,764
What order did he give you?

73
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,487
What's the order?

74
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,072
Tell me.

75
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,698
The Colonel won't find out.

76
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,621
My wife has decided to come back
to save Adelina Dela Cruz.

77
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,041
As soon as she returns,

78
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,545
carry out my orders immediately.

79
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,422
Kill Hiroshi Tanaka

80
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,260
and Adelina Dela Cruz

81
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,929
all at once.

82
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,891
That was his order, Captain.

83
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,726
The Colonel is right.

84
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,105
There’s no reason
to keep these traitors alive.

85
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,026
Lieutenant, you're absolutely right.

86
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,738
Thank you, Captain.

87
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,796
Commander, there's a checkpoint.

88
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,215
Don't be too obvious.

89
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,476
Good morning. Where are you headed?

90
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,089
Miss, your carriage has arrived.

91
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,843
But I'm still worried about your decision.

92
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,851
Don’t worry about me.

93
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,938
But just in case…

94
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,901
If something happens to me,

95
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,364
just pray for my soul.

96
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,993
Miss, you're only scaring me more.

97
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,039
Please take care of yourself.

98
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,671
Thank you so much, sir.

99
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,609
Open the door.

100
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,195
Does the Colonel need anything
from the prisoner?

101
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,406
Why do you care?

102
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,659
I'm still your captain.

103
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,161
Now, open the door.

104
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,081
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:55,923
Akio.

106
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,803
- Hiroshi, follow me.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,684
- Where are we going?
- To Adelina's cell.

108
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,730
We will set them free.

109
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,084
So you're delivering food and supplies?

110
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,005
That’s right.

111
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716
Please let us pass.

112
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,970
Wait.

113
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,306
I can't let you through just yet.

114
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,961
All good! Let them through!

115
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,088
Thanks!

116
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,675
How did you learn Japanese?

117
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,888
After being imprisoned for so long,
I learned a thing or two.

118
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,478
Thank you, God.

119
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,273
These soldiers are a bunch of idiots.

120
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,568
Let’s go, Pablo.

121
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,614
Thank you.

122
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,292
Hello?

123
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,127
Colonel Saitoh speaking.

124
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,257
Colonel, I saw Captain Watanabe just now.

125
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>He released Hiroshi Tanaka from his cell.</i>

126
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,433
I have a feeling
that he'll also release Adelina Dela Cruz.

127
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,487
There are way to many checkpoints now.

128
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,705
Where are you headed?

129
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,058
They deliver our supplies to Camp Doroteo,

130
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,185
but looks like they're lost.

131
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,229
They missed their destination.

132
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,865
You're heading in the direction.

133
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,500
Did you take a wrong turn?

134
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,296
Why aren't you talking?

135
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,048
I see.

136
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,933
Adelina? Adelina?

137
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,435
Adelina?

138
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,779
You’re not Japanese, are you?

139
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,866
You’re Filipinos!

140
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,267
Retreat! Retreat!

141
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,396
Retreat!

142
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,320
Pablo!

143
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,714
Where's Adelina?

144
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,675
I don’t know. I didn't peek inside.

145
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,762
I thought she was just there
all this time.

146
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,765
Don't lie to me.

147
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,018
Where's Adelina?

148
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,730
Hiroshi, calm down.

149
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:10,779
How come you haven't noticed
the girls leaving their cell?

150
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,907
Captain, we just got here to stand guard.

151
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,035
We really don’t know anything.

152
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,788
Come on, Hiroshi.

153
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,083
You two stay here!

154
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,636
What is the Captain doing?

155
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,972
Is he helping that prisoner escape?

156
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,809
I don’t know.
He just told us to stay here.

157
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,542
Looks like we lost them.

158
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,129
Commander, this mission is impossible.

159
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,173
There are too many checkpoints.

160
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,716
We won't get through.

161
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,426
He's right.

162
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,137
They've become stricter now.

163
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,972
This is suicide, Eduardo.

164
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,475
I can’t leave Adelina and Teresita behind.

165
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,062
You can back out if you want.

166
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,856
Make your way out of the jungle.
I'll take it from here.

167
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,526
What? Hey, do you have a death wish?

168
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,614
I’ll be able to move better alone.

169
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,659
So just follow my orders.

170
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,165
Suit yourself. Let’s go, men.

171
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,342
Akio, what about Adelina?

172
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,178
They're gone, aren't they?

173
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,601
We don’t have time to search anymore.

174
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,563
Didn't you hear the sirens?

175
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,233
We're caught.

176
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,194
We need to leave now.

177
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,211
Damn it.

178
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,298
He's already figured us out.

179
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,637
You three, search for them!

180
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,556
Yes, sir!

181
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,404
Akio, it's no use.

182
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,162
Unless I show myself.

183
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,290
You must go without me, my friend.

184
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,626
Akio.

185
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,922
Don't get yourself killed for me.

186
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,262
I've already accepted my fate.

187
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,776
<i>Captain Watanabe is gone.
And so are the prisoners.</i>

188
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,111
<i>Keep looking! They haven't gotten far!</i>

189
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>Find them!</i>

190
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,032
<i>I never agreed for you to hurt me.</i>

191
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,825
<i>Now, where's my sister?</i>

192
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,245
- Release her this instant.
- There’s no need for that.

193
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>She has escaped just like Hiroshi.</i>

194
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,417
<i>Don’t scream if you don’t want to die.</i>

195
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,753
<i>Where's Colonel Saitoh?
Where's your Colonel?</i>

196
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,508
COMING UP

197
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,597
