1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>What are you doing?</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,213
Believe it or not,
I didn't know that she’s already married!

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>I'm not going with you anymore, Eduardo.</i>

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>I want to go back to Lauro.</i>

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,846
Who would've thought
I'd be able to catch you here?

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>How are you, Mrs. Saitoh?</i>

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,976
<i>This is the best time for you to escape.</i>

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,394
<i>You're letting me escape?</i>

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Don’t you want to?</i>

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,565
Tie her up. She's the only one I need.

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,442
Once you're done, I'll let you go.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>I'm no longer that helpless child
you used to bully, Uncle.</i>

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,157
- Adelina!
<i>- Find Adelina.</i>

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>Our Colonel has ordered
our men to arrest her.</i>

15
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>Save your sister.</i>

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>Where's Amalia?</i>

17
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>They’re not with us.
We had to leave them behind.</i>

18
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,543
PREVIOUSLY

19
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,587
<i>My wife has escaped!</i>

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,339
<i>I'm certain that she's on her way
to Adelina right now!</i>

21
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,049
Teresita!

22
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,177
Your niece wants to kill me!

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,511
Help me untie myself!

24
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,181
Do you think I'll follow you like a fool?

25
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,601
You deserve to die, you traitor.

26
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,690
I won't die in the hands
of someone like you!

27
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,589
Morena, don’t be afraid. It’s just me.

28
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,925
My name is Omar.

29
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,095
I work as a carpenter.
I make stage props around here.

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,514
Omar.

31
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,100
God. I thought you were a soldier.

32
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,436
I’m sorry if I frightened you.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,730
My wife left me too.

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,732
I’m also afraid
of those Japanese soldiers.

35
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
They might take me away,
so I hid here in the theater.

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,990
And you, Miss Morena?
What happened to you?

37
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,660
How did you escape from those soldiers?

38
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,121
Omar, we'll talk about that later.

39
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,373
For now, I'm going to need your help.

40
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,417
I need to speak with Adelina.

41
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,587
Do you know where she might be?

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,842
Forgive me, but I don't know
where Miss Chinita is right now.

43
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,310
I’m still here.

44
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,274
Eduardo and I are here for you, Auntie.

45
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,278
Amalia, I’m here too.

46
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,239
Not just as a friend.

47
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,366
You were like a sister to me

48
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,454
with everything we’ve been through.

49
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,791
Auntie, come with us.

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,752
Let’s find Eduardo together.

51
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,049
We’ll fight against our enemies
side by side.

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,970
Prepare yourselves, then.

53
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,266
We’ll leave soon.

54
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,357
Oh, God.

55
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,443
Where can I find my sister?

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,240
I’m too scared to go out and find her.

57
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,034
I can't afford to get caught.

58
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,911
I don’t want to go back to Yuta.

59
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,121
Don’t worry, Miss.

60
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,917
I'll go out first thing
in the morning tomorrow.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,504
Just tell me where you think she might be,

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,673
and I’ll find her.

63
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,549
Just leave it to me.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,761
Thank you, Omar.

65
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,141
To tell you the truth,

66
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,813
when I was young,

67
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,068
I saw you as…

68
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,946
a wicked woman.

69
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,326
Why are we taking my things?

70
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,495
Because you’ll be living with Julio
from now on.

71
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,790
Why are you sending Adelina away

72
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,835
when this house belonged to my mother?

73
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,044
Eduardo!

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,715
<i>We can’t afford to take care both of you.</i>

75
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,386
<i>It’s only right that your father
takes responsibility for you.</i>

76
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,888
Here! You take care of Adelina!

77
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,935
But now,

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,897
everything has changed for the better.

79
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,321
Have I become an angel now, Adelina?

80
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,578
You've been a very brave woman.

81
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:38,004
And I’m proud to call you
my Auntie Amalia.

82
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,495
Hiroshi, tell me. Where is Adelina?

83
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,249
Where is she?

84
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,001
I don’t know!

85
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,756
Even if you kill me right now,

86
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,301
my answer won't change.

87
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,430
I don’t know.

88
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,603
Remember this, Tanaka Hiroshi.

89
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,991
I'll arrest her

90
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,622
and kill her in front of you!

91
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,349
Let go of me!

92
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,928
If only you were still alive, Mom…

93
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,934
My brave children.

94
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,912
…maybe Eduardo and I
would've lived a very different life.

95
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,587
Adelina.

96
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,048
Are you ready to go?

97
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,133
Yes, Sister.

98
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,887
I got you some clothes too, Auntie Amalia.

99
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,930
Let’s go.

100
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,776
Put down your gun!

101
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
Sister.

102
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,493
Amalia.

103
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,620
And you.

104
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,248
Adelina Dela Cruz!

105
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,125
Go away! Leave us alone!

106
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,169
Drop your gun

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,591
if you don’t want all three of you to die!

108
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,343
Don't, Manuela.

109
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,639
We’ll lose the fight
if you drop your weapon.

110
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,808
But we’re going to die, Auntie.

111
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,435
Bow down to us!

112
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,478
You’re weak.

113
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,564
You’re weak.

114
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,275
You won't stand a chance!

115
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,819
Sister Manuela!

116
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Why aren’t you bowing down?

117
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,823
Show us some respect!

118
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,283
Bow down!

119
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,665
You’ll pay for this!

120
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,843
Auntie!

121
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,478
At least I'll be with Luisa in paradise.

122
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,529
Search the house!
Mrs. Saitoh could be here too!

123
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,239
Hurry up!

124
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,534
Tie them up now!

125
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,874
Please tell God about this.

126
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,586
Tell Him everything they did to us.

127
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,526
<i>There's no reason for me
to live anymore, Yuta!</i>

128
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,280
You've already ruined my family.

129
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,866
So just kill me instead.

130
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,372
Do it, you bastard!

131
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,378
I would rather die here

132
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,838
and lay to rest next to my father

133
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,925
than be alive with you
on this hellish world!

134
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,427
You took away my reason to live.

135
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,763
I'm no longer afraid to die!

136
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,848
Colonel!

137
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,894
Where's Gouki?

138
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:33,317
Wasn't he the one I assigned to lead you?

139
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,695
A Filipina killed him, Colonel.

140
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,077
However, that woman is also dead now.

141
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,542
Well? Have you found Teresita?

142
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:56,715
No. But we've found her sister, Adelina.

143
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,329
Eduardo.

144
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,832
We're out of medicine.

145
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,420
This is going to be a problem
if one of us gets hurt.

146
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,885
And our food is not going to last us
much longer.

147
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,222
And as for Minyong…

148
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,147
- He’s been like that since last night.
- The Japanese are here.

149
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,357
Hide, they’re coming.

150
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,942
The Japanese are here.

151
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,778
Hide, they’re coming. Hide…

152
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,364
I don't think he'll survive
another day here.

153
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,242
Who wouldn't lose their mind at war?

154
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,578
We face danger every day.

155
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,542
Keep an eye on him.

156
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,961
Let him rest.

157
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
Maybe he’ll get better.

158
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,384
Leave the food and medicine to me.

159
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,013
I'm going somewhere.

160
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,308
You'll lead the group on my behalf.

161
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,855
If you got caught in a fight and escaped,

162
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,192
meet me at the west side of the river.

163
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,542
Will I ever see you again?

164
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,213
I don’t know.

165
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,844
Only God knows the answer to that.

166
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,766
Be careful out there, my love.

167
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,568
Until we meet again.

168
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,070
My love.

169
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,745
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

170
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,373
<i>My love.</i>

171
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,797
<i>You're going alone?</i>

172
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
It's fine.

173
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,430
It'll be much easier to go alone.

174
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,265
I'm going to the city.

175
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,145
I dreamt of Adelina last night, Tasyo.

176
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,522
I have a bad feeling.

177
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,234
I can feel that my sister is in danger.

178
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,355
Adelina.

179
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,275
Hiroshi?

180
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,033
You can't talk!

181
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,495
Don’t you dare hurt her!

182
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,829
Release her at once!

183
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,123
We will not follow you.

184
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,918
You're not our Colonel!

185
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,545
You scoundrels!

186
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,131
Let her go!

187
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,258
Lock these women up.

188
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,886
Adelina.

189
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,846
Adelina!

190
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,076
Are you sure you'll be okay all alone?

191
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,829
- Let me go with you.
- Our group needs you.

192
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,706
Eduardo.

193
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,917
The Japanese are coming.

194
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,044
They’re headed in our direction.

195
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,631
Tell everyone to get ready.

196
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,842
You heard him. Go.

197
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,803
The Japanese are coming, get ready.

198
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,887
Come on.

199
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,056
Minyong?

200
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,435
Can you still fight?

201
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,989
Adelina!

202
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,078
Adelina!

203
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,918
Adelina!

204
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,594
Don't hurt Adelina!

205
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,229
And if she's hurt, what then?

206
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,983
You know very well

207
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,195
what you're doing is wrong!

208
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,239
The woman you love

209
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,203
is also in the wrong, Hiroshi.

210
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,999
That woman works for

211
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:10,881
the rebels who are against our army.

212
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,508
Liar!

213
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,259
That's not why you arrested her!

214
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,427
It’s Eduardo.

215
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,431
He's the reason you're after Adelina!

216
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:24,353
Those siblings are opposing

217
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,815
my army.

218
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,108
That's why…

219
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:36,281
it's only right that I have them arrested!

220
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:42,246
Stop this madness, Yuta!

221
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,007
Yuta!

222
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,278
Adelina.

223
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,614
I don't want to be in the same situation

224
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,700
I was in before.

225
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,910
I feel like I’m going to lose my mind.

226
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,939
Look who's back home.

227
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:56,778
If it isn't the sister
of Eduardo Dela Cruz.

228
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,797
Do you know that there's a camp here?

229
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,341
No, sir.

230
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,301
Retreat!

231
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,269
Minyong!

232
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,748
Interesting.

233
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,674
Did this woman ever tell you

234
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,469
about the things
she’s been through, Adelina?

235
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,775
If you’re looking for my brother,

236
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,695
I’ll tell you right now.

237
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,116
I don’t know where he’s hiding.

238
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,578
I don't need to know

239
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,915
because I know you won't tell me.

240
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:39,172
I'll use you in some other way.

241
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,388
<i>Listen to me, my wife.</i>

242
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,683
I’m giving you until tonight to come back.

243
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,186
<i>Or else, something bad
will happen to Adelina.</i>

244
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>I know you're a good man
and a good soldier.</i>

245
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,899
So, do what’s right. Help us escape.

246
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,027
<i>There was no sign of forced entry.</i>

247
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>Which meant somebody helped her escape.</i>

248
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,782
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to need your help.

249
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,702
I won’t force anyone,
but I'll forever be grateful.

250
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,162
<i>Count me in, Commander.</i>

251
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,205
<i>- Us too, Commander!
- We’re with you, Commander!</i>

252
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>I'll do as you say, Yuta.</i>

253
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>I'll surrender.</i>

254
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,046
COMING UP

255
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,964
<i>He's also a traitor.</i>

256
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,967
<i>He ruined our mission.</i>

257
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,558
