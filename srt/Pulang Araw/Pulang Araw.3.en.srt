1
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,749
Carmela.

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,209
Adelina only has me to rely on.

3
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,591
Do you really intend
for your bastard child to live with us?

4
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,633
Why?

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,054
So I'll always be reminded
of your infidelity?

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,225
Aren't you satisfied with all the women
you have at your theater?

7
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,519
You even impregnated one of them!

8
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,646
You.

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,648
Where is that mother of yours?

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,318
My mother is gone.

11
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,237
She died.

12
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,032
From tuberculosis.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,788
That's why I can't bear
to abandon my daughter.

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,373
Never!

15
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:28,129
Your bastard child
will bring much shame on me!

16
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,926
And where am I supposed to take her, huh?

17
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,929
It's fine, Dad.

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,432
Please, just let me leave.

19
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,521
Yolanda, take this girl out of my house.

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,064
No!

21
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,274
She's not leaving.

22
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,488
I've made my decision
as the head of this household.

23
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,199
Adelina will live here,

24
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,369
whether you like it or not!

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,125
Adelina.

26
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,878
Meet your sister.

27
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
Her name is Teresita.

28
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,135
And she's my wife.

29
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,180
From now on,
you will call her "Mama Carmela".

30
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,184
"Señorita Carmela."

31
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,437
That's how you will address me.

32
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:32,986
I don't want anyone to know
who or what she is.

33
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:41,286
I will introduce her
as your distant relative.

34
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:48,001
And you will never, ever
call him "Papa", "Dad", or "Father".

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,836
You will call him "Uncle".

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,837
Carmela.

37
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,755
I will allow this.

38
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,929
But I will not let myself
be disgraced by the public.

39
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,516
Are we clear on this?

40
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,061
Yes, Señorita.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,814
Good.

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,595
On that day, ten years
before the Japanese invaders came…

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,934
my entire family and I
entered life's battlefield.

44
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,160
We buried Mario.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,372
In the forest.

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,668
Somewhere in Laguna.

47
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,384
I'm sorry, Auntie, Uncle.

48
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,972
We buried him…

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,518
but you didn't get to see his remains.

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,110
There was no other way for me
to bring him home to you.

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,865
And we could've been
caught by the Japanese.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,159
I understand.

53
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,664
Our only wish is to see

54
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,834
our son's final resting place.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,382
Once the Americans arrive
and the Japanese surrender…

56
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,177
I promise…

57
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,848
I will take you there.

58
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,100
Thank you, Eduardo.

59
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,812
Get some rest.

60
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,775
You and that child must be
tired from the journey.

61
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,746
Can I leave Juan with you?

62
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,124
He's an orphan too.

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,544
The Japanese killed his parents.

64
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:42,550
I worry about his safety
since he always comes with us.

65
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,887
We face danger every day.

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,056
He's like us now.

67
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,184
Orphaned by our son.

68
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,103
Leave him with us.

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:02,278
We will take care of him
just like how we took care of Mario.

70
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,532
Thank you.

71
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,623
Once again, please accept my condolences.

72
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,085
I will take my leave now.

73
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,922
Take care.

74
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,632
You should see him off.

75
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,861
Juan reminds me of you, Adelina.

76
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,032
Especially when you were brought
to someone else's home.

77
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,453
Come in.

78
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,167
This is my office.

79
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,837
For now,

80
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,383
this will be your room.

81
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,684
Your wife scares me.

82
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,563
She hates me.

83
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,732
Try to understand her.

84
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,820
Be kind and obedient to her, to them,

85
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,406
to your sister, Teresita.

86
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,658
In no time at all,

87
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,162
I know they'll learn to accept you.

88
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,331
Can you do that?

89
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,083
Yes, Dad.

90
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,004
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,506
Yes, Uncle.

92
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,851
Adelina, my dear.

93
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,773
When it's just the two of us,
you can call me "Dad".

94
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,674
Where is your mother?

95
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,385
She locked herself up in your room, Papa.

96
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,972
I need to go to the theater.

97
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,646
Look after your mother and sister.

98
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,524
She's not my sister.

99
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,070
She's just your distant relative, right?

100
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,613
Teresita.

101
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,409
Haven't you been begging us for a sibling?

102
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, your wish has been granted.

103
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,542
She's the reason
why you and Mama are fighting.

104
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,753
That's why I can't accept her
as my sister.

105
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,264
Don't blame Adelina

106
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,433
for the wrongs I have done.

107
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,270
Think about it.

108
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,314
If you were in her shoes,

109
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,110
would you want people to hate you?

110
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,988
Do you want to be rejected…

111
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,866
especially by your own family?

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,955
Even if everything that happened
was not your fault?

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,293
My dear.

114
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:54,260
Please, try to learn
to accept your sister.

115
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,305
You share the same blood.

116
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,894
No one else will accept or love her
except the two of us.

117
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,897
Do you understand?

118
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,866
I'm not forcing you.

119
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,994
But, please…

120
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,456
think about it.

121
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,753
Think carefully
about what I have just asked of you.

122
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,513
You share the same blood.

123
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
Dad's unusual shoes!

124
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,500
Through my father, I discovered the beauty
of the world of dancing and performing.

125
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,130
A world I wanted to get into right away,

126
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,550
to escape the trials in my life.

127
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,882
Juanito.

128
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,052
Come here, I need you to do something.

129
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,585
Well, well.

130
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,088
What brings you here, Eduardo?

131
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,173
How did you find my house?

132
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,802
I asked around at the theater, Uncle.

133
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,930
And I came here to warn you.

134
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,975
-Warn me?
-Yes, sir.

135
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,726
I am warning you.

136
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,355
Love and take good care of my sister.

137
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:22,778
Don't you ever hurt her,
and don't let your family abuse her.

138
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,156
Otherwise, you will have to deal with me.

139
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,039
Please, don't laugh.

140
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,419
I will stand by every word I said, Uncle.

141
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,423
And the moment you hurt Adelina,

142
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:46,468
I will not hesitate
to hold all of you accountable.

143
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,520
You think you're tough?

144
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,814
I think…

145
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,153
you better go home before I smack you.

146
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,195
Go!

147
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,906
Go home!

148
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,245
What are you doing here?

149
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,789
Those shoes aren't yours. Take them off!

150
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,793
I'm sorry, Señorita.

151
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,928
I just wanted to see
if I can dance like my father.

152
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,016
You are just like your mother.

153
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:39,688
You take and steal things
that are not yours.

154
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,066
Your mother is better off dead!

155
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,362
Don't speak ill of my mother.

156
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,948
You can insult me all you want.

157
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,076
But, please, spare my mother.

158
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,830
I have the right to say whatever I want
because she ruined my family!

159
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,419
I am most certain
that her soul is burning in hell!

160
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,589
You are so evil!

161
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,217
I'm sure you'll go to hell!

162
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,761
What did you say?

163
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,513
You little brat.

164
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,556
-You have such a foul mouth!
-I'm sorry…

165
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,058
You're just like your mother!

166
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,643
Your whore mother!

167
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,562
-I'm sorry, Señorita…
-Adelina.

168
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,282
Hey! Who are you?

169
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,346
-Please stop, Señorita…
-Now you want me to stop?

170
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,849
Stop crying!

171
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,309
-I said, stop crying!
-Please, stop.

172
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,395
-Can't you shut up?
-Please, stop.

173
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,689
-Can't you shut up…
-Adelina!

174
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,946
Eduardo, don't!

175
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,123
Eduardo, calm down.

176
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,458
Don't hurt her.

177
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,461
Is that rude boy your brother?

178
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,755
Is he my father's son?

179
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,301
No, ma'am. He's my brother from my mother.

180
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,927
Well, look at that.

181
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,638
She even has a child with another man.

182
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,850
Your mother is really a lowlife.

183
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,562
You're the one who's a lowlife
because you would hurt a child

184
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,856
and judge others!

185
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,068
Let's go, Adelina.

186
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,487
You bastard!

187
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,030
Get out of my house!

188
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,077
Señorita?

189
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,829
Hurry!

190
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,291
What?

191
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,216
Adelina!

192
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,346
-Adelina, hop on. Hurry.
-Adelina.

193
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,681
-Where are we going?
-We'll figure that out later.

194
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,935
Adelina. You can't leave.

195
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,604
Why? They're hurting her here.

196
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,481
Your father will look for you.

197
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,359
Adelina, let's go.

198
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,576
Mr. Juanito, let Adelina go.

199
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,622
I can't do that, Teresita.

200
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,961
The señor entrusted your sister to me.

201
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,420
She's my responsibility.

202
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,258
Wait, Mr. Juanito. I'll go with you.

203
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,384
Let's go.

204
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,961
We have no one else to turn to.

205
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,131
My sister and I no longer have a home.

206
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,260
Especially now that Mom is dead.

207
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:18,133
I'm willing to serve you,
just take me and my sister in.

208
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,469
Even for a little while.

209
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,561
In that case,
just give me enough money, sir.

210
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,440
I will look for a place we can rent.

211
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,450
You're such a bad father.

212
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,703
You got my mother pregnant
and abandoned us.

213
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,330
And now,

214
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,707
you're laughing at your own son?

215
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,001
Come to think of it,

216
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
when did you ever become a father to me?

217
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,554
I only told the truth, sir.

218
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,558
You were never a father to me.

219
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,480
Instead of calling you "Dad",

220
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,357
you insisted on "Sir".

221
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,403
I wish the Japanese
would arrive soon and kill you

222
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,489
because you're such a bad father!

223
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
Eduardo!

224
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,239
Eduardo!

225
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,854
I thought I was the only one

226
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,484
who had a pitiful
and heart-wrenching life.

227
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:46,073
I never imagined you would copy me.

228
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,331
Forget about your father, Eduardo.

229
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,751
We don't need him.

230
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:04,466
Besides, Mom doesn't like seeing us cry.

231
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,886
So stop crying now.

232
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,559
Adelina, forgive me.

233
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,146
I couldn't do anything to help you.

234
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,690
Don't worry.

235
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,695
Once I get a good job,
I will buy a very big house

236
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,198
we can call our own.

237
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,660
I hope that comes true, Eduardo.

238
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,871
I will definitely wait for the day

239
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,793
we have our own home,
where we can live together.

240
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,419
So don't cry anymore.

241
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,386
Adelina.

242
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,932
While you and your brother's wish
hasn't come true yet,

243
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,309
come back home.

244
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,981
That's just how the señorita is.

245
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,858
She's hurting too.

246
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,401
Let's try to understand her.

247
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,238
Besides, your father
will be looking for you.

248
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,826
Do you want to make him worry?

249
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,830
Let's go.

250
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,791
Come on.

251
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,469
Get in.

252
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,979
Don't worry.

253
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,148
I'll come and visit you.

254
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,570
In case you need me,
you know where to find me, okay?

255
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,405
Okay, Eduardo.

256
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,742
Miss, your brother's home
is quite far from here.

257
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,413
Always remember Mom's words, okay?

258
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,750
Don't let anyone walk over you, Adelina.

259
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,792
Ever.

260
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,213
Okay, Eduardo.

261
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,594
Here you go, son.

262
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,762
Go home.

263
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,516
Take care of yourself, Adelina, okay?

264
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,687
-Eduardo…
-Don't let anyone trample on you.

265
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,273
Always remember what Mom said.

266
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,610
Adelina, remember what Mom said.

267
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
Adelina!

268
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,572
Adelina!

269
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,867
Adelina!

270
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,274
Why are they at your house?

271
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,776
They want to arrest my father.

272
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,571
They said my father was an insurgent
against the Americans.

273
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,366
When I grow up,
I want to become an insurgent too.

274
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:20,245
-I will punish all our oppressors.
-I'm sure the Japanese killed them.

275
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:24,916
-What's their motive?
-They don't need a reason to scare us.

276
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,212
COMING UP

277
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,339
You won't hear anything from me.

278
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,050
But I swear, until the day I die,

279
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,720
I will never speak to you
and your bastard child again.

280
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,555
I am sorry to inform you,

281
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,724
but your theater burned down last night.

282
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,941
