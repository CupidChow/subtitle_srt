1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,753
My God! It's the devil!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,089
I finally found my wife.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,925
My country loathes you so!

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,427
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>There is a limit to my patience.</i>

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,268
<i>You're all traitors!</i>

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,853
Die!

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,897
<i>- That's enough!
- Stay with me, Sister.</i>

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>We still need to live.</i>

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,742
Forgive me, Adelina.

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,618
I don't think
we will see each other anymore.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,038
- Teresita, get away from him!
- Eduardo!

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,001
I won't let you live this time!

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>The world looked like a stage for death,</i>

15
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>and everyone is a lead actor
in their last scene.</i>

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>In war, where there is endless sadness,</i>

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,183
<i>even tomorrow has no certainty.</i>

18
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,772
You must pay
for all the vile acts you committed

19
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,940
against our women!

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,612
Especially for the lives you stole

21
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,489
from the Filipinos you slaughtered!

22
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,290
<i>Kill this baby!</i>

23
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>For the sake of Adelina.
We need to protect her.</i>

24
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,673
<i>I'll handle Saitoh.</i>

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>I have a far greater punishment
of death for him.</i>

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,263
<i>Our suffering has been put to an end.</i>

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,099
<i>We can finally start again.</i>

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,228
<i>You deserve a punishment
far worse than death.</i>

29
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,355
My people, look!

30
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,984
This is the face of the enemy
who made us all suffer!

31
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,415
Does it hurt?

32
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm so sorry,
but you have to bear with me.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,921
The bleeding needs to stop.

34
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,223
Adelina?

35
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,743
Ta…

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,244
Tasyo.

37
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,259
You were right.

38
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,139
You said we'd meet again one day,
and here we are.

39
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,604
I'm so glad to see you again, Tasyo.

40
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,814
Thank God you're alive.

41
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,110
Don't you think this is a sign?

42
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,698
That we're meant for each other?

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,164
Unbelievable, you're such a jokester.

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,838
But you're not the only

45
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,884
beautiful lady here.

46
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,179
I'm Tasyo.

47
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,058
She's a nun. What's wrong with you?

48
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,476
Have some shame.

49
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,770
My God. I'm so sorry.

50
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,647
Just help me out of here.

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,315
Let's take her to the hospital.

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,650
Sure. Let's go.

53
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,859
Be careful.

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,571
Can you manage?

55
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,991
Ready? One, two, three.

56
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,706
We should also blame ourselves.

57
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,169
We accepted these foreigners in our land,

58
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,879
and we allowed them to take over!

59
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,135
We believed in their promises
of prosperity,

60
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,014
but they only turned our lands
into battlefields

61
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,016
so they can flaunt their power!

62
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,191
No foreigner can genuinely care
for our country,

63
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,901
no one but us Filipinos!

64
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,822
We're the only ones
who can love and foster this land

65
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,615
that they've been fighting over!

66
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,537
Let us not allow this to happen again.

67
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,498
Hey.

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,250
Come here!

69
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,379
She's Japanese!

70
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,339
- Shame on you!
- I'm not bad!

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,426
- Shame on you!
- Ouch! Let me go!

72
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,470
That's enough. Let her go.

73
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,306
Her people killed my husband.

74
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,850
They beheaded him!

75
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,936
Let her go, I know her.

76
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,271
Trust me.

77
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,733
She's not an enemy,
she's not a bad person.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,487
Who are you?

79
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,947
Where am I?

80
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,658
You're in our house.

81
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,494
My brother and I helped you.

82
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,120
Don't get up yet, sir.

83
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,456
You don't understand.

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,208
I just want to go home.

85
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,376
I'll find a carriage for you.

86
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,217
Thank you, Eduardo.

87
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,512
Thank you for remembering me.

88
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,223
I will never forget

89
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,935
the kindness you and Ryo showed me.

90
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,189
I'll always be indebted to you.

91
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,276
So let me return the favor.

92
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,076
This man's the real devil!

93
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,997
He's the one you should despise and hate!

94
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,876
I'll leave him to you.

95
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,256
You bastard!

96
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,676
You can't kill me like this!

97
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,969
Untie me this instant!

98
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:16,018
A shameful death is your punishment,
Colonel Saitoh Yuta.

99
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,647
Hell is what you deserve.

100
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,612
No!

101
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,448
Mother!

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,162
Let him feel your wrath and resentment!

103
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,500
So that it may lessen all the suffering

104
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,295
you've endured at their hands!

105
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,089
This is for my son, Mario!

106
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,509
This is for taking away my dignity,
you monster!

107
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,261
You monster!

108
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,949
<i>On that day,
the devil's life came to an end.</i>

109
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>The full moon appeared once again,</i>

110
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>making its first appearance after the war.</i>

111
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,273
<i>But there's still no news of Hiroshi
ever since he left.</i>

112
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,325
<i>What happened to the promise he made?</i>

113
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,141
May the souls of the departed

114
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,645
finally find peace.

115
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,494
Uncle, Auntie Adelina is here.

116
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,538
Eduardo! Teresita!

117
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:41,956
Adelina…

118
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,125
Adelina!

119
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,797
Auntie, you're alive.

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,098
Adelina.

121
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,769
We're truly the children of Filipina
because we both survived.

122
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,941
What took you so long?

123
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,236
Please forgive me, Teresita.

124
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,280
I just had so many things to take care of.

125
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,329
How about Manuela? How is she?

126
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,373
She's safe, Teresita.

127
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,752
As well as Tasyo and Auntie Yolanda.

128
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,878
They're all safe!

129
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,800
What about Hiroshi?

130
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,302
Did you see him?

131
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,179
Is there any news about him?

132
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,278
What's with the long faces?

133
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,155
Have you heard anything?

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,369
What is it, Eduardo?

135
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,747
Adelina.

136
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,541
Let's talk at your house instead.

137
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,255
- Wait, tell me what happened.
- Adelina…

138
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,634
It's a miracle our home wasn't destroyed.

139
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
Let's go home first.

140
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,015
I don't understand.

141
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,976
I waited at our meeting place last night,
but he didn't come.

142
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,520
None of you did.

143
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,939
Why? What happened to him?

144
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,652
Uncle, let's just tell her.

145
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,411
Is he gone?

146
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,248
Is Hiroshi dead?

147
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,918
Adelina.

148
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,464
Juan said…

149
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,220
Eduardo, maybe you should tell her.

150
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,556
What happened?

151
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,641
Eduardo, tell me.

152
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,854
Juan witnessed what happened to Hiroshi.

153
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:19,071
<i>He was stabbed repeatedly
by Japanese soldiers until he fell.</i>

154
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,120
The Americans couldn't save him,

155
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,081
so it's possible that he's gone.

156
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,459
I think Hiroshi is dead.

157
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,483
My condolences.

158
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:15,002
Adelina, our safety is not guaranteed
in times of war.

159
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,590
But we can't let this stop us.

160
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,344
We must continue to live.

161
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,889
Your sister and I will help you.

162
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,560
We'll start over. We can get through this.

163
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,488
I told him not to leave.

164
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,910
I told him not to go!

165
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,080
I shouldn't have let him leave.

166
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,085
He shouldn't have left.

167
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,463
- Adelina, it's not your fault.
- Your brother's here.

168
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,048
It's not your fault.

169
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,467
Adelina.

170
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,096
Adelina, you're a brave woman.

171
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,265
We can get through this together.

172
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,933
We're here for you.

173
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,309
We're here.

174
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,812
We won't leave you, Adelina.

175
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,897
We won't leave you.

176
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,357
Hush now, Adelina.

177
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,194
Hush now.

178
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,200
Dry your tears.

179
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,337
I'm fine.

180
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,758
I'm fine.

181
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,552
Should we take you home?

182
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,097
Let's go.

183
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,227
Let's go, Adelina.

184
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,387
Adelina.

<i>The war has come and gone,</i>

202

<i>but we continued to survive.</i>

203
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,105
<i>Despite our wounds
and painful experiences,</i>

204
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,942
<i>we have now come together
to rebuild our dreams.</i>

205
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,488
<i>To dream of a free country.</i>

206
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,550
<i>- To dream for ourselves and for others.
- To dream for ourselves and for others.</i>
