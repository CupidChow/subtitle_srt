1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,213
I want her arrested immediately!

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,134
It's right that you go back, so you can
report everything the Colonel has done

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,386
to the Prime Minister.

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,930
We can't smuggle
these weapons out of Manila.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,933
That's why you'll have to deliver
and transport these weapons

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,852
to our guerrillas.

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,021
But they will still inspect
our goods, won't they?

8
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,276
Damn!

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,570
Don't you dare hurt my family.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,363
Especially Adelina.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,865
Can I trust you'll be true to your word?

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,201
Does that mean Adelina is in danger?

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,871
We need to escape again for my sister.

14
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,166
Where's Adelina? Bring her out!

15
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,917
Adelina ran away.

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,546
-Whose body is this?
-Eduardo Dela Cruz.

17
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,631
I killed him myself.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,467
I shot him, Colonel.

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,511
I found his cedula in his pocket.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,556
I can finally be at peace.

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:01,144
Farewell, Eduardo Dela Cruz.

22
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,521
I have thought of a way for us to escape.

23
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,484
Please be honest with me.
Where's Teresita?

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,361
-I don't--
-I don't believe you anymore.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,744
If you're going to keep accusing me,

26
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,792
I won't hesitate
to have you arrested and imprisoned

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,586
just like your traitorous husband.

28
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,755
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,764
Sir Julio?

30
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,725
Sir Julio.

31
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,687
It's me, Tasyo.

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,355
I'm a friend of Eduardo.

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,362
Tasyo?

34
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,033
Yes, sir. How are you holding up?

35
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,496
Right now, my whole body hurts.

36
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,750
But by God's grace, I'm still alive.

37
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,503
That's good to hear.

38
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,172
I was just wondering if…

39
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,885
you have any news from outside?

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,972
Do you know what's going on out there?

41
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,894
Do you know if we can still
get out of here alive?

42
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,155
-Did he fall for it?
-Yeah.

43
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,826
We made the enemies believe
it was your corpse.

44
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,623
I knew we could outsmart them.

45
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,586
Who among the soldiers did you speak with?

46
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,713
Their one and only leader.

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,550
The one they call Saitoh-taisa.

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,806
That's Colonel Saitoh.

49
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,101
He was there.

50
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,496
You know very well

51
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,917
you're the one
I want my daughter to marry.

52
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,505
If my daughter is with you,

53
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,174
then that would ease my worries.

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,306
I trust you.

55
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,520
So please just tell me.

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,234
Is my daughter with you?

57
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,911
Don't worry.

58
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,332
She's safe and in good hands.

59
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,046
Teresita, what about the others?

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,215
Are we just going to leave them behind?

61
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,763
Escaping won't be as easy as before.

62
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,684
We need to put ourselves first.

63
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,856
We can think of a way to save
those we'll leave behind later on.

64
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,996
We need to leave now
while there are fewer guards outside.

65
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,998
Let's go.

66
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,625
Where…

67
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,211
Where is she?

68
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,299
Can I see her?

69
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,428
You can't.

70
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Why not?

71
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,435
If she's safe like you said,
then why can't I see her?

72
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,605
Just don't look for her anymore.

73
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,942
Trust me.

74
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,531
Your daughter is safe,
and she won't be harmed.

75
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,700
The Colonel is a very intimidating man.

76
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,537
His presence alone terrifies me.

77
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,040
Like he's always up to no good.

78
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,587
Listen, Pablo.
Escort your dad out of here now.

79
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,589
After that, I want you back at camp.

80
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,801
-I'll take it from here.
-Why?

81
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,636
It's too dangerous here.

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,972
Someone might recognize you.

83
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,600
I need to keep tailing Saitoh.

84
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,439
He's the only one
who can lead me to Teresita.

85
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,903
Don't worry. Be on your way.

86
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,738
Just stay safe.

87
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,867
I'll do the same.

88
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,358
Please let go!

89
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,369
You may take your leave.

90
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,748
I'm a very busy man.

91
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,835
I have one last favor, Colonel.

92
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,425
I hope you won't deny me this time.

93
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,513
What is it?

94
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,526
-Open the door.
-Yes, sir!

95
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,988
Why, sir? What are you going to do to me?

96
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,615
Why…

97
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,741
What…

98
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,827
Wait, I haven't done anything wrong!

99
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,621
Wait, please! Wait!

100
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,706
What are you going to do, sir?

101
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,874
-Wait!
-Tasyo?

102
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,792
Sir Julio?

103
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,294
Tasyo?

104
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,471
Please pray for me, Sir Julio.

105
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,450
Everyone, out!

106
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,206
God, help me!

107
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,177
Hey! Where are you going?

108
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,723
Close the gate now!

109
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,770
Close the gate!

110
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,648
Close the gate!

111
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,141
He's here.

112
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
Hey.

113
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,994
What happened?

114
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,039
Were you captured?

115
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,250
Or are you here to visit?

116
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,920
I found a way to get you out.

117
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,258
We're going home. Get ready.

118
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,488
I will.

119
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,697
You may leave.

120
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,051
Sir, we both live in this country.

121
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,138
You don't need to point a gun at me.

122
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,973
Don't worry.

123
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,935
I won't hurt you if you cooperate.

124
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,189
Sir, what are you going to do to me?

125
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,507
Tasyo!

126
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,346
Why didn't you ask them
how they found out Eduardo is dead?

127
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
Tasyo.

128
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,274
He's dead! Why the hell would I ask?

129
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,052
Listen to me.

130
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,554
Follow that car closely.

131
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,608
Let go of me!

132
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,950
Let go! Stop, please!

133
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,370
Wait!

134
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,593
Very pretty.

135
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,804
You…

136
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,016
You're very pretty.

137
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,440
Lock them up in their rooms.

138
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
-Go.
-Yes, sir!

139
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,529
Come on, let's go.

140
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,448
Let me go.

141
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,163
Where is Teresita?

142
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,262
You wench!

143
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,392
Why are you looking for me?

144
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,709
Thank you, Adelina.

145
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,212
-This will help us a lot.
-So the rumors are true.

146
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,674
Like my brother, you're a guerilla too.

147
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,509
Eduardo is one of us?

148
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,264
Good. Where is his group right now?

149
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,141
In Rizal.

150
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,770
Along with your fellow comrades.

151
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,107
But I don't know where they are now.

152
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,737
I'm sorry to interrupt, Adelina.
But we need to leave now.

153
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,863
Okay.

154
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,991
-We're off. Goodbye, Dado.
-Wait.

155
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,828
We saw your Japanese friend.

156
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,081
We fought them last night.

157
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,999
You mean Hiroshi?

158
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,877
Did you hurt him?

159
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,421
Why do you seem worried?

160
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,467
Don't tell me you feel for the enemy.

161
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,904
Father.

162
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,825
They said your ship hasn't arrived yet.

163
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,327
I can wait for it by myself.

164
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,915
I hope you won't forget
what we talked about, Father.

165
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,670
Please find a way to talk
to our Prime Minister.

166
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,967
He needs to know the barbarity
of his soldiers in this country.

167
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,058
Are you really not going
to change your mind?

168
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,020
Just come with me.

169
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,608
This country is too dangerous for you.

170
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,071
Father, don't worry about me.

171
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,366
I can take care of myself.

172
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,870
We'll see each other again, Father.

173
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,205
I promise.

174
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,106
Why are you crying?

175
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,746
I failed to see just how horrible
the Japanese were.

176
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,375
I didn't listen.

177
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,043
I thought

178
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,632
if I allied with them,
we could protect our family.

179
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,468
But I was wrong.

180
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,097
I was wrong, Julio.

181
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,477
I'm so ashamed of my stupidity.

182
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,903
I hope you and Teresita can forgive me.

183
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,990
If there's anyone who should be ashamed,

184
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,327
it's me.

185
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,126
I should be the one asking
for your forgiveness.

186
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,464
It's my fault you were filled with hate.

187
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,804
I hurt you.

188
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,641
I owe you so much

189
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,437
for all my mistakes and shortcomings.

190
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,777
Forgive me, Carmela.

191
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,751
I hope you can forgive me

192
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,838
for being selfish

193
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,968
and putting myself and us in danger.

194
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,055
In these times,
you should be relying on me,

195
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,807
depending on me.

196
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,853
I should be helping you look for Teresita.

197
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,150
I know where our daughter is.

198
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,238
And I know what happened to her.

199
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,492
What happened to her?
Where is she? Is she safe?

200
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
Let's not talk about it here, Julio.

201
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,957
Let's go to Johnny's.

202
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,751
I think Adelina is there too.

203
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,836
So let's go.

204
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,088
Come on.

205
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,350
Are you girls hungry? I'll prepare supper.

206
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,520
Yolanda?

207
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,064
What are you doing here?

208
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,567
They've been waiting for you, my dear.

209
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,404
I'll let you girls talk.

210
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,282
I'm going to check on Luisa.

211
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,700
Thank you.

212
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,288
Adelina.

213
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:36,545
I want you to meet
Sister Manuela and Lorena.

214
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,925
They know your sister.

215
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,806
And they know what happened to her.

216
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,684
Nice to meet you, Adelina.

217
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,770
Teresita has told us about you.

218
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,189
What happened to my sister?

219
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,484
How do you know her? Where is she?

220
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,130
Colonel.

221
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,966
Good evening, sir.

222
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,972
I hope your day was productive.

223
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,224
Today was a good day.

224
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,060
Many good things happened.

225
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,856
Now, tell me. How is she?

226
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:42,944
Teresita's in her room
and she's doing well, Colonel.

227
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,491
Also, our soldiers have brought

228
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,577
new women here as well.

229
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,079
That's all you think of.

230
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,998
Idiot.

231
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,012
There's no more reason for you to resist.

232
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,182
Especially now that Eduardo is gone.

233
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,769
He was killed by your fellow Filipinos.

234
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,940
I hope you and Eduardo can forgive me
for everything I've done.

235
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,236
Colonel, Amalia is nowhere to be found.
I think she has escaped.

236
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,655
Let all our soldiers know

237
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,033
they can take any of the women here.

238
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,452
Except for Teresita.

239
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,162
I thought I'd lost you.

240
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,999
I heard you fought
Dado's group last night.

241
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,294
It was thanks to my father.
He saved us, Adelina.

242
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,588
Where's Eduardo, Adelina?
Take me to his camp.

243
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,174
I'm not going as his enemy,
but as his ally.

244
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,300
COMING UP

245
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,224
