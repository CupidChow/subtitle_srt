1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,045
One of my employees, Eduardo.

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,631
He's the son of an American officer
in the US Army.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,343
You hire people
without investigating their background?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,513
Kill him if you have to!

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,724
Someone's out to kill you.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,268
-Who? Why?
-It's difficult to explain.

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,769
You must leave.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,647
Take Adelina with you
and Teresita as well.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,399
Maybe you're here in the Philippines

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,776
because you want to bomb
and invade our country?

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,571
The Filipinos may be angry
with us right now.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:34,784
Especially now that news has spread
about our country's attack in Hawaii.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,828
Hawaii is very far from our country!

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,999
Why do you have to involve the innocent
and peaceful Japanese people living here?

15
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,209
Take care of my parents.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,335
Don't abandon them.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,046
PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,552
How can we perform
if there's no one in the audience?

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,305
Please take care of Hiroshi,
wherever he is.

20
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,901
I said, take him there! Hurry!

21
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,904
Where are the rest of them?

22
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,536
Father, why are they angry at us?

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,996
Stop complaining.

24
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,082
Everything will be fine.

25
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,804
Let's go. It's okay.

26
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,515
I got this. Don't worry.

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:32,777
My sister and I didn't do anything wrong!

28
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,779
I beg you!

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,116
We grew up here in the Philippines.

30
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,662
-We are like Filipinos now.
-I was not born yesterday.

31
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,664
Back to your place!

32
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,000
-Please!
-Get back!

33
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,586
-Move!
-It's okay.

34
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,629
It's okay. It's all right.

35
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,063
I hope so, Eduardo.

36
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,233
I really hope so.

37
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,874
You didn't tell us your boss was rich.

38
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,795
You could've asked him for a loan
for your auntie and me.

39
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,004
Uncle, please.

40
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,215
That would be embarrassing.

41
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,801
What is there to be embarrassed about?

42
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,888
It's a loan. We will pay for it, anyway.

43
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,391
It's a small favor

44
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,604
in exchange for what we spent
raising and feeding you.

45
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,788
No, we're not.

46
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,088
Please, leave.

47
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,842
Once Hiroshi returns
and this commotion is over,

48
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,012
I will personally visit you
and give you some money.

49
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,139
You better keep your word.

50
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,854
All right, I'll see them out.

51
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,564
Let's go.

52
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,022
-Please, no!
-Adelina!

53
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,316
-Adelina, don't!
-Wait, no!

54
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,818
-Adelina, no!
-You cannot interfere!

55
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,571
-Don't hurt us!
-Have mercy on them!

56
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,032
-What are you doing?
-She's too old!

57
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,326
Do you have to arrest them all, sir?

58
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,828
We have no choice. These are our orders.

59
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,926
Hurry!

60
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,844
Hurry up!

61
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,027
-Adelina!
-Hurry up, take them away!

62
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,862
Go, take them away!

63
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,782
-Go!
-Wait! Don't hurt them!

64
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,121
Sir, please.

65
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,998
-Please don't hurt them.
-Adelina, let them be.

66
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,544
When people are angry,
they lose sight of right and wrong.

67
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,254
You cannot stop them.

68
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,880
Come out, hurry!

69
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,757
Take them away!

70
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,679
My dear Hiroshi.

71
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,850
I cannot believe
what I'm witnessing right now.

72
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,103
What is happening to the world?

73
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,606
Especially to my fellow Filipinos.

74
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:26,028
If they felt fear earlier
because of the attack on Pearl Harbor,

75
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,159
now their hearts have quickly turned
to anger and revenge.

76
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,538
Where is the spirit of humanity?

77
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:41,002
Have we truly lost the importance
of humanity in this country?

78
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,552
How will I face the people
we owe money to, Lauro?

79
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,263
Mrs. Lopez will surely
be waiting for us when we get home.

80
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,476
Just think of an excuse.
You can head back home.

81
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,645
-I need to go somewhere.
-You're leaving me?

82
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,397
Where are you going?

83
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,941
I'm going to scrape together some money!

84
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,944
-Go home!
-Don't come home empty-handed!

85
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm telling you, Lauro!

86
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,448
Or else we'll have another fight.

87
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,079
Hey! Stay right there!

88
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,790
Where are you going?

89
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,710
I want to know where they're taking them.

90
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,673
I want to make sure they're safe
and they'll be treated like humans.

91
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,510
Adelina, forget it.
We'll only get in trouble.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,846
Marcel, if we just watch them
take the Japanese away,

93
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,974
if we allow their wrongdoings,

94
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,685
how are we different
from the merciless Japanese

95
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,146
who are attacking Pearl Harbor right now?

96
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:48,194
Then we're just as cruel
and exploitative as they are!

97
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,910
We cannot remain silent
and let all this happen.

98
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,995
What if the situation is reversed?

99
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,999
And these atrocities
are repeated against us!

100
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,876
-What will we do?
-Adelina.

101
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,379
I understand where you're coming from.

102
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,383
But it's not right
to put ourselves in danger either.

103
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,934
I understand.

104
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,275
I want to go with you.

105
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,280
I want to make sure these people are safe.

106
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,699
We cannot do that!

107
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,120
Sir, my father is also a constabulary.

108
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,331
Captain Marcelo Diomedes Senior.

109
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,376
-Do you know him?
-Your father?

110
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,547
Your father is an admirable man,
respected by all.

111
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,674
Thank you, sir.

112
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,726
Sir, please grant my companion's wish.

113
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,020
Let her go with you.

114
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,650
Please. I won't cause trouble, I promise.

115
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,861
All right, get in.
While the Americans aren't here.

116
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,197
Thank you.

117
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,700
Adelina, be careful. Take care, okay?

118
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,869
-Thank you, Marcel.
-Go on.

119
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,094
Captain, why are you watching him?

120
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,846
I find him mysterious.

121
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,268
What do you know about him, Lieutenant?

122
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,020
I don't know much

123
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,315
despite having known him for a long time.

124
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,362
He never told me anything
about his family or his life.

125
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,532
But he has no fear.

126
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,952
He's also merciless to our enemies.

127
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,703
How do you know that?

128
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,623
I was with him in Nanjing.

129
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,169
I witnessed what he did
to the Chinese captives.

130
00:11:55,923 --> 00:12:00,052
Sir Saitoh,
do we really need to kill them?

131
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,264
Give that to me!

132
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,269
The fewer enemies, the safer we are.

133
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,121
He killed them like animals.

134
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,918
That's how ruthless
our lieutenant colonel is.

135
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,554
Sir.

136
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,976
May I know where you took
the Japanese you've captured?

137
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,978
Why are you asking?

138
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:56,233
You see, one of them
is my daughter's fiancé.

139
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,987
His name is Hiroshi Tanaka.

140
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,365
I don't know where this Hiroshi
you're talking about is.

141
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,085
Dado!

142
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,172
Where is Hiroshi?

143
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,549
Where did you take him?

144
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm begging you.

145
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,848
Please tell me.

146
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,256
I feel sorry for them.

147
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,760
My Lord, please help them.

148
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,832
Adelina.

149
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,989
Colonel.

150
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,329
Get ready.

151
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,668
We're going out
with Lieutenant Nakamura to observe.

152
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,797
Why don't we wait for our army to attack?

153
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,258
They are coming soon.

154
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,803
Let me remind you, Lieutenant Colonel.

155
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,098
You are under my command.

156
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:18,102
You will obey my orders.

157
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,312
Apologies, Colonel.

158
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:25,442
But what you want to happen is suicide.

159
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,613
Are you willing to risk our lives outside?

160
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,200
As of this moment,

161
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:40,457
we are not sure
what the Filipinos feel against us.

162
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,377
-Leave us.
-Yes, sir!

163
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,935
Stay where you are.

164
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,775
Sir, don't be so cruel to him.
I just want to talk.

165
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,155
My God.

166
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,032
You look awful.

167
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,286
Why didn't they treat your wounds?

168
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,372
He's a human being too. He needs help.

169
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,875
What are you angry about?

170
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,502
He's alive.

171
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:08,962
What?

172
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925
Is that how we should treat
our fellow human beings?

173
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,512
Are we going to abandon them
because we think they're all our enemies?

174
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,680
What if their wounds become infected?

175
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,932
Adelina.

176
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,351
Adelina, that's enough.

177
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,063
Don't worry about me anymore.

178
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,862
Seeing you again is enough for me.

179
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,509
Adelina?

180
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,096
What are you doing here?

181
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,940
I didn't know I'd get here.

182
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,776
I didn't expect that…

183
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,279
I only followed the Japanese
who were arrested earlier.

184
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,990
I didn't know
they also brought Hiroshi here.

185
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,075
You don't need to explain, my dear.

186
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,746
What's important is we found him.

187
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,925
How are you?

188
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,139
You have nothing to worry about.

189
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,766
You don't need to concern yourselves.

190
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,727
Mr. Borromeo.

191
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,439
I am all right.

192
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,774
Please go home.

193
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,279
We will not leave you here.

194
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,459
I'll do everything to get you out of here.

195
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,130
Thank you very much.

196
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,177
We will be back.

197
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,515
Let's go, my dears.
We have to go somewhere.

198
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,486
Teresita.

199
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,158
Can we talk for a moment?

200
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,955
I have something important to confess.

201
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:58,548
You have no respect for your superior.

202
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,302
You are disregarding my authority

203
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,889
in front of our men!

204
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,642
My apologies, Colonel.

205
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,565
But I repeat.

206
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,487
It's dangerous for you
to go out of this building.

207
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,781
That's it!

208
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,076
I've had enough

209
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,831
of your insubordination.

210
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,669
You are relieved of your duties!

211
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,381
Effective immediately.

212
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,465
Can you please leave us for a moment?

213
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,841
No.

214
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,843
Go back to your place.

215
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,722
Hiroshi, whatever it is you want to say,

216
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,516
save it.

217
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,603
Just take care of yourself.

218
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,397
Teresita.

219
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,942
Please forgive me.

220
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,951
Even if I get out of here,

221
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,500
I can no longer marry you.

222
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,634
I can definitely feel
the tension between you two.

223
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,137
Is it Hiroshi? Is he the real reason?

224
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,598
Why are you still here?
Aren't you suspended?

225
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,935
I'd like to hand over
my resignation letter.

226
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,480
The constabulary ordered us to help them.

227
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,067
We need to arrest the Japanese
living in that house.

228
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,111
Boys, the Japanese are no longer here.

229
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,530
We kicked them out. Go, off with you.

230
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,323
Our apologies. We'll get going, then!

231
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,742
I can no longer guarantee

232
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,912
that I can drive away anyone
who comes here looking for you.

233
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,622
We need to protect you.

234
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,541
COMING UP

235
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,876
Chikara, let go of that.
Where did you get that?

236
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,052
