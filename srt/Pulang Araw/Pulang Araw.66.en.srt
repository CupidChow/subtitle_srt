1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,504
You shouldn't be doing this
just for a woman, Hiroshi.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,298
She's not worth
losing your comfortable life for.

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,092
Forgive me.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,094
I failed you.

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,971
Why are we doing this?

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,723
We'll need a ride,

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,559
so we can get to the Colonel
as soon as possible.

8
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,228
Women can still fight.

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,646
With what weapon?

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,482
If you use your head,

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,821
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

12
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,365
Can we ride with them?

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,868
They're too many, Juan.
It's hard to trust them.

14
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,288
Why did you allow Hiroshi to go
with Adelina to the prison cell?

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,248
He can't be stopped, Colonel.

16
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,835
He really wants to protect the lady.

17
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:49,841
Bring them here
and present both of them to me.

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,384
I know what they might do to you.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,261
-They are very brutal.
-Shut up!

20
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,847
PREVIOUSLY

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,724
Where are they?

22
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,727
I said I don't know.

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,814
Colonel, Adelina hasn't seen
her brother in a long time.

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,441
Hiroshi!

25
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:11,321
We even helped a Japanese,
so why wouldn't we help our countrymen?

26
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,614
Is he a soldier?

27
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,702
He made us follow a car
that had a young lady

28
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,121
who seemed to have been
arrested by Japanese soldiers.

29
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,624
You really don't want to confess, miss?

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,213
You think this is all just a game?

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,925
Fine.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,928
If that's what you want.

33
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,306
Let's play.

34
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,438
Colonel.

35
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,205
Shut up!

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,884
There's only one bullet left in my gun,

37
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:05,018
and I hope it sides with the truth.

38
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,772
I'll let you live
if you tell me the truth.

39
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,028
But if not…

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,922
Colonel!

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,257
Colonel!

42
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,853
If Adelina survives
and this bullet doesn't hit her,

43
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,315
I'll let you both go.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,862
So I'll ask you again.

45
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,118
Where's your brother?

46
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,705
Speak the truth,

47
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,460
so the bullet will take your side.

48
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,903
We must not let sadness and fear win.

49
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,074
We must strengthen our resolve
now more than ever,

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,868
and we must keep fighting.

51
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,538
Just like we promised, remember?

52
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,918
That we'll survive for our sake.

53
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,885
Women can still fight.

54
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,805
Yuta likes you, doesn't he?

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,266
He wants to possess you.

56
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,643
He's setting you aside for himself.

57
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,396
It seems the devil has fallen for you.

58
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
If you use your head,

59
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:20,570
you can easily make him do
whatever you want.

60
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,658
I won't give up, Adelina.

61
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,245
Auntie Amalia is right.

62
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,500
I can't let Yuta win.

63
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,628
Answer me!

64
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,012
I really don't know.

65
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,056
Colonel.

66
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,894
She's telling you the truth.

67
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,034
And even if I knew

68
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,703
where my brother was,

69
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,706
I would never tell you.

70
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,070
One shot down.

71
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,370
Perhaps the next one will be your last.

72
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,210
I'll give you two more chances to decide.

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,261
Where is Eduardo hiding now?

74
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,283
But is it worth your life?

75
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,913
Is your brother's life

76
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,711
more important than your own?

77
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,550
Tell him.

78
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,635
Tell him you don't know anything.

79
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,806
Shut up, you traitor!

80
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,316
Don't test my patience.

81
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:10,198
It might run out,
and you'll both end up dead.

82
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,917
I would rather die

83
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,171
a thousand times over

84
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,841
than betray my own brother.

85
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,636
Is that so?

86
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,388
Then you leave me no choice.

87
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,230
Colonel!

88
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,940
Please, Colonel.

89
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,734
Don't do this.

90
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,488
Drop the gun, Colonel!

91
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,532
Drop it!

92
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,178
Sir, are we going to enter their camp?

93
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,138
I'll go in alone.

94
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,267
Let's meet back where we got off earlier.

95
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,438
But for now, I need you to do something.

96
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,773
What is it?

97
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,491
Stupid woman!

98
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,622
Colonel.

99
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,083
Please put the gun down.

100
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,460
Adelina doesn't know anything.

101
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,596
I'm afraid, sir!

102
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,681
Please help me!

103
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,694
Don't shoot him, Colonel!

104
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,613
I'll tell you!

105
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,578
I'll tell you everything I know.

106
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,663
Just please don't shoot him.

107
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:34,712
I didn't know that my soldier
meant so much to you.

108
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,535
God, please watch over me.

109
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,868
Hey.

110
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,387
Yes.

111
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:56,729
It's true, I knew
where Eduardo was hiding before.

112
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,275
He had a companion, but I didn't know him.

113
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,863
He was the one who approached me
and told me where he was.

114
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,619
So, yes.

115
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,956
I immediately went to see him…

116
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,256
so I could finally break the news

117
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,968
about what happened to his fiancée.

118
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,891
My sister…

119
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,228
Teresita.

120
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:48,364
That she was abducted
by Japanese soldiers.

121
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,958
But I didn't know my brother
had left their hideout.

122
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,627
Believe me.

123
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,759
Even if you torture
and threaten me again and again,

124
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,515
I still wouldn't know where my brother is.

125
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:37,621
He's quite handsome, isn't he?

126
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,416
Stop that.

127
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,131
Get out of my sight
before I do something to you!

128
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,558
Teresita.

129
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,644
-Teresita.
-Don't pity me.

130
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,940
I've become one of you.

131
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,820
We're all forced to be sex slaves.

132
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,699
Don't try to run away again.

133
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,871
And don't do anything
that will anger the Colonel.

134
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,125
Should I just accept my fate, Sister?

135
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,130
What else can we do but weep and pray?

136
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,925
If there's one thing we have now,

137
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,179
it's our faith.

138
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,724
It's what keeps us sane in this hell.

139
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,310
There's still a way out of here.

140
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,105
I just know it, Sister Manuela.

141
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,318
What can you do, Teresita?

142
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,070
You already failed.

143
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
I'll follow Auntie Amalia's advice.

144
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,163
I don't have anything else
to lose, anyway.

145
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,208
What are you talking about?

146
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,210
What did she tell you?

147
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,463
We must put an end

148
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,884
to this endless torture for the sake
of our bodies and souls.

149
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,846
We must fight back.

150
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,226
I'll fight for you.

151
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,119
Hiroshi, shut your mouth!

152
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:48,752
I know many things about you now, Colonel.

153
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,263
And what could you possibly know

154
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,853
about me?

155
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,150
Teresita.

156
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,457
What about her?

157
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,048
You think no one knows, Colonel?

158
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,057
-Shut up, Hiroshi!
-Let him talk!

159
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,102
Go on.

160
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,316
I know your soldiers took her.

161
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,070
What did you do to her, Colonel?

162
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,410
Where is Teresita?

163
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,749
-You dare accuse me?
-Hiroshi!

164
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,505
I know it was you who took her away.

165
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,632
Am I wrong?

166
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,468
Don't be stupid, you fool!

167
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,596
Take back what you said to our colonel.

168
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,182
Save yourself!

169
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,726
Take it back!

170
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,603
Colonel.

171
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,107
Did you make her your personal slave?

172
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,945
How do you think Adelina would react

173
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,155
if she finds out about this?

174
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,007
-You bastard!
-No, don't shoot!

175
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,843
Please don't shoot! Please!

176
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,554
Please don't shoot! Please!

177
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,012
I wrote a letter.

178
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,932
I wrote down everything I knew.

179
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:55,230
I left it with a trusted friend.

180
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,608
The moment you kill

181
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,779
both me and Adelina,

182
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:08,160
that friend will make sure
my letter reaches General Homma

183
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,455
and our dear Emperor.

184
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,704
-Are you a Filipino?
-Yes, I am.

185
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,374
Are you new here?
I've never seen you before.

186
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,959
Yes.

187
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,505
A Japanese soldier gave me an order.

188
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,134
Where's the office of Colonel Yuta Saitoh?

189
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,678
It's in that building down there.

190
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,931
Thank you very much.

191
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,095
Colonel, I also wonder…

192
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,070
People are not useless and stupid.

193
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,156
That's why Colonel Saitoh

194
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,493
cannot hide his sins for long.

195
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,494
Where have you been?

196
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,121
Where did you get your clothes?

197
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,455
I was right.

198
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,791
It was the Colonel who abducted Teresita.

199
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,334
Forgive me, Eduardo.

200
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,920
But I am no longer worthy of you.

201
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,047
What I am about to do disgusts me.

202
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,300
But I'm left with no choice.

203
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,554
Teresita, you need to understand
that your charm is your weapon

204
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,348
against that damn colonel.

205
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,558
COMING UP

206
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,481
