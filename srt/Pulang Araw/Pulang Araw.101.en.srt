1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,712
<i>Hide here as long as you want.</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>No one will suspect you're here.</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,591
Are you the spy
they've been talking about?

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,595
Don't let the Colonel find you again.
I won't be there to save you.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,224
Run, Teresita. Get yourself out of here!

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,689
- Sir!
<i>- The Lord has not abandoned us.</i>

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,858
<i>But I still can't be happy, Sister.</i>

8
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>Not until I find out what happened
to Hiroshi and my siblings.</i>

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,659
<i>My reunion with Eduardo was very painful.</i>

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,163
Have mercy on me, Lord!

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,250
Adelina, someone broke in!

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,293
Hiroshi?

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,254
Am I dead?

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>Please help. I got away from the Japanese.</i>

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>Please don’t send me back to them.</i>

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,636
Please, Sister. Don’t send me back!

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,639
Don't worry, we'll help you.

18
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,224
<i>I had her, Tasyo.</i>

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,435
But fate separated us again.

20
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>What kind of torment is this?</i>

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>That's just how it is.</i>

22
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,524
<i>No Filipino is safe
as long as the war continues.</i>

23
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>Even love won't stand a chance.</i>

24
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>Let's just pray that they're safe,</i>

25
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,658
<i>so we can continue fighting.</i>

26
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,287
<i>We need to keep fighting
until we win back our freedom.</i>

27
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,333
Teresita.

28
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,711
Could it be that you're pregnant?

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,672
PREVIOUSLY

30
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,278
Mom.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
Adelina.

32
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,075
I don't want to die.

33
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,163
It's not my time yet.

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,832
Don't move!

35
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,314
You're fine.

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,274
Your wound is not that serious.

37
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,942
You'll live.

38
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,653
My comrades…

39
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,906
Did any of them survive?

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,043
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,838
You're the only one left.

42
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:40,970
Juan.

43
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,722
Where's Juan?

44
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,057
Juan!

45
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,016
Juan!

46
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,893
Juan?

47
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,497
Juan, wake up.

48
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,732
Forgive me.

49
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,788
Hey, hand me a cigarette.

50
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,633
The traitor is over here!

51
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,885
Catch him!

52
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,307
Hiroshi!

53
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,824
Juan?

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,909
You're alive?

55
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,161
Uncle?

56
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,039
I'm not dead yet, Uncle.

57
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,460
We still have many enemies to face, right?

58
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,545
Yes, Juan.

59
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,631
You can't die yet

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,677
because you're our country's hope.

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,015
Son, let's go.

62
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,642
The enemies might come back.

63
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,689
- Men!
- Let's go.

64
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,413
Is that all the food we have?

65
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,583
That's all we got from the mountains.

66
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,919
We couldn't take everything.

67
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,797
The family who planted these
needs to eat too.

68
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,801
- Tasyo!
- It's Miguel.

69
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,843
Tasyo!

70
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,013
They're here.

71
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,140
Our Commander is here.

72
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,405
Where…

73
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,368
What happened to you?

74
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,456
Eduardo, where's the rest?

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,210
Only Juan and I survived
after the enemies surrounded us.

76
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,632
Thankfully, another guerrilla unit
rescued us.

77
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,802
They're the reason we're still alive.

78
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,804
No wonder you took so long.

79
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,307
Comrades.

80
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,728
Let's offer a brief prayer
for our fallen brothers.

81
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,587
I hope the nun's hunch isn't true.

82
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,883
I can't be pregnant.

83
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,012
Don't talk for now, dear.

84
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,188
When was

85
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,026
the last time you had your period?

86
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,248
Is it true?

87
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,919
Am I really pregnant?

88
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,088
I couldn't be wrong.

89
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,175
You are going to be a mother.

90
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,992
What are those markings for?

91
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,455
They represent the number
of our fallen comrades

92
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,750
since I began fighting.

93
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,629
This is my way of remembering them.

94
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,798
What about you, Juan?

95
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,095
You could've been one of those markings
our Commander is drawing on that tree.

96
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,764
I can't die just yet!

97
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,853
If you only let me hold a gun,
I would've been a big help in that fight.

98
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,064
That's enough, boy.

99
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,109
I'm sure you're both hungry.

100
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,152
Come, let's eat.

101
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,706
<i>Adelina. Teresita.</i>

102
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>Wherever you are right now,</i>

103
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,545
<i>wait for me.</i>

104
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,089
<i>I have yet to keep my promise.</i>

105
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,674
<i>We will meet again.</i>

106
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,638
Thank you for coming here, Auntie.

107
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,057
Come, I will see you out.

108
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,476
Just a moment, please.

109
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,478
I never wanted this.

110
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,941
I don't want to bear and give birth
to the child of a devil.

111
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,318
My goodness.

112
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,236
Teresita, it's too late.

113
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,696
There's nothing we can do.

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,532
Just accept it, my dear.

115
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,200
This is God's will.

116
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,577
God's will?

117
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,248
No, you're wrong. This isn't God's will!

118
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,586
Why am I being punished
for something that wasn't my fault?

119
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,578
There's…

120
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,502
no one left to trust.

121
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,313
This war

122
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,691
has taken away all my friends.

123
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,500
Please help me get rid of this child.

124
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
Tell me what can I do to stop this?

125
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,714
- Please help me!
- Teresita.

126
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,175
Do you intend to abort your child?

127
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,718
You can't do that.

128
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,637
What you're thinking is a sin.

129
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,930
A sin?

130
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,893
Isn't it a greater sin…

131
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,483
that this child is the fruit
of the abuse I endured from the devil?

132
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,695
Isn't it more of a sin

133
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,739
to carry in my womb

134
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,534
the seed of the accursed enemy?

135
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,580
Teresita, please.
Don't hate your own child.

136
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,041
Please, miss. Help me.

137
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,421
I don't want to give birth
to Yuta's child!

138
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,799
Help me get rid of this baby!

139
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm begging you!

140
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,928
Don't say that, child.

141
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,221
Please.

142
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,432
Take pity on your child.

143
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,436
- That child is not to blame.
- And so am I!

144
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,109
All I want is to live with my family!

145
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,156
But what did Yuta do to me?

146
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,579
He had me kidnapped, he made me his wife!

147
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,419
- I never wanted this!
- Calm down, child.

148
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,671
- I don't want this child!
- Calm down.

149
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,590
- Please.
- I don't want this child!

150
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,426
Please, don't hate your own child.

151
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,178
I don't want this child!

152
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,225
Is Hiroshi not back yet?

153
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,269
Not yet.

154
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,772
I'm really starting to worry.

155
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,903
He told me he was just going out
to get us food and clothes,

156
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,155
but he still hasn't come back.

157
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,950
Could he be in trouble?

158
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,454
I know it's dangerous outside,

159
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,084
but God will not abandon him.

160
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,380
If Hiroshi is still not back
before the night ends,

161
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,632
I'll go look for him.

162
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,672
God of the Catholics.

163
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,259
Please don't abandon me.

164
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,763
I still want to see…

165
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,436
the woman I love.

166
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,783
This is the office of Colonel Yuta Saitoh.

167
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,534
Who is this?

168
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,871
I see.

169
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,332
This is bad news.

170
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,835
Got it. Thank you for the report.

171
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,277
Nakamura.

172
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,365
- What was that call about?
- Colonel.

173
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,451
They failed to capture Eduardo Dela Cruz.

174
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,286
And…

175
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,541
what about my wife?

176
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,751
My apologies, Colonel.

177
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,629
But she's still not found.

178
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,094
These Filipinos will pay

179
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,098
for what they did to me.

180
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,853
I will punish them all with death!

181
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,158
You will join our soldiers.

182
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,077
They will tell you your mission.

183
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,495
Forgive me, sir.

184
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:24,001
But when will you grant
the freedom you promised me?

185
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,173
What for? So you could fight us again?

186
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,550
Take him away!

187
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,385
Yes, sir! Let's go!

188
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,726
Where are you taking me?

189
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,603
Where are you taking me?

190
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,939
Let me go!

191
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,317
Let me go!

192
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,460
Where are they headed?

193
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,253
Where else?

194
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,799
They're looking for the Colonel's wife.

195
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>Wherever you are
Be it the city or the country</i>

196
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:43,288
<i>You will always bump into
The naughty clown</i>

197
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,582
<i>Here he comes, making noise</i>

198
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,460
<i>With his loose pants</i>

199
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,754
<i>And there like a fool</i>

200
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>Roaming the streets, growling</i>

201
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,343
<i>Ouch! Oh no!</i>

202
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,512
<i>Silly clown</i>

203
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,930
Eduardo.

204
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,393
I've searched the entire theater,

205
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,855
but there's no sign of Adelina
or Teresita here.

206
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,899
I believe this theater is abandoned.

207
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,737
Let's run away together, Teresita.

208
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,949
Let's elope.

209
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,453
I'm going to marry you
so that no one takes you from me.

210
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,289
Okay, fine.

211
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,458
So I can finally resolve
my issues with Mama.

212
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm saying yes.

213
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,847
- You're back.
- I couldn't find him, Sister.

214
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,058
<i>There's no news about him anywhere.</i>

215
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,518
<i>Didn't I tell you I'd come back?</i>

216
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,189
<i>Colonel, your wife is not inside
the organizer's house.</i>

217
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,150
<i>If that's the case,
let's continue the search.</i>

218
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,195
<i>We will search the entire Metro Manila
if that's what it takes to find her!</i>

219
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>I didn't come here for money!</i>

220
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,700
I know your father and I know
who killed Julio Borromeo.

221
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,036
<i>- Adelina, who's that man?
- Celso.</i>

222
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,705
Who killed my father?

223
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,748
Tell me!

224
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,750
COMING UP

225
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,090
