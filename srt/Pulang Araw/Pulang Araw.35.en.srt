1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,171
So they have vaudeville in this city.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,133
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:12,303
These Filipinos are copycats of the West.

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:17,183
One of these days,
we will enter and clean up their theater.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,061
We will find out who their artists are,

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:25,358
so we can use them for the changes
we plan to make in this country.

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,782
I don't feel comfortable with us
being a burden to them.

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,868
There's no reason
for you to feel that way,

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,413
especially since you and Hiroshi
are going to be married soon.

10
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,915
Why did you invade our country?

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,753
We didn't do anything to yours.

12
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,594
That is why, with the annihilation of the
United States Army Forces in the Far East,

13
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,306
nothing will stand in the way
of expanding our territory here in Asia.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,144
Have you no shame?
You stole my daughter's fiancé!

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,938
Don't flirt with someone
who isn't meant for you!

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,816
Sir, the people here are all innocent.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,902
They're just here to pray.

18
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,821
Get them out, quickly!

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,201
I've been waiting for you
so that I can give you this.

20
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,995
If possible, please don't approach me
or talk to me anymore.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,247
Especially when Señora Carmela is around.

22
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,457
But why?

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,919
Because her mind is set that you
and Teresita should end up together.

24
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,670
I will talk to Mrs. Borromeo, Adelina.

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,464
Do you know what happened here?

26
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,673
The Japanese bombed it.

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,342
I'm sure they all died.

28
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,219
You're not supposed to die yet.

29
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,728
It seems Chinita and Morena have arrived.

30
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,357
-Compadre.
-My friend!

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,361
-We're still alive.
-By God's grace.

32
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,158
Don't tell me you're still
planning to perform

33
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,077
even though we've been
taken over by the Japanese.

34
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,079
Who would even watch?

35
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,248
Well, here's the thing, compadre.

36
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,125
Last night…

37
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,670
some Japanese came to my house.

38
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,300
I thought they were going to arrest me or…

39
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,342
you know.

40
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,595
But it turns out…

41
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,807
they want me to reopen this theater.

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,726
They said they'll watch!

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,606
Are we really going to perform
for the enemy?

44
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,149
Indeed.

45
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,487
Be careful.

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,990
Someone might overhear you and report you.

47
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,909
Why, Marcel?

48
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,328
Is there a traitor among us?

49
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,415
Is there anyone here
who has sided with the Japanese?

50
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,686
Take that to my room, Meding.

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,146
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

52
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,992
I thought you had an important errand
to attend to, Hiroshi.

53
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,995
I was just about to leave.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,249
I want to speak with you, Mrs. Borromeo.

55
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,338
I ask that you treat Adelina kindly.

56
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,801
Please do not stop her from speaking to me
or force her to avoid me.

57
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,390
Most importantly,
do not harm or mistreat her.

58
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,103
I hope you will grant me these requests.

59
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,940
If you do not wish to lose this new home.

60
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,795
You really went ahead and told him,
you wretched girl.

61
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,630
I could kill you for this.

62
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,136
Who among us would be a traitor?
We are all Filipinos here.

63
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,558
Even if we know or are friends
with a Japanese person,

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,186
that does not mean we would betray
and turn our backs on our own country.

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,646
Right, Mr. Luis?

66
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,359
Perhaps you're right.

67
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,990
Besides, I believe
America will defeat them

68
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,409
and drive them out of our country…

69
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,787
sooner rather than later.

70
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,123
Yes.

71
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,502
I know we do not like the Japanese.

72
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,382
But aren't they just like the Americans
who also colonized us?

73
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,010
How are they different, really?

74
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,181
That's true.
There's no real difference, sir.

75
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,393
Ah, pardon me, but you are mistaken.

76
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,398
The Americans are grumpier
than the Japanese.

77
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,070
You're really something, Adelina.
You can still joke at a time like this.

78
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,282
We need laughter now more than ever.

79
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,954
Because of the dreadful situation
our country is in now.

80
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,416
That's why I don't want this
to end in tears later,

81
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,170
so we need to make the Japanese happy,
so they'll leave us alone.

82
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,927
Who among our singers knows
how to sing in Japanese?

83
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,057
Huh? No one?

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,934
Teresita.

85
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,562
Do you remember that song
Hiroshi sang when we were children?

86
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,190
Ah, it was so beautiful.

87
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,945
I chased after rabbits

88
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,116
On that mountain

89
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,162
I fished for minnow

90
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,165
In that river

91
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:02,046
I still dream of those days

92
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,299
Even now

93
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,637
Oh, how I miss

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,640
My old country home

95
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,435
I even taught it to you.

96
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,687
That's good. Yes.

97
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,732
Yes. Practice it with our musicians now!

98
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,733
Go on.

99
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,776
But…

100
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,029
I really do not want to perform
for those soldiers.

101
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,366
And I do not wish
to show my daughters to them.

102
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,493
-Let's go.
-No, wait. My friend!

103
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,455
My life and this theater
are at stake here!

104
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,665
What, you'd just abandon us?

105
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,958
Julio, come on!

106
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,199
Good afternoon, everyone!

107
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,036
I chased after rabbits

108
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:01,249
On that mountain

109
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:06,003
I fished for minnow

110
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,382
In that river

111
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,804
I still dream of those days

112
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,933
Even now

113
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:23,479
Oh, how I miss

114
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,775
My old country home

115
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,407
Father and mother

116
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,119
Are they doing well?

117
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,582
Is everything well

118
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:47,378
With all my friends?

119
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,757
When the rain falls

120
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,886
When the wind blows

121
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,057
I stop and recall

122
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,311
My old country home

123
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:10,568
Some day, when I have done

124
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,739
What I set out to do

125
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,076
I'll return home

126
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,414
One of these days

127
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:28,085
Where the mountains are green

128
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,256
My old country home

129
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,927
Where the waters are clear

130
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:41,265
My old country home

131
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,230
Where the waters are clear

132
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,735
My old country home

133
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,360
Hey! Where are you going?

134
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,322
Come here!

135
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,283
I said come here!

136
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,246
You.

137
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,084
I am Filipino.

138
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,147
I heard the Japanese have already released
their imprisoned fellowmen.

139
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,692
Has your friend been released?

140
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,071
The one you visited recently
in their prison?

141
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,117
Yes, he's free now.

142
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,206
Is he still your friend even though
we are now under his people?

143
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,001
Marcel, he's not evil.

144
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,378
Hiroshi is a good person.

145
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,884
He and his family took us in

146
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,222
after we were driven out of our home
by his countrymen.

147
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,099
That's why you should be careful with him.

148
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,602
Even if he's Hiroshi.

149
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,564
Just because he shows you kindness,
it doesn't mean…

150
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,527
Remember,
his people are still our enemies,

151
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,904
his country is still our enemy.

152
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:44,949
And one more thing,

153
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,993
I don't want you to be seen
as traitors by our people.

154
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,663
It's difficult to be branded…

155
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,207
a traitor.

156
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,678
But there is a Japanese officer
who wishes to meet you.

157
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,887
I have no choice.

158
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,980
They must not find you attractive.

159
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,022
Sit.

160
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,357
-Dad, what?
-Open your mouth!

161
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,817
-Open my mouth?
-Show your teeth.

162
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,110
Open your mouth.

163
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,001
Okay! Teresita, your turn. Come on.

164
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,044
Open your mouth. Show your teeth.

165
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,092
Friend…

166
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,695
Thank you for showing your talent, miss.

167
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,120
There's no need to thank me, Colonel.

168
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,041
Ah, so you also know…

169
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:05,130
how to speak English and our language.

170
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,676
I am Julio Borromeo,

171
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,346
the father of these young women.

172
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,892
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Borromeo.

173
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,729
I am Colonel Saitoh Yuta.

174
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,606
And yes, you are correct,

175
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,736
I studied in your country
and learned your language.

176
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,161
Are all the Japanese who lived
and studied here in our country

177
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,122
spies and soldiers like you?

178
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,305
Liar!

179
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,650
Do that again and I will kill you!

180
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,364
What did you just say? Again!

181
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,622
Not all of us are soldiers or spies, miss.

182
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:51,111
And I heard there is a famous comedian
who performs here,

183
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,406
but we didn't see him earlier.

184
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,409
Oh, you mean Pugo and Togo?

185
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,039
Um, they had some errands to do
and that's why they are not here.

186
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,749
Are you referring to them?

187
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:10,047
They are the famous comedians
of your theater and your country's movies?

188
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,257
Yes, yes.

189
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:17,846
You seem to have done your research
before coming here to watch us, Colonel.

190
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
That's right, sir.

191
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,475
That's why…

192
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,939
did you know that
our respected Prime Minister,

193
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,819
General Tojo Hideki,

194
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,824
his name sounds like
the stage name of Mr. Togo?

195
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,331
We will consider it disrespectful
if he continues to use that name.

196
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,255
I will make them change
their names right away!

197
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,965
I will tell them right away.

198
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,677
Very well.

199
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,640
Thank you very much, Mr. Borromeo.

200
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,353
I will wait for you
and your daughters outside.

201
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:14,862
And I hope you allow me to bring
you and your daughters home.

202
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,781
No need, sir.

203
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,075
We have a car.

204
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,080
I will wait for you outside.

205
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,877
Thank you very much to all of you!

206
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,613
Papa, I don't want him to drive us home.

207
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,865
Teresita is right.

208
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,119
I suspect he has his eyes on Teresita
so he's acting that way.

209
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,662
I sensed that too.

210
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,289
Me too.

211
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,833
We're all thinking of the same thing.

212
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,047
But who are we
to refuse a Japanese officer

213
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,216
who is invading our country, huh?

214
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,476
You!

215
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,814
Go back to your country
because we don't need you here!

216
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,093
Long live the Philippines…

217
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,096
who is always being invaded by foreigners!

218
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,559
Death and defeat for all animals like you!

219
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,520
What did you say?

220
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,317
Do you want to die?

221
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,573
What's going on here?

222
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,202
It seems like this man wants to fight us!

223
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,456
He can't even tell us who is in the photo!

224
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:41,383
I'm sure he is not related to that man.

225
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,718
I know Eduardo.

226
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,886
He is my childhood friend.

227
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,473
So please leave him to me.

228
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,693
Reprimand him!

229
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
Teach him to show respect!

230
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,739
Yes, sir!

231
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,906
Idiot!

232
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,790
Thank you for defending me.

233
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,004
The photo they took from you,

234
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,715
is he your American father?

235
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,889
Eduardo, didn't I already warn you
to leave Manila?

236
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,640
Why are you not listening, Eduardo?

237
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,392
And where will I go, Hiroshi?

238
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,730
I can't just leave
Adelina and Teresita, you know that.

239
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,736
Don't worry, this war is only temporary.

240
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,365
The moment our army drives away
all the Americans here…

241
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,328
peace will return.

242
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,998
Can I trust your words?

243
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,754
Eduardo, I am still your friend.

244
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,047
Friend?

245
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,593
Your people have brought us nothing
but war and invasion!

246
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,428
And you knew this all along!

247
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,977
That's why even your friendship
with us seems like a lie!

248
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,607
As fake as the peace you are promising us.

249
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,811
It seems like Dado is right, Tasyo.

250
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,939
I wish we had
gone to the mountains with him.

251
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,276
Wait, wait one moment.

252
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,485
What made you say that?

253
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,071
I don't want to explain anymore.

254
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,950
But prepare yourself.

255
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,994
Because, just like Dado,

256
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,414
I think…

257
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,793
we will soon be forced
to go to the mountains

258
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,254
and fight those damn Japanese.

259
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:41,563
I know that the Borromeo family
is respected in this city.

260
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:47,402
So I am hoping you will help us
explain to your countrymen

261
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:53,491
about us freeing this country
from American colonialists.

262
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,330
But isn't the invasion you are doing now
also the work of colonialists?

263
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,664
Adelina.

264
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,833
COMING UP

265
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,462
All sides have their danger.

266
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,757
I no longer know how
we can survive in these times.

267
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,929
You will survive. I will defend you
and fight for you every day.

268
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,515
Apologies, but since
I already have a fiancé,

269
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,435
this will be the last time
you will visit me.

270
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:25,941
Apologies but I cannot give in
to your request to stay away from you.

271
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,821
He never treated me as his son.

272
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,506
