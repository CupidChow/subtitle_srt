1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,587
<i>There's no reason for me
to live anymore, Yuta!</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>You've already ruined my family.</i>

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>I'm no longer afraid to die!</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>And the way you talk back?
It's as if I'm not your husband.</i>

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,269
Eduardo's in danger.

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>Soldiers are on their way to his location,</i>

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>and his Aunt Amalia is leading the hunt.</i>

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,860
Why did you let Adelina Dela Cruz escape?

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>We let them get away.</i>

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,655
- Adelina!
<i>- But we killed her male companion.</i>

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>Where are you going?</i>

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>To see Colonel Saitoh Yuta.</i>

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>I'm going to put an end to all of this.</i>

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>Have you met my wife?</i>

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>Did she tell you where Eduardo
and his group are hiding?</i>

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,168
Thanks for all your help, Lauro.

17
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,672
I'll kill your leader
if you kill my daughter.

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,885
My soldiers will kill you and your child!

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>If it's not too much to ask,
I only have one request.</i>

20
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,931
<i>It's about my daughter, Luisa.</i>

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,933
<i>I ask that you help me find her.</i>

22
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,979
Tell us where Eduardo Dela Cruz is.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>Looks like there's an attack.
Or maybe someone got shot.</i>

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,983
That was for the guerillas.

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,985
So they would find us.

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,071
We'll make them come to us.

27
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>Eduardo, it's your Auntie Amalia.</i>

28
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,242
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,786
It's a trap.

30
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,080
It's a trap!

31
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,581
Retreat, retreat!

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,135
Which one of you is Eduardo Dela Cruz?

33
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,055
I never thought I'd be famous
among bastards like you!

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,557
Is it you?

35
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,725
Are you Dela Cruz?

36
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,813
Surrender yourselves
if you don't want to die!

37
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,233
Commander, are we going to surrender?

38
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,902
Don't drop your weapons.

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,863
We'll die fighting!

40
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,781
Disarm them!

41
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,580
It's an ambush! Take cover!

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,756
This is for Colonel Saitoh.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,799
Go inside.

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,693
Thank you, sir.

45
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,010
I'll stay with you and keep watch.

46
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,317
We'll die here!

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,485
Let's retreat!

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,986
Now!

49
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,657
Retreat!

50
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,287
Luisa.

51
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,956
Luisa.

52
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,546
Who was that? Who saved us?

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,232
Sir Jorge?

54
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,026
They're with me.

55
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,739
I didn't expect you'd help us.

56
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
We fight for the same cause, Eduardo.

57
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,370
Even if we have different opinions.

58
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,978
You thought it was the Colonel,
didn't you?

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,188
Well, too bad for you.

60
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,776
You just made a grave mistake.

61
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,832
Luisa, come here.

62
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,916
Luisa…

63
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,252
Luisa.

64
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,180
Dearest?

65
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,516
My dear Luisa…

66
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,855
Eduardo, help me.

67
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,273
Auntie.

68
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,915
Make sure this person
is arrested immediately.

69
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,832
Yes, sir!

70
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,088
Good news, Colonel.

71
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,839
They've captured Hiroshi Tanaka.

72
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,342
He's already locked up in a cell.

73
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,385
How was he captured, Lieutenant?

74
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,931
Hiroshi attempted to assassinate
the Colonel in his office,

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,976
but he ended up killing a mere soldier.

76
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,735
Your friend is probably regretting
his actions right now, Watanabe.

77
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,032
He killed the wrong person.

78
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,204
My dearest…

79
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,333
Wake up.

80
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,338
Mommy's had enough of your jokes.

81
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,132
Please wake up.

82
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,094
If you don't wake up, I'll spank you.

83
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,056
Wake up! Wake up!

84
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,517
Luisa?

85
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,768
Luisa?

86
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,937
Luisa…

87
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,774
Luisa…

88
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
Luisa!

89
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,657
Luisa!

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,875
Luisa!

91
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,796
You know what to do.

92
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,342
Don't show him any mercy

93
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,387
for he is a traitor and a fool.

94
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,308
Colonel, are you planning
to have him executed?

95
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,144
With all due respect, Colonel.

96
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,937
But he's already behind bars.

97
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,773
Why does he still need to be executed?

98
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
I don't think it's just
to kill one of our own.

99
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,323
Are you giving me orders?

100
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,042
Forgive me, Auntie.

101
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,880
I failed to protect Luisa.

102
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,677
The enemies are to blame.

103
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,308
But why my daughter?

104
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,854
Why did it have to be Luisa?

105
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,570
Why is He doing this to us?

106
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,161
Why are we being punished by God?

107
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,873
Auntie, don't blame God.

108
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,088
Blame those who wish to rule our homeland.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,260
It's still God's fault

110
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,181
because He has abandoned us all.

111
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,522
He's only teaching us
to be brave and strong.

112
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,651
He wanted to show us the value

113
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,822
of our freedom
that was taken away from us.

114
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,037
It doesn't stop with Luisa.

115
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,626
We could lose more of our loved ones

116
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,338
if we continue to allow

117
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,301
these good-for-nothing foreigners
to trample over us.

118
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,849
We must put an end to this war

119
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,521
so no one else suffers like this.

120
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,983
It's okay to mourn for your daughter.

121
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,988
We'll lay her to rest here.

122
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,326
And after that,

123
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,663
we'll continue the fight.

124
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,409
We'll follow the proper process.

125
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,580
Hiroshi Tanaka will undergo a trial
by court-martial

126
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,333
to hear any charges against him.

127
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,420
Therefore, you will not be the one
to punish him.

128
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,465
That man…

129
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,260
attempted to kill me!

130
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,347
As the leader of the Kempeitai,

131
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,351
you're responsible for enforcing
proper discipline and punishment.

132
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,269
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

133
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,355
Watanabe.

134
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:36,278
Make sure your friend
doesn't escape his cell.

135
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,578
Because if he does,

136
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,791
I'll hold you accountable for it.

137
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,109
We'll be on our way, Eduardo.

138
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,987
We need to return to our base.

139
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,865
Where did you find your new group, sir?

140
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,536
They're the Hukbalahap.

141
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,539
Comrade Luis Taruc is our leader.

142
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,167
He's young just like you.

143
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,918
Often hot-headed.

144
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,591
But like you, he has principles
and a strong conviction.

145
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,386
He always prioritizes what's best
for the people and the nation.

146
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,973
Bring him along sometime.

147
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,207
Are you done?

148
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,542
You may leave us now.

149
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:16,921
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,220
I was right.

151
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,640
I knew you had plans to kill the Colonel.

152
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,976
Do you realize how enraged he is
because of this foolishness?

153
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,481
Good thing I was to change his mind.

154
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,568
Why did you do that?

155
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,870
Even though you're an idiot,
you're still my friend.

156
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,333
How are you going to get out of this now?

157
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,546
How can you be so stupid?

158
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,801
I no longer think about myself.

159
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,971
I'm just worried for Adelina.

160
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,765
I know our forces
are already looking for her.

161
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,560
Thanks again for all your help.

162
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,487
Let's go!

163
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,826
It's getting dark.

164
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,996
We also need to return to our base.

165
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,293
I'm not going with you anymore, Eduardo.

166
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,006
I'm going back to the city.

167
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,759
But it's too dangerous there, Auntie.

168
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,389
Do you really think I still give
a damn about that?

169
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,103
I want to go back to Lauro.

170
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,902
I want to confront my treacherous husband.

171
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,532
He's the reason I was captured
in the first place.

172
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,579
They're here to take you away.

173
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,830
I'm not coming with you!

174
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,957
Let me go, you monsters!

175
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,626
He's the reason why

176
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,964
Luisa got her involved in this mess.

177
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,799
Either you tell me where Eduardo is,

178
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,927
or your daughter will experience

179
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,971
the same things you did
at the hands of my soldiers.

180
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,431
You monster!

181
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,142
You'll tell me where Eduardo is

182
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,810
or your daughter suffers.

183
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,688
That's why he's to blame.

184
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,654
He has to pay the price
for what he did to us.

185
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,531
Do you want me to come along?

186
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,910
Our group needs you here.

187
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,374
I can take care of myself.

188
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,534
This is my last request, my friend.

189
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,455
Find Adelina.

190
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,457
Save her.

191
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,379
I don't know how I can repay you

192
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,965
for all the kindness you've shown me.

193
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,383
But, Akio…

194
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,137
I'll make it up to you someday.

195
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,307
Please, my friend.

196
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,687
Save the woman I love.

197
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,983
I think you're forgetting

198
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,111
that I'm a still loyal soldier
of our army.

199
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,698
I can't just protect
those who are against us.

200
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,076
You really are stupid.

201
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,799
Adelina, whose house is this?

202
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,344
This was our mother's house.

203
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,224
This is where we were born.

204
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,019
We'll hide here for now.

205
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,109
Is someone living here?

206
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,237
This house doesn't feel empty to me.

207
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,905
What if they come back here?

208
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,134
I'm not sure about that, Sister.

209
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
But let's take a chance.

210
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,099
For now, let's stay here for the night.

211
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,811
We'll be safer here.

212
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,612
Just my luck.

213
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,907
Who would've thought
I'd be able to catch you here?

214
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,535
It's my good-for-nothing uncle.

215
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,340
Yuta.

216
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,814
How are you, Mrs. Saitoh?

217
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,775
<i>Hide my children.</i>

218
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,446
<i>- Where are the others?</i>
- It's just me and my wife.

219
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,739
Liar!

220
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,952
<i>Eduardo, he's the man we saw
at Mr. Tanaka's store.</i>

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>He's pretending to be a civilian.</i>

222
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,665
<i>Colonel.</i>

223
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,500
<i>Thank you, Captain.</i>

224
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,170
<i>Let's finish him.</i>

225
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm glad to see you again.

226
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,388
<i>Colonel.</i>

227
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>What happened?
Have you captured Dela Cruz?</i>

228
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,728
Forgive me, Colonel.
We failed to capture him.

229
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,938
Useless fools!

230
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>What do you need, Yuta?</i>

231
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,401
How dare you attempt to take away my life?

232
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,947
<i>I won't die in the hands
of someone like you!</i>

233
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,573
<i>My love, you came back!</i>

234
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,075
Please help me.

235
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,619
Your niece wants to kill me!

236
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,206
You deserve to die, you traitor.

237
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
Amalia.

238
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,500
COMING UP

239
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,214
