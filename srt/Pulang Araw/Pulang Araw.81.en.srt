PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,889
It has come to our attention
that one of your people is a spy.

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,810
<i>I know and believe Teresita is alive.
I'm sure we’ll find her.</i>

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,437
Along with all the women like her.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>We're going to free them
from those monsters!</i>

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>She's just 12 years old.</i>

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,818
She's far too young to endure
your disgusting soldiers.

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>We'll prove to you that someone here
is against us.</i>

9
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,037
- What's that?
<i>- A Makapili.</i>

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>They're traitors
who report to the enemies.</i>

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>Arrest him!</i>

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>Traitor!</i>

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>Are you really going to marry the Colonel?</i>

14
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,298
Don't worry about me.

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,300
Go home to your parents.

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,970
Who are your other comrades?

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,639
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,853
I'm still wondering
who's the man behind the mask.

19
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,646
The one you call a Makapili.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,523
<i>I'm sure Marcel knows that man.</i>

21
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,861
<i>He was a wearing a disguise,
which meant we might know him too.</i>

22
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,405
<i>Now do you know</i>

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>how we captured Sergeant Diosdado Reyes?</i>

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,122
He was captured by our soldiers yesterday.

25
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,299
Don't even try to escape, you moron!

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,071
It's so easy to eliminate the guerrillas.

27
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:40,285
They confess pretty easily
once they're captured.

28
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,162
- Stop!
- Lift his head!

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:53,381
I'm so glad we met again, soldier.

30
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,389
I'll make you suffer even more.

31
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,062
Continue!

32
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,950
He couldn't bear the pain,

33
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:27,123
so he switched sides and pointed to you.

34
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,342
He claims you're the one
aiding their group,

35
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,095
supplying them with food and weapons.

36
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,641
Now,

37
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,603
are you still going to deny it?

38
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,078
If I were you,

39
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,374
I'd rather confess now than suffer later.

40
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,004
Who are your other comrades?

41
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:22,345
Tell me the names
of those treacherous snakes.

42
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,980
Tell me who they are.

43
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,982
I'm not like Dado!

44
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,277
I won't betray…

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,572
my people!

46
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,593
I'd rather die

47
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,972
than tell you the truth!

48
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,815
Colonel, why did you kill him?

49
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,527
He was wasting my time.

50
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,863
I still have to prepare for my wedding.

51
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,867
Wedding? You're getting married?

52
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,535
That's right.

53
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,290
So don't bother me for now.

54
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,962
Dispose of him.

55
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,973
Please be careful, Sister.

56
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,392
Watch out for those soldiers.

57
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,248
We'll stay here for now.

58
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,416
Marcel has been captured.

59
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,169
My Lord.

60
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,964
How long must we endure this?

61
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,758
When is General MacArthur coming back?

62
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,135
Who knows.

63
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,099
I think we should just prepare ourselves
for what's going to happen next.

64
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
It's time, Manuela.

65
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,061
Your escort is waiting outside.

66
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,646
All right.

67
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,023
Take care.

68
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985
I have something for you.

69
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,407
I saw this poster on the street.

70
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,499
Isn't that Hiroshi?

71
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,043
What?

72
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,674
Are the Japanese
planning to arrest Hiroshi too?

73
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,801
Did you two meet recently?

74
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,180
Have you heard anything from Hiroshi?

75
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,476
No.

76
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,687
I don't even know where he is.

77
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,313
Who are you?

78
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
Thief! Catch him!

79
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,099
What's that noise?

80
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,852
- Is someone there?
- Could it be the guerrillas?

81
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,979
Go check over there!

82
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,308
Now!

83
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,191
Damn! A base nearby is being attacked.

84
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,388
What's happening? Why are there gunshots?

85
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,058
Please, let's take a different route!

86
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,601
We're going to get killed here!

87
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,187
No! Our men need us!

88
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,314
Get ready to fight!

89
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,274
Let's get out of here!

90
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,946
Adelina.

91
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,949
Who's that letter from?

92
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,621
Eduardo.

93
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,625
Juan gave this to me the other day.

94
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,712
I'm just reading it again
to reassure myself

95
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,297
he's still alive out there.

96
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
Your brother's alive?

97
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,304
Then the Japanese were lying
when they told everyone he's dead?

98
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,474
Eduardo's very much alive, Luis.

99
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,939
I just hope the same goes for my dad,

100
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,486
Hiroshi, and Teresita.

101
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,158
I hope they're all alive like my brother.

102
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,245
Start the car now! Let's move!

103
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,983
Adelina. Luis.

104
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,028
- Bad news.
- What is it, Nando?

105
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,447
Marcel's dead.

106
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,285
The intel came from our insiders.

107
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,746
The Japanese killed him.

108
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,456
Those bastards!

109
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,553
Hey, you!

110
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,564
Hey!

111
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,315
Stop right there!

112
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,901
- Give that back!
- Give it!

113
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,486
Give it!

114
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,325
- I'm not your enemy.
- Give that back!

115
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,373
- Give that to me!
- Don't fight back!

116
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,961
Thank you for your help, miss.

117
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,965
It means a lot that you came with us.

118
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,010
It's so nice to see you again.

119
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,721
You should thank Colonel Marcos Agustin.

120
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,477
Thank you very much, Colonel.
My name's Eduardo.

121
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,354
Call me Marking.

122
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,697
We're leaving in five minutes!

123
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,116
Make sure you all get the…

124
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,871
- Enemies are approaching.
- Let's move.

125
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,416
- Everyone, move!
- Move!

126
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,659
My Lord. Eduardo?

127
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,661
Eduardo!

128
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,210
Eduardo!

129
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,053
Eduardo!

130
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,391
Stay back!

131
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,976
Eduardo!

132
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,313
- Let's move.
- Go, before they catch up.

133
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,441
Stay back!

134
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,068
Stay back!

135
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,737
Faster!

136
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,540
My heart is bursting
with excitement and joy.

137
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,792
- My Lord.
- What happened?

138
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,337
I saw my fiancé.

139
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,131
I saw Eduardo again.

140
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,218
Wait, isn't he dead?

141
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,013
That's what I thought too.

142
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,931
But I'm sure I wasn't mistaken.

143
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,769
I saw him with my own eyes.

144
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,274
My Lord, thank you for hearing my prayer.

145
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,901
Eduardo's alive.

146
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,237
Good for you.

147
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:17,327
As for me, I don't even know
if my husband is alive or dead.

148
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,622
I don't even know if he's looking for me.

149
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,797
Forgive me, Norma.

150
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,926
I haven't thought about…

151
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,180
your situation.

152
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,787
Uncle.

153
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,247
I'm glad you all game back alive.

154
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,750
We lost one comrade.

155
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,420
We couldn't even bury his corpse.

156
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,674
Get some rest!

157
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,636
You too, kid.

158
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,809
I heard there was a gunfight earlier.

159
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,271
I'm glad you weren't harmed.

160
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,163
Can you please let go of me?

161
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,791
It's very hot in here.

162
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,504
Could you step out for a bit?

163
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,883
I want to change my clothes.

164
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,761
You can change your clothes right now.

165
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,933
We're getting married, anyway.

166
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,652
Eduardo.

167
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,490
I'll be leaving the camp later at dawn.

168
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,577
I'm going to the city

169
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,622
in hopes of finding my daughter.

170
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,583
I'll go with you, Auntie.

171
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,087
We might get a full moon tomorrow
or the next day.

172
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,842
I was hoping to see my sister again.

173
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:43,515
And hopefully, Teresita will be there too.

174
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,185
Then you should get some rest.

175
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,354
We have a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

176
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,858
I'll just say goodbye to Jorge.

177
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,752
We can't talk to Marcel's family
when their house is surrounded by enemies.

178
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,005
Let's just go before anyone notices us.

179
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,341
We need to avenge Marcel's death.

180
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,764
Take me to the guerillas.
I want to talk to them.

181
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,356
Stop! Why are you outside?

182
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,400
Come with us!

183
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,486
Hey!

184
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,695
Don't shoot!

185
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,744
Everything's all set.

186
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,414
A priest will come tomorrow
to facilitate our wedding.

187
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,960
Tomorrow?

188
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,172
- Yuta, maybe we can…
- We've already talked about this.

189
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,804
Don't try to postpone this any longer.

190
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,019
It would be more favorable for you
to marry me right away.

191
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,983
Our wedding is tomorrow.

192
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,195
So get some rest.

193
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,676
<i>You caught a Japanese soldier.</i>

194
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,429
Not all Japanese are bad.

195
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,639
- You're lying!
<i>- Don't touch him!</i>

196
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,766
COMING UP

197
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,227
<i>Help me. I don't want to die yet.</i>

198
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,104
I'm a friend of Hiroshi.

199
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,481
<i>Looks like they're hiding women
in that garrison.</i>

200
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,443
<i>- What are you going to do, sir?
- I'll get inside that garrison.</i>

201
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,902
<i>Maybe Teresita's inside.</i>

202
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:08,076
<i>Teresita Borromeo, do you take Yuta Saitoh</i>

203
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,203
<i>to be your lawfully wedded husband?</i>

204
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,623
- Where are the other women?
<i>- One of them is outside.</i>

205
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,133
