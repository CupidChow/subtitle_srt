1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,212
<i>This is the best time for you to escape.</i>

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,547
Teresita!

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>I no longer have the reason to live.</i>

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>Eduardo and I are here for you, Auntie.</i>

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>We’ll fight against our enemies
side by side.</i>

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>I need to speak with Adelina.</i>

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,436
Do you know where she might be?

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,105
I don't know
where Miss Chinita is right now.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>Where is she?</i>

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>I don’t know.</i>

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>Even if you kill me right now,
my answer won't change.</i>

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,121
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,416
At least I'll be with Luisa in paradise.

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,711
- Have you found Teresita?
<i>- No.</i>

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>But we've found her sister, Adelina.</i>

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,924
<i>I dreamt of Adelina last night, Tasyo.</i>

17
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

18
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,553
I can feel that my sister is in danger.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,806
- Adelina.
- Hiroshi?

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,934
<i>The Japanese are coming.
They’re headed in our direction.</i>

21
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>It’s Eduardo.</i>

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,937
<i>He's the reason you're after Adelina!</i>

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,566
<i>Those siblings are opposing my army.</i>

24
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,819
That's why it's only right
that I have them arrested!

25
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,614
If you’re looking for my brother,

26
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,825
I don’t know where he’s hiding.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,703
<i>I don't need to know</i>

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,623
<i>because I know you won't tell me.</i>

29
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,586
I'll use you in some other way.

30
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,348
Whatever it is your planning,

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,433
I don't give a damn.

32
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,937
Do what you want

33
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,273
if it pleases you.

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,902
That's what playing God
is all about, right?

35
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,867
I assure you

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,245
that this time

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,084
you won't escape death.

38
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,401
Thank you for bravely defending
this country with us, Minyong.

39
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,639
I'm sorry

40
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,893
if I can't take you back home
to your family.

41
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,272
For we too

42
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,192
have families and loved ones
wanting and waiting for our return.

43
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,122
Take all the supplies we can use.

44
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,039
Be quick.

45
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,711
We'll leave right away
and look for a new camp.

46
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,727
Where's the Colonel?

47
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,061
He's not here.

48
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,356
The authorities have arrested Adelina.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,861
He must have stayed up late
because he visited her last night.

50
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,696
Did they catch Adelina?

51
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,033
What did the Colonel do to her?

52
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,328
Is she still alive?

53
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,457
Why do you ask?

54
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,877
And why…

55
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,673
are you so concerned for her?

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,220
I just want to know the details, Colonel.

57
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,975
As an officer, I believe
it is my right to know.

58
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,351
You're right.

59
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:58,066
It's also my right to know
how Teresita escaped.

60
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,861
There was no sign of forced entry.

61
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,245
I also made sure not to leave anything

62
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:19,378
inside the room
that Teresita can use to escape.

63
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,424
Which meant…

64
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,927
somebody helped her escape.

65
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,310
What do you think, Akio?

66
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,146
Colonel.

67
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,274
I don't know how she escaped.

68
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,820
With all due respect, sir.

69
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,490
But your wife is your responsibility.

70
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,160
My apologies, but I have to go.

71
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,541
I only came here to submit some paperwork.

72
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,594
Where's your pistol?

73
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,855
Be safe, my friend. Please.

74
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,532
My pistol…

75
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,328
I must've left it in my quarters.

76
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,125
What impeccable timing.

77
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,505
Hiroshi just used a gun against me.

78
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,757
Was that your gun, Akio?

79
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,390
Colonel.

80
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,768
I am not a traitor.

81
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,483
My loyalty and allegiance
is to the Japanese Imperial Army.

82
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,864
Now if you have no more questions,

83
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,492
may I have your permission to leave?

84
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,795
Shimizu.

85
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,090
Keep an eye on Akio.

86
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,967
That lad…

87
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,262
I don't trust him.

88
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,889
Yes, sir.

89
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,152
Nakamura, any updates?

90
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,531
Akio, look at this.

91
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,832
What's this?

92
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,921
The Colonel wants everyone to know
that the vaudeville star,

93
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,092
Adelina Dela Cruz, has been captured.

94
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,512
And that she will only be freed
once Eduardo Dela Cruz

95
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,765
or Teresita Borromeo surrenders.

96
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,184
Don't you think that's a smart move?

97
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,022
Men, distribute these to everyone!

98
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,691
Post these in every corner!

99
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,987
The Colonel wants the word out
as soon as possible.

100
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,738
Yes, sir!

101
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,759
Miss, it's me, Omar.

102
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,136
Please don't hurt me.

103
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,305
- Calm down.
- I'm sorry.

104
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,222
God.

105
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,099
How was your trip?

106
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,688
What's wrong? What's that?

107
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,565
I saw this poster at the checkpoint.

108
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,234
The Japanese soldiers
were giving these away.

109
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,071
They caught Chinita.

110
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,243
And they'll only release her

111
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,913
if Eduardo or I surrender.

112
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,293
That bastard Yuta.

113
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,861
Yuta.

114
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,245
<i>Leave Adelina alone.</i>

115
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,874
I know how important
she is to you, Teresita.

116
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,335
Release my sister at once.

117
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,091
I have a proposition for you, my wife

118
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,887
I'll do what you wish,

119
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,267
but you must come back home to me.

120
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,978
I don't trust you.

121
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,732
I know you won't release
my sister that easily.

122
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,820
I know you're a hoax and a liar, Yuta.

123
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,617
You'll do anything
just to get what you want.

124
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:29,165
He's just using Adelina to force Teresita
and Eduardo to surrender?

125
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,837
Is Teresita free from Saitoh?

126
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,965
I released Teresita, Hiroshi.

127
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,177
I helped her escape.

128
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,846
Saitoh is suspecting me.

129
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,682
He thinks I'm no longer loyal to him.

130
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,521
If that's the case, why did you call?

131
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,318
Do you think you can order me
to release Adelina?

132
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
You're a monster, Yuta.

133
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,033
Listen to me, my wife.

134
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,205
I’m giving you until tonight to come back.

135
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,624
Or else,

136
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,586
something bad will happen to Adelina.

137
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>I'll hold the gun myself…</i>

138
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
<i>and I will end her life.</i>

139
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,779
Akio.

140
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,114
I know you're a good man
and a good soldier.

141
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,991
So, do what’s right.

142
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,327
Help us escape.

143
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,204
Get us out of here.

144
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,089
The fate and safety of your sister
is in your hands, Teresita.

145
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,051
You must decide.

146
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,304
Will you save her?

147
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,641
Or will you let her die?

148
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,085
Are you crazy?

149
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,713
I can't do that.

150
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,258
The Colonel is going to kill me

151
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,802
if he finds out.

152
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,013
Why do you still fear him?

153
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,224
How long are you going to tolerate

154
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,101
his evil deeds?

155
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,770
Until it's too late?

156
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,315
Until he has killed many more?

157
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,112
He might kill you too,
just like what he did to Colonel Arata.

158
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,825
Akio, you're a good man.

159
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,453
Do what's right.

160
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,848
Open the door.

161
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,249
Is he really going to kill Chinita
if you don't surrender?

162
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,171
Don't you think
he's just trying to scare you?

163
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,673
I know Yuta.

164
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,968
I've seen what he's capable of.

165
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,602
It's me! Teresita didn't do anything!

166
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,898
- Miss Dolores!
- Release Teresita.

167
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,400
Miss Dolores.

168
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,779
Take this woman outside and kill her.

169
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,574
<i>When he says he'll punish anyone
who defies him,</i>

170
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>he means it.</i>

171
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,911
That's why I know

172
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,874
that Yuta will really kill my sister

173
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,585
if I don't surrender.

174
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,755
But if you surrender,

175
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,927
how can you be so sure
that he'll free your sister?

176
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,470
That's the problem.

177
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,684
I don't trust Yuta's words and promises.

178
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,965
How can I save my sister

179
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,888
when I know we'll both die
in the hands of that monster?

180
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,768
Colonel.

181
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,353
If Mrs. Saitoh does return,

182
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,440
are you really going to release
Adelina Dela Cruz?

183
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,199
Nakamura.

184
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,787
Do you think I'm a fool?

185
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,833
I will not release Adelina.

186
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,298
I will kill her and her brother,
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

187
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,051
That way,

188
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,014
we can finally silence
those damned guerillas!

189
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,142
Colonel.

190
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,685
I'll be heading out first.

191
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,076
Are you starting to be like Minyong?

192
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,745
How come you're smiling right now?

193
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,085
I was just remembering
the dream Adelina and I once had.

194
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,463
We wanted our own home.

195
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:56,009
When I get a good job,
I'll buy us a big house

196
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,095
that we can call our own.

197
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:03,183
I can't wait to live in our very own house

198
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,477
with just the two of us.

199
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,692
But look at us now, Tasyo.

200
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,863
We're hiding from our enemies
deep in the forest.

201
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,284
We're always under the scorching sun,

202
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,828
the chilly rain.

203
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,954
Waiting.

204
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,916
I'd rather wait here

205
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,503
than suffer in the hands of our enemies.

206
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,756
This is paradise for me.

207
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,970
True paradise is a place
where we can all live peacefully

208
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,599
with the ones we love.

209
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,268
I'm left with no other choice,

210
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,064
but to surrender and pray

211
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,485
that Yuta will release my sister.

212
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:00,449
But if you do that,
you'll be the Colonel's slave forever.

213
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,368
Is there really no other way?

214
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,789
That's where we'll fulfill
and achieve our dreams.

215
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,542
This is hell, Tasyo.

216
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,504
And that's because of our enemies.

217
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,133
In coming!

218
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,429
Please don't shoot.

219
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,182
It's just me!

220
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,850
Wait.

221
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,727
Lower your weapons.

222
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,687
Dad.

223
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,317
How did you find us here?

224
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,319
I know this mountain well. Why, son?

225
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,030
Don't you want to see me?

226
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,825
Are you jealous of them?

227
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,080
Speaking of, where's your dad?

228
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,707
Is he still alive?

229
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,254
Eduardo…

230
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,802
He needs to know about this.
so he can save our sister.

231
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,595
We need to talk, Eduardo.

232
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,639
That's why I'm here.

233
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,183
There's something you need to know.

234
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,277
But I don't know where Eduardo is.

235
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm going to get killed,
just like Colonel Arata.

236
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,911
<i>Whom are you referring to, sir?</i>

237
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:32,374
<i>I caught Captain Watanabe
talking to Hiroshi Tanaka.</i>

238
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,876
<i>What were they talking about?</i>

239
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,503
<i>That's a powerful poison for rats.</i>

240
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,423
<i>It can also kill humans and other animals.</i>

241
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,549
<i>Drink it.</i>

242
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>I said drink!</i>

243
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,968
<i>That has poison.</i>

244
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,011
COMING UP

245
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,887
<i>I'll die honorably.</i>

246
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,222
<i>That's a promise.</i>

247
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,683
<i>This is the office of Colonel Yuta Saitoh.</i>

248
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,892
<i>I'll surrender.</i>

249
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,736
