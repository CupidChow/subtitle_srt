1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,460
<i>I was one of them.</i>

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,797
I was raped by his soldiers!

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>A Japanese officer invited us</i>

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>to perform at a birthday party
of one of their officials.</i>

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>This is a good opportunity.</i>

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,807
- Good day!
- Good day!

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,393
<i>Don't tell me you're one
of those guerrillas?</i>

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>Those fools do nothing
but fight against our true heroes?</i>

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>Looks like there's an attack nearby.</i>

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>Not every battle is ours to fight.</i>

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>Then what's the point
of holding these weapons?</i>

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,883
- Don't light it.
<i>- Why did you change our plan?</i>

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>I'm still the leader here
and you'll do as I say.</i>

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,767
<i>No one can make me question my beliefs!</i>

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,021
PREVIOUSLY

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>Where are you going?</i>

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,858
<i>I'm just going to use the bathroom.</i>

18
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,195
<i>Thank the heavens we met again.</i>

19
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,405
<i>I have so much to tell you, Adelina.</i>

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,657
<i>We can't talk right now.</i>

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,494
You need to leave here, save yourself.

22
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,996
<i>If we succeed, you'll be free.</i>

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,539
But if not…

24
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,130
Damn.

25
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,046
2145.

26
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,259
2145.

27
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,263
That's the telephone number
of Yuta's room.

28
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,652
That number is the only way for you
to reach me.

29
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,447
In case this plan fails.

30
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,408
2145.

31
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,745
2145.

32
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,793
2145, 2145.

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,131
- Okay.
- Correct.

34
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,801
Be safe out there.

35
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,845
You too, Teresita.

36
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,556
Until we meet again.

37
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,350
I love you very much.

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,603
I love you very much too.

39
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,737
You'll be okay.

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,781
Go.

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,621
There are bombs planted in the room!

42
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,339
Someone here wants to kill us!

43
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,842
Close all the doors!

44
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,388
And seal off the entire venue!

45
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,858
Faster!

46
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,799
No one is allowed to leave,

47
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,428
especially the Filipinos.

48
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm certain they planted the bombs.

49
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,305
Have our men search the forest.

50
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,933
The enemy might still be hiding there.

51
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,812
This might be our end.

52
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,192
They're over here!

53
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,919
We're late. They're already dead.

54
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,803
Wait! We're still alive!

55
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,763
We're Filipinos too.

56
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,224
We bring no harm,
and we're also soldiers of this nation.

57
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,892
May I know who you are?

58
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,602
What group are you from?

59
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,775
Idiot.

60
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,319
Don't you recognize me, my friend?

61
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,161
You're the idiot!

62
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,043
How can you just show up here
after you abandoned me in that…

63
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,974
You're back.

64
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,476
How are you, my friend?

65
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,411
Good thing I managed to get out.

66
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,164
But Adelina and Josefa are still inside.

67
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,755
All Filipinos must line up in front.

68
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,132
Now!

69
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,021
Stop!

70
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,981
What's going on?

71
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
Let that woman go.

72
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,777
She's with me.

73
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,914
Who among you imbeciles

74
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,750
dared to bomb this place?

75
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,804
It wasn't me, sir!

76
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,356
Let's get out of here.

77
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,067
Adelina won't make it out alive, anyway.

78
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,953
Was it you?

79
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,454
No, sir!

80
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,498
I know nothing!

81
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,416
I swear on my family's grave!

82
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,962
Well, you're about to die yourself.

83
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,299
Luis is right.

84
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,468
We need to get out of here!

85
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,514
We're not leaving
until we guarantee Adelina's safety.

86
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,375
Colonel.

87
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,544
Thank you, Captain.

88
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,046
Let's end this now.

89
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,739
Colonel.

90
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,175
Looks like Adelina's in deep trouble.

91
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,927
- That's why we need to go!
- No!

92
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,596
Get your guns ready.

93
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,182
I know a way to distract them.

94
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,725
Get your guns ready!

95
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,829
Where's your other clown friend?

96
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,167
Tell me! Where is he?

97
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,670
Find him!

98
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,840
The other clown is nowhere to be found.

99
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,969
Colonel, looks like the clown escaped.

100
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,640
You wanted to escape?

101
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,728
Were you the ones who planted the bombs?

102
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,950
Who are you?

103
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,539
Why are you outside?

104
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,959
You, come here!

105
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,794
Now!

106
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,172
Don't make me say it again!

107
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,814
Let me do it.

108
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
I want to learn how to shoot.

109
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,838
Stay right there!

110
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,966
Please don't shoot me, sir.

111
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,428
I'm not an enemy.

112
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,515
- You're Japanese?
- Yes, I am.

113
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,267
Tell us your name.

114
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,520
What's inside this cart?

115
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,564
My name is…

116
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,651
Kenjie Yoshida.

117
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm also a soldier
under Colonel Yuta Saitoh

118
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,449
of the Japanese Imperial Army.

119
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:09,872
The man inside my cart is my father.

120
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,168
He's dead and I wish
to bring him home to my family

121
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,296
with your permission.

122
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:41,028
Traitors like you
shouldn't be allowed to live!

123
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,282
Die, all of you!

124
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,868
I'll check.

125
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,245
Do not lower your guns.

126
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,720
Yoshida!

127
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,431
What happened to him?

128
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,810
My father was killed by the guerillas.

129
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,105
Those ungrateful bastards!

130
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:03,319
Sir, please let me bring
my father home to my family.

131
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,780
I want my mother to see him.

132
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,452
I admire your love for your father.

133
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,454
You may pass!

134
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,205
Be careful.

135
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,791
Thank you very much.

136
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,505
Open the gate! Let this man through!

137
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,382
Yes, sir!

138
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,062
Colonel, the enemies
have infiltrated the venue.

139
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,276
Draw your weapons!

140
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,278
Defend this building!

141
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,198
Let's go, Teresita. Hurry.

142
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,794
- Let's go.
- Come on!

143
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,068
- Let's go back inside.
- Yes, sir!

144
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,270
- Stay behind me.
- Yes, sir!

145
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,313
Let's go.

146
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,617
One, two, three, four.

147
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,954
Captain, there's one missing!

148
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,164
One of them was still alive.

149
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,208
Find that clown!

150
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,518
Captain, look at this!

151
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,105
Captain.

152
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,987
That bastard!

153
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,494
<i>Women like Teresita
are no different from our country.</i>

154
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,704
<i>Imprisoned.</i>

155
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,038
<i>Oppressed.</i>

156
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,540
Stripped of their dignity.

157
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,667
<i>Why did you help a criminal?</i>

158
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,919
<i>Was that Adelina?</i>

159
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,214
Tell me or I'll kill you!

160
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,632
<i>From this night on,</i>

161
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>our death sentences
are hanging over our heads.</i>

162
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,680
<i>Eduardo Dela Cruz isn't dead.</i>

163
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,142
<i>He's still out there
fighting alongside my wife.</i>

164
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>Where's Eduardo Dela Cruz?</i>

165
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,191
My wife, Amalia, knows where he is.

166
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,568
COMING UP
