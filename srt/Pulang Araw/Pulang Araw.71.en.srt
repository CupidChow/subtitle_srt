1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:07,173
War only brings immense suffering
and death of countless lives.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,425
You're right.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,467
I agree with you.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,678
I guess you've realized

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,972
that the Japanese
were never truly your friends.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,308
I'm beginning to despise them.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,604
Use that wrath to help save
our country, Adelina.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,692
Our guerrillas need eyes.

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,444
-Eyes?
-A spy.

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,904
Our guerillas need us.

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,615
He's my friend.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,786
He's half Japanese, half German.
And he's deaf-mute.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,540
Julio and Teresita are gone.

14
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,459
And now, you're leaving us too?

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,962
Have you ever thought
that this is all your fault?

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,341
Are you going to wait
for Teresita to be killed in front of you

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,885
before you come to your senses?

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,637
PREVIOUSLY

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,307
Do you have any women here, Ryo?

20
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,268
Not in this camp. There are no women here.

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,103
I need the list of your camps.

22
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,230
I accept your offer.

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,442
My mind is set on becoming a spy
for the guerrillas.

24
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,237
But before you begin,
we need to test you on a mission first.

25
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,990
Do we have a deaf-mute soldier
around here?

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,909
We don't have a soldier like that here!

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,495
Grenade!

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,457
I'm all right.

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,583
Let's go.

30
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,460
Filipino bastards!

31
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,503
Kill them all!

32
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,796
Make them pay!

33
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,632
Where are they going?

34
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,637
They are being called to a camp.

35
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,014
Looks like they have a mission.

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,935
But why are you out here?

37
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,773
Get inside.
I don't want to get in trouble.

38
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,650
Go.

39
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,531
Do you have any cough medicine?

40
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,493
I'm not feeling well these days.

41
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,416
Come. I'll get you some.

42
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,738
Don't move.

43
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,700
No, wait!

44
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,371
It's me. Hiroshi.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,876
Kenji.

46
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,712
Get up from there.

47
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:40,845
Sir, we're glad to have you at this camp.

48
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,724
I never thought you'd be a soldier.

49
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,392
Here.

50
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,233
We can't really refuse

51
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,403
if they asked for our service.

52
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,614
You?

53
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:05,411
How did you become
a Second Lieutenant so soon?

54
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,250
I think our colonel wants
to embarrass me in this camp

55
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,879
and put you all in danger
as your worthless leader.

56
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,132
Kenji, we'll all die together.

57
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,343
Ow! What?

58
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,595
-What?
-Keep your voice down!

59
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,974
Someone here might understand you.

60
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,894
You'll be reported to the Colonel.

61
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,942
Do I look like I care, Kenji?

62
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,487
I won't give him what he wants.

63
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,699
I'll protect this camp.

64
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,828
And I'm going to make sure
none of us die here.

65
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,959
I would like to ask permission
if I could see my husband,

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,004
and ask if he knows where my daughter is.

67
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,099
Colonel Saitoh is not here.

68
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,475
Now, get out!

69
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,981
I'm very, very good friends
with the Colonel.

70
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,149
I don't care!

71
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,236
You don't have the right
to speak his name, bitch!

72
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,323
-Get out!
-Let's go, señora.

73
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,373
My God.

74
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,924
Where is my girlfriend?

75
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,760
You won't find her.

76
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,431
I won't hesitate to kill you.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,391
Even if you kill me,

78
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,394
you won't find out anything.

79
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,689
You think I was bluffing?

80
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,107
Help…

81
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,869
I brought you some food.

82
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,041
Come.

83
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,044
Sit down, my love.

84
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,208
Lieutenant, our platoon is ready.

85
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,168
Take Lauro with you,

86
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,671
and find Eduardo Dela Cruz.

87
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:30,593
Don't return until he's either killed
or arrested, understood?

88
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,386
-Yes, sir!
-You, Filipino!

89
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,598
-Let's go!
-But what about the Colonel?

90
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:40,520
Are you going to report to him
that I told you where Eduardo is?

91
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:45,316
Of course, you will surely be rewarded.

92
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,026
That won't be necessary.

93
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,404
I just want to see
my wife and daughter again.

94
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,282
-That's all I want.
-It will be granted.

95
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,743
Now scram!

96
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,879
Where's the Colonel this time?

97
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,549
Why are you the one giving orders?

98
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:14,011
Didn't he order us
to capture Eduardo Dela Cruz?

99
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,638
And if he isn't captured…

100
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,225
We'll go after Adelina Dela Cruz,

101
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,770
and she'll be our bait
to capture her brother.

102
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,021
Yes, sir!

103
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,871
I'm ready.

104
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,584
I'm ready for my first mission.

105
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,762
Can you tell me your story, Yuta?

106
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,689
I want to know more about you.

107
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,900
About your family.

108
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,072
Your childhood.

109
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,994
Do you have any siblings?

110
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,623
Do you still have parents?

111
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,335
Let me get to know you.

112
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,225
You know, in our culture…

113
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,482
our family is what completes us.

114
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,151
Like me.

115
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,404
Like my family.

116
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,450
Especially my sister.

117
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,703
Adelina.

118
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,625
And my father. They mean the world to me.

119
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,254
What about you?

120
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,924
Who completes you?

121
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,341
Intramuros is still as beautiful as ever,
even in these times.

122
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,081
December 8, señor.

123
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,542
What's your mission?

124
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,752
Love for the Philippines.

125
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,811
This is very important.

126
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,772
-Be careful with this.
-Yes, señor.

127
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,112
This will be a big help to our guerrillas.

128
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,324
Goodbye, sir.

129
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,044
My mother…

130
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,757
She had a beautiful voice.

131
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,970
I remembered her

132
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,892
when I first heard you sing.

133
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
Where's your mother now?

134
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,610
Mother.

135
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,071
-I'm scared.
-What's wrong?

136
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:48,744
It's getting late
and Father's on his way home.

137
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:53,666
It's okay, my son.
When he's drunk or in a bad mood,

138
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,877
just hide in your room, okay?

139
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,463
Do you understand?

140
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,015
Gimo, why are you drunk again?

141
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,518
Hey, why are you hiding from me?

142
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,478
You don't want to show respect?

143
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
Come here!

144
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,319
Please, let's just eat.

145
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,742
You're the bane of my existence!

146
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,035
Mother!

147
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,831
I thought I'd be living large,
but I got nothing from you!

148
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,918
It's not my fault my parents disowned me
because I went with you!

149
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,670
If I had known you'd be like this…

150
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,089
What?

151
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:47,761
I never would have married you!

152
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,139
Did you just curse me?

153
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,725
Didn't I tell you not to speak
in your language?

154
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,184
Mother!

155
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,896
Mother!

156
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,690
Mother!

157
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,904
Mother!

158
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,449
My mother died from my father's beating.

159
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:16,624
She was killed by my worthless father…

160
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,587
who is a Filipino.

161
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,060
I was sent home by my Japanese uncle

162
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,437
to keep me away from that monster.

163
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:45,569
My mother was the only one who loved me.

164
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,700
And now, I can never see her again

165
00:15:54,328 --> 00:16:00,834
because she was killed
by someone from your kind.

166
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,381
I'm sorry to hear

167
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,635
what your poor mother had to go through.

168
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,350
-But that means you're also Filipino.
-I'm not like you!

169
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:23,023
I despise the blood of that monster.

170
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,693
But your mother was a woman too.

171
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,071
Just like the women here.

172
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:34,034
They're being beaten every day and night
by men who are just like your father.

173
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,332
How could you ignore it and let it happen?

174
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,295
Don't you feel an ounce of sympathy
for these women

175
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,841
every time they're being beaten and raped?

176
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,514
Why should I…

177
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,020
when every time they weep,

178
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,110
I remember the cries of my own mother?

179
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,408
I'll never forget that, Teresita.

180
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,872
And I don't want to forget it

181
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,251
because it is all buried in here.

182
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,257
The cries of these women

183
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,011
fuel this hatred of mine.

184
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:40,726
I want to punish every single Filipino

185
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,937
who is just like my father.

186
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,794
-Follow us!
-I didn't do anything, sir!

187
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,921
Let go of me!

188
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,633
Let go of me!

189
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,051
I'm begging you!

190
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,845
I didn't do anything wrong!

191
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,954
Hey, kid! Stop!

192
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,871
Come here.

193
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,249
I have something to ask you.

194
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,500
Hey! Stop!

195
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,969
Hey!

196
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,977
This is the place.

197
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,980
Here.

198
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,109
This is where I encountered
Eduardo's group.

199
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,154
I'm sure their camp is not far from here.

200
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,989
Find them!

201
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:17,906
Yes, sir!

202
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,503
Who…

203
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,186
This is already a dead-end.

204
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,856
Let's go!

205
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,418
Thank you, Lord.

206
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,923
Thanks for not blowing my cover, kid.

207
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,678
Don't worry. They're gone now.

208
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,764
I'm really sorry.

209
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,308
I'm in a hurry and I really need to go.

210
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,809
Adelina?

211
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,483
Is that you?

212
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,321
Who are you? Why do you know me?

213
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,366
Don't you remember me?

214
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,826
I'm Luisa.

215
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,913
I'm the daughter of your Auntie Amalia.

216
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,799
What are you doing here?

217
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,927
Why are you wandering the streets?

218
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,055
Why are you so dirty?
Where's Auntie Amalia?

219
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,139
What happened?

220
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,226
My mother's gone.

221
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,147
The Japanese took her away.

222
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,069
I don't know where she is anymore!

223
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,627
They're going to need
more weapons, Adelina.

224
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,796
Leave it to me. I'll handle it.

225
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,965
What are you doing here?

226
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,091
Go back to your room.

227
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,968
-Are we being attacked?
-No, Colonel.

228
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,179
But the women tried to escape.

229
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,265
How can you be so stupid?

230
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,519
I want you to write down
all your camps here, Ryo.

231
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,605
I can never do that, Eduardo.

232
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,193
Is this really what you want? To die here?

233
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,738
Write it down and we'll set you free.

234
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,991
Sir! They have us surrounded!

235
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,037
Adelina, forgive me.
I think I won't be seeing you again.

236
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,079
COMING UP

237
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,752
