1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,377
God Almighty.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,005
Save our country
from the Japanese invaders.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,967
Please guide our soldiers.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,137
Help them drive away the new conquerors.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,432
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,935
Give us your money and jewelry.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,812
Don't step any further. Haruka, run!

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,568
You won't succeed
with your evil plans for this country!

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,529
America will destroy you
and your demonic race!

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,156
They just keep coming.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,325
It won't be long before our country
falls into the hands of the Japanese.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,536
God, I hope not.

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,122
I don't know
what's happening to my parents.

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,209
I don't know if they've been caught.
They could be in danger.

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,421
-That's why I can't stay here any longer.
-Mr. Tanaka!

16
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,964
Mr. Tanaka, what happened to you?

17
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,675
Eduardo, Mrs. Tanaka…

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,968
Haruka, wake up!

19
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,429
Haruka! Haruka!

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,600
I really don't feel good
about this place, Ryo.

21
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,435
I have to go home.

22
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,153
Don't worry.

23
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,740
He's still breathing.

24
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,955
-Let him sleep.
-Okay.

25
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,376
I hope the Americans and Filipinos

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,963
are defeated by our army.

27
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:15,009
That is the only way we can truly get

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,470
revenge.

29
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,807
Don't say things like that. Shame on you.

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,018
I stand by what I said.

31
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,522
Once we get out of here,
I'll join our army

32
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,442
and punish every Filipino

33
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,906
and American who made us suffer.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,381
We're not merely soldiers.
We'll win this war.

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,264
The whole Japanese Imperial Army
are warriors bound by honor and duty.

36
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,728
Together, we shall overcome.

37
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,941
Together, we shall triumph!

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,696
For victory is not a mere hope,
it is our inevitable destiny!

39
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,449
Long live the Emperor!

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,494
-Long live!
-Long live!

41
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,080
-Long live!
-Long live!

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,375
-Long live!
-Long live!

43
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,760
Why are there suddenly so many flies here?

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,430
Where are they coming from?

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,910
Do you also smell that stench?

46
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,040
I think something is rotting.

47
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,669
It seems to be coming from a dead animal.

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,547
Maybe that's why flies are swarming us.

49
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,636
Maybe you knew this.

50
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
Is that right?

51
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,186
My Uncle Lauro and Auntie Amalia.

52
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,939
You brought them…

53
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,277
here yourself!

54
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,076
No, he did not…

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,453
It wasn't him.

56
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,997
We don't know anything
about what happened.

57
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,710
Get out!

58
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,171
Get out!

59
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,631
I don't want to see your face!

60
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Leave now!

61
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,186
You two, go.

62
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,105
Tasyo and I will stay here.

63
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,603
Teresita and Adelina left?

64
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,272
Where on earth did they go?

65
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,108
I'm sorry, señor.

66
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,984
They didn't say where.

67
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,195
It's dangerous outside!

68
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,451
Señor Julio, where are you going?

69
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,161
I'm going to find my daughters!

70
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,082
But what if the señora
asks me where you are?

71
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,002
Eduardo.

72
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,004
Do you think
what Mr. Tanaka said was true?

73
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,217
Uncle Lauro has his vices,
but to kill someone?

74
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,388
Do we really know our uncle?

75
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,517
Do we know how far he would go
when he's desperate for money?

76
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,902
If that's true,
then he's a monster for killing her.

77
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,823
How could he do that?

78
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,162
Eduardo.

79
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,582
What about Hiroshi?
What if he finds out about this?

80
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,085
He'll be hurt when he hears about
what happened to his mother.

81
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,214
Take care of my parents.

82
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,467
Don't abandon them.

83
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,428
Calm down.

84
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,556
Adelina, go home.

85
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,434
Be careful. I just have to go somewhere.

86
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,686
Where?

87
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,940
To Uncle Lauro's.
I need to find out the truth.

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,362
If I prove that it was really him
who killed Mrs. Tanaka,

89
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,449
I will turn him over
to the constables myself.

90
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,784
Eduardo.

91
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,704
Please. Go home.

92
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,414
Eduardo!

93
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,507
God Almighty.

94
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,800
Have mercy on us.

95
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,555
Please don't let evil and chaos
reign over our country.

96
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,942
Watanabe!

97
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,946
What are you doing here?

98
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,700
The foul odor is coming from here,
Lieutenant Colonel.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,249
There's already chaos outside,

100
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:05,086
and yet here you are slacking off.

101
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,173
Go and replace Yamamoto!

102
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,552
You'll guard our cipher machine.

103
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,013
And don't leave your post
until I order you to.

104
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,450
Beloved Emperor.

105
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,126
It's time to take over this cursed country

106
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:52,174
with the entire force
of your Japanese Imperial Army,

107
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:58,764
to destroy

108
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,517
and crush them.

109
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,938
That way,

110
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:13,029
we can finally leave this cursed place.

111
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,490
Dad?

112
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,410
-Dad!
-You made me worry!

113
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,246
It's dangerous out here,
yet you still went out?

114
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,414
Where's your sister?

115
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,210
Dad, we need to find a constable
and an ambulance.

116
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,254
Why? Did something happen to your sister?

117
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,823
My daughter is so beautiful.

118
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,285
Promise me
you won't grow up stubborn, okay?

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,997
-I promise, Mom.
-You better be.

120
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:54,088
Your father and I waited so long
to have a child.

121
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:02,304
You completed our little family.

122
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,682
Luisa.

123
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
Uncle Lauro?

124
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,396
Uncle Lauro!

125
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,314
Eduardo!

126
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,570
Eduardo, why are you here?

127
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,363
What do you need from Lauro?

128
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,907
We have something to talk about, Auntie.

129
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,827
He's not here. He hasn't come home yet.

130
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,829
What is it about?

131
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,675
My condolences, sir.

132
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,896
With all due respect,
where are you taking him?

133
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,858
To the garrison, in compliance with
the Commonwealth government's order

134
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,610
to arrest and detain all Japanese!

135
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,530
Sir, wait a moment!
His wife just passed away!

136
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,699
That's true! Have mercy on him!

137
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,036
Give him the right to mourn
and bury his wife!

138
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,164
Friends, my daughters have a point.

139
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,875
Just let him mourn this once.

140
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,086
Leave him to me,
I'll be responsible for him.

141
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,839
That's not possible, señor.
We're just following orders!

142
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,704
The war has indeed reached our country.

143
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:58,462
People are slowly losing
their compassion for one another.

144
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,262
You're right, Dad.

145
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,681
That's why I'm more worried

146
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,726
about what will happen to us
once this war conquers us.

147
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,279
Amalia!

148
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,489
Luisa!

149
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,084
-Dad!
-Come here.

150
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,169
I bought you something.

151
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,343
Thank you, Dad!

152
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,761
That's a doll, okay?

153
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,306
-That's my Christmas gift for you.
-Okay.

154
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,349
Lauro, you're being waited by…

155
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,809
You are so evil, Uncle.

156
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,186
How rude, Eduardo.

157
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,399
-What are you talking about?
-You can't fool me.

158
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,694
I know what you did
at the house of the Tanakas.

159
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,160
What's he talking about?

160
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,038
Amalia, go inside right now.

161
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,764
Eduardo, don't talk to me
like that in my house!

162
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,267
And don't accuse me in front of my family!

163
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,811
These aren't accusations,
but the absolute truth!

164
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,314
It came straight from Mr. Tanaka.

165
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,608
You and your friends!

166
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,194
You broke into their home and robbed them.

167
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,072
And as if that wasn't enough,
you even murdered Mrs. Tanaka!

168
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,823
Eduardo, shut up! That's not true!

169
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
Liar!

170
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,084
Are you going to kill me too?

171
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,263
I feel sorry for Hiroshi.

172
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,018
He'll be furious when he finds out
that it was Uncle who killed his mother.

173
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,610
All you do is bring misfortune
and trouble to this family!

174
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,903
Enough, Carmela.

175
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,906
This is not the time to blame others.

176
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,868
We have important matters to tend to.

177
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,329
We'll take care of Haruka's burial.

178
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,290
The Tanakas have been
our friends for a long time.

179
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,879
Teresita, you better go back
to see Hiroshi and tell him what happened.

180
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,132
Julio, you go with your daughter

181
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,801
while I look for help
and a funeral service

182
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,803
for Haruka's remains.

183
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:57,057
Perhaps it is better
to let Adelina talk to Hiroshi.

184
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,812
Why her? Aren't you his fiancé?

185
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,399
Didn't I tell you I was backing out?

186
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,152
There will be no wedding.

187
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm your mother. I have the last say!

188
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,954
Even if Adelina and Hiroshi
are really the ones in love?

189
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,585
Do you think that I can bear
to stand between them?

190
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,589
Teresita, stop using me to stop something
that's inevitable anyway.

191
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,008
-Stop talking, Adelina!
-Be quiet, all of you!

192
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,804
Our country is already at war.

193
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,726
Don't tell me we're at war
in this house too?

194
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,065
I'll do it.

195
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,734
I'll go see Hiroshi.

196
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,071
I'll ask Eduardo to go with me,
so I'll wait for him to come back.

197
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
As for all of you…

198
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,703
It's already so chaotic outside.

199
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,457
So I am begging you.

200
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,126
Don't bring that chaos inside.

201
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,512
You should have gone with your father.

202
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,014
What are you thinking?

203
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,141
I have made my decision, Mama.

204
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,769
This conversation is over.

205
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,533
You've already destroyed
our family before.

206
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,788
And now, you are also destroying
Teresita's future family!

207
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,417
You must be delighted

208
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,797
now that Teresita
is giving Hiroshi to you, right?

209
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,757
Because you're a flirt!

210
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,471
-You're a whore like your mother!
-Señora! Enough!

211
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,310
Insult me all you want,
but don't ever drag my mother into this.

212
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,106
Because in spite of herself,
she was still a good person.

213
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,399
Unlike you!

214
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,853
You demon! You'll do everything
for money even if it's evil!

215
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,521
Let go of me, you bastard.

216
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:55,110
I respected and understood you
for the sake of my father and Teresita.

217
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,573
But I'll no longer let you
hurt and insult me,

218
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,825
especially my mother.

219
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,619
You heard Dad.

220
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,954
The war is already here in our country.

221
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,959
People like me must learn to be brave
and stand up for ourselves

222
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,503
against arrogant
and oppressive people like you!

223
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,298
-You demon! Just for money?
-Let go of my husband!

224
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,928
-You're shameless! Shameless!
-That's enough!

225
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,389
Eduardo, enough, please!

226
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,560
Please don't hurt my dad!
Have mercy on him!

227
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,563
If only you went to school,

228
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,485
you'll see that even in our history

229
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:42,741
the uprising of the oppressed
and the poor never succeeded.

230
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,921
Because most arrogant people
like you are traitors.

231
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,384
You only think of your own reputation,
wealth, and safety.

232
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,802
And for what?

233
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,513
For you to keep your lofty position,

234
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,016
you're prepared to trample
and sacrifice poor people like me!

235
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,976
Isn't that right?

236
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,689
Forgive me, Luisa.

237
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,609
But your father committed a huge crime!

238
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,570
Don't corrupt her mind!

239
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,661
Stop denying your crime!

240
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,375
That's why you insisted
on guarding the house of the Tanakas

241
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,252
because of your bad intentions!

242
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,547
Why, Uncle? Why them?

243
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,758
Why does it have to be the home
of my friend's family?

244
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,602
People like you are useless.

245
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,289
Stop right now!

246
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,792
Enough with your accusations
or I'll call the constabulary!

247
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,878
There's no need for that.

248
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,548
I already called them before coming here.

249
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,888
There he is!

250
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,223
He killed Mrs. Tanaka!

251
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,104
Try to arrest me!

252
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,648
-Dad!
-I'll hurt my own child!

253
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,152
-Lauro, she's your daughter! Lauro!
-Stay back!

254
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:46,615
This I swear to you. I will survive.

255
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,367
But as for you?

256
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,746
You won't.

257
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,585
People like you will be the first
this war swallows whole.

258
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,125
I really don't trust
our lieutenant colonel.

259
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,086
Colonel Arata will not leave us
all of a sudden.

260
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm sorry, Hiroshi.

261
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,630
Forgive me.

262
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,050
Why are you asking
for forgiveness, Eduardo?

263
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,636
Tell me the truth. What happened?

264
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,348
If your hearts are weak,
where will you two end up?

265
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,933
Your empathy can put you at risk.

266
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,061
Are you really going to ignore me,
Teresita?

267
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,272
Do you still hate me?

268
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,151
Day and night, they keep attacking us.

269
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,778
We're truly helpless against the Japanese.

270
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,781
-Yamada, I need your help.
-With what?

271
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,952
COMING UP

272
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,141
