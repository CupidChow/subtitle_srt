1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,419
<i>Eduardo, it's your Auntie Amalia.</i>

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,337
It's a trap! Retreat!

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,840
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,926
- Take cover!
<i>- I'll stay with you and keep watch.</i>

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>Who was that? Who saved us?</i>

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,932
<i>We'll die here!</i>

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,142
Let's retreat! Now!

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,979
Sir Jorge? I didn't expect you'd help us.

9
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,022
We fight for the same cause, Eduardo.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>Even if we have different opinions.</i>

11
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>Good news, Colonel.
They've captured Hiroshi Tanaka.</i>

12
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>He's already locked up in a cell.</i>

13
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,240
Don't show him any mercy

14
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,908
for he is a traitor.

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,244
<i>Eduardo, help me.</i>

16
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,495
Auntie.

17
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,122
<i>It's still God's fault</i>

18
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>because He has abandoned us all.</i>

19
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>He's only teaching us
to be brave and strong.</i>

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,754
He wanted to show us the value

21
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,548
of our freedom
that was taken away from us.

22
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,676
How are you going to get out of this now?

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,804
How can you be so stupid?

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,723
I no longer think about myself.

25
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,892
<i>I'm just worried for Adelina.</i>

26
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,811
<i>I know our forces
are already looking for her.</i>

27
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>I'm not going with you anymore, Eduardo.</i>

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,191
I'm going back to the city.

29
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>I want to go back to Lauro.</i>

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,655
<i>I want to confront my treacherous husband.</i>

31
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,032
Just my luck.

32
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,535
Who would've thought
I'd be able to catch you here?

33
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,954
It's my good-for-nothing uncle.

34
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,041
<i>How are you, Mrs. Saitoh?</i>

35
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,001
I'm glad to see you again.

36
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,839
Uncle, put that down.

37
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,006
Hands up!

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,430
Uncle, don't you dare betray me.

39
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,307
We're still family!

40
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,893
With that bounty on your head,

41
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,148
I'd rather fill my pockets
than give a damn about you!

42
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,858
So, hands up!

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,487
You. Take the rope.

44
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,907
Tie her up. She's the only one I need.

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,826
Once you're done, I'll let you go.

46
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,785
Go!

47
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,795
Hurry up! Don't make me kill you!

48
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,175
What do you need, sir?

49
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,596
Where's my…

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,515
Where's Colonel Saitoh?

51
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,978
Does he need anything from me?

52
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,898
This is the best time

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,277
for you to escape, Mrs. Saitoh.

54
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,529
You're letting me escape?

55
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,031
Don’t you want to?

56
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:23,995
Adelina.

57
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm no longer that helpless child
you used to bully, Uncle.

58
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,920
I've changed over the years.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,380
Adelina, I'm warning you.

60
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,425
- Don't fire that gun!
- What are you going to do?

61
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,510
Slap me?

62
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,182
Leave me out in the sun?
Whip me with a broomstick?

63
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,981
You can no longer scare me, Uncle.

64
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,401
You can't kill me.

65
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,111
How can you be so sure, Uncle?

66
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,286
This war has changed me so much.

67
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,417
What I couldn't do when I was young,

68
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,797
I can do now.

69
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,926
Adelina!

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,139
Find Adelina.

71
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,977
Our Colonel has ordered
our men to arrest her.

72
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,980
Save your sister

73
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,234
and leave Manila as soon as possible.

74
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,122
Thank you, sir.

75
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,792
Thank you so much.

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,808
I'll make sure the next shot won't miss.

77
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,394
Now, down!

78
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,524
Kneel and raise your hands.

79
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
Now!

80
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,326
Wait.

81
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,122
Could you really do this to your uncle
who took care of you for all those years?

82
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,500
We raised you and your brother.

83
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,461
And you did it out of spite!

84
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,340
You never loved him.

85
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,593
You never loved me!

86
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,846
So don't lie to my face.

87
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:51,726
Because if Eduardo was here,
I'm sure you’d betray him too!

88
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,770
But I'm still your uncle.

89
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,733
I'm the husband of your Auntie Amalia,
and the father of your Cousin Luisa!

90
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,445
I think we should talk about this.

91
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,197
Talk?

92
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,199
Us, talk? How?

93
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,246
When just seconds ago,
you were about to turn me over!

94
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,504
Colonel.

95
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,507
What happened?

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,804
Have you captured Dela Cruz?

97
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,057
Forgive me, Colonel.

98
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
We failed to capture him.

99
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,231
Useless fools!

100
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,821
There were so many of you,

101
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,285
and yet you still failed?

102
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,788
Where's Amalia?

103
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
What happened to her and her child?

104
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,755
They’re not with us.
We had to leave them behind.

105
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,855
You’re a traitor to our country.

106
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,191
You’re a traitor to our family!

107
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,487
So shut up or I might do something
we'll both regret!

108
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,916
My apologies, Colonel.
But it was the woman's fault.

109
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:44,130
She warned Eduardo before we could attack.

110
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,262
My wife has escaped!

111
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,016
I'm certain that she's on her way
to Adelina right now!

112
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,393
Find them!

113
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
And don’t you dare come back

114
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,693
until you’ve found all three of them.

115
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,612
Do you understand?

116
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,947
And this time,

117
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,950
don't fail me.

118
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,827
Yes, Colonel!

119
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,680
Teresita!

120
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,561
You've disrespected me

121
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,732
far too much.

122
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,114
Once I find you, I'm going to kill you!

123
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,874
Adelina, what are we going to do with him?

124
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,877
I don’t know, Sister.

125
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,006
Why don’t you just let me go?

126
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,093
Why would we do that?
So you can turn on us again?

127
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,846
What exactly is your plan?

128
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,724
Even if you kill me,

129
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,729
I’m sure someone will eventually
turn you over to the Colonel.

130
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,650
And when that happens,
you'll be trembling in fear.

131
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,488
I’ve witnessed how savage
the Colonel can be.

132
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,782
Hiroshi!

133
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,909
Stupid woman!

134
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,000
What more could he do to surprise me?

135
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,669
A lot.

136
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,881
I know Sir Master Yuta very well.

137
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,467
We’re almost like friends,
helping each other out.

138
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,012
He protects me.

139
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,312
How is he going to protect you now, Uncle?

140
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,731
Who's going to protect you
from those Japanese soldiers?

141
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,694
Who's going to save you
from those rapists?

142
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,074
From those who continuously defile
and degrade you?

143
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,784
<i>Help!</i>

144
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,463
The Colonel can skin you alive.

145
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,926
He’ll break your bones until you cry

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,595
and beg them to kill you!

147
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,437
Before that happens,

148
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,982
I'll kill you first.

149
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,237
What are you doing there?
Our tea is ready.

150
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,169
Adelina, someone’s here.

151
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,259
Amalia.

152
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,304
Amalia, thank God you're alive.

153
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,321
My love.

154
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,740
My love, you came back!

155
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,033
Please help me.

156
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,744
Your niece wants to kill me!

157
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,996
Help me untie myself!

158
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,009
Where's Lieutenant Yamamoto?

159
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,095
Why haven’t I seen him?

160
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,682
That’s exactly what I’m wondering too.

161
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,434
Don't worry, Colonel.

162
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,189
I’ll have him found.

163
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,883
How dare you order me around

164
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,594
after choosing the enemy over me?

165
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,765
Do you think

166
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,851
I'll follow you like a fool?

167
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,356
You know the pain I’ve been through.

168
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,442
And yet, you still turned on me.

169
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,614
You surrendered me to that demon.

170
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,162
Do you know what they did to me?

171
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,378
He let his soldiers rape me again.

172
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,299
They feasted on my body like pigs.

173
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,265
And your demonic master
used our baby girl.

174
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,308
Luisa?

175
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,602
They found Luisa?

176
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,732
But Luisa is under the care of the church.

177
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,569
That’s where I hid her with Yolanda.

178
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,114
Those soldiers took her.

179
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,286
They used her as bait

180
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,542
to make me reveal Eduardo’s location.

181
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>They used us as traps…</i>

182
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,462
It's a trap!

183
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,132
- Retreat, retreat!
<i>- …to corner your brother.</i>

184
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:48,429
Eduardo and I may have survived,

185
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,100
but my poor daughter…

186
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,564
<i>Luisa?</i>

187
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,566
<i>Dearest?</i>

188
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,527
<i>My dear Luisa…</i>

189
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,238
She’s dead.

190
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,410
A stray bullet hit her.

191
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,915
My God.

192
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,251
Poor Luisa.

193
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,548
I found her wandering in the streets.

194
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,553
My mom is gone.

195
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,725
Those soldiers took her from me.

196
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,478
Please help me, Adelina.

197
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,397
Please help me find my mother.

198
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,775
Mom!

199
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,154
She always talked about you, Auntie.

200
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,452
She searched for you for so long,
and this is what happened to her?

201
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,373
She just died like that?

202
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,173
Where's my daughter’s body?

203
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,260
How dare you call her yours!

204
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,517
Why are you blaming me?
I did nothing wrong!

205
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,810
Nothing?

206
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,852
Nothing?

207
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,229
Nothing?

208
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,941
This is all your fault!

209
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,823
If you hadn’t surrendered me
to those soldiers,

210
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:35,119
they wouldn't have used Luisa.

211
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,747
She wouldn’t have been involved.

212
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,874
She wouldn’t have died!

213
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,253
You’re the one to blame!

214
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,715
You're to blame for everything!

215
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,259
You, you, you!

216
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,802
This is all your fault!

217
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,388
Please set me free.

218
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,056
I promise I’ll change.

219
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,517
I’ll no longer side with them.
Just set me free.

220
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,644
I promise I’ll change, Amalia.

221
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,441
- Amalia.
- Go to hell.

222
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,487
I wish I had never met you.

223
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,417
Amalia?

224
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,634
You deserve to die, you traitor.

225
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,471
Auntie Amalia.

226
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:36,972
Amalia…

227
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,935
Traitor!

228
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,479
Traitor!

229
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,689
- Open it.
- Yes, sir!

230
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,003
What do you need, Yuta?

231
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,297
Hiroshi Tanaka.

232
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,927
You've gotten so rebellious.

233
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,720
Let go of me!

234
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,185
How dare you attempt to take away my life?

235
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,689
I won't die in the hands
of someone like you!

236
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,376
We offer our condolences.

237
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,047
I'm so sorry for your loss.

238
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,387
Even in the short time
that I was with Luisa,

239
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,975
I felt her kindness,

240
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,435
her love,

241
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,775
and her deep longing for you.

242
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,922
My daughter's dead.

243
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,635
I no longer have the reason

244
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,598
to live.

245
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,392
Amalia.

246
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,521
Amalia, God still has a purpose for you.

247
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,859
He has a purpose for all of us
who are still alive

248
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,987
amidst this bloody war.

249
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,781
Please don’t lose hope.

250
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,535
Let us use our lives

251
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:08,957
to protect our loved ones
from the enemies.

252
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,418
I no longer have anyone.

253
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,763
Don’t you dare!

254
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,767
You’re weak!

255
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:27,995
<i>Colonel!</i>

256
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,664
Well? Have you found Teresita?

257
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:36,044
<i>No. But we've found her sister, Adelina.</i>

258
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,547
- Adelina.
- Hiroshi?

259
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,925
Stop this madness, Yuta!

260
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,428
Do you know that there's a camp here?

261
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,429
- No, sir.
- Retreat!

262
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,560
<i>Look who's back home.</i>

263
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,064
If it isn't the sister
of Eduardo Dela Cruz.

264
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,400
COMING UP

265
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,239
