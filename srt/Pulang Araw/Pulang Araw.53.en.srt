1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:06,589
They said the Japanese are abducting women
and raping then killing them.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,258
You won't get away from them!

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,509
What kind of place is this?

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,430
But how can this murderer still be alive?

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:18,226
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,569
"Kill the Borromeos.

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,613
They are traitors
who are helping the Japanese."

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,157
Why are they threatening us?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,450
If I know, they're just jealous.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,077
While we're being protected
by the Japanese,

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,704
they're out there, suffering.

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,081
You seem to be getting along
with your father, sir.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,418
And I think he's pretty fond of you.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,880
That's because he doesn't know me.

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,674
I know you feel the same way, Eduardo.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,634
My home is spacious enough for all of you.

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,595
We're staying at another person's place?

18
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,347
How is that different
from staying with the Tanakas?

19
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,975
Johnny is a Filipino like us.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,936
Wouldn't it be better
if we ask him for help?

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,689
It's time for us to move out.

22
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,316
For everyone's peace.

23
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,859
Do you also see me as an enemy?

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,904
Have you forgotten
our agreement with Eduardo?

25
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,656
We'll meet up every full moon, remember?

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,825
Promise, Teresita and I will be there.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,827
So should you and Eduardo, okay?

28
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,704
That way, we'll see each other again.

29
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,374
I'll surely miss you, Adelina.

30
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,252
-Is he one of the new recruits?
-He's Eduardo.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,837
We have a mission for you.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,631
To the new garrison
of the Japanese in the barrio.

33
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,091
-Observe them thoroughly.
-Get some rest.

34
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,885
I'll wake you when it's time to go.

35
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,300
Join your sister in your room upstairs.

36
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,094
Get some rest.

37
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,930
You have an early day tomorrow.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,975
Good night, Dad.

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,737
What about you, Carmela?

40
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,157
Aren't you going to bed?

41
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,745
How can I when I have
so much on my mind right now?

42
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,542
You don't even understand my side.

43
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm just thinking about
our family's safety.

44
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,799
Is that why you're siding
with the Japanese?

45
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:02,015
Carmela, our safety should not
depend on them.

46
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,350
There are other ways.

47
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,313
If you just have an open mind, you'll see…

48
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,943
that even our countrymen can help us.

49
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,240
Now, if you don't want to go to bed,

50
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,285
suit yourself.

51
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,315
Colonel Saitoh?

52
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,740
Can we meet tomorrow?

53
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,954
Eduardo.

54
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,249
Eduardo, wake up!

55
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,294
We're leaving.

56
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,964
It's time.

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,141
Don't let the Japanese catch you.

58
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,562
You must come back alive.

59
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,402
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,154
Let's go, Sir Lucas.

61
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,309
Where are my wonderful
husband and daughter?

62
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:16,149
They went to the theater
with Señorita Adelina.

63
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,568
Señor Julio drove them there.

64
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
Yolanda.

65
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,664
Prepare something delicious
to eat because…

66
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,668
we have an important guest coming.

67
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,217
Come on, Teresita.

68
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,137
How could you forget to bring
your costume above all else?

69
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,098
You and Papa were in such a hurry.

70
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,142
You could've just asked Dad to pick it up.

71
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,936
But he already left. Didn't you hear?

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,939
He said he had to leave right away.
What was I supposed to…

73
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,736
Fine!

74
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,155
Let's be quick
so we can return right away.

75
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,284
Sir!

76
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,838
Thank you, Teresita.

77
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,466
Let's go.

78
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,353
-Miss Sanita!
-Oh, Lauro!

79
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
Aren't you supposed to be in prison?

80
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,357
I'm a free man now.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
I'm actually going home
since my boss gave me a day off.

82
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,654
I really want to see my family.

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,949
But your family never comes home anymore.

84
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,035
Where are they?

85
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,287
Beats me.

86
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:58,459
All I know is that Amalia and Luisa
stopped coming home.

87
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,138
Let me go!

88
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,224
Let me go! Let me…

89
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,893
Let me go!

90
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,481
Let me go!

91
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,591
Hush now. Don't cry.

92
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,844
-Hush, child.
-Who are you?

93
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,472
Why are we here?

94
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,267
What is this place?

95
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,526
Hell.

96
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,447
You're in hell.

97
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,616
So prepare yourself.

98
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,367
Are you saying

99
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
you'll be living somewhere else?

100
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,872
That's correct, Colonel.

101
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:06,003
We wouldn't have this problem

102
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:10,383
if we could just get our old house back.

103
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:16,514
My apologies,
but that place is now a garrison.

104
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,270
However, I can give you a new house

105
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,523
if you're willing to accept it.

106
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,776
I wouldn't refuse that, Colonel.

107
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,320
But…

108
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,242
I'm sure my husband
is going to be a problem.

109
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,911
He won't accept that.

110
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,416
You can convince him.

111
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,669
No matter how much I try to convince him,

112
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,046
he won't listen to me.

113
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,549
To tell you the truth,

114
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,177
my husband is against you.

115
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,349
And the man he wants for Teresita
is Eduardo, a criminal.

116
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,733
He has done nothing
but spoil our daughter.

117
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,987
He even allows her
to perform in the theater!

118
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,741
That's why Teresita
is rebelling against me.

119
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,371
Forgive me, Mrs. Borromeo.

120
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,667
But there's nothing more I can do

121
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,920
about your husband and your daughter.

122
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,720
But you can do something
about this, Colonel.

123
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,973
You can help me set things right

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,770
so we can finally come to terms
about Teresita.

125
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,148
How?

126
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,372
Teresita, isn't this the car
of that demonic colonel?

127
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,417
What does he want now?

128
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,253
Follow me.

129
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,317
You want…

130
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,738
Mr. Borromeo separated from your daughter.

131
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,241
-Is that it?
-Yes, Colonel.

132
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,992
That's exactly what I want.

133
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,038
If you can find a way to get Julio
out of the picture,

134
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,708
no one will stand in the way
of my decisions.

135
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,714
I can easily arrange her marriage to you.

136
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,470
Why does it seem like

137
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:06,142
you're betraying your husband,
Mrs. Borromeo?

138
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,770
Julio and I haven't gotten along
for a long time.

139
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:17,194
Now, if you really want to marry
my daughter, Colonel…

140
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:24,243
you must keep Julio away from my family.

141
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
Just make sure…

142
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,552
Julio never goes near our family again.

143
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,023
Your mother is really wicked, Teresita.

144
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,735
Surely the colonel will agree
to her request.

145
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,034
Forgive me, Mrs. Borromeo.

146
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,121
I can't grant your request.

147
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:15,794
I don't want to get involved
in your marital crisis.

148
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,884
But I'm willing to help you,

149
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
so you can be with my daughter.

150
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,267
But not like this, Mrs. Borromeo.

151
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,395
What do you want?

152
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,399
To have your husband arrested
and imprisoned?

153
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,986
For what crime?

154
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,746
Your suggestion is an insult to my honor.

155
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,502
I will still fight for Teresita.

156
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,755
I'll do anything in my power
to protect her,

157
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:05,052
but not in a way that hurts her father.

158
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,722
She is that important to me.

159
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,272
If you have nothing more to say,

160
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,525
I must take my leave.

161
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,427
I can't believe the colonel rejected
your mother's proposal.

162
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:35,392
And I can't believe
she is willing to put our dad in prison.

163
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:43,776
Forgive me, Teresita,
but your mother is unbelievably wicked.

164
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,450
Let's be glad that the colonel
didn't even consider it.

165
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,247
I didn't know that man
would be capable of kindness.

166
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,376
I can't deny that, Teresita.

167
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,090
But let's talk about this later.

168
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,718
You wait here.

169
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,554
I'll sneak upstairs to get your things.

170
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,932
Okay, but hurry. Mama might see you.

171
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,089
Alberto.

172
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,299
Where did Eduardo go?

173
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,137
I haven't seen him since this morning.

174
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,848
They left. He's on a mission with Lucas.

175
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,812
But why didn't they bring me along?

176
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,774
You should be glad you didn't go.
It's too dangerous.

177
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,903
If they make a mistake,
they could be in danger

178
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,781
and get caught, which means…

179
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,375
Colonel, my apologies.

180
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,836
But it seems like Mrs. Borromeo

181
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,548
is not a good mother and wife.

182
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,676
You're right.

183
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,265
Mrs. Borromeo is not
a good wife and mother.

184
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,518
I don't want to associate myself
with her anymore.

185
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,441
Instead, I have a better plan in mind.

186
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,611
Would you mind sharing it with me?

187
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,034
Yamamoto, this is none of your business.

188
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,496
I'll handle it myself.

189
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,259
What are you doing?

190
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
Why are you packing your things?

191
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,517
Señor ordered me to do this
before he left earlier.

192
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,394
He told me that we're moving out.

193
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,355
Julio always gets the last say!

194
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,731
It's always him!

195
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,400
You're on your own!

196
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,777
Damn this!

197
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,042
Come on, Adelina.

198
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,961
I don't want to be late
for our performance.

199
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,966
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

200
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
Let them be, Adelina.

201
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,846
Let's just go.

202
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,446
Thank you.

203
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,619
Now I've realized

204
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,414
that in this time of war,

205
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,375
there's only one basis for loyalty.

206
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:37,342
You're a loyal Filipino
if you support your own countrymen

207
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,678
or our American allies.

208
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:45,934
But what about the friendship
between the Filipinos and the Japanese

209
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,603
before the war?

210
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,646
Comrades, it's this way.

211
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,320
I hope we can steal plenty of food.

212
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:04,244
Should that friendship be severed
and forgotten because of the war?

213
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,957
Who are you?

214
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,668
Where am I?

215
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,504
This is our house.

216
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,256
We're the ones who helped you.

217
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,800
Ryo, he's awake!

218
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,638
I'll get you a carriage
that will take you home.

219
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,859
My apologies.

220
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,320
I made a mistake.

221
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,490
Let's go over there.

222
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,752
You know him?

223
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,837
I do.

224
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,757
But he's still a friend.

225
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,682
How are we going to survive these times

226
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,852
without hurting our hearts and souls?

227
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,900
I don't know, Adelina.

228
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,737
But we're still fortunate

229
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,492
because we have the theater and vaudeville

230
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,455
as a brief escape from this harsh reality.

231
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,144
Teresita is right.

232
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,230
Because through vaudeville,

233
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,483
we can smile and laugh again.

234
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,864
It's the same for the audience.

235
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,700
In every laugh, in every smile,

236
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,786
we're able to gather new strength,

237
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,789
so that when we come out of this world,

238
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,251
we can face the ongoing war again.

239
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,920
Tell them that the sisters are here.

240
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,216
They can make their move now.

241
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,635
Understood.

242
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,539
Good job, Chinita, Morena!

243
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,249
Well done!

244
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,003
-You did great.
-Thank you very much.

245
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:05,008
You know, it means a lot
that we're able to entertain our audience.

246
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,638
It was only right to reopen this theater.

247
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,972
Am I right?

248
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,015
That's right.

249
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,395
-Marcel, your act is next.
-Good.

250
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,272
Excuse me, ladies.

251
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,400
All right.

252
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,779
Adelina, Teresita,
you may now get dressed.

253
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,782
You still have a lot to prepare
before you move, right?

254
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,702
I almost forgot about that.
Thank you, Daddy Johnny!

255
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,496
-Hurry now.
-Let's go!

256
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,135
Let's go inside!

257
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,106
This is our chance.
Looks like everyone's leaving.

258
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,692
We were only ordered to observe.

259
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,360
We need guns and food.

260
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,113
This is a good chance for us to get in.

261
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,781
Let's not delay it.

262
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:14,494
Cleanse me thoroughly…

263
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,914
COMING UP

264
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,457
Teresita!

265
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,002
Wait! Let me go!

266
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,171
Let me go! Stop the truck!

267
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,964
Not my sister!

268
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,884
Adelina!

269
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,344
Where's my daughter?

270
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,181
She was abducted by Japanese soldiers.

271
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:39,686
And we don't know where they took her.

272
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,153
