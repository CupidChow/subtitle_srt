1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,337
You know you can't escape!

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,840
Now we're all doomed!

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,259
Who started this?

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,262
It was me.
I'm the one responsible for all of this!

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:20,020
Dad already warned you
that the damn colonel

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,938
is the one behind
my sister's disappearance!

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,023
But you didn't listen!

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,694
Are you going to wait
for Teresita to be killed in front of you

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,279
before you come to your senses?

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,072
Teresita didn't do anything!

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,615
I started this!

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,453
Take this woman outside and kill her.

13
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,040
We still succeeded.

14
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,375
Manuela and Lorena were able to escape.

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,545
You were able to gain back
the devil's trust.

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,922
Before the sun rises tomorrow,
we'll go on a journey.

17
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,592
We'll check every garrison.

18
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,929
Take your positions. There are enemies.

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,057
Please, Colonel.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,934
Don't send my son away.

21
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,562
I will not grant your request.

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,065
Hiroshi is needed there.

23
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,150
And my order will stand.

24
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,904
We'll be in danger if we let him live.

25
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,238
Finish him off.

26
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,865
What are you going to do?

27
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,617
Mario, out of the way!

28
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,494
Let's go.

29
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,665
We're surrounded by monsters. Be careful.

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,834
Damn you, Colonel!

31
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,712
This is all your fault, Colonel!

32
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,671
PREVIOUSLY

33
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,628
You scoundrels!

34
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,381
Die, you bastards!

35
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,390
Damn it!

36
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,350
They have backup! Retreat!

37
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,978
Attack!

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,526
Señora?

39
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,155
Why are you still up?

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,115
It's past midnight.

41
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,450
I can't sleep.

42
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm worried about

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,000
Julio and Teresita.

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm also waiting for Mr. Tanaka.

45
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,803
I want him to accompany me
to Fort Santiago tomorrow.

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,100
Maybe he can help me
visit my husband there.

47
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,438
Mr. Tanaka is not home yet?

48
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,650
But he left early this morning.

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,278
Where could he be at this hour?

50
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,365
Hiroshi, why did they stop attacking us?

51
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,451
Maybe this is their trap.

52
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,082
Or maybe they're already gone?

53
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,046
Why would they retreat when we're losing?

54
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,926
Take him and use him as a decoy.

55
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,771
Lieutenant, the enemies retreated.

56
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,950
Someone's coming!

57
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,036
Hiroshi!

58
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,538
What are you doing? Get down!

59
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,831
Are you crazy?

60
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,543
Hiroshi.

61
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,345
Father.

62
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,015
Hiroshi.

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,696
I don't know, Yolanda.

64
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,365
Why are you asking me?

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,160
You know, just go back to sleep.

66
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,664
You're not helping me at all.

67
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,291
My apologies, madam.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,668
Francisco.

69
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,879
There are two women looking for you.

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,674
They said they're Teresita's friends.

71
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,384
They have a message for you.

72
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,303
Her friends? Let them in.

73
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,471
-Hurry up.
-Okay. Come in.

74
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:41,674
Don't tell me this traitor is still alive?

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,800
What do you--

76
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,015
What do you need from me?

77
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:04,363
You're the reason I'm in this war.

78
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,372
Because you don't want to give
your loyalty to our country.

79
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,466
Stop.

80
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,663
How could my daughter have friends
who look like that?

81
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,377
Get them out of here.
I'm not giving them anything!

82
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,672
We didn't come here to beg.

83
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,177
We came to thank your daughter

84
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,972
for helping us escape.

85
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,102
We're also here to tell you

86
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,606
about the awful things that happened
to us and to Teresita.

87
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,650
Teresita?

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,820
Where is she?

89
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,906
Señora, let's have them sit first.

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,366
Come, please.

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,703
Please sit.

92
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,717
You! And you!

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,219
Go inside and take a look!

94
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,638
-What?
-What if…

95
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,307
-Do as I say!
-Yes, sir!

96
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,113
Sir, there's no one here!

97
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,199
But this used to be their camp!

98
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,701
Damn it! They escaped!

99
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,454
How are we going to catch Eduardo now?

100
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,210
Come on! Let's go!

101
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,057
Thanks for telling us right away, Mario.

102
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,726
Let's go.

103
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,410
Looks like

104
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,789
you're really thirsty and hungry.

105
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,961
Forgive us, madam.

106
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,631
We traveled a long way.

107
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,884
We're very tired.

108
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,055
We're just really grateful to God
we found your home.

109
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,474
Don't tell me

110
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,310
you're going to stay the night?

111
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,896
We don't know you.

112
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,401
How can I be so sure
you're friends with my daughter?

113
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,987
Señora, I'm a nun.

114
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,241
I can even take you to my convent

115
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,204
just to prove we're not lying.

116
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,455
You?

117
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,544
A nun?

118
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,588
Looking like that?

119
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,924
Do you think I'm a fool?

120
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,099
My habit was taken from me.

121
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,894
-Hey!
-Let her go!

122
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,694
But it wasn't my doing, señora.

123
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,744
It was the Japanese soldiers
who abused us.

124
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,872
We were captured and imprisoned.

125
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,584
They took advantage of us every night

126
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,836
for their sick pleasure.

127
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,304
And what does my daughter
have to do with that?

128
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,141
Your daughter was one of us, señora.

129
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,770
Like us,

130
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,191
she was also captured, imprisoned,

131
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,485
and abused by them.

132
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,700
But where is she?

133
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,286
Why isn't she with you?

134
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,373
Only the two of us managed to escape.

135
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,001
Teresita and the others were left behind

136
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,754
in a big stone house
that served as a garrison

137
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,839
of the Japanese soldiers.

138
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,467
Señora, we're worried for her.

139
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,805
I'm sure Colonel Yuta
has already punished them all.

140
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,560
What does the Colonel
have to do with this?

141
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,114
I know I'm the one they're after.

142
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,953
I'm sure because my uncle
is part of the enemy.

143
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,583
They won't stop until I'm caught.

144
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,044
And I know why.

145
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,964
It's because of Colonel Saitoh.

146
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,261
They won't stop
until I'm captured or killed.

147
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,597
You won't be captured.

148
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
We'll find a new place to hide.

149
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,186
-Let's go.
-Wait, sir.

150
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,647
Where's Lucas, Mario?

151
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,649
Why isn't he with you?

152
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,903
He's dead.

153
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
Ryo died too.

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,827
Ryo?

155
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,330
How did they die?

156
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,833
Didn't I tell you to be careful, Mario?

157
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,420
The Japanese must've done it.

158
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,922
Enough of this. Let's go.

159
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,425
Only Sir Lucas was killed by them.

160
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,552
But Ryo…

161
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,933
Ryo was killed by Sir Lucas.

162
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,560
Why?

163
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,063
Why did Sir Lucas kill him?

164
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,568
Are you telling me

165
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,906
that Eduardo Dela Cruz

166
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,076
still hasn't been captured?

167
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,498
You're all useless!

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,251
That's why

169
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:19,715
I want her arrested immediately!

170
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:27,515
Adelina Dela Cruz is the only key
to Eduardo Dela Cruz's surrender.

171
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,684
Just do as I say.

172
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,062
Now!

173
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,154
It was the Colonel
who ordered Teresita's arrest.

174
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,285
He also authorized his men to arrest us.

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,831
Help!

176
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,753
-I'm Teresita.
-Teresita?

177
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,256
I saw what they did. I heard everything.

178
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,883
What you went through was terrifying.

179
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,593
Help me!

180
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,762
It was also the Colonel

181
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,975
who constantly took advantage
of your daughter

182
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,687
even though it was against her will.

183
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,946
You can't imagine the violence
we all endured

184
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,657
at the hands of the Japanese soldiers.

185
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,161
Even the rain

186
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,125
can't compare to the tears
we shed every night.

187
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,378
It was like hell.

188
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,508
We were abused by the devils
invading this land.

189
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,307
Didn't I only order you to bring Ryo
back to their garrison?

190
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
That's enough! We need to leave now!

191
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,103
Mario, speak.

192
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,107
Who ordered to kill Ryo?

193
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,151
Tell me!

194
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
Who?

195
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,084
Why, sir?

196
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,548
Why did you have Ryo killed?

197
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,594
Do you even need to ask?

198
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,097
Damn it!

199
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,646
You shouldn't have killed him.

200
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,857
I was deeply indebted to him.

201
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,026
That man was my friend!

202
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,236
A friend?

203
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,575
He's still a Japanese soldier
who could kill any one of us.

204
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,868
All of us.

205
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,205
Or any other Filipino guerilla.

206
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,499
How can you call that man a friend?

207
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,795
We're at war, Eduardo.

208
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,508
That friendship is meaningless now!

209
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:14,139
Every Japanese you know
who serves the Japanese Imperial Army

210
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,476
is no longer your friend, but your enemy.

211
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,061
They're our enemies!

212
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,355
All of them! Enemies!

213
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,815
Remember that!

214
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,571
Father, thank you very much for saving us.

215
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,075
If it weren't for you,
we'd all be dead by now.

216
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,785
Hiroshi.

217
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,664
This war is meaningless

218
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,169
now that it's being led by Colonel Saitoh.

219
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,130
Why, Father?

220
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,757
Why are you saying that?

221
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,971
Because we've been deceived
by our own people.

222
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
They did not punish Lauro.
He's still alive.

223
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,771
That bastard is still alive?

224
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,902
Are you sure, Father?

225
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,865
He was kept alive

226
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:20,748
by the Colonel
so he could find and kill Filipinos

227
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,377
who are fighting against our army.

228
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:32,468
The Colonel is especially after
your friend, Eduardo.

229
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,183
Damn it! You've got to be kidding me!

230
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,687
Eduardo.

231
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,565
Sir Jorge is right.

232
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,778
The Japanese soldiers are our enemies.

233
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,160
We witnessed how they killed
our comrades in prison.

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,876
Eduardo!

235
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,379
Including Tasyo.

236
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,303
I will never forget that.

237
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,267
Even if this war ends one day,

238
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,311
I'm certain

239
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,858
I'll still have nightmares
about it every night.

240
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,030
That's why I consider Ryo our enemy.

241
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,953
And so is your childhood friend.

242
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,288
You mean Hiroshi?

243
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,543
His people are the ones
who killed my parents.

244
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,670
That makes him our enemy too.

245
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,467
Our colonel is a liar.

246
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,598
Father, how is Adelina?

247
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,852
Did they fulfill their promise

248
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,522
not to arrest and torture my beloved?

249
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,525
By the Colonel's orders,

250
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:16,196
the Kempeitai took Adelina
and the Borromeos by force.

251
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,200
They were forced to speak and convince

252
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,786
their fellow Filipinos

253
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,543
to give their trust and loyalty to Japan.

254
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:35,924
…as we cooperate with Asia
for a progressive continent.

255
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:41,555
So I ask you. Let's cooperate with them.

256
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,476
But Julio didn't obey their orders.

257
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,356
That's why they shot him.

258
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,233
They are so evil!

259
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,111
They're killing our men,

260
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,530
-they're abducting our women…
-Dad.

261
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,158
…and they are stealing
our country from us!

262
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,622
Dad! Dad!

263
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,503
Mario.

264
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,508
Take me to their bodies.

265
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,845
We don't have time to bury them.

266
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,472
I have a plan.

267
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,807
You're right.

268
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,105
The Japanese soldiers are our enemies.

269
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,484
Including Hiroshi and Ryo.

270
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,404
So let's go.

271
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:59,758
Akio killed Mr. Borromeo?

272
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,510
He's alive,

273
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,097
but he's in prison now.

274
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,724
What about Adelina?

275
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,894
What did they do to Adelina?

276
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:17,442
I don't know where she is now.

277
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,861
They made us believe

278
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,116
what we were doing was
for the honor of Japan.

279
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,745
But we're even worse than
Americans and Spaniards.

280
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,457
The war hasn't even started yet.

281
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,086
I don't care about the war anymore!

282
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:41,842
You'll only die here,
so just come with me.

283
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,095
I'm making arrangements for a ship.

284
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,389
I'm leaving tomorrow night.

285
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,141
Hiroshi.

286
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,228
I'm going back to Japan.

287
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,653
It's right that you go back,

288
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,615
so you can report everything
the Colonel has done

289
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,909
to the Prime Minister.

290
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,582
But I can't go with you, Father.

291
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,713
Why do you want to stay here?

292
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,508
I want to find Eduardo.

293
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,636
And join forces with them.

294
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,223
What? Are you out of your mind?

295
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:35,771
Father, you raised me to be a good man.

296
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,524
Please let me do what's right.

297
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,870
The Japanese are less strict
with women like you.

298
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,915
But they will still inspect our goods,
won't they?

299
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,626
What if they find out we're carrying guns?

300
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,002
Our lives are at stake.

301
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,838
Where's Adelina? Bring her out!

302
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,256
She's no longer with us, sir!

303
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,092
I don't believe these two!

304
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,135
Search the whole house and find Adelina!

305
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,054
We already told you not to come back here!

306
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,430
This is real gold. Gold.

307
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,515
Very expensive.

308
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,682
So let us inside.

309
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,768
I need to speak to your colonel.

310
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,770
I thought of a way for us to escape.

311
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,480
Whose body is this?

312
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,981
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

313
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,733
How can you be so sure?

314
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,069
I found his cedula in his pocket.

315
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,115
Where's Teresita Borromeo?

316
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,574
COMING UP

317
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,205
