1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,420
I trusted you!

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,047
But I didn't think
you would be one to betray them.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,883
Leave. I don't want to see you right now.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,844
Hiroshi got mad at my brother?

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,263
He was probably shocked by what happened.

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,725
My only allies right now are my own kin.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,727
So I need your help.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,813
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,648
Be quiet and carry on with your plan.

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:28,445
You need to rest and gather your strength

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,657
while we wait for
our entire army to arrive!

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,242
Why are you looking for Hiroshi?

13
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,746
He said he escaped early this morning.
They haven't found him yet.

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,416
What crime did Hiroshi do,
as well as the other Japanese civilians

15
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,043
for you to treat them like criminals?

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,173
Adelina, I don't have time
to argue about an order I did not make.

17
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,800
I can't blame Hiroshi for escaping.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,554
I just don't know if I should worry
or be happy with what he did.

19
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,056
You should come with us.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,725
Today is the funeral of your boss' wife.

21
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,669
Here come the Japanese planes again.

22
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,680
No, those are American warplanes.

23
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,770
Good thing America
still hasn't abandoned us.

24
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,068
I hope they succeed.

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,612
I hope they drive away our enemies,

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,241
so we can have a peaceful Christmas.

27
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:07,437
Due to our coordinated attacks yesterday,

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,567
the strength of the American Far East
Air Force was cut in half.

29
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,990
The enemy's response was disorganized,
making it easy for us to disperse them.

30
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,329
Of the 200 aircrafts
in our Japanese strike force,

31
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,372
eight returned to our base.

32
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,293
Our superiority in the air
has been established.

33
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,798
Proceed with the land invasion.

34
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,342
Yes, sir!

35
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,309
Enough talking.

36
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,147
Let's bury the dead,
so we can all go home.

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,315
Wait!

38
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,903
Aren't you going to wait
for the priest to bless the dead?

39
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,948
The deceased wasn't Catholic or Christian,

40
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,284
so we didn't call for one.

41
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,997
We also didn't want
to offend their family's beliefs.

42
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,832
Go ahead.

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,627
Lower the casket.

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,504
Hold on!

45
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,470
Hiroshi?

46
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,270
My condolences.

47
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,317
Our sympathies to your family, Hiroshi.

48
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,004
Our condolences, son.

49
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,778
Señor.

50
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,364
Shall I call the constabulary?

51
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,950
You didn't see anything here.

52
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,119
Hiroshi isn't here.

53
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,663
Señor.

54
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,416
Shut up.

55
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,586
No one will report him.

56
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,644
Mother.

57
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,035
We're worried about you, Hiroshi.

58
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,626
They will surely punish you
if they catch you.

59
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,795
Haven't you thought about that?

60
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,716
I know you wanted to see
your mother one last time.

61
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,176
But what will you do now?

62
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,137
Where will you go? Where will you hide?

63
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,226
Papa, can we hide him?

64
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,697
Francisco, could you wait
for us by the car?

65
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,287
Where will we hide him?

66
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,838
Dad. Don't we have a farm?

67
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,592
Can we take Hiroshi there?

68
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,761
Yes, Papa. Hiroshi can stay there.

69
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,972
Adelina.

70
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,640
Don't worry about me.

71
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,643
I don't want to drag you all into this.

72
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,900
How could we not worry about you?

73
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,196
Dad, please.

74
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
Let's hide Hiroshi at the farm.

75
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,700
Adelina.

76
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,745
I don't want to leave Manila.

77
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,417
I want to find where they took
and imprisoned my father.

78
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,711
-But how will you do that?
-Where? How?

79
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,050
We have many friends.

80
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,219
Especially my father.

81
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,429
I'm sure they can help me.

82
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,019
I must go now.

83
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,525
Hiroshi.

84
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,867
Be careful.

85
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,580
Take care of yourself, all right?

86
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,807
Hiroshi, wait.

87
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,102
I want to ask you something.

88
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,903
You know I don't want
to talk to you, right?

89
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,287
How did you know

90
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,501
the Japanese would invade
and attack our country?

91
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,380
Have you forgotten?

92
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,174
When you visited me at my house.

93
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,051
Just leave now, Eduardo.

94
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,513
Go somewhere far from Manila.
It's the only way to be safe.

95
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,016
Safe from what, Hiroshi?
What are you talking about?

96
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,478
How did you know this country
would be in danger, Hiroshi?

97
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,150
Is it because of your father's friends?

98
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,195
Or is it because of Mr. Tanaka?

99
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,663
Why won't you answer me, my friend?

100
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,416
That Eduardo is dangerous.

101
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,585
Do something about him, Tanaka.

102
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,338
Kill him if you have to!

103
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,923
Dad, can you please
tell me who you truly are?

104
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,470
I work for the Japanese
Imperial Army as a spy.

105
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,349
That's why I know
they'll attack the Philippines next.

106
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,897
What secret are you
and your father hiding from us?

107
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,695
What does this war have to do
with you and your kin?

108
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,623
Would you dare betray
the people you hold precious to you?

109
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,583
We are still your friends.

110
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,419
All of us.

111
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,213
If so, then let me go.

112
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,864
Did I hear that right, son?

113
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,869
Yes, Uncle.

114
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,081
I suspect…

115
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,794
that Hiroshi's father is a spy
for the Japanese army.

116
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,430
Excuse me, but why are you crying?

117
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,184
Maybe I can help you.

118
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,227
It's my husband.

119
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,438
He's in prison right now.

120
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,318
We don't have any money to hire a lawyer.

121
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:04,909
Especially now that the Japanese
are bombing American camps.

122
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,078
I don't know anymore.

123
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,706
I don't know what to do.

124
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,753
You came to the right place to pray.

125
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,050
The Lord will not abandon you.

126
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,019
I'm sorry.

127
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:36,065
I know this is not much,
but I hope this can help you.

128
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,447
Thank you so much.

129
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,825
This will really help me.

130
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,744
Thank you.

131
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,958
Sister Manuela,
you are being called to the convent.

132
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,006
You should go home now
with your child, ma'am.

133
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,844
As you have said,
these are dangerous times.

134
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,474
And may God have mercy on you.

135
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,354
I will go ahead.

136
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,606
Thank you.

137
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,868
Mom, that woman was kind, wasn't she?

138
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,668
I hope we meet again.

139
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,677
Hello?

140
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,101
Is anyone here?

141
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,018
Hey, who are you?

142
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,691
Who are you? Why have you come here?

143
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,820
We are not enemies.

144
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,282
We don't know each other, so who are you?

145
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,039
Hiroshi?

146
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,131
Do you know each other?

147
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,551
He is Hiroshi Tanaka, lieutenant colonel.

148
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,803
He is the son of Chikara Tanaka,

149
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,222
a spy for our army.

150
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,403
If that's the case,
then you truly are an ally.

151
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,415
Eduardo suspects that Tanaka is a spy?

152
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,628
I couldn't believe it either,
but he presented me with evidence.

153
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:32,760
And you believe
that bastard's fabricated evidence?

154
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,429
But Eduardo is telling the truth, Mama.

155
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,059
How else would Hiroshi have known
the Japanese would attack our country

156
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,852
if not for his father?

157
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,149
It's a good thing
I called off our wedding.

158
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,570
I would never want to be part

159
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,197
of a family of enemies.

160
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,240
Enemies?

161
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,912
Teresita, don't you think Eduardo
is doing this to Hiroshi

162
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,331
because he wants you for himself?

163
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,375
Don't involve my brother in this.

164
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,587
He doesn't lie or badmouth other people.

165
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,839
So it's true?

166
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,176
That Hiroshi and his father
are our enemies?

167
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,178
Adelina.

168
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,306
If Eduardo's suspicion is correct,

169
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,353
shouldn't you forget
about your feelings for Hiroshi?

170
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,357
Would you still want to love an enemy?

171
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,026
Teresita, we are not sure about that.

172
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,987
Yes, we are not sure about it.

173
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,073
So can we please stop listening

174
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,910
to Eduardo's nonsensical accusations?

175
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,959
Hiroshi, what is the truth?

176
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,045
Are you really a friend,

177
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,798
or are you one of our enemies?

178
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,555
What they did to you is horrible.

179
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,142
Good thing you survived and made it here.

180
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,230
Where did you come from?

181
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,901
And how did you find out about this place?

182
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,738
Now that you know my real identity,

183
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:23,537
I want you to promise me
you won't tell anyone about this.

184
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,417
Thank you, son.

185
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,085
One more thing.

186
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,381
In case the war finally comes

187
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,177
and I am not with you and your mother,

188
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,764
I want you to know where you can find me.

189
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,894
Where, Father?

190
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,609
My father told me about this place.

191
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,282
Why is he not with you?

192
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,868
Where is Mr. Tanaka?

193
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,623
He was arrested
by the constabulary and detained.

194
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,626
But I still don't know where he is.

195
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:17,299
Just like our other countrymen
who are being arrested and detained.

196
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,597
The moment we conquer this country,

197
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,853
we will immediately free
the Japanese who have been detained.

198
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:36,610
And put to death
everyone who arrested them.

199
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:42,366
Especially the ones
who killed your mother.

200
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,701
Thank you very much.

201
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,412
But when will that happen?

202
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,333
When will my father be freed?

203
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,465
And when will my mother's death
be given justice?

204
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,301
Soon.

205
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:09,643
Especially if a civilian like you
will help our army.

206
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,398
Tanaka.

207
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:22,406
Our country needs your help and service.

208
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,408
How can I help?

209
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,661
Aren't you fluent

210
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,457
in speaking English and Tagalog?

211
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,588
You can be a translator for our army.

212
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,841
A translator?

213
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,220
You will help us build a new government.

214
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,686
A new government that will give justice
to someone like you,

215
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,859
who was stripped of his honor,
freedom, and family.

216
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,654
Do you accept, Tanaka?

217
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,491
Are you ready to serve our country

218
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
and help our army?

219
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,629
I accept your offer, Lieutenant Colonel.

220
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:27,095
In order to achieve justice for my mother.

221
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,728
I am Hiroshi Tanaka.

222
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:43,070
I'm ready to offer my life and service
for Japan's glory.

223
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,155
Long live the Emperor!

224
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,657
-Long live!
-Long live!

225
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,410
-Long live!
-Long live!

226
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,498
-Long live!
-Long live!

227
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:05,008
I never saw Hiroshi again
after his mother's funeral.

228
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,596
Meanwhile, his country kept coming
and attacking our homeland.

229
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,434
These attacks happened in December 1941

230
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,020
throughout the whole country.

231
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,776
The attacks kept happening
even on the sacred day of Christmas.

232
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,209
Japanese planes are passing by again.

233
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,670
Don't look.

234
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,880
There is nothing you can do, anyway.

235
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,802
So just sit down.

236
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,849
And let's eat our meager Christmas dinner.

237
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,193
This isn't what I expected

238
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,782
for our first Christmas dinner
since my return.

239
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
But I still wish you all…

240
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,913
a Merry Christmas.

241
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,128
Merry Christmas.

242
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,047
Merry Christmas, señora.

243
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,888
Merry Christmas, Papa.

244
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,019
Mama.

245
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:49,321
What's important is you are with us, Dad.

246
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,873
We will celebrate this event

247
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:49,464
because the whole city
of Manila will turn blood red.

248
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,674
Are we also going to die?

249
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,008
We will get through this.

250
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,385
You need to stay strong.

251
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,928
Where are the constabulary?

252
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,638
Why did they leave us here?

253
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,931
-Eduardo!
-Why, Dado?

254
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,517
The Japanese have invaded Manila.
Come with me.

255
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,768
Why? Where are we going?

256
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,061
To the mountains, to fight.

257
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,146
We must not let them conquer us!

258
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,523
You're embarrassing our family.

259
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,025
They might think
we are siding with the enemy.

260
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,904
COMING UP

261
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,614
You know what they call you? A traitor.

262
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,159
Eduardo, there's still some good
coming out of this, right?

263
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,370
Hiroshi can come out
from wherever he is hiding.

264
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,081
We will see our friend again, won't we?

265
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,718
