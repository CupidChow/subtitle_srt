1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,964
I don't believe you can defend
and protect us at all times.

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,257
Because the truth is…

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,718
just like us, you're powerless too.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,846
Justice has been served
for your mother's death.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,473
The culprit has been sentenced to death.

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,559
Thank you very much, Colonel.

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,354
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,110
I know the person mentioned by your guest.

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,194
Especially Eduardo.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,612
Don't let Teresita go.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,115
If I were you, I'd elope with her.

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,616
What is it this time?

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,870
There's a colonel
who wants to take Teresita.

14
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,456
Eduardo is on our list.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,333
Eduardo's father
is an American military officer,

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,753
so Eduardo
is a potential threat to us too.

17
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:49,507
He himself might be hiding his own father.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,092
-Teresita, you have a guest.
-Who is it?

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,970
Go to Adelina and Teresita
in their dressing room right away.

20
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,389
They have a visitor, a Japanese colonel.

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,640
I already have a fiancé…

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,562
I feel extremely uncomfortable
receiving this kind of treatment from you.

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,230
Where is that colonel?

24
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:09,903
Apologies, but I cannot heed your request
to stay away from you.

25
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,112
What's your plan?

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,781
Are you going to fight a colonel?

27
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,698
Are you insane?

28
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,951
I don't want to destroy Eduardo's honor.

29
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,286
I understand.

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,747
And I bid you farewell.

31
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,853
He works here with us.

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,899
His name is Damian.

33
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,973
Eduardo. Why are you here?

34
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,023
I heard everything you
and that Colonel talked about.

35
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,570
I knew I chose the right woman to love.

36
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,617
Thank you for your loyalty, Teresita.

37
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,535
Thank you.

38
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,467
Father.

39
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,137
You're leaving?

40
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,182
Yes.

41
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,602
I will visit the imprisoned man
who killed your mother.

42
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,068
They have already been punished, Father.

43
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,448
They are all dead.

44
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,160
Hiroshi.

45
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,497
Why do you cry like a woman?

46
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,461
Because in seeking justice for my mother,

47
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:01,134
my hands have been stained with blood.

48
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,056
Father, I have killed people.

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,725
No.

50
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,771
Death is the only fitting punishment
for them, so do not cry.

51
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
We are in the midst of war,

52
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,446
and we need strong

53
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,200
and resilient men.

54
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,578
Not weaklings.

55
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,291
I will return to my duties now.

56
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,794
Father.

57
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,006
I will leave you to it.

58
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,717
Hiroshi.

59
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,970
Be careful.

60
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,891
Make me proud!

61
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,112
I know about that colonel.

62
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,032
Hiroshi told me all about him.

63
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm glad you two have already talked.

64
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,079
So that's why you came here in a hurry.

65
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,833
Do you think that colonel
will leave you alone, Teresita?

66
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,796
I hope so.

67
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,550
I doubt that.

68
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,262
He even had the nerve
to confess his feelings to you,

69
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,473
even though he knew
you were already engaged.

70
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,726
What makes you think
that colonel will stop pursuing you,

71
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,686
especially since he knows
he's a powerful man?

72
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,108
Not to mention, your mother.

73
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,402
We know that she wants
the colonel for you, right?

74
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:49,408
Do you think she will let you
marry someone like my brother?

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,916
We also know she will never
accept Eduardo for you.

76
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,502
So no matter how much you resist,

77
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,464
she will keep looking for a man
she wants you to marry.

78
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,210
I had some food cooked.

79
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,464
I was hoping to send some to his office,

80
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,092
so he can taste Filipino food.

81
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,514
That's why I'm asking where his office is.

82
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,948
I know that, Adelina.

83
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,576
And you're right.

84
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,371
But what can I do
if that's just how my mother is?

85
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,709
There is something we can do.

86
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,963
What?

87
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,427
How about we…

88
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,973
run away together, Teresita?

89
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,393
Let's elope.

90
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,814
I'm going to marry you
so that no one takes you from me.

91
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,737
That is, if you agree.

92
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,580
But what about my work, Eduardo?

93
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,541
Vaudeville?

94
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,710
You know that Adelina and I
have always dreamed of this.

95
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,128
Don't worry, Teresita.

96
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,714
Once we're married, I won't hold you back.

97
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,758
You can still do vaudeville.

98
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,595
Well, there you go, Teresita.

99
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Unless…

100
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm not the one you see
spending the rest of your life with.

101
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,232
What are you saying, Eduardo?

102
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
Okay, fine.

103
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,287
So I can finally resolve
my issues with Mama.

104
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,955
I'm saying yes.

105
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,165
I'll elope with you.

106
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,880
Oh, Teresita.

107
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,843
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard from you.

108
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,854
Hey, wait a minute.

109
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,774
This is an unexpected turn of events.

110
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,152
When are you planning to elope?

111
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,112
As soon as possible.

112
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,405
Tonight?

113
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
Before the curfew starts?

114
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,496
Let's meet later this evening,
before seven, across Adamson, okay?

115
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,081
Wait, you're doing this tonight?

116
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,376
Why should we wait any longer?

117
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,465
Should I wait for Mama to force me
to entertain the colonel's advances?

118
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,675
I won't let that happen.

119
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,177
I'll be there.

120
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,889
I'll marry you right away,
in any church, Teresita.

121
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,317
All right, you should go now.

122
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,945
Adelina and I still have a performance
we need to do.

123
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,033
Right away.

124
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,952
So please be there, okay?

125
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,963
Eduardo!

126
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,091
Oh, Adelina,
my heart's about to burst with joy!

127
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,717
Thank you.

128
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
All right, go.
We still have a show to perform.

129
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,056
Later.

130
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,017
Go, scram.

131
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,776
It's been so long
since I saw my brother this happy.

132
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,031
Thank you so much, Teresita.

133
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,089
That is the person I mentioned, Colonel.

134
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,133
That's Eduardo Dela Cruz!

135
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,928
That man?

136
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,431
Are you sure?

137
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,558
Yes, Colonel.

138
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,101
I'm certain.

139
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,188
Adelina.

140
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,358
He works here with us.

141
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
His name is Damian.

142
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,325
That damn woman, she deceived me!

143
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,002
Should I follow him?

144
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,420
No.

145
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,843
I'll deal with that person myself.

146
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,193
I still can't believe
Teresita is going to elope with you.

147
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,280
But why don't you seem happy?

148
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,615
Did I say otherwise?

149
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,783
All I'm saying is…

150
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,496
I didn't expect you'd be able to
trick a woman like that

151
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,955
into running away with you.

152
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,584
You won't ruin this day, Tasyo.

153
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,463
My only problem now is…

154
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,424
where will I take Teresita later?

155
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,927
To be honest,

156
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,473
I don't have enough money saved up.

157
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,308
Don't worry about that.

158
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,854
I know a place you can stay in
for the meantime.

159
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
Really? Where?

160
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,192
I'll tell you later. Finish packing first.

161
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,612
Thank you very much, Tasyo.

162
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,282
You've finally done something good.

163
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,660
You're welcome, I guess.

164
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,709
Dad.

165
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,922
You two are home early.

166
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,966
I was going to pick you up.

167
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
Papa.

168
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,264
I wasn't feeling well,
so we only managed to do one show.

169
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,725
Is that so?

170
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,604
At least you don't have a fever.

171
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
But you should rest.

172
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
Hold on, I'll prepare some tea.

173
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
Oh, no, Teresita.

174
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,955
You lied to Dad?

175
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,002
Shouldn't you let him in
on your plans with Eduardo?

176
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,423
Where have you ever seen someone
tell their parents they're eloping?

177
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,884
Mama might find out.

178
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,135
And then we'll be in trouble.

179
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,887
What were you thinking?

180
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,822
Your fellow soldier brought that.

181
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,040
It's easy to win her mother over.

182
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,712
But not Teresita.

183
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, that's just how Filipino women are.

184
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,760
You need to court them.

185
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,809
Colonel.

186
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,689
Go to Captain Akio and tell him…

187
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,862
to take the necessary actions
for Eduardo Dela Cruz.

188
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,282
It will be done.

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,669
With all due respect, Colonel,

190
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,255
why don't you put Eduardo in jail,

191
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,716
so no one can come
between you and Teresita?

192
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,427
Don't be impatient.

193
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,101
It's going to happen soon.

194
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,238
Teresita, how long will you
and Eduardo be gone?

195
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,199
Maybe I should come with you.

196
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,410
Oh, would you stop that, Adelina?

197
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm sure your mother will blame me
if you go missing.

198
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,426
Oh, Adelina.

199
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,844
What do you want us to do?

200
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,930
Should Eduardo and I
drop this entire thing?

201
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,559
Then I'll be in trouble with my brother.

202
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,064
Teresita.

203
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,859
Just be careful, okay?

204
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,698
And make sure to have
a little Teresita or Eduardo soon,

205
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,409
so I'll have a niece
or nephew to look after.

206
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,495
Stop that, Adelina. You are such a rascal.

207
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,788
But you thought of that too.

208
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,711
Is everything in here now, Teresita?

209
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,838
Oh, my!

210
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,631
We have electricity now!

211
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,092
We've had for some time now.

212
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,261
Turn it off, it's a waste of power.

213
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,313
Teresita, open the door.

214
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,984
One moment, Mama!

215
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,781
Teresita, what's taking so long?

216
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,619
Coming!

217
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,705
-Teresita, come on!
-One moment, Mama!

218
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,458
-Teresita!
-Coming!

219
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,669
Mama.

220
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,967
Why are you locking yourselves up
in your room?

221
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
What are you two doing?

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,689
Please pass this around.

223
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,333
Japan has good intentions for you.

224
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,378
We are not your enemies.

225
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,630
We are your friends.

226
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,594
The Japanese really want to gain
the trust and confidence of the Filipinos.

227
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,101
Good morning, Adelina!

228
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,814
Don't be afraid of Hiroshi, Mr. Luis.

229
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,192
He's not like the other Japanese.
He's a good man.

230
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,573
That's Adelina's friend.

231
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,038
What do you think
about Adelina and her family?

232
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,041
Are they pro-Japanese?

233
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,838
Are they our allies or enemies?

234
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,259
I can't say for now.

235
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,888
But we will eventually see
their true colors.

236
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,892
Let's go.

237
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,440
Mama…

238
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,567
I was just getting dressed.

239
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,111
Do you need anything?

240
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,363
I heard you're not feeling well.

241
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,242
So drink this,
your father made it for you.

242
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,162
And go to bed early.

243
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,955
Thank you, Mama.

244
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,794
And as for you…

245
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,464
You better take care of my daughter,

246
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,593
so you'd have some use in this house.

247
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,772
Well, you heard her.
I should take care of you.

248
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,068
And what kind of excuse is that?

249
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,403
You're getting dressed?
You're wearing the same clothes!

250
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,739
I knew it!

251
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,992
She'll have my head if you and Eduardo
just suddenly disappear!

252
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,286
Be quiet.

253
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
Mama might hear you.

254
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,583
Our plans might get foiled.

255
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,711
Come on.

256
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Is the door closed?

257
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,893
Does it taste good?

258
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,947
I'm sure my relatives there
will take you in.

259
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,200
Just show them the letter I wrote,
they won't turn you away.

260
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,494
Thank you very much, Tasyo.

261
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm deeply indebted to you.

262
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,832
You don't have to thank me.

263
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,584
Go on, hurry now!

264
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,378
Teresita might get there before you do.

265
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,798
No reason to wait around now.
You've been waiting for this for so long.

266
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,553
God is still watching over me.

267
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,264
Thank you very much, Lord.

268
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,057
Until we meet again, my friend.

269
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,409
Good evening.

270
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,163
Which one of you is Eduardo Dela Cruz?

271
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,086
Why are you looking for him, sir?

272
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,339
Just answer my question!

273
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,180
Yolanda!

274
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,017
Where are Dad and Señora?

275
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,561
The señor just left.

276
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,189
And the señora is in their room.

277
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,067
You should call her.
Dinner will be ready soon.

278
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,194
All right, but Yolanda,

279
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,280
could you please make
some lemonade for Teresita?

280
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,740
-Yes, sure.
-Thank you!

281
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,032
Why are you carrying luggage?

282
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,620
Come with us.

283
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,746
We will drop Teresita off.

284
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,292
-Where?
-Just come along. We'll tell you later.

285
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,711
Go get her bags.

286
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,100
That would be me. Why, sir?

287
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,060
-Arrest him!
-Yes, sir!

288
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,772
Why?

289
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,692
What did I do?
Did I do something wrong, sir?

290
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,110
One moment, sir.

291
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,411
That's right.
Sir, you have the wrong person.

292
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,206
Maybe they just look alike,
but my friend is innocent.

293
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,041
Shut up!

294
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,628
Arrest the other one too.

295
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,797
He is our enemy too, for sure.

296
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,592
-Sir, one moment.
-Quiet!

297
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,219
What did I do wrong, sir?

298
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,225
What did we do?

299
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,602
One moment.

300
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,438
We haven't done anything wrong, sir!

301
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,995
Teresita, it's already 7:20 p.m.

302
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,163
The guards might arrest you.

303
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,081
I'm really starting to worry
about Eduardo.

304
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,708
Do you think something happened to him?

305
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,336
I'm just an employee of
Mr. Chikara Tanaka.

306
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,587
Even if you ask him,

307
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,300
you'll find out that I've never been
with my worthless father!

308
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,136
You already know it's dangerous
and you still want to go out?

309
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,055
What do you want me to do,
abandon my children?

310
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,768
Perhaps they arrested Eduardo

311
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,854
because they have questions
about his real father.

312
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,357
Are you sure about what you're saying?

313
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
Or are you just saying to calm us?

314
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:31,780
Where is your American father?

315
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,739
I don't know.

316
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:44,042
