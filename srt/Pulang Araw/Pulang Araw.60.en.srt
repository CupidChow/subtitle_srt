1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,170
You have angered our colonel, Hiroshi.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,297
He has asked me to assign you to Pampanga.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,174
I'll have you fetched later.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,761
Maybe he just wants you out of the way.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,181
I want to ask you,
please let go of the women here.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,309
What will I get in return?

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,186
What do you mean?

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,940
Your affections.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,151
I have my suspicions, Father.

10
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,111
I think I know who abducted Teresita.

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,239
-Who?
-It's Colonel Saitoh.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,950
How can I love you, Yuta?

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,495
You allow your soldiers
to abuse our women!

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,666
Are you going to deny them the reward…

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,753
for their sacrifice?

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,922
Is that how little you think of women?

17
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,426
We are humans too!
We have a heart and a soul!

18
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,844
You're so shameless!

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,763
It was his doing, Father.

20
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,682
He doesn't want me to look for Teresita,
that's why he's sending me away.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,517
He's dispatching me to the province.

22
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,519
Our colonel has lost his mind.

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,940
Your dignity is not
the only thing I can take.

24
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,777
I can take your life too.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,570
Where's my brother?

26
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,364
We need to go deep into the jungle.

27
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,366
Adelina, be careful.

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,494
I think there's a lot of snakes here.

29
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,455
We already have tons of them
back home, Marcel.

30
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,124
And they carry the flag of our enemies.

31
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,210
COMING UP

32
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,398
Thank you for helping us, Teresita.

33
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,489
No, thank you

34
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,119
for believing in me.

35
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,708
How did you end up here?

36
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,341
I was asked…

37
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,680
by my grandmother
to buy some ingredients at the store.

38
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,058
She was going to cook chicken adobo.

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,019
But…

40
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,482
on my way home,

41
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,905
I was blocked by two Japanese soldiers.

42
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,449
You! Are you one of the guerillas?

43
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
Tell us where they are right now!

44
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,412
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

45
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,457
I live here with my grandmother.
I just passed by the market.

46
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,502
You're lying!

47
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,714
-You're coming with us!
-Wait! What did I do wrong?

48
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,633
Don't resist! Come with us!

49
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,593
My grandma is waiting for me at home!

50
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,887
Grandma! Grandma!

51
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,974
Then they brought me here.

52
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,732
They've been raping me almost every night.

53
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,570
Even if I beg.

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,951
Even if I tell them I'm too young.

55
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,249
Even if I tell them
I'm not menstruating yet.

56
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,507
God Almighty.

57
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,932
How old are you, Lorena?

58
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,438
I'm only fourteen.

59
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,442
God Almighty.

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,947
I used to play with my friends outside.

61
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,991
I remember…

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,078
what my grandma used to say.

63
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,083
She warned me not to be too frisky

64
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,044
because I'm wearing a skirt.

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,257
She kept telling me to be careful because…

66
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,261
I'm still a child.

67
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,350
And now, this happened.

68
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,417
Juan, are we still far away?

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,044
We're almost there.

70
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,255
-Why don't we take a break?
-No.

71
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,132
I want to see my brother
as soon as possible.

72
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,550
Let's keep going, Juan.

73
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,478
We'll blow our cover
if we keep waiting for the Major here.

74
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,564
We don't even know when he'll return.

75
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,359
I have a bad feeling about this place.

76
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,779
Take everything we can use,

77
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,655
and then we'll leave.

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
Get to it.

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,119
Sir, how is the Major going to locate us
if he does return?

80
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,039
If we stay here,

81
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,126
we'll put our safety at risk.

82
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,047
Are we going to gamble our lives

83
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,258
just to wait for such uncertainty?

84
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,596
I'll stay here.

85
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,890
I'll wait for them.

86
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,227
I don't think that's a good idea, Eduardo.

87
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,479
Juan is my responsibility, Mario.

88
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,689
I can't just abandon that boy.

89
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,488
Were you summoned by the Colonel?

90
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,697
You can't just barge in!

91
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,539
Let her in.

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,332
Yes, sir!

93
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,762
I thought I made myself clear, Teresita.

94
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,934
I won't set those women free.

95
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,814
Even if one of them is only 14?

96
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,901
Lorena is a child.

97
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,656
Your soldiers took her innocence away!

98
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,909
Don't you have a sister?

99
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,246
Or a niece her age?

100
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,709
If they were here instead of these women,

101
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,587
can you bear to ignore their cries?

102
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,841
Where's your heart?

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,305
It's with you, Teresita.

104
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,893
You hold my heart.

105
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,105
Please, Yuta.

106
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,525
Just let Lorena go.

107
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,320
That's all I ask.

108
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,198
Set that girl free.

109
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,619
I'll set her free

110
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,831
if you grant my wish.

111
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,877
And what wish is that?

112
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,885
I want you to be my wife, Teresita.

113
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,805
Marry me.

114
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,850
Are you out of your mind?

115
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,690
I'm in love with someone else,
and I promised I'd marry him.

116
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,112
But this is the only way

117
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,074
for Lorena to be freed.

118
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,870
Are you acting selfish now?

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
This is your chance…

120
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,462
to help that poor child.

121
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,345
Teresita is just like her parents.

122
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,765
All rich people are selfish.

123
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:25,147
They pretend to help,
but it's all for show.

124
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,573
Why are you still praying?

125
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,993
Your God no longer hears you.

126
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,754
God has a reason
behind the Colonel's refusal.

127
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,717
Just admit it.

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,261
Teresita did nothing.

129
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,222
She didn't talk to Yuta!

130
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:04,854
Now, why are you silent, Teresita?

131
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,191
If you really want to help her,

132
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,612
you wouldn't think twice.

133
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:19,243
How can you marry and live with me
when I don't even love you?

134
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,791
What kind of man and soldier
are you, Colonel Yuta?

135
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:31,297
How could you hurt and force
these poor women?

136
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,011
This conversation is over, Miss Borromeo.

137
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,807
You may return to your room right now.

138
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,813
Even if Teresita spoke to him,

139
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,068
there's nothing we can do
if that's the will of the Lord.

140
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
We can only put our trust in Him.

141
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,333
How can we trust God

142
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,463
if He is allowing these men
to rape us every night?

143
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,638
Where is your God

144
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,226
whenever we are abused?

145
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,188
What about tomorrow?

146
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,400
And the day after that?

147
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:39,198
How long is your God going to abandon us?

148
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:49,959
I'll make sure that Lorena suffers
even more tonight,

149
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:56,549
so you'll hear her cry
and beg all night long.

150
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,557
Are you still human, Colonel Yuta?

151
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,101
Or are you the devil himself?

152
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,812
No.

153
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm just a good leader

154
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,780
who thinks about his soldiers

155
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,825
and provides for all their needs.

156
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,995
You should be grateful

157
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:31,750
that you won't have to suffer
like the women here.

158
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,757
Don't you dare abuse my kindness.

159
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,802
I have my limits.

160
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,685
Don't say that, Amalia.

161
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,104
You should fear God.

162
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:59,069
Insulting Him will only bring more terror
and suffering,

163
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,742
especially now that you've lost
your trust and faith in Him.

164
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,872
God is gone, Manuela!

165
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,627
He has forsaken us!

166
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,340
You need to wake up.

167
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,094
No matter how much you pray to Him,

168
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,726
He will no longer hear or listen to you!

169
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
It's time to accept

170
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,070
that He left us in this hell to die.

171
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,881
Tell Lorena to prepare herself

172
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:07,304
for the worst night of her life.

173
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,314
I'll do it.

174
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,614
What did you say?

175
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,244
I will do as you wish.

176
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,290
I'll marry you.

177
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,419
But you must free Lorena this instant.

178
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:58,564
I will only set her free
after we are married.

179
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,822
I'll immediately call for a priest.

180
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,451
Sasuke!

181
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,379
Uncle!

182
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,298
-Uncle!
-Juan.

183
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,718
Where have you been all night?

184
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,555
No, don't spank me!

185
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,182
I brought your sister with me!

186
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,017
Look!

187
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,451
-Adelina?
-Eduardo!

188
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,563
Who goes there?

189
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,818
Where's Colonel Yuta?

190
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,906
I want to speak to him right now!

191
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,499
Hello, Colonel Yuta speaking.

192
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,335
Colonel, this is Yamamoto.

193
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,881
Chikara Tanaka is here
and he wants to see you right away.

194
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:54,471
Tell that old, useless man
to come back another time.

195
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,598
But…

196
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,561
he told me he won't leave until you come.

197
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,899
Shit!

198
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,452
Thank you. Thank God you're alive.

199
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,330
Thank heavens you're safe.

200
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,379
I'm glad He brought us together again.

201
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
Thank heavens.

202
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,102
Look at you!

203
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,855
You look so dirty.

204
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,356
And…

205
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,859
You stink!

206
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,402
Do you still take a bath?

207
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,280
You're embarrassing me
in front of my comrades.

208
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,200
Try putting yourself in my shoes for once.

209
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,914
By the way,

210
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,417
why did you only take Marcel with you?

211
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,089
Where's Teresita?

212
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,136
Damn it. I look terrible.

213
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,515
One moment. Mario, find me a clean shirt.

214
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,391
-Help me, Juan.
-Help me get changed.

215
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,145
I need to wash up too.

216
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,833
Adelina, why won't you stop crying?

217
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,129
Why isn't Teresita here with you?

218
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,133
Did something happen?

219
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:06,019
Adelina, stop crying
and tell me where Teresita is.

220
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,981
What happened to her?

221
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,868
What?

222
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,079
You're getting married to Colonel Yuta?

223
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,417
I never wanted this to happen.

224
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,881
I don't want to turn my back on Eduardo.

225
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,093
He's the one I love.

226
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,722
I want to marry him and only him.

227
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,438
But I can't abandon you here, Lorena.

228
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,858
Thank you.

229
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,152
You are very kind.

230
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:01,992
But you don't need to
sacrifice yourself for my sake.

231
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,119
It's too late.

232
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,747
What's done is done.

233
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,499
Lorena.

234
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,129
Don't belittle yourself

235
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,634
because of something
you didn't want to happen.

236
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,845
I said yes to that devil…

237
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,224
to save you.

238
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,561
You don't belong here.

239
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,192
No woman deserves to be in this situation.

240
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,569
Especially you.

241
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,908
But you're putting yourself at risk.

242
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:48,205
You shouldn't be doing that for me,
I don't think it's right.

243
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,417
He set me up.

244
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,088
I thought he was going to set you free.

245
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,591
But he wants something in return.

246
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,136
I never wanted to put myself at risk.

247
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,850
Maybe there's another way
for us to escape.

248
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,154
I can sneak you out.

249
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,323
That's right.

250
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,286
I'll sneak you out
and we'll escape together.

251
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,247
But what about Manuela?

252
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,040
Auntie Amalia? The others?

253
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,420
They became my friends here.

254
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,505
I can't just leave them here.

255
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,758
Why don't we take them with us?

256
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,148
Damn it, Adelina.

257
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,819
Your tears are not the answer I want!

258
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
Where's Teresita?

259
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,783
She is gone, Eduardo.

260
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,954
They took her.

261
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,833
She was abducted by the Japanese.

262
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,591
I couldn't do anything.

263
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,094
We couldn't do anything to help her.

264
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,387
Why?

265
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,140
They took her away.

266
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,685
She's gone.

267
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,943
Forgive me, Eduardo.

268
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,364
Please forgive me, I couldn't save her.

269
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,244
No, this can't be.

270
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
Teresita.

271
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,919
Adelina.

272
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,880
Is there still a God?

273
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,634
He seems to have forsaken us.

274
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,302
God has forsaken us, Adelina.

275
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,446
Hey!

276
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,740
Hey!

277
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,742
Tanaka!

278
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,723
Apologies, sir.
But the soldiers have come back.

279
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,986
We came to pick you up.

280
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,157
We'll be taking you
to our garrison in Pampanga.

281
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,953
Where are your belongings?

282
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,582
-Let's go!
-I'm not going with you.

283
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,542
I'm not leaving.

284
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,962
I'll stay here until Adelina comes back.

285
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,970
Dad and I looked all over for her.

286
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,516
Hiroshi is helping us find her too.

287
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,270
We've asked several
Japanese officials for help,

288
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,647
but we haven't gotten anything.

289
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,524
Don't expect them to help

290
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,527
because Colonel Saitoh
won't let Teresita go!

291
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,653
You see?

292
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,364
Don't you understand?

293
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,120
-You think it was the Colonel?
-Who else could it be?

294
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,208
Who else would have her abducted?

295
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,710
No one, but that damned colonel!

296
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,925
-Eduardo…
-Which garrison is he at right now?

297
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,010
Adelina, tell me.

298
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,012
-Where?
-What are you going to do?

299
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,347
Only two things.

300
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,101
I'll save Teresita and kill Saitoh myself!

301
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,311
Where is he?

302
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,771
-Stop!
-Where?

303
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,105
That's suicide!

304
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,566
-One!
-There's no way I'll tell you!

305
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,692
-Two!
-Don't scare me!

306
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,610
Two and a half!

307
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,030
We were raised by the same mother!
You can't scare me!

308
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,115
Go to hell, you bastards!

309
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
I'll kill you all!

310
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,327
Eduardo!

311
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,635
You can send me instead,
or allow me to accompany my son.

312
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,928
What is it, Lorena?

313
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,931
-Is there something you want to say?
-Don't be afraid, Manuela.

314
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,725
The Japanese can't hurt us anymore.
We'll escape.

315
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
There's no mistake. Let's go!

316
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,562
Someone's coming. Hide.

317
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,148
It is time to arrest Adelina.

318
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,945
-Go back. Something's not right.
-No, this truck is not free to use!

319
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:18,118
All of us must live
so we can avenge our loved ones!

320
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,911
Long time no see, foolish colonel.

321
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,829
COMING UP

322
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,711
