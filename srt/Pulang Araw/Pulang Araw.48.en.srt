1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,964
From what I know, Miss Teresita
is in love with somebody else.

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,049
And I believe that man is Dela Cruz.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,176
No. I will never allow that.

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:16,808
As her mother,
I want my daughter to marry a foreigner.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,518
Someone like you, Colonel.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,480
"You went on a stroll?"

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:27,110
I will take care of Teresita
and Eduardo's sister.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,154
He's a high-ranking official.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,198
We'll have a better life.

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:38,121
Do you want us to end up like the poor
who only eat sweet potatoes and shoots?

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,998
We shouldn't eat everything

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,501
because we don't know
when our next meal will be.

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,837
That's a lot of canned goods and rice!

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,465
These are gifts from Colonel Yuta.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,009
He sent these to us.

16
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,263
He wants to formally court you,
that's why he sent over some gifts.

17
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,515
We're going to Rizal.

18
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,852
If it's no trouble,
we would like you to take us there.

19
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,731
I know a way that will spare us
from the Japanese.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,276
We need to get along with Colonel Yuta.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,988
As long as our country is at war,

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,367
we wouldn't want them
to think of us as their enemies.

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,248
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,302
I see you have
all your belongings with you.

25
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,596
Are you evacuating?

26
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,892
Living in Manila is difficult.

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,438
They arrest and kill whoever they want.

28
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,609
Thanks to God, you two escaped.

29
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,404
You're right, sir.

30
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,199
But these clothes are too hot.

31
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,327
Stop complaining.

32
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,329
This is our protection.

33
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,248
She's right, so just keep quiet.

34
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,553
I really don't want to see the Colonel.

35
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:10,231
I think I would be cheating on Eduardo
if I let Yuta court me.

36
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,068
Teresita, Eduardo will understand
your situation right now.

37
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,282
And it's not cheating
if you don't fall for the colonel.

38
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,455
Like Dad said,

39
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,792
we just need to be
friendly and accommodating.

40
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,215
Besides, he's right. We're powerless
against those ruthless Japanese.

41
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,257
Don't you agree?

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,394
I will only do this

43
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,565
for our family's safety.

44
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,331
I see Japanese soldiers, sir.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,459
Allah, please protect us.

46
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,378
No matter what happens,
don't reveal yourself.

47
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,809
Hello. Good day, sir.

48
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,205
Mr. Tanaka and Hiroshi aren't back yet.

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,001
They went to their garrison, Colonel.

50
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:02,176
I think you know I'm not here for them.

51
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,887
I do.

52
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,765
We received the items you sent over.

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,351
Thank you very much for your kindness.

54
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,021
You're welcome.

55
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,231
I really don't want to face him.

56
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,651
I can't.

57
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,282
Teresita, think of it
as performing on stage.

58
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,287
You need to entertain the audience
no matter who they are.

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,462
Fine, I'll try.

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,299
You speak Tagalog very well, Colonel.

61
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,887
I spent my youth here in the Philippines.

62
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:54,020
I was 12 when I left this country
to return to my homeland.

63
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,148
Was it to study?

64
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,865
What's wrong, Colonel?

65
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,036
I'm sorry, but was it something I said?

66
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,918
But be careful, Teresita.

67
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,215
Don't let him see
how you truly feel about him.

68
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,762
But you shouldn't give him any reason
to keep his hopes up.

69
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,561
Okay.

70
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,108
I'll remember that.

71
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,655
Let's go.

72
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,637
Good day, sir.

73
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,683
Good day, Colonel Yuta.

74
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,689
Good day to you as well, ladies.

75
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,374
-They're not armed.
-You're free to go. Move!

76
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,306
Thank goodness.

77
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,267
I almost passed out.

78
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,369
Have some refreshments, Colonel.

79
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,718
Colonel.

80
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,554
Do you think

81
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,725
the Japanese will be extending
their stay in our country?

82
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,353
Teresita,.

83
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,487
I'm just having doubts
about our friendship, Colonel.

84
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,449
Will this last?

85
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,494
Or will you be leaving our country soon?

86
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,042
I knew it.

87
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,337
He likes Teresita.

88
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,675
Oh, God.

89
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,292
Teresita.

90
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,544
Sit down.

91
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,715
Do not disrespect our guest.

92
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,179
Teresita!

93
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,157
I would like to apologize
for my daughter's discourtesy.

94
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,995
She was just taken aback.

95
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,835
On her behalf, I welcome your intention
to court my daughter.

96
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,671
But what about Teresita?

97
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,550
It doesn't matter how she feels right now.

98
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,221
You see, it is a custom in our culture

99
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,015
for a young lady
to not accept proposals right away.

100
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,812
But if you continue your good intentions,

101
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,356
I know she will eventually accept.

102
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:36,612
I wholeheartedly accept you
as my daughter's spouse.

103
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,811
Gentlemen.

104
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,480
We've arrived in Rizal.

105
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,697
Thank you very much, sir.

106
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,346
Thank you, ma'am.

107
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,682
Thank you.

108
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,392
Thank you, ma'am.

109
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,063
Take this,
so you'll have something to eat.

110
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,857
Please, take it.

111
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,692
Food is important.

112
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,903
No, thank you.

113
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,781
You've helped us enough.
We can't possibly accept this.

114
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,074
We insist.

115
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,952
We'll be offended if you refuse.

116
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,078
You wouldn't want that.

117
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,211
Thank you so much.

118
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,462
Thank you.

119
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,339
Take care, gentlemen.

120
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,717
May the Almighty Allah
guide you in your journey.

121
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,428
In God's will…

122
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,346
In God's will.

123
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,430
…let's meet again.

124
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,599
Thank you very much.

125
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,310
In God's will.

126
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,020
-Thank you very much.
-Take care.

127
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,104
Thank you so much.

128
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,733
We will never forget your kindness.

129
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,467
This is proof that we only serve one God.

130
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,182
Even though I am a Catholic,
we were helped by Muslims.

131
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,769
Whether Catholic or Muslim,

132
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,439
we're all Filipinos, sir.

133
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,157
Let's go.

134
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,639
Lieutenant. Captain. Good day to you both.

135
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,725
Good day.

136
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,812
If you're looking for the colonel,
he's not here.

137
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,606
Where's our colonel?

138
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,776
And what time will he be back?

139
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,153
I don't know.

140
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,489
What do you need from him, Hiroshi?

141
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:13,579
Don't tell me this is about your friend,
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

142
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,917
Don't get me wrong, Hiroshi.

143
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,586
But here's some friendly advice.

144
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,133
Don't mind whatever's happening
to the two ladies in your home,

145
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,347
and don't you dare attempt
to save Eduardo Dela Cruz.

146
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,976
Our colonel is a dangerous enemy.

147
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,480
You must keep your family safe.

148
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,274
Is that clear, Hiroshi?

149
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,903
Good.

150
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,073
You may go now.

151
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,003
How will we know where to go, sir?

152
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,272
Excuse me.

153
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,864
I'm just taking my chances, sir.

154
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,910
Do you know where the guerrillas are?

155
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,746
Why are you asking such questions?

156
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,625
Are you joining them
or are you Japanese spies?

157
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,502
No, sir!

158
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,589
We are looking for them
so we can join them.

159
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,137
You must know where they are
since you're from here.

160
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,022
Their camp is on that mountain.

161
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,440
Be careful.

162
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:19,038
You should not disclose our plans
to people we barely know.

163
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,625
We cannot just trust anyone,
do you understand?

164
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
Let's go.

165
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,165
Dad.

166
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,377
Do you have any idea
what your wife just did?

167
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,714
She's giving away my sister
to Colonel Saitoh.

168
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,383
That's why I didn't show up.

169
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,469
I know Carmela too well.

170
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,888
But Dad…

171
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,141
wasn't that enough of a reason
to be there?

172
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,769
You could've stopped her.

173
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,065
Dad, what is she going to do next?

174
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,651
Is she going to marry her off?

175
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,197
Is she really going to marry her off
to that despicable colonel?

176
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,991
What do you want me to do?

177
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,412
Stop the colonel
from courting your sister?

178
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,833
Do you want me to oppose?

179
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,835
For what?

180
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,380
So we'll be arrested, sent to prison,

181
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
and tortured like Eduardo?

182
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,968
Is that what you want?

183
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,096
Is that why you didn't show up?

184
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,601
Are you also agreeing to their marriage?

185
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,605
I hate to do this to your sister.

186
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,527
But what can I do against that colonel?

187
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,032
Exactly, Dad.

188
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,953
There's nothing you can do.

189
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,665
That's why you're here, doing nothing.

190
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,795
But come to think of it…

191
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,426
You abandoned us for a long time.

192
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,181
How can I expect you
to act differently from your wife,

193
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:48,812
who's willing to marry off her daughter
for our safety?

194
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,526
I'm still your father.

195
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,405
Don't talk to me that way.

196
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,158
But we need you now, Dad!

197
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,786
Teresita needs you now.

198
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,540
Just this once,
can't you be a real father to us?

199
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,673
What's wrong, sir?

200
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,741
Someone's following us.

201
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,046
Ouch!

202
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,800
Let me go. Don't you remember me?

203
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,886
My name is Juan.

204
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,433
I'm here every time
there's a show in the theater.

205
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,311
Remember my name, okay?

206
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,730
Juan?

207
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,985
I'm glad you remember me.

208
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,821
Why are you following us?

209
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,573
How did you end up here?

210
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,200
I heard everything.

211
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,662
You're going to the rebel camp,
aren't you?

212
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,748
I'm going with you.

213
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,169
A while ago, didn't you ask that farmer?

214
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
I want to join too.

215
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,634
If you want to join the rebels
and fight the Japanese,

216
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,512
I want to do the same!

217
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,889
Please take me with you.

218
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,311
Are you telling the truth, Adelina?

219
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,731
I heard the señora clearly, Teresita.

220
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,152
She was giving you away
to that damn colonel!

221
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,363
I felt so humiliated then.

222
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:51,078
And to make things worse,
Dad is letting her get away with it.

223
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,666
Merciful God.

224
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,836
Even Papa?

225
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,759
What are you talking about, child?

226
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,762
It's too dangerous here.
Just go home, Juan.

227
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,348
We're not bringing a child
to the mountains.

228
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,226
-I can't go home!
-Why not?

229
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,894
Did you run away?

230
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,439
I didn't know you were this stubborn.

231
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,276
You shouldn't be running away at your age.

232
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,905
I won't allow you to come with us,
so just go home.

233
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,116
But I don't have a place to go home to!

234
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,202
My parents are dead.

235
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,039
I saw them get killed
by Japanese soldiers.

236
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,129
They killed my mother and father.

237
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,301
I won't let them ruin my life.

238
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,971
Quickly, Adelina.

239
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,223
Pack your bags.

240
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,724
We are leaving this instant.

241
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,643
But where will we go?

242
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,396
We will follow Eduardo to the mountains.

243
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,067
I would rather die in this war

244
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,903
than let my mother marry me off to Yuta.

245
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,489
What did you say, Teresita?

246
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:22,085
There is no guarantee that Hiroshi
will be loyal like his father.

247
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,423
What kind of life awaits her
if she marries a foreign invader, señora?

248
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,842
She may live in luxury,

249
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,513
but she'll be a prisoner trapped in hell

250
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
-with the colonel!
-Shut up!

251
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,602
COMING UP

252
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:43,023
She'll just destroy
your relationship with your son.

253
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,649
Believe me.

254
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,652
She is Mrs. Panlilio, my visitor.

255
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,323
And just like you,
she's also seeking shelter for the night.

256
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,909
Can we really trust them?

257
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,961
