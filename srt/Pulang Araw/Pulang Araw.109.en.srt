1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,794
<i>I saw Eduardo.</i>

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>- How was he?
- Did you tell him we're together?</i>

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>He wanted to come with me to see you.</i>

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>But he's in the middle of a battle
right now with his troops.</i>

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,721
<i>Forgive me, Colonel.
But only death awaits us here.</i>

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>We're staying in Manila!</i>

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,891
We'll defend this city until we die!

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:21,438
Are you really going to sacrifice us
for a woman who has never loved you?

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>Kill anyone.</i>

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>If we die here,
the Americans and Filipinos will win.</i>

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>We can't allow that to happen!</i>

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>The shooting isn't over yet.
Where are you going?</i>

13
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>Adelina, I can't hide
like a coward forever.</i>

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,330
Take my gun.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,500
Use it if necessary.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>- Attack!
- Long time no see, Colonel.</i>

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>Remember me?</i>

18
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,885
PREVIOUSLY

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,512
<i>You probably thought
you would reign over this land forever.</i>

20
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,641
<i>Now, taste the wrath of the people
who will not bow down</i>

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,894
<i>or be oppressed by anyone!</i>

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,188
This is for all the suffering you caused!

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,733
For all our comrades you've killed!

24
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,530
Saitoh!

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>We need to evacuate!</i>

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>We're no longer safe here!</i>

27
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,954
<i>We have nowhere else to escape!</i>

28
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,124
<i>We're going to get shot
if we step outside!</i>

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,212
Do you remember
when we used to perform vaudeville?

30
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,506
Let's sing again, Teresita.

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,341
But this time,

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,469
we'll perform to calm everyone down.

33
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,553
Damn it.

34
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,941
There are people here.

35
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,332
My God! It's the devil!

36
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,544
I finally found my wife.

37
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,088
No wonder I couldn't find her.

38
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,551
Have you truly become a nun, my love?

39
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,345
You're alive?

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,808
Your soul should've been burning
in hell by now!

41
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,027
You're a brave woman, Adelina.

42
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,656
If there's one thing I regret, it's you.

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,663
I should've killed you long ago.

44
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,499
Even if you kill me now,

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,086
my country loathes you so!

46
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,105
I've fought in many wars, Adelina.

47
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,986
That's why I know who can kill

48
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,491
and who cannot.

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,787
Yuta!

50
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,414
Yuta, don't hurt my sister.

51
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,542
- Please.
- Get out of the way, Teresita!

52
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,710
Teresita.

53
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,463
Run for your lives.

54
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,340
- Go on without me.
- No!

55
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,509
- Teresita, just do as I say!
- I'm not leaving you here!

56
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,927
Sister, take Teresita with you!

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,638
- Get out of here!
- You're not going anywhere, Teresita!

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,725
I won't let you leave me again.

59
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,477
Manuela, save the others!

60
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,605
- Let's go!
- Me and Adelina will handle this.

61
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,815
Go!

62
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,066
- Yuta, please!
- Come here!

63
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,985
- Let them go!
- Hurry.

64
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,613
Now! Run for your lives!

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,825
Run for your lives! Run!

66
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,535
Hurry up, Yolanda!

67
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:46,995
Hurry!

68
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,507
When will you leave us alone, Yuta?

69
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,026
Get out of the way, Teresita!

70
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,153
Don't make me angry.

71
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,155
What happened, Saitoh?

72
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,782
I thought you were good at killing?

73
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,410
Why didn't you hit me?

74
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,287
Adelina.

75
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,123
Don't provoke him any further.

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,833
Put the gun down.

77
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,335
Put the gun down, my love.

78
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,464
- Spare Adelina.
- Come here.

79
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,091
- I'll go with you.
- Come closer.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,217
I'll go with you.

81
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,179
I'll go with you, I'll go with you…

82
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,393
- Manuela!
- That's enough! Please!

83
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,896
Yuta, please. I'll go with you.

84
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,607
I'm begging you. Please, no more.

85
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,150
You're a bunch of traitors!

86
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,322
Please, Yuta. I'll go with you this time.

87
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,366
Spare them. Let them go.

88
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:33,142
There is a limit to my patience.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,855
Please spare them. I'll go with you.

90
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,067
- I'll go…
- You're all traitors!

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,485
Die!

92
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,863
Adelina! Adelina! That's enough!

93
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,365
No more, Yuta!

94
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,118
Please, I'll go with you this time.

95
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,620
Please spare their lives.

96
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,415
I'll go. I'll go with you.

97
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,001
Please spare their lives.

98
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,463
- Don't kill them…
- Come with me.

99
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,257
Let's go!

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,801
Teresita, don't go with him!

101
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,804
You monster! Don't take my sister!

102
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,141
I can take care of myself, Adelina.

103
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,561
If we don't see each other again,

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,897
take care of Eduardo for me.

105
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,110
You monster!

106
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,654
You're a monster, Saitoh! You monster!

107
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,719
Stay with me, Sister.

108
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,180
We still need to live.

109
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm here. I won't leave you.

110
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>But how can we live at a time like this?</i>

111
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,742
<i>Death seemed like a sweeter surprise</i>

112
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:17,580
<i>to end all suffering, fear, and dread.</i>

113
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,799
Just please stop, Yuta!

114
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,676
You're running out of time!

115
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,223
Don't say another word,

116
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,936
unless you want me to kill you and myself.

117
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,895
Is that what you want?

118
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,857
Teresita, get away from him!

119
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,658
Juan!

120
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,823
I won't let you live this time!

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,784
Eduardo!

122
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>What meaning does life hold
in moments like these?</i>

123
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,978
<i>When dreams seem to have vanished
and are impossible to rebuild?</i>

124
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,487
<i>The world looked like a stage for death,</i>

125
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>and everyone is a lead actor
in their last scene.</i>

126
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,330
<i>In a war where there is endless sadness,</i>

127
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,458
<i>holds a tomorrow with no certainty.</i>

128
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,876
Forgive me, Adelina.

129
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,587
I don't think
we will see each other anymore.

130
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,594
<i>Embracing death is easier</i>

131
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:42,099
<i>than to live amidst
a meaningless and cruel war.</i>

132
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,563
Don't leave him there!

133
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:20,054
May God forgive you
for all the sins you've committed!

134
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,267
And may He forgive me
for what I am about to do to you.

135
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,776
Eduardo Dela Cruz.

136
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,780
Just let me go.

137
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,909
I want to see my mother.

138
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,079
She was the only one

139
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:53,170
who ever loved someone like me.

140
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,757
No one else did.

141
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,928
Only my mother.

142
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,432
You must pay
for all the vile acts you committed

143
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,475
against our women!

144
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:12,189
Especially for the lives you stole
from the Filipinos you slaughtered!

145
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,036
He's still alive, Eduardo.

146
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,250
Let me kill this man

147
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,880
for all the atrocities
he inflicted on our country.

148
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,966
Teresita.

149
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,555
Don't stain your hands.

150
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,605
For the sake of Adelina.
We need to protect her.

151
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,484
I'll handle Saitoh.

152
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:03,824
I have a far greater punishment
of death for him.

153
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,422
Be careful.

154
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,217
Take this.

155
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,177
Keep yourself safe.

156
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,763
Be careful, my love.

157
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,468
Adelina, please.

158
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,596
Just go.

159
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,932
Save yourself.

160
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,600
Get out of here.

161
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,731
I won't leave you, Sister, okay?

162
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,568
We'll just wait for the gunfire to stop,

163
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,320
then I'll take you to the hospital.

164
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,740
You can't die here.

165
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,244
You can't leave me.

166
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,038
I don't want to be alone here.

167
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,835
I'm still afraid of ghosts.

168
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,675
Despite the painful events in my life,

169
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,638
I still thank the Lord

170
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,685
because He gave me a friend
like you and Teresita.

171
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,774
Just stay strong, Sister.

172
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,571
Our lives will be peaceful
and happy once again.

173
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,243
By God's mercy.

174
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,168
<i>Despite everything, we continued to hope</i>

175
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>and pray that this war will do good.</i>

176
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,596
<i>But what good can the destruction
of an entire city bring</i>

177
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,223
<i>just to defeat the enemy?</i>

178
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>The once beautiful
and dignified city of Manila</i>

179
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:44,318
<i>became a massive graveyard
and a painful symbol of war.</i>

180
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,574
<i>With the end of the war,</i>

181
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>those who survived saw
a part of our history</i>

182
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,458
<i>that should never be repeated.</i>

183
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,567
<i>The remaining Japanese forces
surrendered to the Americans.</i>

184
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,404
<i>The exploitative and cruel empire</i>

185
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>fell under the curse
of the brutal bombings</i>

186
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</i>

187
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,122
<i>With our freedom and the liberation
of the entire Asia-Pacific</i>

188
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>from the oppressive hands of the enemy,</i>

189
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,586
<i>thousands of innocent Japanese lives
were also affected.</i>

190
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>People finally removed
the enemy's symbol across the country.</i>

191
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,637
<i>But another replaced it.</i>

192
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,182
<i>The flag of our rescuers.</i>

193
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,686
<i>We're still far away from freedom.</i>

194
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,691
<i>But we are happy that the chaos has ended.</i>

195
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,944
<i>Our suffering has been put to an end.</i>

196
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,739
<i>We can finally start again.</i>

197
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,907
Look what you did, Saitoh.

198
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,952
Your people destroyed our nation.

199
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,247
Look at what the war
has done to our people,

200
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,083
whom you stripped of honor and dignity!

201
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,962
Just kill me now.

202
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,923
- I order you!
- That won't be enough

203
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,178
for all the barbarity you've done to us.

204
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,225
You deserve a punishment
far worse than death.

205
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,732
My people!

206
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,735
Look!

207
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,032
This is the face of the enemy
who made us all suffer!

208
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,914
Uncle, Auntie Adelina is here.

209
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,167
We're truly the children of Filipina
because we both survived.

210
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,003
<i>- How about Manuela? How is she?
- She's safe, Teresita.</i>

211
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,507
As well as Tasyo and Auntie Yolanda.

212
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,508
They're all safe!

213
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,842
What about Hiroshi?

214
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,344
Did you see him?

215
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,639
<i>I waited at our meeting place last night,
but he didn't come.</i>

216
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>None of you did.</i>

217
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,517
<i>Is there any news about him?</i>

218
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
Uncle, let's just tell her.

219
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,437
<i>Is he gone?</i>

220
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
Is Hiroshi dead?

221
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,358
COMING UP

222
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:38,992
