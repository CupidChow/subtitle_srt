1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,711
<i>Eduardo Dela Cruz isn't dead!</i>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,922
<i>He's still out there
fighting alongside my wife.</i>

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,716
Let's silence them for good!

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,094
Where's Eduardo Dela Cruz?

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,472
<i>My wife, Amalia, knows where he is.</i>

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,474
<i>They're here to take you away.</i>

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>You're just like your master.</i>

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>A traitor.</i>

9
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>A devil!</i>

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Hiroshi?</i>

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

12
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,234
<i>Have you spoken with her?</i>

13
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>Saitoh has her under control.</i>

14
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,654
<i>I bring bad news.</i>

15
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,114
It's your father.

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,199
PREVIOUSLY

17
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,162
<i>The enemies have ambushed our camp.</i>

18
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,621
Who shot him?

19
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,082
Was it the Japanese?

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,252
<i>I will help you find your daughter</i>

21
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>if you tell me the whereabouts
of Eduardo Dela Cruz.</i>

22
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>Auntie Amalia has been captured.</i>

23
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>She's being forced to tell him
where he is right now.</i>

24
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>I'll tell Eduardo immediately.</i>

25
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,183
There's something you need to know.

26
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>He fought at war with Hiroshi.</i>

27
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>Dad was shot in the middle
of the encounter.</i>

28
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>Do everything you can to survive.</i>

29
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,027
I'll talk to Yuta.

30
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>Does your silence mean
you're agreeing to my condition?</i>

31
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:16,201
Just tell me where Eduardo Dela Cruz is,

32
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,411
and you'll see your daughter.

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,914
If tell you where he is,

34
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,334
are you sure you won't kill me too?

35
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,507
- Nakamura!
- Sir!

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,676
- Let the soldiers in!
- Yes, sir!

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,388
Men, come inside!

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,389
Yes, sir!

39
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,441
Still stubborn, I see.

40
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,915
What more do you want from me
when you've already taken everything?

41
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,753
I've been raped
by every single one of you.

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,340
Even if you threaten me with your power,

43
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,261
my mouth will remain shut.

44
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,181
I will never tell you where Eduardo is.

45
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,310
Go to hell.

46
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,238
- Nakamura!
- Sir!

47
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,282
I want you to bring me her daughter.

48
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,537
Scour every inch of Manila if you must.

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Yes, sir!

50
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,798
My love, I have to go.

51
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,178
Where are you going, Adelina?

52
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,973
Do you want me to come along?

53
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,099
No.

54
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:31,771
It's safer for you and me
to part ways for now.

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,112
Uncle Johnny still has some
of his clothes in his room.

56
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,863
You can use them.

57
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,743
You should leave this place
as soon as you can too.

58
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,830
It's too dangerous.

59
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,834
You might just end up fighting
two races at once.

60
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,364
Will I ever see you again?

61
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,788
I don't know.

62
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,670
Only God knows the answer to that.

63
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,175
Be careful out there, my love.

64
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,143
Until we meet again.

65
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,896
My love.

66
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,072
Until we meet again.

67
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,324
My love.

68
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,392
<i>We can't die just yet.</i>

69
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,061
Our family's waiting for us.

70
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,668
<i>Anyone can die at war.</i>

71
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,252
<i>Anyone can end up killing…</i>

72
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:58,102
<i>I will never forgive
whoever did this to him.</i>

73
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,522
<i>I'll curse him for as long as I live!</i>

74
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,076
Mr. Borromeo?

75
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,830
Forgive me, Mr. Borromeo.

76
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,874
Please forgive me. It was an accident.

77
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,792
<i>I thought you were the enemy,
Mr. Borromeo.</i>

78
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,794
Why did it have to be you?

79
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,963
I wish I could take your place.
Please forgive me.

80
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,673
<i>I'll do what's right.</i>

81
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>I'll do everything to bring you home
to Adelina, Mr. Borromeo.</i>

82
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,013
Mr. Borromeo.

83
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,477
I'm sorry I couldn't tell Adelina the
truth.

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:46,067
Please forgive me for being such a coward.

85
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,448
I don't want your daughter to hate me.

86
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,655
What are you doing sitting there?

87
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
Come eat.

88
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,617
Yuta.

89
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,620
Yuta, I need to ask for your permission.

90
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,001
And where are you going?

91
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,170
To my father.

92
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,965
He’s dead, Yuta.

93
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,426
I want to see his grave.

94
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,352
How did you know your father is dead?

95
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,616
I just got a call.

96
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,660
From who?

97
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,626
It was…

98
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,794
Who called you, Teresita?

99
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,048
It was Uncle Johnny.

100
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,805
Impossible.

101
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,143
That man is dead.

102
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,813
Now, who called you?

103
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,275
Was it Adelina?

104
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,529
Tell me the truth.

105
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,246
Let me do it.

106
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
I want to learn how to shoot.

107
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:13,714
Adelina was the clown, and you knew it.

108
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,886
That's why you stopped me
from killing her.

109
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,514
Isn't that right?

110
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,075
Good morning.

111
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,704
I just want to ask
if there are young children in your care.

112
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,374
May I ask why?

113
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,793
I'm looking for a young girl.

114
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,967
The child's name is Luisa.

115
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,220
Do you have a child like that here?

116
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,681
I don't know.

117
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,975
What do you need from her?

118
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,353
- Stop that woman!
- Yes, sir!

119
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,069
That child has done nothing wrong!

120
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,320
Have mercy on her!

121
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,739
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

122
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,867
- Bring her out!
- She's not here!

123
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,702
Or else, I'll kill you all!

124
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,663
She's not here! Believe me!

125
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,083
I don't know what you're talking about.

126
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,002
It's the truth.

127
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,504
But please.

128
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,922
I'm begging you.

129
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,258
Please let me see him.

130
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,803
You can send as many soldiers as you want.

131
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,306
Just let me see him.

132
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,266
Just let me see him.

133
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,645
I just want to pay my respects
to my father.

134
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,022
Please, Yuta.

135
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,195
Why should I let you leave?

136
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,534
So what if Mr. Borromeo is dead?

137
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,748
You're not leaving my sight.

138
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,709
You're not allowed to go anywhere!

139
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,855
Test me one more time, Teresita.

140
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,275
This is a warning.

141
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,486
Don't test my patience.

142
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,115
Or I'll line up my soldiers
outside this door.

143
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,370
They'll take turns raping you repeatedly

144
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,748
until you wish to die.

145
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,835
And that will be the end.

146
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,505
Is that what you want to happen?

147
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,138
So don't you dare fight back.

148
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,046
Damn all of you.

149
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,511
If there's truly God,

150
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,350
I hope He burns everyone of you

151
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,647
and take you all to hell
where the demons are!

152
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,317
You're all spawns of Satan himself!

153
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,861
Everyone of you will die today!

154
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,447
Every single one!

155
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,867
You will all rot in hell!

156
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,329
You're all spawns of Satan!

157
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,790
That's who you are!

158
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,003
She's here.

159
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,800
Adelina, thank heavens you're back.

160
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,303
What happened to you?

161
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,013
We've been waiting all night.

162
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,265
I don't want to talk about it.

163
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,145
I'm going to Eduardo's camp.

164
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm joining their alliance.

165
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,401
You can't do that right now, Adelina.

166
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,029
It's too dangerous for you.

167
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,114
What do you mean?

168
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>You're wanted in town, Adelina.</i>

169
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,830
They know who you are.

170
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,125
They know you were involved
in our previous mission

171
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,294
and there’s a huge bounty for your head.

172
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,131
You should hide here for now.

173
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,841
I'll stay with you.

174
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,429
We'll leave tonight
so they won't notice you.

175
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,976
Our enemies know what you did
that's why they put up a reward.

176
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,979
If only you didn't hesitate
to light up those dynamites,

177
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,981
we would've killed the Colonel by now!

178
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,400
My sister was there, Nando!

179
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,362
How could I blow up the place
when she's there?

180
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,991
Are you saying
we should've killed her too?

181
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
This is no time to argue.

182
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,831
Nando, where are you going?

183
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,082
Nando!

184
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,473
You!

185
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,766
You're Satan!

186
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,810
You can all go to hell!

187
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,272
Take your minions with you!

188
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,024
- I hope you rot in hell!
- Colonel.

189
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,278
Let's see if you'll still curse me

190
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,615
once you find out who I'm with.

191
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,622
Luisa?

192
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,752
My daughter!

193
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
- My daughter!
- Mom…

194
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:15,469
- My daughter!
- I've missed you so much.

195
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,596
Mom…

196
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,909
Didn't you say you we have a spy
inside the enemy camp?

197
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,577
A spy?

198
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,873
You and Marcel told me before
that a spy works for you.

199
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,625
Who is he?

200
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,710
We have an insider.

201
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,878
He confirmed it.

202
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,964
It's best you don't know who.

203
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,674
The less you know,

204
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,136
the better for you and for our group.

205
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,346
Why are you asking?

206
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,347
Talk to him.

207
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,684
Ask him what Saitoh did to Auntie Amalia.

208
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,814
I want you to give me the intel
before we leave tonight.

209
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,694
All right.

210
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,612
Thank you.

211
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,285
Don't cry.

212
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,829
Don't cry.

213
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,207
I promise we won't be separated again.

214
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,168
I promise.

215
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,879
Get the kid!

216
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,427
My daughter!

217
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,262
Yuta! Yuta!

218
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,598
Don't hurt my daughter!

219
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,060
Mom!

220
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,648
You know I can do much more
than that to her.

221
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,818
What do you mean?

222
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
Either you tell me where Eduardo is,

223
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,074
or your daughter will experience

224
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,994
the same things you did
at the hands of my soldiers.

225
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,040
Captain Watanabe's office.

226
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,166
Who's this?

227
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,585
What do you want?

228
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
Where are you?

229
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,713
I'll be there.

230
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,168
I know where Adelina Dela Cruz is.

231
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,754
Adelina! Manuela!

232
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,548
Run away!

233
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,966
Adelina!

234
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,342
Run away!

235
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,429
<i>I'm sorry, Hiroshi.</i>

236
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,264
But your father is dead.

237
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,267
Who gave the orders to kill him?

238
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>I think you already know who he is.</i>

239
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,771
That wench! Teresita!

240
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,523
<i>Who wouldn't lose their mind at war?</i>

241
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,692
<i>We face danger every day.</i>

242
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,695
I'm going to the city.
I dreamt of Adelina last night, Tasyo.

243
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,988
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

244
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,741
<i>I can feel that my sister is in danger.</i>

245
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,036
<i>You can no longer scare me, Uncle.</i>

246
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,329
COMING UP

247
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>- Eduardo, it's your Auntie Amalia.
- Auntie!</i>

248
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,833
It's a trap!

249
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,376
Retreat, retreat!

250
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,384
