1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,547
You have angered our colonel, Hiroshi.
He has asked me to assign you to Pampanga.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,464
He's sending me away.

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,801
He's dispatching me to the province.
He doesn't want me to look for Teresita.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,929
-Our colonel has lost his mind.
-You'll never make it out of here alive.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,348
I am just reminding you, so please.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,808
We can still escape, okay?

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,226
I'll do everything I can.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,812
Hiroshi, why are there soldiers here?

9
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,231
-What do they want?
-They're here to fetch me.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,192
I thought you promised
you wouldn't leave me?

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,113
Adelina, I'm nothing but a mere soldier

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,991
who follows the orders of his superiors.

13
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:36,703
I've already arranged for a priest
to officiate our wedding.

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:41,458
I want to wear a beautiful white dress
before I present myself to God.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,959
Can we buy one?

16
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,086
Take care of yourself.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,255
I also left a letter for you.

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,631
It's in your room.

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,884
My letter can keep you company.

20
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,844
Hiroshi, it's time.

21
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,345
I'm upset

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,266
because I don't know
what could possibly happen to them.

23
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,062
You better make sure
Hiroshi Tanaka complies.

24
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,231
And once he's gone, bring me Adelina.

25
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,526
Go back. Something's not right.

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,446
-Stop the car!
-Don't listen to him!

27
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,073
We came here to arrest her!

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,783
She's the only one I have!

29
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,661
PREVIOUSLY

30
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,710
"My name is Hiroshi Tanaka,

31
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,965
a translator from the Sendenbu unit."

32
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,598
I'm under the command
of first Lieutenant Hamada

33
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,561
and Colonel Saitoh.

34
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,398
I'm certifying

35
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,360
that the bearer of this letter,

36
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,364
Ms. Adelina Dela Cruz,

37
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,702
is a good friend

38
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,747
of my dear family

39
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,167
and our nation.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,380
I request

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,426
that you show her respect,

42
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,513
for she is one of our allies.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,142
Adelina, I'm coming for you.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,853
Wait for me.

45
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,938
This letter is useless!

46
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,025
Mr. Tanaka.

47
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,003
This letter is useless!

48
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,548
Captain!

49
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,597
-Arrest her!
-Yes, sir.

50
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,225
-Move!
-Dad.

51
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,309
Dad!

52
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,647
Dad!

53
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,159
You, take these two with you.

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,246
Hide outside and keep watch.

55
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,793
If there's danger,
whistle like a bird to alert us.

56
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,586
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,587
Let's go.

58
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,510
Alberto, take one of our men with you.

59
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,178
Find something we can eat.

60
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,098
-Right away.
-Let's go, Pablo.

61
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,102
As for the others, get some sleep.

62
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,062
Replenish your strength.

63
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,356
We're going to need it.

64
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,525
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,458
Uncle, we got you some water
from a nearby well.

66
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,461
Have a drink.

67
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,052
Thank you.

68
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,432
You should get some rest too.

69
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,434
I'm sure you're exhausted.

70
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,355
I'm okay, you guys go ahead.

71
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,775
-Come on.
-I want to be alone.

72
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,617
Captain, take pity.

73
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,954
They're truly friends of my family.

74
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,123
Why are you arresting me?

75
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,961
Hiroshi already stated in his letter
that I am his friend.

76
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,880
You know that, Akio!

77
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,342
You know we've been friends
since childhood.

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,062
There he is!

79
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,656
Wait!

80
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,160
-Sir?
-Let me in.

81
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,995
Please don't hurt us, sir.

82
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,249
-I'm not going to. Now, let me in!
-Just let him in already!

83
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,720
Follow that car!

84
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,853
Dad…

85
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,647
-Dad!
-Yamamoto.

86
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,482
-Kill him.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,734
Don't!

88
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,447
I won't go with you!

89
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,241
I haven't done anything wrong!
Now, let me go!

90
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,285
Please don't kill him.

91
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,790
He only wants to save his daughter!

92
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,459
Tanaka! Move!

93
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,376
Yamamoto!

94
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,879
Let him live.

95
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,006
Yes, sir.

96
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,008
-Dad!
-Adelina.

97
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,384
Where are you taking me?

98
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,761
-Adelina!
-Julio, it's dangerous.

99
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,846
-Adelina!
-Julio, stay.

100
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,186
What are you going to do to me?

101
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,062
-Adelina!
-What do you want?

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,231
-Dad!
-Adelina! Let her go!

103
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,525
-Let me go! Dad!
-Let her go this instant!

104
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,818
Dad!

105
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,695
Dad!

106
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,114
Don't hurt my father!

107
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,410
Dad! Don't hurt him!

108
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,996
Out of the way!

109
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,624
Stop! Don't hurt him!

110
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,251
-Please! Don't hurt him!
-Julio.

111
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,295
-Please, stop!
-My daughter…

112
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,838
Don't hurt my father!

113
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,465
I'll go with you!

114
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,509
Just don't hurt my father!

115
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,302
-Dad!
-No, Adelina!

116
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,262
Dad!

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,056
Adelina!

118
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
Let go! I said I'll go!

119
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,940
-Francisco.
-Señor.

120
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,983
Get the keys to my car.

121
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,652
We'll follow them.

122
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,321
What? You're going to follow them?

123
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,367
Hold still!

124
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,578
Get in!

125
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,343
I can't let them harm her.

126
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,053
So don't stop me, Tanaka.

127
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,555
I won't listen to you.

128
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,609
Francisco!

129
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,658
Why are you smiling, Carmela?

130
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,165
Francisco!

131
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,334
Francisco!

132
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,169
Where are the keys?

133
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,993
You and your sister are now the same.

134
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:27,293
Looks like your fate
will be one and the same too.

135
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,073
The town is still far.

136
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,453
The journey is still quite long.

137
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,961
Sing for me, Teresita.

138
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,050
I want to hear your voice again.

139
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,522
I'd like to hear you sing
the song that's dear to us Japanese.

140
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,234
It's the song…

141
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,989
I first heard from you and your sister.

142
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,628
I'll sing for you.

143
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,092
But on one condition.

144
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,469
What is it?

145
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,438
I need to use the restroom.

146
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,858
I can't hold it in anymore.

147
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,327
Teresita is finding a way
for us to escape!

148
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,538
How?

149
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
I don't know.

150
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,711
But she already left
with the Devil Colonel.

151
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,924
But there's no restroom here.

152
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,309
We can stop here. I'll be quick.

153
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,030
Stop the car.

154
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,801
Keeping your hopes up again, Lorena?

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,847
What if Teresita left you for good?

156
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,683
What if she only saved herself?

157
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,399
Do you really have to follow me, Yuta?

158
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,987
I need some privacy.

159
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,823
Besides, we're not married yet.

160
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,121
Why don't we give her a chance?

161
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,207
She might be planning something for us.

162
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,961
You're right, Manuela.

163
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,964
I believe in her.

164
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,758
She's a kind woman.

165
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,345
She really wants us to escape
and free us from this place.

166
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,932
Please trust her.

167
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,570
Good day, sir.

168
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,047
Teresita?

169
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,175
Teresita!

170
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
Thank heavens. There's still hope.

171
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,306
Freedom is within reach.

172
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,602
There's still hope.

173
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,944
Ladies, get back to work.

174
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,116
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

175
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,292
Sir, forgive me. But I'm in a hurry.

176
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
Can you please drive faster?

177
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,670
Yes.

178
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,465
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

179
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,802
With all due respect, sir.

180
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,393
But what did I do wrong?

181
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,990
Truth is, I didn't do anything.

182
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:02,498
I've been following
your laws and regulations.

183
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,002
Someone reported to us

184
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,466
that you know where Eduardo Dela Cruz is.

185
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,097
But you didn't come forward about it.

186
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,559
That means

187
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,606
you're siding with someone
from the rebels,

188
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,236
and that makes you an enemy.

189
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,202
You can't find my keys?
Where did you put them?

190
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,997
I looked but I couldn't find them, señor.

191
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,916
Carmela.

192
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,797
Where are my keys? Why can't he find them?

193
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,758
How would I know?

194
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,054
-Give me the keys.
-What about the señor?

195
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,432
Tell him you can't find them.

196
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,018
Mr. Tanaka, I can't find my keys.

197
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,315
Wait.

198
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,941
You can't catch up to her now.

199
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,569
You don't even know
where they're taking her.

200
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,155
-You'll just waste your time.
-Carmela.

201
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,285
Can you just shut up? You're not helping.

202
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,580
Mr. Tanaka, please.

203
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,248
Wait here.

204
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,417
I'll get my keys.

205
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,553
That's not true.

206
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,643
I've never met with my brother.

207
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,022
I don't know where he's hiding.

208
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,198
You're only making things
worse for yourself.

209
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,160
You'll be paying for this greatly.

210
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,791
I'd keep praying if I were you.

211
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:59,258
Perhaps your God can save you
from the punishment you're going to face.

212
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,961
Adelina?

213
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,215
Follow that car.

214
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,425
Hurry!

215
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,265
Follow that car closely.
Don't let it out of your sight.

216
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,750
Colonel, over here!

217
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,543
I found her!

218
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,546
Teresita is one of us now.

219
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,632
The Colonel has violated her, hasn't he?

220
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,800
I told you.

221
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,636
Teresita can't do anything to save us.

222
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,472
I don't think we'll ever be free.

223
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,184
-What's your purpose here?
-They are here to drop me off.

224
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,686
Let us inside.

225
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,688
-No!
-Hold still!

226
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,064
Don't hurt me!

227
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,608
Don't give me a hard time!

228
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,695
This is how ruthless our enemies are.

229
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,990
They don't just murder our men.

230
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,076
They also abuse and hurt our women.

231
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,870
Where are you going?

232
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,830
I'm going to find Colonel Saitoh.

233
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,914
COMING UP

234
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,796
