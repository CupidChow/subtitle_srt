1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,794
I think there's a lot of snakes here.

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:05,714
We already have tons of them
back home, Marcel.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,425
And they carry the flag of our enemies.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,386
I don't want to associate myself
with her anymore.

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,972
Instead, I have a better plan in mind.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,224
I have my suspicions, Father.

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,767
I think I know who abducted Teresita.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,977
It's Colonel Saitoh.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,230
He doesn't want me to look for Teresita,
that's why he's sending me away.

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,065
I think there's a lot of snakes here.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,692
Just let Lorena go.

12
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,569
That's all I ask.

13
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,238
I will only set her free

14
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,659
after we get married.

15
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,829
I brought your sister with me!

16
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,414
Look!

17
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,583
Why isn't Teresita here with you?

18
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,044
-Did something happen?
-She is gone, Eduardo.

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,213
She was abducted by the Japanese.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,715
Is there still a God?

21
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,092
God is gone, Manuela!

22
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,887
He has forsaken us!

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,473
I'll sneak you out
and we'll escape together.

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,559
But what about Manuela?
Auntie Amalia? The others?

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,936
Why don't we take them with us?

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,271
I'm not leaving.

27
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,732
I'll stay here until Adelina comes back.

28
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,817
Go to hell, you bastards!

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,985
I'll kill you all!

30
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,945
Eduardo!

31
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,740
PREVIOUSLY

32
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,494
Adelina.

33
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,916
Just tell me where Colonel Saitoh is.

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,919
I have to save her.

35
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,713
I have to save Teresita,
do you understand?

36
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,466
I have to save her. Take pity.

37
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,718
Take pity.

38
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,012
Take pity on Teresita.

39
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,056
Take pity.

40
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,309
Take pity on Teresita. Take pity on me.

41
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,312
-Take pity on me.
-Eduardo.

42
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,981
-Eduardo--
-Where is he?

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,485
-Where is he?
-Eduardo, think this through!

44
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,446
I've already lost Teresita.

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,198
I can't lose you too!

46
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,410
I can't, Eduardo!

47
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,082
-He's at Fort Santiago.
-Marcel!

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,670
That's where that bastard is.

49
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,090
You're not going there. Eduardo!

50
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,387
Eduardo…

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,931
Don't let anger
get the best of you, Eduardo.

52
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,349
Out of my way.

53
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,352
-You'll only get yourself in trouble!
-Listen to them, Eduardo!

54
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,021
-Eduardo.
-Please!

55
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,106
-Eduardo.
-Let me go!

56
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,399
-Eduardo!
-Eduardo.

57
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,988
Do you know what the Japanese do
to the women they abduct?

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,783
They violate them!

59
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,369
They destroy their dignity!

60
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,166
They rape them!

61
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,918
They rape them!

62
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,629
You hear me?

63
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,966
You hear me?

64
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,306
I've protected her for so long.

65
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,064
I've loved her ever since I was young.

66
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,442
She…

67
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,575
gives me hope whenever I see her laugh.

68
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,419
She's the first and only woman I've loved
aside from you and our mother!

69
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,548
So how can I just sit here and do nothing?

70
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,468
I won't!

71
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,138
Let me through.

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,599
-Let me…
-I won't let you.

73
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,520
And you'll obey because I'm still
the second-in-command of our group.

74
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,574
Colonel.

75
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,704
Why do you keep bothering me?

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
What do you want now?

77
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,922
Please, Colonel. Don't send my son away.

78
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,634
Don't take him to a far-off place.

79
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,220
I don't want him to leave.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:09,892
I ask this in return for my loyalty
to our army.

81
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,145
Mr. Tanaka.

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,064
I will not grant your request.

83
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,820
Hiroshi is needed there.

84
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,034
And my order will stand.

85
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,953
You're dismissed.

86
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,290
You can send me instead,

87
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:36,085
or allow me to accompany my son.

88
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,295
No!

89
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:38,963
Get out!

90
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,507
Forgive me, Colonel.

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,887
But I won't leave

92
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,185
until you grant my request.

93
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,325
Colonel.

94
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,703
No matter how much you beat me,

95
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:17,126
I won't leave until you grant my request.

96
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,010
-Forgive me.
-Eduardo, will you please listen?

97
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,763
Think about your own safety!

98
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,557
Eduardo, let's talk about this.

99
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
Forgive me, sir.

100
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,394
But I’ve made up my mind. Out of my way.

101
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,271
-We're only thinking of your safety!
-Eduardo!

102
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,564
-Eduardo!
-Eduardo!

103
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,317
-Eduardo.
-Eduardo, please.

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,278
-Eduardo!
-Why are you so stubborn?

105
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,739
Will you please just listen?

106
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,908
-Eduardo…
-Eduardo, calm down!

107
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,076
-Eduardo!
-Calm down.

108
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,536
-Teresita needs me.
-Eduardo.

109
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,495
I know what I'm doing!

110
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,996
-Calm down.
-Let me through.

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,956
-Let me through!
-Eduardo!

112
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,999
-I said let me go!
-Eduardo!

113
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,334
Hold him!

114
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,335
Eduargo!

115
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,256
-Hold him!
-Let me go!

116
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,175
The rope! Give me the rope!

117
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,431
-Enough, Eduardo!
-Teresita, I'm coming for you!

118
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,182
Let me go!

119
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,934
Bastards!

120
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,062
You fools don't understand!

121
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,565
-Eduardo!
-Teresita!

122
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,192
Teresita!

123
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,154
Colonel.

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,284
Please forgive me,
but please grant me this request.

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,662
I'll take it

126
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:43,546
in exchange for my loyalty and service.

127
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,343
I can easily destroy your reputation.

128
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:56,893
I can say to everyone
that you're a spy and a traitor

129
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,063
serving both sides.

130
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,068
A man of pure evil.

131
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,404
He's a parasite in our army and country.

132
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,031
It's Colonel Saitoh.

133
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,534
He's nothing but a monster in our army!

134
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,624
We…

135
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:29,967
once saw ourselves as liberators.

136
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,266
But now…

137
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,442
What have we become, sir?

138
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,658
Get out.

139
00:08:55,826 --> 00:09:00,122
Or I'll kill you.

140
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,078
That stupid old man.

141
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,625
Did he really think
he could just disobey me?

142
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,128
Colonel.

143
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,505
If I may,

144
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,134
Mr. Tanaka's concern
is very understandable.

145
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,929
No parent would want to be separated

146
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,808
from their child at a time like this.

147
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,271
Has Hiroshi Tanaka left?

148
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,273
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,736
Captain Akio has informed him
of the transfer.

150
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,865
Our soldiers have probably
fetched him by now.

151
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,994
"Probably"?

152
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,496
Don't give me a vague answer!

153
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes, sir. My apologies!

154
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
You understand?

155
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,819
What is the troop doing here?

156
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,699
You better make sure

157
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,911
that Hiroshi Tanaka complies.

158
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,207
I don't want him to get in my way anymore.

159
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,378
And once he's gone, bring me Adelina.

160
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,640
-You're dismissed!
-Yes, sir.

161
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,453
Does he really need to be tied up?

162
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,124
That's the only way to restrain him.

163
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.

164
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,256
I'll make him understand.

165
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,509
Say your goodbyes.
We'll be heading out soon.

166
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,450
Eduardo?

167
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,619
Have you finally calmed down?

168
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,211
Please, enough is enough.

169
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,426
Listen to me, Eduardo.

170
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,388
We're just worried about you.

171
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,349
Confronting the Colonel is dangerous.

172
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,395
It's madness to face him alone.

173
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,440
Please, think this through.

174
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,486
Take care of yourself.

175
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,993
I'd hate it if the next thing I hear
is your imprisonment.

176
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,290
Please don't push me further into madness.

177
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,261
Don't worry about me.

178
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,015
I can handle myself.

179
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,060
You've got yourself a brave sister.

180
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,063
Just like you.

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,780
Don't cry, Eduardo.

182
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,032
Don't cry.

183
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,078
The Lord is merciful.

184
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,832
He will never abandon my sister.

185
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,418
I believe that.

186
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,008
Just stay strong, okay?

187
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,492
Let's go.

188
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,091
Untie me.

189
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,385
-I'll behave.
-Later.

190
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,597
When I'm sure.

191
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,559
Let's go, Eduardo.

192
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,736
Auntie.

193
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,405
Do you still need me to guide you back?

194
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,573
No more, sonny.

195
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,950
I already know the way back.

196
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,161
I have a good memory.

197
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,287
You better get going.

198
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,331
Goodbye, miss.

199
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,334
I'll take care of him for you.

200
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,836
I won't abandon him.

201
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,880
Thank you, Juan.

202
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,174
Thank you so much.

203
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,927
Be safe, okay?

204
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,969
Take care of yourself.

205
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,876
Colonel Saitoh!

206
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,338
Here comes another problem.

207
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,970
I need your help.

208
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,265
If this is about Teresita,

209
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,478
there's no need to worry
because my men are looking for her.

210
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,483
But why hasn't she come home?

211
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,486
Why is there still no sign of my daughter?

212
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,374
That's what they all said to Julio.

213
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,878
But now, we've parted ways
just to find our daughter.

214
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,547
Because to this very day,

215
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,676
Colonel, Teresita has still not
returned home.

216
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,140
Colonel, I'm ready to offer a reward.

217
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,685
They can have all my jewelry,
all my possessions.

218
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,689
I'm willing to give them up
just to have Teresita back.

219
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,508
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be.

220
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,353
I'll die if I don't see my daughter!

221
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,016
-Father.
-Hiroshi.

222
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,186
Where have you been?

223
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,021
The troops came to pick me up.

224
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,733
But I was waiting for you and Adelina

225
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,735
so I can say goodbye.

226
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,535
Forgive me, my son.

227
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,205
I have failed you.

228
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,713
Failed me?

229
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,633
What made you say that, Father?

230
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,886
You're right.

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,932
We're surrounded by monsters.

232
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,352
You must be careful.

233
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,437
Why are you saying that?

234
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,523
Where have you been?

235
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,442
What changed your mind about them?

236
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,073
Forgive me, but we can't wait any longer.

237
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,617
We have to go.

238
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,667
I hope you feel better now.

239
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,297
I'm exhausted, Marcel.

240
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,635
It's exhausting

241
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,724
to keep living like this.

242
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,979
We can't even keep

243
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:53,692
our families safe and well.

244
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,865
We're completely oblivious
to what's going to happen to them.

245
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,160
And to us.

246
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,954
I'm exhausted.

247
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,129
We can only blame the cruel Japanese.

248
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,845
Adelina, think about our offer.

249
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,474
We can still save this country.

250
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,894
You're not just helping us,
you're helping your brother too.

251
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,854
Marcel.

252
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,535
In a short while, the sun will set.

253
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,541
The demons will come out once again.

254
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,466
In here.

255
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,801
Come in.

256
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,138
Come in.

257
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,897
What is it, Lorena?

258
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,815
Is there something you want to say?

259
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,652
Don't be afraid, Manuela.

260
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,031
The Japanese can't hurt us anymore.

261
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,283
We'll escape.

262
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,055
Can someone please untie me?

263
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,183
It's getting really hard to move.

264
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,227
We're just being cautious, Eduardo.

265
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,437
You might throw a fit again.

266
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,816
I'm your ally, not your captive.

267
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,235
He's right. Let's untie him.

268
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,738
Let go!

269
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,992
Watch yourself, Eduardo.

270
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,995
I'm talking about
your judgment and actions.

271
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,164
You can't just pull the trigger

272
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,251
whenever you feel like it.

273
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,090
Your wrath will not just blind you,

274
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,094
it also prevents you
from thinking straight.

275
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,268
Before you charge in, Eduardo…

276
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,771
you must always plan and prepare for it.

277
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,942
If I plan carefully,

278
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,739
are you going to help me save Teresita?

279
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,035
Let's find a new campsite first.

280
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,455
Then, we'll talk.

281
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,583
Let's go.

282
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,752
They must have gone in this direction!

283
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,840
Someone's coming.

284
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,050
Let's go.

285
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,472
And how exactly are we going to escape?

286
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,230
Every corner of this garrison
is heavily guarded.

287
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,573
You're too naïve, Lorena.

288
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,575
You're a fool…

289
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,122
to believe a stupid woman like her.

290
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,415
Auntie Amalia.

291
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,959
Don't talk to her that way.

292
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,920
And don't give her false hope.

293
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,007
Compared to Lorena,
we've been here longer than she has.

294
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:16,056
Do you think
we've never thought of escaping?

295
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,225
All right, Teresita.

296
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,144
Tell us.

297
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,317
How are we going to escape
from these vile soldiers?

298
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,126
Untie me now.

299
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,575
Hey, what's wrong?

300
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,494
Someone's here, I heard it.

301
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,790
We can still escape, okay?

302
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,375
I'll do everything I can.

303
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,627
Thank you for granting my request, Yuta.

304
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,172
Why would I deny such a simple request

305
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,217
from my future bride
if it will make her happy?

306
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,137
They're sending me to the province.
I'm to be assigned there.

307
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,348
I thought you promised
you wouldn't leave me.

308
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,350
Take us to Adelina this instant!

309
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,268
Dad!

310
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,769
Dad! No!

311
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,855
Someone's looking for all of you.

312
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,606
He wants to kill you all.

313
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,358
His name is Lauro.

314
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,359
He's my uncle.

315
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,569
COMING UP

316
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,451
