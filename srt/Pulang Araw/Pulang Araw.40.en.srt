1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,795
Eduardo's father
is an American military officer,

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,880
so Eduardo
is a potential threat to us too.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:10,468
He himself might be hiding his own father.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,720
Where is that colonel?

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,513
Are you going to fight a colonel?

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,764
Are you insane?

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,933
He works here with us.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,102
His name is Damian.

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,188
Do you think that colonel
will leave you alone, Teresita?

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,273
I hope so.

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,737
Adelina. That damn woman, she deceived me!

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,738
Let's elope.

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,907
I'm going to marry you
so that no one takes you from me.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,159
Okay, fine.

15
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,119
So I can finally resolve
my issues with Mama.

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,331
It's easy to win her mother over.

17
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,668
But not Teresita.

18
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,754
Why don't you put Eduardo in jail,

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,922
so no one can come
between you and Teresita?

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,008
It's going to happen soon.

21
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,551
We are not your enemies.

22
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,552
We are your friends.

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,014
What do you think
about Adelina and her family?

24
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,766
Are they allies or enemies?

25
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,184
I can't say for now.

26
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,020
Go on, hurry now!
Teresita might get there before you.

27
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,147
Why are you carrying luggage?

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,148
Come with us.

29
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,858
We will drop Teresita off.

30
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,776
Where?

31
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,611
Which one of you is Eduardo Dela Cruz?

32
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,405
What did I do?
Did I do something wrong, sir?

33
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,032
PREVIOUSLY

34
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,700
We haven't done anything wrong, sir!

35
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,832
Where could Eduardo be?

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,793
Will he still come?

37
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,463
Why wouldn't he, Teresita?

38
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,799
He wanted this, right?

39
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,219
You and Eduardo agreed to meet at seven.

40
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,304
He should be here by now.

41
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,600
Why? Is it exactly seven now?

42
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
Yes, Adelina.

43
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,484
Why isn't he here yet?

44
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,863
He's never late for anything.

45
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,824
My God.

46
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,243
Where could he be?

47
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,962
Why were you arrested, sir?

48
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,929
I was afraid
this was going to happen, Eduardo.

49
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,141
They might kill us.

50
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,487
Teresita!

51
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,698
It's already 7:20 p.m.

52
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,700
We need to go home.

53
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,330
Teresita.

54
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,249
I'm really starting to worry
about Eduardo.

55
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,586
What if something happened to him?

56
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,633
My God. I hope not.

57
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,847
Things will get worse
if you're caught breaking curfew.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,100
So can we please go home?

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,148
Hiroshi, ten more minutes, please.

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,318
Let's wait for Eduardo.
He might be on his way.

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,863
Teresita.

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,325
What if I leave you with Hiroshi now?

63
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,703
I'll go to my brother's house.
I'll find out what happened to him.

64
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,205
Don't, Adelina.

65
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,289
Why?

66
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,999
You can't go alone.

67
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,751
It's too dangerous.

68
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,422
Teresita, believe me.
I really have a bad feeling about this.

69
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,263
Let's go.

70
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,723
Let's go find him.

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,685
Huh? Oh, all right. Let's go.

72
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:23,448
SERVED AS A PRISON FOR FILIPINOS
AND AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR II

73
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,006
Get in!

74
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,885
Get inside! Hurry!

75
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,302
Enough, please!

76
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,348
What are you looking at? Keep walking!

77
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,227
Keep walking!

78
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,748
Stop!

79
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,417
Line up properly and wait!

80
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,754
Halt! Line up properly and wait!

81
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,446
I told you, we're going to die here.

82
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,326
May I know why you arrested us?

83
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,453
What exactly do you want from us?

84
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,332
Our Commanding Officer will answer that!

85
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,921
-Salute!
-Salute!

86
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,674
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening, sir.

87
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,307
Eduardo Dela Cruz!

88
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,189
That's me.

89
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,359
Come with me.

90
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,036
Yes, sir.

91
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,332
But I have no relationship with him.

92
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:29,587
From the moment I was born,
he never treated me as his son.

93
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,363
Eduardo?

94
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,532
-Eduardo?
-Eduardo?

95
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,369
-The door is open. Eduardo?
-Eduardo! Tasyo!

96
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,328
Eduardo!

97
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,997
-Eduardo!
-Excuse me…

98
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
but there is no one there.

99
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,543
No one?

100
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,384
Why?

101
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,678
Where are Eduardo and Tasyo?

102
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,350
Don't be afraid of him.

103
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,726
I won't hurt you.

104
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,106
Please. Where are Eduardo and Tasyo?

105
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,943
The Japanese soldiers
arrested them earlier.

106
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,153
We don't know why,

107
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,615
but what happened to them
is truly frightening.

108
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,034
My God.

109
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,413
Have mercy on my brother.
Save him and Tasyo.

110
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,166
Teresita.

111
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,668
-Teresita!
-Teresita.

112
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,171
My sister. Teresita. Please help us.

113
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,089
Help us.

114
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,173
Teresita.

115
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:05,599
Mr. Dela Cruz,
do you know where your father is?

116
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,102
I don't know.

117
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,563
I don't know where he is.

118
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,897
As I told you before--

119
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,528
Just answer my colonel's question.

120
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,701
No details or explanations!

121
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,587
Where is your father hiding,
Mr. Dela Cruz?

122
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,798
I don't know.

123
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,633
I don't know anything.

124
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,895
I don't know.

125
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,647
I don't know where he is!

126
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,984
I'm just an employee of
Mr. Chikara Tanaka.

127
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,527
Even if you ask him,

128
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:04,325
you'll find out that I've never been
with my worthless father!

129
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,262
One more chance, Mr. Dela Cruz.

130
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,433
Tell us where he is.

131
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,103
Where is your father?

132
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,069
I don't know anything…

133
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,487
I don't know.

134
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,948
I'm not lying.

135
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,978
There is something you must know
about one of my employees, Eduardo.

136
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,481
I just learned he's the son
of an American officer in the US Army.

137
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,318
You hire people
without investigating their background?

138
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,737
What if he's an American spy?

139
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,448
That Eduardo is dangerous, kill him!

140
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,503
My God.

141
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,922
Teresita, wake up.

142
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,217
Wake up already.

143
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,808
That's enough!

144
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,293
Where is your American father?

145
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,797
I don't know. I don't-- I'm not lying.

146
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:38,020
I'll leave you for a while, Adelina.
I just need to go somewhere.

147
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,980
What?

148
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,817
You're leaving me
and my sister in this situation?

149
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,615
Adelina, Teresita is awake.

150
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,284
Teresita?

151
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,204
Teresita.

152
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,999
Adelina.

153
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,213
Hold on. Don't push yourself!
Are you feeling better?

154
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,131
Adelina, where's Eduardo?

155
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,260
I wonder where they took Eduardo.

156
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,513
Enough.

157
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,443
I don't know. I don't know where he is.

158
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,872
Get his companion and bring him here.

159
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,166
Yes, sir!

160
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,545
Wait. What will you do with Tasyo?

161
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,214
He has nothing--
He has nothing to do with this.

162
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,425
Tasyo doesn't know anything. He doesn't--

163
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,563
I wonder what they did to him.

164
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,358
Maybe they already killed your friend.

165
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,915
Who is the friend of Eduardo Dela Cruz?

166
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,833
It's him!

167
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,170
-Come with us!
-Wait a minute, sir! No!

168
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,381
What did I do? Boss! Wait, sir!

169
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,474
I just left for a brief moment,
and my daughters disappeared?

170
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,603
And not one of you noticed
they slipped out again?

171
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,065
Why do you seem angry with me too?

172
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,610
-How could I have known they would leave?
-Carmela, it is already nighttime!

173
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,694
There is a curfew!

174
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,821
It's dangerous outside now.

175
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,366
What if something bad happens to them?

176
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,084
You already know it's dangerous
and you still want to go out?

177
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,544
What do you want me to do,
abandon my children?

178
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,779
Teresita, don't worry about Eduardo now,
or you might get sick again.

179
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,864
"Don't worry"?

180
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,036
I shouldn't worry
that your people took him?

181
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,125
I shouldn't worry about what they might be
doing to my fiancé right now?

182
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,634
Perhaps they arrested Eduardo

183
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,805
because they have questions
about his real father.

184
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,765
His father?

185
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,394
Hiroshi, what does Eduardo have to do

186
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,814
with someone who never had
any relationship with him?

187
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,692
But he is still
an American military officer, isn't he?

188
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,946
So if that's the only reason
he was invited by my fellow soldiers--

189
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,364
"Invited"?

190
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,285
He was arrested, Hiroshi, not invited!

191
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,829
Please don't get angry.

192
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,749
And you have nothing to worry about.

193
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,003
I'm sure they only have
questions for Eduardo.

194
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,838
They will let him go after.

195
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,340
Are you sure about what you're saying?

196
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,386
Or are you just saying to calm us?

197
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,558
I will leave you for now.

198
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,438
I will find out what really happened
to Eduardo and where he is.

199
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,108
-We are going with you.
-We won't be left here.

200
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,071
How can you come with me
when it's already curfew?

201
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,199
Stay here.

202
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,701
Please lock up if you can.

203
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,787
I will come back right away.

204
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,833
-Good evening!
-Why are you still outside?

205
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,418
It's dangerous now.

206
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,213
Apologies.

207
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,591
I just came from a mission.

208
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,039
I think I recognize that one.

209
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,917
But all our enemies look alike.

210
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,130
So? Are we going to attack them?

211
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,134
No. There are far too many of them for us.

212
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,428
Let's go.

213
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,019
You might run into armed criminals.

214
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,270
Be careful.

215
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,940
Thank you very much.

216
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,212
Hey!

217
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,766
Sit here.

218
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,310
Sir, what do you want from me?

219
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,854
Hurry up!

220
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,774
Sir, what do you want from us?

221
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,609
Sir, what?

222
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,569
Sir, I just got dragged into this.

223
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,945
What will you do to Tasyo?

224
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,239
What are you going to do to him?

225
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,995
-Sir, what? Hey!
-Tie him up. Do the nail pricking on him.

226
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,751
Sir, I'm not involved in this.
We didn't do anything.

227
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,544
I just got dragged into this.

228
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,839
Sir, I just got dragged into this.
I shouldn't have been arrested…

229
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,841
Sir! Eduardo, what will they do?

230
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,926
What will you do to him?

231
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,682
Sir, we really didn't do anything.
What do you want from us?

232
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,810
We'll tell you everything
you want to know.

233
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,729
But… we know nothing.

234
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,735
Give me the needle.

235
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,033
Sir, what will you do with that?

236
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,827
Sir, what will you do with that?

237
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,036
Sir, don't, please!

238
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,581
Tasyo, Tasyo.

239
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
Sir, don't!

240
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,292
We really don't know anything, sir!

241
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,379
Sir, don't!

242
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,673
Tasyo!

243
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,882
Tasyo!

244
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,722
Tasyo!

245
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,142
Enough!

246
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,314
Enough! Enough, please!

247
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,571
Tasyo!

248
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,327
Can I talk to you in private, please?

249
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,537
Where are they going?

250
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,164
Worry about our daughter!

251
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,708
COMING UP

252
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,710
Eduardo and Tasyo were arrested.

253
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,879
And perhaps the Kempeitai did it.

254
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,007
I know nothing, so why are you asking me?

255
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,550
Could it be Colonel Yuta?

256
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,761
Is my father the only reason
you are doing this to us?

257
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,932
Or maybe you really want to punish me
because of Teresita?

258
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,769
It's so hard that we can't leave,
we can't look for him,

259
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,313
and we can't do anything.

260
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,898
We need to get out of here, Tasyo.

261
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,941
-They will kill us.
-How?

262
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,903
The Japanese won't put us here

263
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,530
if they know there is a way
for us to escape.

264
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,575
There is no other way
but the next plan I'm thinking of.

265
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,118
Me? Don't!

266
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,219
