00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,547
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,300
I feel sad that we no longer talk.
That you are avoiding me.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,220
I love you. I love you so much, Adelina.

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,597
Adelina?

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,932
Let me explain.

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,399
Our first attack on this country
will take place in December.

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,901
First, Pearl Harbor.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,154
We should think about
our victory, Colonel.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:33,283
Even if it costs the lives
of thousands of innocent Filipinos.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,794
The war has erupted in Hawaii.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,380
The military officials are holding
an urgent meeting.

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,343
Here is the list of names
of high-ranking soldiers.

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,721
Why is my father's name on that list?

14
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,060
Major Tyler Campbell, sir.

15
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,728
What is that for, sir?

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,357
Sir, you haven't answered my question.

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,994
Go home now.

18
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,180
Reporting in.

19
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,599
The 14th Division from Kyoto,

20
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,895
the 365th Division from Taiwan,
and the division from Shanghai

21
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,856
will enter from Northern Luzon.

22
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,026
-A message has arrived.
-From there, they will advance to Manila

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,780
and corner MacArthur in Corregidor.

24
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,865
I see.

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,993
How many American soldiers are there?

26
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,539
There are approximately
65,000 American troops.

27
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,167
Our Japanese forces are around 45,000.

28
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,088
This is going to be a tough battle.

29
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,219
Contact all units.

30
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,806
Relay this message immediately.

31
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,849
Yes, sir!

32
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:09,480
Lieutenant Colonel, what's the message?

33
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,448
In ten hours,

34
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:25,663
the war in Hawaii
will reach the Philippines.

35
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:39,302
God Almighty, I pray that the war
in Hawaii doesn't worsen.

36
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,057
Lord, please spare
our nation from this chaos.

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,269
Is there any more news?

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,742
There's nothing else, Dad.
Should I put it back?

39
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,163
If this war does reach us,

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:15,463
could it be that God
is punishing killers, thieves,

41
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:21,052
and whores who steal spouses or partners?

42
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:26,808
That's the God the colonizers taught us.

43
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:34,732
The God who doesn't forgive
and punishes harshly.

44
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,155
The true God is
merciful and understanding.

45
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,324
Why, Julio?

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,371
Were you hurt
by what our daughter just said?

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,584
Let's go to the altar, Mama.

48
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,255
Let's pray for this war

49
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:03,511
and for the souls of all sinners.

50
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,147
Come, both of you.

51
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,367
What's wrong, dearest?

52
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,746
Are you worried?

53
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,167
Hawaii is far from here.

54
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,420
The war will not reach us.

55
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,548
No need to worry.

56
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,520
Eduardo and the others.

57
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,485
Wait, are you sure about what you heard?

58
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,195
You heard it in English, right?

59
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,530
-I think you're just…
-Listen to me, Tasyo,

60
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,991
-What?
-This isn't the time for jokes.

61
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,078
I may not be fluent in English,
but I understand it.

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,997
Where's my brother?

63
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,584
-Eduardo…
-There he is.

64
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,627
Eduardo!

65
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,841
Eduardo, did you hear the news?
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

66
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,471
Eduardo, what will happen to us now?

67
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,890
I don't know.

68
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,519
Could Teresita be right?

69
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,731
Is this war happening
because of bad people like me?

70
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,234
What are you muttering, Adelina?

71
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,403
Nothing.

72
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:50,118
I was just thinking, aren't we under
American rule like Hawaii?

73
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,996
What if the Japanese come here next?

74
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,922
Hiroshi, tell him yourself.

75
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,773
Dad.

76
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,527
I made a grave mistake.

77
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,196
I hope you can forgive me.

78
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,199
What mistake?

79
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,583
I kissed Adelina and Teresita saw it.

80
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:48,426
Have some shame
for your betrothed's family!

81
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,053
Forgive me, Dad.

82
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,683
But I truly love Adelina.

83
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,603
She's the one I wish to marry,
not Teresita.

84
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,900
You're a man without honor.

85
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,652
-A disgrace to our family.
-Chikara, calm down.

86
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,907
Sir!

87
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,874
Mr. Tanaka, you must get ready.
It will happen soon.

88
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,460
Why the hurry, Akio?

89
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,879
What are you talking about?

90
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,718
Wait for me outside.

91
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,692
Dad, what are you and Akio
going to talk about?

92
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,071
Can you tell me what's happening?

93
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,579
War has broken out in Asia-Pacific.

94
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,959
They will attack the Philippines next.

95
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:17,640
Teresita, I told Eduardo
about what we heard on the radio.

96
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,309
He's worried about you, about us.

97
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
Why are you telling me this?

98
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,943
You know I've already
cut ties with Eduardo,

99
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,908
Unlike you with Hiroshi.

100
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,995
You promised to avoid him, Adelina.

101
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,999
But what happened?

102
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,042
I tried to avoid him, Teresita.

103
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,046
But what could I do if he approached me?

104
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,342
I was also surprised by what he did.
I didn't expect him to kiss me.

105
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,721
Surprised…

106
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,640
or pleased?

107
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,814
Is that why you kissed him back?

108
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,946
Or you grabbed the opportunity,
since you were alone with him,

109
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,908
to confess your feelings.

110
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,411
He's a man, after all.

111
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,457
He was tempted, so he kissed you.

112
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,714
Are you saying I'm a flirt?

113
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,259
It's so obvious, Teresita.

114
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,929
You kept dropping hints,
even when Dad was around.

115
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,184
Is that how lowly you think of me?

116
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,272
What should I think, Adelina?

117
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,484
Why don't you ask Hiroshi
what really happened

118
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,486
instead of blaming me?

119
00:10:54,945 --> 00:11:00,201
You'd know what really happened
if you only let him explain.

120
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,330
Why don't you ask your fiancé?

121
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,419
Are you afraid he will admit
he can't stand to marry you?

122
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,477
How did you know the Philippines
will be their next target, Dad?

123
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,396
There's no time to explain.

124
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,817
No one leaves this house. No one.

125
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,946
Dad!

126
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,831
Teresita…

127
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,795
Why are you so angry?

128
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,924
You don't even love Hiroshi
in the first place.

129
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,137
Eduardo is the one you truly love, right?

130
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,599
When I broke up with Eduardo,

131
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,562
I accepted my fate
and agreed to marry Hiroshi.

132
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,651
I've been trying to forget
my feelings for him

133
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:19,196
because we agreed to help Papa!

134
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,785
I sacrificed myself, Adelina!

135
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,333
And I expected you to do the same!

136
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,713
But did you?

137
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:43,429
Adelina, I wouldn't be this angry
if I saw Hiroshi with some other woman.

138
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,183
I might've even laughed.

139
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,271
But I caught you, Adelina!

140
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,399
My very own sister!

141
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,112
You betrayed me
and that's what hurts, Adelina!

142
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,207
That's why I'm asking
for your forgiveness, Teresita.

143
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:19,006
It was just a moment of weakness.

144
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,136
I wasn't the one who started it.

145
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,265
It was Hiroshi. He kissed me first.

146
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,228
I'll admit…

147
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:39,151
I was tempted because you know I like him.

148
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,280
You're not the only one
who sacrificed something.

149
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,993
I know what I did was wrong.

150
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,624
Don't worry.
I'll stand by my word from now on.

151
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,752
I'll never go near Hiroshi again.

152
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
I promise.

153
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,509
I hope this never happens again, Adelina.

154
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,932
This could cause a scandal
for both of our families!

155
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
What's going on?

156
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,992
Are you two fighting?

157
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,544
Girls, the Americans
and the Japanese are already at war.

158
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,963
Are you going to join in?

159
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,800
What are you arguing about?

160
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,277
I understand…

161
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,241
that arguments between siblings
are inevitable.

162
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,829
But please,

163
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,374
don't let your fight drag on.

164
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,600
You must reconcile.

165
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,565
Can you do that?

166
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,485
Teresita.

167
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,030
Adelina.

168
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,774
Don't let your resentment
towards each other overwhelm

169
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,404
the blood that flows through your veins.

170
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,203
Can you forgive each other now?

171
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,205
Don't fight anymore.

172
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,129
Go on, hug each other.

173
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,966
Go on.

174
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,187
That's what I want.

175
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,984
I want my princesses to always get along.

176
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,537
Hush now.

177
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,582
Hush now.

178
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,385
Smile now.

179
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,554
Smile.

180
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,183
Listen,

181
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:45,397
your grandmother once told me
that anger makes you ugly.

182
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,358
So smile now.

183
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,654
Come here.

184
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,079
I won't stay long. I have to get going.

185
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,499
Wait, there is something you must know

186
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,087
about one of my employees, Eduardo.

187
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:16,011
I just learned he's the son
of an American officer in the US Army.

188
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,433
You hire people
without investigating their background?

189
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,561
What if he's an American spy?

190
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,272
You are putting our army at risk!

191
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,900
That Eduardo is dangerous.

192
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,861
Do something about him, Tanaka.

193
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,240
Kill him if you have to!

194
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,670
Hiroshi, have you been there long?

195
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,171
Dad.

196
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,800
What are you, really?

197
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,637
What do you mean?

198
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,765
I heard your conversation with Akio.

199
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,061
Dad, can you please tell me
who you truly are?

200
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:18,652
I work for the Japanese Imperial Army
as a spy.

201
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:25,575
That's why I know
they'll attack the Philippines next.

202
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,956
Son.

203
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,421
Don't tell anyone what you heard

204
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,134
if you don't want to endanger our family.

205
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:05,991
Eduardo.

206
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,039
What will happen to your studies
if we get caught in the Japanese attack?

207
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,418
I hope we don't.

208
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,254
I'm just starting to chase my dreams.

209
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,259
Even if Teresita isn't part
of that dream anymore?

210
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,098
Can't I dream for myself and my sister?

211
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,768
What about Adelina?

212
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,021
What about her dream
of becoming famous in vaudeville?

213
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,359
We only have a sliver of hope,
and I won't let war take that away.

214
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,236
Well, what are you going to do?

215
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,449
If there's going to be war,
we'll be left with no choice.

216
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,077
Tell me, who will you side with?

217
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,287
The Americans or the Japanese?

218
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,583
Because I…

219
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,090
I won't side with the Americans.
You know that.

220
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,467
You were there.

221
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,723
You saw how the American police
killed my dad, right?

222
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,359
-Dad!
-Jose!

223
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,987
-Jose!
-Dad!

224
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,281
Dad!

225
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:33,370
-Dad!
-Jose!

226
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,754
-Are you going to side with the Japanese?
-No, I'll side with the Philippines.

227
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,384
I'll side with our people.
I'll fight for our country.

228
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,720
I won't side with the Americans
or the Japanese.

229
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,097
I don't like war.

230
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,600
I don't like anything
that will ruin my or Adelina's life.

231
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,736
Leave now. Go to your province.

232
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,782
Go somewhere far from Manila.
It's the only way to be safe.

233
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,868
Safe from what, Hiroshi?
What are you talking about?

234
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,536
Our son already knows

235
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,831
that I work for the Japanese Imperial Army
as a spy.

236
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,167
In a few hours,
Japan will attack this country too.

237
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,336
COMING UP

238
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,714
-Sir!
-Remain vigilant.

239
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:32,512
That's right, our safety is more important
as we wait for the attack.

240
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,514
-Arrest the Japanese!
-Why will you arrest him?

241
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:39,686
I'm only following orders
to arrest all Japanese in Manila.

242
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,146
Take care of my parents.

243
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,814
Don't abandon them.

244
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:50,030
Lord, please take care
of Hiroshi wherever he is.

245
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,748
