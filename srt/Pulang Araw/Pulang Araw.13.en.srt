1
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,584
Meding, please bring my things to my room.

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,881
Yolanda, where is Teresita?
Please tell her I'm home.

3
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,007
Well…

4
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,259
She's not here, señora.

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,678
She left a while ago.

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,640
Where did she go?

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,642
I don't know, ma'am.

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,603
She didn’t say.

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,151
There's a seat reserved for you.

10
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,445
This way, señor.

11
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,363
Thank you.

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,949
Enough with your antics, Togo!

13
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:21,664
Let's introduce the two lovely ladies
who will be performing next.

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,837
Oh, in that case, we
would like to introduce to you…

15
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,716
Pugo and Togo!

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,552
What are you doing?

17
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,804
Why did you hit me?

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,139
I said, two lovely ladies.

19
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,058
Not us.

20
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,434
Just kidding!

21
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,894
What's your problem?

22
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,648
Well then, go on and introduce them!

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,442
Tasyo, do you think Adelina
and Teresita are next?

24
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,194
Well, we'll see.

25
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,740
…let's give these beautiful ladies
a round of applause!

26
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,079
Here's Chinita and Morena!

27
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,958
I guess not.

28
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,049
I thought they would be next.

29
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,105
Eduardo, it’s them.

30
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,444
Teresita, there are a lot
of people watching.

31
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,989
My knees are shaking.

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,283
Calm down.

33
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,285
Take a deep breath.

34
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,128
What’s happening? It looks like
our friends are nervous.

35
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,680
I am sure my daughter is at the theater.

36
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:06,019
And she’s with that bastard again.

37
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,189
I really need to marry off my daughter

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,026
so I won't have to
worry about her so much.

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,950
-But who will I marry her off to?
-Worry about that some other time.

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,786
Sit down.
You just got out of the hospital.

41
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,501
Señora, Mr. Tanaka is here.

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
Oh, let him in.

43
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,007
Come in, sir.

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,135
-Mr. Tanaka.
-Good day, Mrs. Carmela.

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,438
Please, let's have a seat.

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,125
Do you still remember me?

47
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,669
Hiroshi!

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,421
Look at you. You’re all grown up.

49
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,676
And I'm glad to see
you haven’t forgotten Tagalog.

50
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,469
I can never forget.

51
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,768
Where are Teresita and Adelina?

52
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,770
Are they here?

53
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,189
My daughter is away at the moment.

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,109
Anyway, how are you?

55
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,987
Hiroshi, are you…

56
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,990
are you married?

57
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,034
No, ma'am.

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,885
Don’t leave yet.

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,762
I'll prepare something to eat.

60
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,807
Please, Mr. Tanaka.

61
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,103
-All right, Mrs. Carmela.
-All right.

62
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,315
Please, have a seat.

63
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,111
Mr. Tanaka and Hiroshi.

64
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,207
Come, Betina.

65
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,876
Hurry, let’s go to the servants.

66
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,548
I think I know what you’re thinking.

67
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,425
It's Hiroshi.

68
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,928
I will have him marry my Teresita.

69
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,388
Come on, hurry.

70
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,027
It's time, Adelina.

71
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,487
The people are getting impatient.

72
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,447
I’m still nervous, Teresita.

73
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,910
Here.

74
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,328
Hold my hand.

75
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,042
Our dreams are finally coming true.

76
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,588
So put on a smile.

77
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,925
We will let everyone know…

78
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,138
who Chinita and Morena are.

79
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,961
Maestro.

80
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,360
Wherever you are
Be it the city or the country

81
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:29,824
You will always bump into
The naughty clown

82
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,118
Here he comes, making noise

83
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,412
With his loose pants

84
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,290
And there like a fool

85
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,751
Roaming the streets, growling

86
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,087
Ouch! Oh, no!

87
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,005
Silly clown

88
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,423
Hey!

89
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,845
Hey!

90
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,849
Even his forehead

91
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,643
He's shaved

92
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:02,607
His walk and moves have changed

93
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,445
Roaming the streets, singing…

94
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,033
In English without lyrics

95
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,409
And with a ukulele

96
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,623
Greet him, "How are you?"

97
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:24,337
And he'll reply, "Well, see for yourself!"

98
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,138
You silly, silly clown

99
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,712
This naughty clown is popular

100
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,801
In every gathering
Holding a ukulele

101
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,428
Serenading your food

102
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,597
Here he comes, dancing

103
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,058
His body moving wildly

104
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,061
And his spit flying through the air…

105
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,643
Is that Borromeo?

106
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,186
I think it's Julio.

107
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,646
Are you sure?

108
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,565
The famous impresario from way back?

109
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,066
Yes, I think it's Julio.

110
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,318
I think it's him.

111
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,044
Crying nonstop

112
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,050
Don't stop.

113
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,774
Ouch! Oh, no! Silly clown

114
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,860
Hey!

115
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,535
Maestro.

116
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,246
Music.

117
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,633
He even shaved his forehead

118
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:21,097
The way he moves and walks
Have changed

119
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,474
Is that part of the act?

120
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,352
You are witnessing

121
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,772
the power an artist possesses

122
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,111
to affect the audience and convey

123
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,114
the different kinds of love,

124
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:43,035
as he makes them understand
the principles and beliefs

125
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,747
important to humanity.

126
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,334
Greet him, "How are you?"

127
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:56,132
And he'll reply, "Well, see for yourself!"

128
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,097
You silly

129
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,474
Silly

130
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,811
Clown

131
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,036
Not only was I laughing,

132
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,249
but I was also deeply moved
by what I witnessed.

133
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,959
How about you, Togo?

134
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,961
You are right, Pugo.

135
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,796
Well…

136
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,051
Go ahead and do it, because I can't.

137
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,387
My fellow countrymen,

138
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,682
let's put our hands together

139
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,853
for the one and only, the unfailing…

140
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,481
Marcelo!

141
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,911
Why were you gone for so long, Dad?

142
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,500
We've been waiting for you
for a long time, Papa.

143
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,877
Dry your tears, both of you.

144
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,672
I'm here now.

145
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,427
We will never be apart again.

146
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,927
Dad, he's singing our song.

147
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,393
I heard Teresita's father hasn't returned?

148
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,523
I'm no longer hoping he would, Hiroshi.

149
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,026
But let's not talk about him.

150
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,948
Mr. Tanaka.

151
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,199
Yes.

152
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,127
Cheers?

153
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,962
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

154
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,296
Cheers.

155
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,720
Boy, give me two of those.

156
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,518
Is this for the vaudeville actresses
or for the young lady you're courting?

157
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,857
What do you know about those things, boy?

158
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,734
I know a lot of things!

159
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,652
I can clean your shoes

160
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,904
for only five centavos!

161
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,117
Not today. Maybe some other time.

162
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,536
No need to give me change.
You can keep it, all of it.

163
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,954
Thank you, sir!

164
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,123
My name is Juan.

165
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,502
I'm here every time
there's a show in the theater.

166
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,464
Remember my name, okay?

167
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,341
Don't worry.

168
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,260
I won't forget you, Juan.

169
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,848
Did you buy those for Teresita?

170
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,184
For her and Adelina.

171
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,313
Don't even try to tease me.
Teresita might hear you.

172
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,398
Look, here they come.

173
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,192
Well done, ladies.

174
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,651
I saw this coming.

175
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,445
You were truly delightful!

176
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,571
Oh, thank you.

177
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,530
Thank you very much.

178
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,990
Thank you.

179
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,036
What are you waiting for?

180
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,080
Give those flowers to Teresita.

181
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,750
-No, it's embarrassing. These are cheap.
-So what?

182
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,171
What matters is you get to
express your feelings

183
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,964
without even saying anything.

184
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,882
Eduardo!

185
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,300
Here she comes.

186
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,387
I'm glad you were able to watch the show.

187
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,598
She's right.

188
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,434
Eduardo, our father is back.

189
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,187
Good day--

190
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,981
Good day to you, sir.

191
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,527
Is that really you, Eduardo?

192
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
Wow!

193
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,197
You've really grown up.

194
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,201
Thank you, Uncle Julio.

195
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,996
Thank you very much
for coming back to your daughters.

196
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,501
My girls and I will grab something to eat.

197
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,794
Why don't you join us?

198
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,629
Oh, sure. Where will we eat?

199
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,549
It's fine, we'll go home.
You three should go ahead.

200
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,425
We might be a bother to you.

201
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,386
Why would you be?

202
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,597
Yes, come with us, Eduardo.

203
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,058
Maybe you're just shy.

204
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,020
Don't worry, Adelina and I know
you have a big appetite.

205
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,189
Well, there's no problem then.

206
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,942
This ugly girl is annoying me like always.

207
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,321
There you go again, Eduardo.

208
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,574
You're teasing her.

209
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,786
I know you know
how beautiful my sister is.

210
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,872
Right?

211
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,374
Who are those flowers for?

212
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,421
Eduardo's getting shy now!

213
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,755
Come on, come with us!

214
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,382
No, we're fine.

215
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,050
Tasyo and I will just go home.

216
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,887
I still have a lot of things to do.

217
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,221
Whatever, Eduardo.

218
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,100
If you're not coming,
bring these home with you.

219
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,727
-I’ll just get them later.
-Good idea.

220
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,853
All right, I’ll take those.

221
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,318
Eduardo, thank you very much
for taking care of my daughters.

222
00:19:55,068 --> 00:20:00,157
Thank you for taking on the responsibility
that should've been mine.

223
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,284
I will never forget that.

224
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,786
It’s nothing, Uncle Julio.

225
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,707
You know I will do everything
for our princesses.

226
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,425
That’s right.

227
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,928
For our princesses.

228
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,097
Well, then…

229
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,807
Shall we, my princesses?

230
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,518
Take care.

231
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,395
You too!

232
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,066
We'll eat something delicious.
We'll have chicken and pancit.

233
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,986
Why didn’t we go with them?
We don't have food at home.

234
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,282
Hey!

235
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,201
Go head back home.

236
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,327
I have to go somewhere.

237
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,954
What? Where are you going?

238
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,207
Hey.

239
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,875
Eduardo…

240
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,552
I swear to you,

241
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,055
we will never bother you again

242
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,100
for as long as I live.

243
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,562
Go to hell.

244
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,516
It hurts so much that my own father
didn’t even recognize me.

245
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,065
I thought I wouldn't get hurt anymore.

246
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,025
But I…

247
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,111
I really thought…

248
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,953
after all this time,
I would be able to accept

249
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,209
that I had no place in my father's life.

250
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,879
But that isn’t the case.

251
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,424
Especially when I saw

252
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,806
how happy Uncle Julio was
to see Teresita and Adelina.

253
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
I was so envious.

254
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,861
I was so envious, Mom.

255
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,871
Why isn’t he like my father?

256
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:45,215
Even now, he still hasn’t acknowledged me.

257
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,399
I wish you didn't die, Mom.

258
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,533
I wish he wasn’t my father.

259
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,979
Dad, I think you want
me and Teresita to get fat!

260
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,314
There's so much food.

261
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,528
Let me make it up to you,
all the breakfasts,

262
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,157
lunches, dinners,
and snack times I've missed.

263
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,870
Thank God we are together again.

264
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,710
Especially now that my princesses
have become stars.

265
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,383
Dad, Teresita and I aren't stars yet.

266
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,802
We only just started
performing vaudeville.

267
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,096
That’s right, Papa.

268
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,558
We still have a lot to learn
before we become stars.

269
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,561
No.

270
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,773
To me, you are stars already.

271
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,946
And I am grateful
because you embraced my art.

272
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,241
I am truly proud of both of you.

273
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,785
We are even more proud of you, Papa.

274
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,456
But please,
don’t ever leave us again, okay?

275
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,875
Don’t abandon us again.

276
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:49,381
Because Teresita and I
will hold a grudge if you do.

277
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,886
I have no reason to leave
the two of you again.

278
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:00,725
In fact,
I have a big surprise for you both.

279
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,938
This is the result
of ten years of sacrifice.

280
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,818
I wanted to bring home a special gift

281
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,570
you two will use, even when you grow old.

282
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,198
-Are those shoes?
-What is it, Papa?

283
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,157
What shoes?

284
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,493
It’s more than that.

285
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,331
I have a lot of savings.

286
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,252
So I will rebuild my theater right away.

287
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,547
And once it’s done,

288
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,341
I'll take you back from Johnny.

289
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:38,638
So you two can help me

290
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,641
manage our new theater.

291
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,686
Of course, you will perform there

292
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,775
as the brightest among all the stars.

293
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,618
What’s the matter? Why the long faces?

294
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,287
Aren’t you happy?

295
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,009
Dad, we no longer own the lot
the theater stood on.

296
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,936
Forgive us, Papa,

297
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,441
if we weren't able to stop Mama
from doing what she did.

298
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,362
What she did was also painful for us.

299
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,238
But, Papa, believe me…

300
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:43,828
I did everything to take the theater
back from Mr. Tanaka, but I couldn't.

301
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,133
I have made arrangements
for what you ordered me to do.

302
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,635
About what?

303
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,761
About Eduardo.

304
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,847
COMING UP

305
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,143
You sold my lot and theater?

306
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,562
You should have just killed me!

307
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,772
Where is Eduardo?

308
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,898
I don’t know.

309
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,066
Maybe he’s still at home.

310
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,901
I already went there,
but the place was empty.

311
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,070
Just wait for him there.
He's probably on his way now.

312
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,780
There's something I want to ask you.

313
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,657
Is it true Hiroshi has returned?

314
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,534
Have you seen your boss’ son?

315
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,787
You don't have to
worry about Adelina, señora.

316
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,165
Because I’m sure,
once she and Eduardo talk,

317
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,210
they will definitely
not bother you anymore.
