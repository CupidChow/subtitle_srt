1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,964
Aren't we under American rule like Hawaii?

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,049
What if the Japanese come here next?

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,552
In ten hours,

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,597
the war in Hawaii
will reach the Philippines.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,141
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:21,229
Could it be that God
is punishing killers, thieves,

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,648
and whores who steal spouses or partners?

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,816
I kissed Adelina.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,736
She's the one I wish to marry,
not Teresita.

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,906
Are you afraid he will admit
he can't stand to marry you?

12
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,452
Mr. Tanaka, you must get ready.
It will happen soon.

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,872
You must reconcile.
Don't let your resentment

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,876
overwhelm your love for each other.

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,005
I work for the Japanese Imperial Army
as a spy.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,924
That's why I know
they'll attack the Philippines next.

17
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,176
What about Adelina?

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,845
What about her dream
of becoming famous in vaudeville?

19
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,139
We only have a sliver of hope,
and I won't let war take that away.

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,682
Who will you side with?

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,392
The Americans or the Japanese?

22
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,729
I won't side with the Americans
or the Japanese. I don't like war.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,149
I don't like anything
that will ruin my or Adelina's life.

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,715
Are they the only ones attending the mass
of the Immaculate Conception?

25
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,728
-Hiroshi.
-Eduardo.

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,148
Eduardo, be careful.

27
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,191
Someone's out to kill you.

28
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,068
What?

29
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,362
Who? Why?

30
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,366
It's difficult to explain.

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,327
Especially with what's about to happen
in this country.

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,248
Eduardo, you must leave.

33
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,626
Take Adelina with you
and Teresita as well.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,589
Wait, I'm confused.

35
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,384
And Teresita,
aren't you going to marry her?

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,678
Forget about the wedding.

37
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,097
Just leave now, Eduardo.

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,851
Go to your province.
Go somewhere far from Manila.

39
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,896
It's the only way to be safe.

40
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,607
Safe from what, Hiroshi?
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,948
Chikara, wake up!

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,283
It's Hiroshi.

43
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,702
He left. I don't know where he went.

44
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,291
You're not answering my questions.

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,919
Who wants to kill me?

46
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,338
And why are Adelina
and Teresita in danger?

47
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,132
Eduardo, just listen to me, will you?

48
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,219
You must leave.

49
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,638
Leave Manila as soon as possible.

50
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,057
You're no longer safe here.

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
Goodbye, Eduardo.

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,566
You're Japanese, aren't you?

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,109
You traitor.

54
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,528
You bombed Pearl Harbor
without any warning.

55
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,531
-I had nothing to do with that.
-Really?

56
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,034
Maybe you're here in the Philippines

57
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,453
because you want to bomb
and invade our country?

58
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,496
Maybe so.

59
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,874
Gentlemen, do not be hasty.
I know this Japanese man.

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,543
He has nothing to do with all of this.

61
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,837
Do not defend this monster!

62
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,056
Where could our son have gone to?

63
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,474
Do not worry.

64
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,060
I'll find him.

65
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,815
Oh, my!

66
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,858
What's happening?

67
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,366
There they are!

68
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,118
Ruthless Japanese!

69
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,661
Get out of our country!

70
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,621
Go back to your country!

71
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,832
-Go back to your country!
-Come out!

72
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,515
Close the windows! Close them!

73
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,352
They're mad at us. What do we do?

74
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,812
We will not leave the house.

75
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,480
We will stay inside.

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,899
What about Hiroshi?
What if something bad happens to him?

77
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,234
They closed their windows on us.

78
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,236
-Come out!
-Go back to your country!

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,116
-Come out!
-Come out!

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,667
Let's stop this!

81
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,713
Enough!

82
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,815
He's Japanese!

83
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,526
If they're enemies of America,
then they're ours too!

84
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,738
-Traitors!
-Wait…

85
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,616
-Don't interfere, Eduardo!
-Calm down!

86
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,784
Let go of me!

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,911
What's that noise?

88
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,625
These Japanese are shameless!

89
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,170
My God!

90
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,506
Don't you pity him?
You've beaten him enough! Stop!

91
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,508
Have mercy!

92
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,551
Enough!

93
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,141
Enough! Have mercy on him!

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,518
Don't help him, Eduardo!

95
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,728
He's hurt! Enough with this!

96
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,357
Why are you siding with him?
The Japanese are demons!

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,942
Hey! Stop that!

98
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,653
-Enough!
-Enough!

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,154
Stop that!

100
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,032
That's enough!

101
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,034
Have mercy on him. What is happening?

102
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,620
They're angry

103
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,289
about what the Japanese
did to Pearl Harbor.

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,834
Fellow Filipinos!

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,671
Hawaii is very far from our country!

106
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,717
Why do you have to involve the innocent
and peaceful Japanese living here?

107
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,515
Have you also lost all compassion
for your fellow human beings?

108
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,613
Arrest the Japanese!

109
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,740
Enough!

110
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,326
Enough! Let him go!

111
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,744
With all due respect, Dado.

112
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,081
But it was our fellow Filipinos
who started the trouble here.

113
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,875
They mercilessly beat up Hiroshi.

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,168
Why will you arrest him?

115
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,711
Don't meddle, Eduardo.

116
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:47,675
I'm only following orders
to arrest all Japanese in Manila.

117
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,011
But why are you arresting them?

118
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,722
What do they have to do
with what's happening in Pearl Harbor?

119
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,307
Think about it!

120
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,810
It's only right to arrest
and imprison America's enemies.

121
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,483
Let's help the constabulary
find all the Japanese,

122
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,485
so they can arrest them right away!

123
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,444
-Right!
-Let's go!

124
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,946
-Let's go! Come with us!
-No!

125
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,503
Chikara, what are those?

126
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,339
Why are you burning them?

127
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,470
Chikara, what's going on?

128
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,889
These are classified documents.

129
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,690
Our son already knows

130
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,614
that I work for the Japanese Imperial Army
as a spy.

131
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,578
In a few hours,
Japan will attack this country too.

132
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,957
We never know what will happen,

133
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,126
that's why I need to burn
all of these for our safety.

134
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
Just a moment.

135
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,931
Eduardo, take care of my parents.

136
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,559
Don't abandon them.

137
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,397
What did you whisper to Eduardo?

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,233
Dado, we're all childhood friends here.

139
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,068
You know Hiroshi.

140
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,029
We used to play baseball together.

141
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,948
We grew up together!

142
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,494
So I'm begging you, don't hurt him.

143
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,248
Let's go.

144
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,208
Where are you taking him?

145
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,586
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute!

146
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,337
Now, you're even arresting the elderly.

147
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,047
They're completely helpless!

148
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
Don't you have any mercy?

149
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,345
I'll repeat, I'm just following orders.

150
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,683
No, I won't go!
I haven't done anything wrong!

151
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,018
My God.

152
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,521
What's happening?

153
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,909
You two, go inside.

154
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,495
Report this immediately to Uncle Julio.

155
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,833
Teresita, find out
where they're taking Hiroshi.

156
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,793
I won't be able to join you

157
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,714
because I need to see
the Tanakas right away.

158
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,134
Eduardo, you might end up in danger too.

159
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,555
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

160
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,475
-Just do as I say.
-Eduardo…

161
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,425
Captain Watanabe has arrived.

162
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,733
-Did anyone follow you here?
-No, Colonel.

163
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,318
I made sure of that.

164
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:39,990
We cannot be certain of our safety
in this country right now.

165
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,745
The Filipinos may be angry
with us right now.

166
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,790
Especially now that

167
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,377
the news has spread

168
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,756
about our country's attack in Hawaii.

169
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:03,305
Remain vigilant.
We'll not allow anyone to break in.

170
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,223
Yes, sir!

171
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,894
That's right, Colonel.

172
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,441
Our safety is more important

173
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,777
as we wait for the attack.

174
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,991
Therefore, anyone who enters our location

175
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,328
will be captured

176
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,582
or killed.

177
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,418
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

178
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,174
Lieutenant, please keep watch outside.

179
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,285
Where can we find those Japanese?

180
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,913
In Escolta.
There are many Japanese shops there.

181
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,624
Those damn Japanese will pay for this.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Eduardo!

183
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,714
Our workplace is closed.
People are looking for our employers.

184
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,674
The people want them arrested.

185
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,843
Uncle, Auntie, why are you here?

186
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,554
I saw them earlier.
They're looking for you.

187
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,974
Can we borrow some money?

188
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,394
We're in a bit of a pinch right now.

189
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,147
Your uncle keeps going to the cockfights.

190
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,361
Auntie Amalia, I'm sorry.
I don't have anything to lend you.

191
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,238
I can't help you.

192
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,616
I have somewhere to be. Tasyo, let's go.

193
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,992
We need to go to the Tanakas.

194
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,327
-They might be there.
-All right.

195
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
Can we come with you?

196
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,749
Maybe your boss can lend us some money.

197
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,626
Uncle, this is not a good time.

198
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,921
Is money all you really think of?
Let's talk some other time.

199
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,048
-Let's go, Tasyo.
-Let's go.

200
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,303
Now, what?
Where are we going to get the money?

201
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,140
Let's follow them.

202
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,521
Where did the constabulary take Hiroshi?

203
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,401
We don't know, Papa. They didn't say.

204
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,571
My God. Poor Hiroshi.

205
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,367
What about his parents?
The Japanese are being arrested.

206
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,035
Don't worry, Mama.

207
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,665
Eduardo has already gone there
to ensure the safety of Hiroshi's family.

208
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,793
I'm sure my brother won't abandon them.

209
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,672
What's important now is to make sure that…

210
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,801
Hiroshi is safe, right?

211
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,141
Wait here. I'll get dressed.

212
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,521
We'll find your boyfriend.

213
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,323
Teresita, what about the show?
Don't we have a performance today?

214
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,575
How can you be so selfish?

215
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,704
We need to be there for Hiroshi,
not your vaudeville!

216
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,581
Mama is right.

217
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,542
I need to go with Papa first.

218
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,005
You go ahead to the theater
and perform for the both of us.

219
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,592
Mama, I'll just get dressed.

220
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,761
Please tell Papa to wait for me here.

221
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
-Get out of there!
-Go away!

222
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,986
-Traitors!
-Go home!

223
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,656
-Get out of here!
-Traitors!

224
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,157
Traitors!

225
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,284
That's enough!

226
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,036
Stop this foolishness.

227
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,133
Lieutenant Colonel.

228
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,847
What do you need, Watanabe?

229
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,476
I'm just curious.

230
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,398
How are you fluent in Tagalog?

231
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,946
Did you also grow up
and study in Manila like I did?

232
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,867
Not everything needs to be known.

233
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,373
Some things are better left unsaid.

234
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,643
Ben? Panyong?

235
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,730
Why are you joining this commotion?

236
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,191
Yeah, what are you doing here?
Isn't Mr. Tanaka our boss?

237
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,736
They've been good to us.
What's your problem?

238
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,530
Even so, they're still Japanese.

239
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,117
They're enemies of the Americans,
so they're also enemies of our country!

240
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,494
-That's right!
-Mr. Tanaka!

241
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,538
I said, enough!

242
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,499
Just because they attacked other places
that are under the Americans,

243
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,794
doesn't mean you should harm
the Japanese in this country!

244
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
What if they're innocent

245
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,635
and have no knowledge of the chaos
happening in Hawaii?

246
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,972
Especially Mr. Tanaka,

247
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,059
who has shown us nothing but kindness!

248
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,187
We don't need to be violent, my friends!

249
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,981
So, leave. Go home.

250
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,611
And don't blame the innocent,
or we'll all get into a fight here!

251
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,988
Enough of this!

252
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,200
-You heard him.
-We will be back!

253
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,703
And I assure you,
we'll bring the constabulary with us.

254
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
-Let's go, comrades!
-Let's go!

255
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,209
-We'll be back!
-We'll be back!

256
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,682
That's just how Filipinos are.

257
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,060
They're even angrier than the Americans.

258
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,106
Let's go. Let's follow them.

259
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,067
What for?
Eduardo isn't even paying attention to us.

260
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
Just do as I say!

261
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,868
Chikara.

262
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,552
How can I refuse to serve our own country

263
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,515
and our beloved Emperor?

264
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,484
Eduardo's here looking for you.

265
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,782
But he's very insistent on talking to you.

266
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,200
Forgive me.

267
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,251
-Good thing we arrived just in time…
-Uncle? Auntie?

268
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,587
You shouldn't have followed us here.

269
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:36,091
We just wanted to help you.
What if those people come back?

270
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,397
Eduardo.

271
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,491
My Uncle Lauro and Auntie Amalia.

272
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,208
Where is Hiroshi?

273
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:21,845
That's why we're here to help,
to help you escape.

274
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,767
I will not leave this house.

275
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,204
Chikara, can we trust his word?

276
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,862
There's nothing we can do.
The world is like that.

277
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,407
Good morning, Daddy Johnny.

278
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,914
-I apologize for coming alone.
-Teresita doesn't have to come.

279
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,671
How can we perform
if there's no one in the audience?

280
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,716
There's no line outside either.

281
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,262
The seats used to be full,
even before the program started.

282
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:51,601
Perhaps, the people panicked
because of what happened to Pearl Harbor.

283
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:57,399
It's likely they wouldn't even consider
watching a stage show.

284
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:04,156
Perhaps it is better
for all of you to go home.

285
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,035
Hurry now! Go home this instant!

286
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,786
Then we'll go ahead.

287
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,626
I'll also take my leave, Daddy Johnny.

288
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,337
Take care.

289
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,506
All of you.

290
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,722
We don't know what will happen next.

291
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,852
Stay safe out there.

292
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,270
Prioritize your safety.

293
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,191
I hope to see you all again…

294
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,821
once this damned war finally ends.

295
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,283
Let's go.

296
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,330
Adelina.

297
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,291
Let's go home together. I'll drop you off.

298
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,251
Why?

299
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,341
I just want to make sure
you get home safe.

300
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,887
You never know, the constabulary
might mistake you for a Japanese.

301
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,101
How can you joke at a time like this?

302
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,522
Can't you see what's going on outside?
It's not funny.

303
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,822
That's why I'll let you accompany me home.

304
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,865
Thank you very much.

305
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,537
-Let's go.
-One moment, I'll just get dressed.

306
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,840
Lord,

307
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,010
please take care of Hiroshi,
wherever he is.

308
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,460
What do you know about him, Lieutenant?

309
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,462
He has no fear.

310
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,341
-He's also merciless to our enemies.
-Get ready.

311
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,886
We're going out
with Lieutenant Nakamura to observe.

312
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,097
It's dangerous for you
to go out of this building.

313
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,184
I've had enough of your insubordination!

314
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,603
COMING UP

315
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,025
I hope so, Eduardo.

316
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,235
Dado! Where's Hiroshi?

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,445
Where did you take him?

318
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,448
-Where are you going?
-I want to know where they're taking them.

319
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,827
I want to make sure they're safe
and they'll be treated like humans.

320
