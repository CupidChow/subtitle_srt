1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,212
<i>My mind is set on becoming a spy
for the guerrillas.</i>

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,841
<i>But before you begin,
we need to test you on a mission first.</i>

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,217
<i>December 8, señor.</i>

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,802
What's your mission?

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,095
Love for the Philippines.

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>Eduardo Dela Cruz isn't dead!</i>

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>Where's Eduardo Dela Cruz?</i>

8
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>My wife, Amalia, knows where he is.</i>

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>Auntie Amalia has been captured.</i>

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>She's being forced to tell him
where he is right now.</i>

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,902
My mouth will remain shut.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,239
I will never tell you where Eduardo is.

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Go to hell.</i>

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>I want you to bring me her daughter.</i>

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>Scour every inch of Manila if you must.</i>

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,207
Papa's dead?

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>Do everything you can to survive.</i>

18
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>I'll talk to Yuta.</i>

19
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:51,551
It's safer for you and me
to part ways for now.

20
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,261
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

21
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,389
<i>How did you know your father is dead?</i>

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,266
<i>I just got a call.</i>

23
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,434
Was it Adelina?

24
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,269
Isn't that right?

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>You can't do that right now, Adelina.</i>

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>It's too dangerous for you.</i>

27
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>There’s a huge bounty on your head.</i>

28
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,487
<i>Either you tell me where Eduardo is,</i>

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,739
<i>or your daughter will experience</i>

30
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>the same things you did
at the hands of my soldiers.</i>

31
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,204
Didn't you say you we have a spy
inside the enemy camp?

32
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,081
Where are you? I'll be there.

33
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,167
<i>You're not leaving my sight.</i>

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>You're not allowed to go anywhere!</i>

35
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,631
PREVIOUSLY

36
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,298
You monster!

37
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,468
You'll tell me where Eduardo is…

38
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,474
or you'll watch your daughter
pay the price.

39
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,936
Answer me!

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,731
Either help us
by telling Eduardo's location

41
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,984
or your daughter suffers.

42
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,165
How can I be sure
that you won't hurt or harm her?

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,334
I'll hand her over immediately
to your husband.

44
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,712
I don't trust Lauro!

45
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:55,174
My daughter is not safe
in the hands of my husband.

46
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,096
I can't possibly let you
hand her over to him!

47
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,812
So what do you plan to do?

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,532
These are the only weapons we found.

49
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,494
We should keep finding more troops

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,581
so we can find more weapons
and ammunition.

51
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,668
Eduardo, don't you think it's about time
we leave this camp?

52
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,297
Aren't you worried
that Jorge might come back here?

53
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,759
Besides, you two got bad blood.

54
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,969
If he's angry,

55
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,974
he might to the unimaginable to you or us.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,604
Jorge isn't a traitor, Tasyo.

57
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,649
He loves our country too much.

58
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,070
I can guarantee that he won't betray us
just because of our feud.

59
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,531
Besides, I'm waiting
for someone to return.

60
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,200
Who?

61
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,285
My Auntie Amalia.

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,089
Mom.

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,384
Where are we going?

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,679
I'm scared.

65
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,603
Whatever happens, just stick with me.

66
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,985
I just know she won't be able
to endure my uncle.

67
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,486
She'll be back.

68
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,031
That's why we can't leave just yet.

69
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,536
Have our men guard the area.

70
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,122
It's always good to be ready.

71
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:59,424
Lieutenant Yamamoto has contacted the camp
in that province to assist you.

72
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,304
More of our forces will attack
Dela Cruz's stronghold.

73
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,599
Make sure to capture him dead or alive!

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,644
- Understand?
- Yes, Colonel!

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,523
Let's go!

76
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,832
Colonel!

77
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,960
Now tell me, Fujita.

78
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,463
Have you found Adelina?

79
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,964
Yes, Colonel.

80
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,717
I know where she is right now.

81
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,896
Wait here.

82
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
I need to check on my wife.

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,900
Yes, Colonel.

84
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,415
Teresita.

85
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,464
You wench!

86
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,509
Teresita!

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,434
Captain.

88
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,602
Why did you decide to meet here?

89
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,731
You know very well
our army is after for you!

90
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>Hey, were you listening?</i>

91
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,654
Eduardo's in danger.

92
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,282
Our soldiers are on their way
to his location,

93
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,910
and his Aunt Amalia is leading the hunt.

94
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,914
Thank you for your help, sir.

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,586
But I've been wanting to ask.

96
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,007
Why are you helping us?

97
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,219
Were you just after the money?

98
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,223
I just want this war to be over.

99
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,145
Forgive me, but please don't speak
in your language.

100
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,482
I can't understand you.

101
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:08,988
I don't even know what's right
or wrong in this war anymore.

102
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,949
What are you saying?

103
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,746
Forgive me, I just wanted
to check on my father.

104
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:22,460
I tried calling him in Japan,
but no one answered me, Captain.

105
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm sorry, Hiroshi.

106
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:32,803
They're no longer happy
with our army, Colonel.

107
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,847
Traitor!

108
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,934
Lieutenant, what happened to Tanaka?

109
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,646
Did you follow the order
I gave you over the phone?

110
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,733
Yes, Colonel.
Tanaka has been taken cared of.

111
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,817
He was killed earlier.

112
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,819
But…

113
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,449
your father is dead.

114
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,295
My father is dead?

115
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,800
Are you messing with me?

116
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,229
How?

117
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,397
Where?

118
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,232
What happened, Akio?

119
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,280
Someone killed him before he could board
the ship bound to Japan.

120
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,380
He never got to board the ship
and your father died on the spot.

121
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,975
Who gave the orders to kill him?

122
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,896
I think you already know who he is.

123
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm tired.

124
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,741
I no longer want to be a part
of this atrocious war.

125
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,369
I'm done.

126
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,751
I just want to go home
and be with my family.

127
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,758
<i>Was it our Colonel?</i>

128
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,929
He also killed
a respected officer of mine.

129
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,515
Colonel Arata.

130
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,486
I recently discovered the evidence.

131
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,631
Now I know why Colonel Arata
was never found.

132
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,259
He was murdered
and he's been dead all along.

133
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,889
It's no surprise
why the Colonel killed your father.

134
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,975
He killed him
because he was going to expose him

135
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,435
to our General Homma.

136
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,528
Where's the Colonel?

137
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,280
Bring me to him, Akio!

138
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,742
Bring me to him!

139
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,289
Have you gone mad?

140
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,852
Please.

141
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,773
Lend me your gun.

142
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,650
Are you stupid?

143
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,570
Akio.

144
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:22,450
I need your gun
to protect myself and Adelina.

145
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,536
She's the only one I have left.

146
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,129
I don't want another friend of mine dead.

147
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,090
This is too foolish!

148
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,439
Be safe, my friend.

149
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,858
Please.

150
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>We already buried him</i>

151
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,393
<i>in the backyard of Uncle Johnny’s house.</i>

152
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,025
<i>We put a cross on his grave.</i>

153
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,574
Mr. Nakamura?

154
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,211
What are you doing here?

155
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,589
Colonel.

156
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,425
Who were you talking to on the phone?

157
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
Forgive me, Colonel.

158
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,389
I was just talking to a friend.

159
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,894
Tell my soldiers to be ready.

160
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,065
I want Adelina Dela Cruz arrested.

161
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,861
Mr. Fujita will join them.

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,574
He'll tell you where she's hiding.

163
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,785
Yes, Colonel! I will tell them right away.

164
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,041
Lieutenant Nakamura,
allow me to accompany you.

165
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

166
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:56,163
<i>Where the deer and the antelope play</i>

167
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,042
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>

168
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,545
<i>A discouraging word</i>

169
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:10,552
<i>And the skies are not cloudy all day…</i>

170
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,886
I know where Adelina Dela Cruz is.

171
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,315
There it is. That's their hideout.

172
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,942
Go, surround the house.

173
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,695
Five of you go around back!

174
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,906
The rest, stay with me!

175
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,784
Come on!

176
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,079
We'll guard the front!

177
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,790
Now you've seen your father's grave,

178
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:07,753
I guess you've already mourned enough.

179
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,089
Adelina! Manuela!

180
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,757
Run away!

181
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,133
Run away!

182
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,802
Adelina!

183
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,021
My country…

184
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,031
Adelina.

185
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,462
Let's go.

186
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,781
Over here!

187
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,326
Let's go.

188
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,048
Can't you give me more time, Yuta?

189
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,388
A few minutes aren't enough
to grieve for my father,

190
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,268
especially since I never got to mourn
for my mother.

191
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,109
I'll mourn over the deaths of my parents
for as long as I want, Yuta!

192
00:19:55,527 --> 00:20:00,282
I have no time
for your sentiments, Teresita.

193
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,786
Then leave me alone!

194
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,250
Let me mourn and cry for my father!

195
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
Just leave me alone!

196
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,214
All of you!

197
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:17,966
What do you want?

198
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,429
Are you going to cry all day and night?

199
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,727
If so, you might as well weep
for the deaths

200
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,856
of Eduardo and Adelina Dela Cruz.

201
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,525
I'm sure that by now

202
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,613
my soldiers have tracked them down

203
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,490
and killed them.

204
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
You monster!

205
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,080
You heartless beast!

206
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,081
Go to hell!

207
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,999
Take your soldiers with you!

208
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,751
All of you can go to hell!

209
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,506
May God curse you all!

210
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:07,015
Your God can do nothing, Teresita.

211
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,017
Let go of me.

212
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,061
Please just let me go.

213
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,479
Set me free!

214
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,743
You won't escape me.

215
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,871
As long as I live,

216
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,209
I'll never let you go.

217
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,465
Bring her home!

218
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,550
Yes, Colonel!

219
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,520
Why don't you just kill me, Yuta?

220
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>Tell the camp that we're here.
We'll wait for their arrival.</i>

221
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>I'll kill your leader
if you kill my daughter.</i>

222
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,881
My name is Hiroshi Tanaka.
I'm Adelina's boyfriend.

223
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>Where can I find her?</i>

224
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,176
<i>Sir, where could she have gone?</i>

225
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,636
She went to her brother's camp.

226
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>I hope she gets there safely</i>

227
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,848
<i>without our soldiers capturing her.</i>

228
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:35,353
<i>If you kill me,
my soldiers will kill you and your child.</i>

229
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,605
Looks like there's an attack.

230
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,899
Tasyo. Panyong. Stay here.

231
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,275
<i>Stay with Juan.</i>

232
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,610
<i>That was for the guerillas.</i>

233
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
<i>So they would find us.</i>

234
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,321
<i>We'll make them come to us.</i>

235
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,031
COMING UP

236
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,120
