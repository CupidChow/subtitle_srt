1
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,666
Francisco, please put my things there.

2
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,463
I'm glad you're still awake.

3
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,088
Mama.

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,717
Good evening, señora.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,262
I have some good news for you.

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,433
I met with Mr. Tanaka
at Tom's Dixie earlier.

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,812
Mr. Tanaka? Hiroshi's father?

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,859
Why are you meddling in our conversation?

9
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,069
Mama.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
Goodness me.

11
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,032
She is ruining my evening.

12
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,581
As I was saying, I'm happy
that I met with Mr. Tanaka,

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,084
especially since we
discussed very important news.

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,714
This is for you too.
For your bright future.

15
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,718
Why? What did you talk about?

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
I've been away for a long time.

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,852
I worked in Hong Kong. I just
returned to the Philippines.

18
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,190
I've saved a considerable amount.

19
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:54,656
Johnny, I saved up enough to
rebuild my burned-down theater.

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,408
That's why I'm here,

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,536
because I need your help.

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,619
My friend.

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,834
You know very well I
can't say no to your favors.

24
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,417
However,

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,549
I believe your children
will be more helpful to you.

26
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,803
You know Adelina and Teresita?

27
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,975
They joined my company
to become performers.

28
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,858
They followed in your footsteps.

29
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,570
Your daughters have great potential.

30
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,201
And it will be even more grand

31
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,538
if the theater is rebuilt
as soon as possible.

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,831
My friend.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,127
That's the only thing
I can leave my children.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,296
How are they?

35
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,383
I think they detest me.

36
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,051
Especially since I left them.

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,512
No, they hold no grudges against you.

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,765
In fact, they are proud of you.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,230
Thank you for your words.

40
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,027
No matter how few…

41
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,324
they ease my worries.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,042
Do you still remember the lot

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,503
where your father's burned-down theater is?

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,386
What does that have to do with Mr. Tanaka?

45
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,095
A lot.

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,266
That's because I told him

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,102
I was going to sell that lot to him.

48
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,857
Sell? What? You will
sell my father's theater?

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,904
What use is it to me? Be
glad someone took an interest.

50
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,072
But, Mama…

51
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,117
Adelina and I already have plans.

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,330
What plans?

53
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,753
I hope I'm wrong…

54
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,881
about whatever you're
planning for that land.

55
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:22,679
Mama, why don't we revive the
theater instead of selling it?

56
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,641
That's the only memory we
have left of our father, señora.

57
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,230
I don't care about your father.

58
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,607
Or whatever memories you have of him.

59
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,736
I ought to sell that land now,

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
especially if you two
are plotting something.

61
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,700
But, Mama, what if Papa comes back?

62
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,912
- He will surely be hurt.
- Your father isn't coming back!

63
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,373
He might even be dead.

64
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,129
So stop whatever you're planning.

65
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,299
Especially since, Teresita,

66
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,094
I've already decided to find you a husband.

67
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,640
A husband?

68
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,478
And I already have someone in
mind. I'm sure he's perfect for you.

69
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,990
Are you hoping that Teresita
will look out the window again

70
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,578
so you can admire her beauty?

71
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,124
Shut up, someone might hear you.

72
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,669
Oh, Eduardo.

73
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,967
Keep doing this and you'll
just lose her to somebody else.

74
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,851
But, Mama, marriage is
not my priority right now.

75
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,313
Teresita, are we really
going to argue about this?

76
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,068
You should just follow everything I say.

77
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,823
Why should she follow you if
that doesn't make her happy?

78
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,074
Stay out of this!

79
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,453
Adelina, enough.

80
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,621
No, Teresita.

81
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:59,168
Señora, I don't mind being
a servant in this household.

82
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:04,966
But it's not fair for you to meddle
with my sister's choice of husband!

83
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,135
Who are you to talk to me like that?

84
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,762
-Enough, Adelina. -Teresita!

85
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,892
Can you stand being with a
man you don't love or even know?

86
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,811
With all due respect, señora,

87
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,189
but I won't let you do this to my sister.

88
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,941
And if you ask me,

89
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,528
you shouldn't have meddled
with my father's land and theater!

90
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
That belongs to my father, not you!

91
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,698
-You insolent child! -Mama!

92
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,118
-Mama, let her go! -You little devil!

93
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,828
You've got no shame!

94
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,915
- You shameless girl!
- Mama, don't hurt my sister!

95
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,086
I've had it with you!

96
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:47,133
From now on, I don't want
to see your face in my house!

97
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,512
Adelina. Adelina, go upstairs!

98
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,182
No! She's not going upstairs.

99
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,310
I don't want to see your face in my house!

100
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,561
Get out!

101
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,939
Adelina, please don't leave.

102
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,025
-Don't leave. -Get out!

103
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,902
Fine, I'll leave!

104
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,653
Adelina!

105
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,322
Mama…

106
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,246
Your life will be so much
better without that bastard!

107
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,916
Ma…

108
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
My friend.

109
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,722
Can you please not tell
my children that we met?

110
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,182
Keep it a secret from them.

111
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,267
Why? Don't you want to see them?

112
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,187
I want to surprise them.

113
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,733
When will they perform on stage again?

114
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,071
The morning of this Saturday.
That's what we agreed on.

115
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,615
In that case, I'll watch them.

116
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,871
I'll prepare for our reunion that day.

117
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,793
They'll surely be delighted and surprised.

118
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,128
My friend.

119
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,593
It would be an honor to
have you as our special guest.

120
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,345
Thank you.

121
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,584
Looks like you've saved up quite a bit.

122
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,171
Can you lend me some?

123
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,255
Forget it.

124
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,468
I'm saving this to buy
a small piece of land.

125
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,889
I want to build a small house for Teresita.

126
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,058
So…

127
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,979
I can have a small dowry to offer her.

128
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,192
We'll see about that. You're
so shy when it comes to her.

129
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,861
How can you make that happen?

130
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,411
I'm too embarrassed to court
her because I have nothing.

131
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,165
But with a little more money,
I'll be able to buy the land.

132
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,500
Eduardo!

133
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,799
Move aside!

134
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,013
It's late. Why did you come rushing here?

135
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,058
What happened?

136
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,352
Because…

137
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,231
the señora kicked me out after she hurt me.

138
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,486
She hurt you again?

139
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,534
I don't want to go back to her, Eduardo!

140
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,372
I've had enough. She's so cruel.

141
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,626
Do you know she's selling Dad's
theater to Hiroshi's father?

142
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,336
God!

143
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,797
Teresita and I have long
dreamed of restoring that theater.

144
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,341
And now it will all be for nothing?

145
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,346
What did Teresita say?

146
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,643
Oh, Eduardo.

147
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,105
She has a bigger problem.

148
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,485
Señora intends to marry
her off, to just any man.

149
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,446
Is that right?

150
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,451
To dictate my sister's life like
that, even though it's against her will?

151
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,997
Oh, no.

152
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,710
Say your goodbyes to
your dream house and wife.

153
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,258
I'm going there, you stay here.

154
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,759
Huh?

155
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,219
-Eduardo! -Hey!

156
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,139
Your brother…

157
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,724
Who knows what he'll do. You
know how he is when he's mad.

158
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,568
I'm not doing all this for myself.

159
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,278
This is for your own good, Teresita.

160
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,780
How will it be good, Mama?

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,242
Please, Teresita.

162
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,994
Just obey me.

163
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,413
This is for your future.

164
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:32,084
Besides, I won't choose
an irresponsible man.

165
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,463
I'll make sure you'll like him.

166
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,006
And most importantly,

167
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,302
I'll make sure he meets all my standards.

168
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:47,349
So I can be sure you'll
be content and happy!

169
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,064
Oh, my.

170
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,568
What are you doing here, huh?

171
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,195
And why did you enter my house?

172
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,071
Eduardo…

173
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:07,369
I'm here to get my sister's things
since you kicked her out, right?

174
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,206
Yolanda, Meding!

175
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,332
Come here!

176
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,833
No need, señora.

177
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,335
I'll get my things myself.

178
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,337
Come, Adelina. I'll help you.

179
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,757
Eduardo, wait for me outside.

180
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,841
She's right.

181
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,511
Wait outside, that's where you belong!

182
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,470
Eduardo.

183
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,057
Wait for me outside.

184
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,766
Please.

185
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,478
No.

186
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,900
I'd rather wait here.

187
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,534
Don't you dare sit there!

188
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,997
Adelina, go ahead. Don't mind me.

189
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,042
Get your things.

190
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,169
Eduardo.

191
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,711
Hurry up!

192
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,731
Teresita, I'm so sorry I left.

193
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,650
I couldn't bear your mother anymore.

194
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
I understand.

195
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,903
And I think you made the right decision.

196
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,241
You'll be free and you
won't get hurt anymore

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,244
if you stay with Eduardo for now.

198
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,913
But, Teresita, what about you?

199
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,165
What about Dad's land and theater?

200
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,505
Adelina.

201
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,050
Adelina, don't worry.

202
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,387
We'll take it back, okay?

203
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,472
No matter what happens.

204
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,159
Why are you looking at me like that?

205
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,454
Why does it seem like you want to kill me?

206
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,166
If I could hit a woman or an elderly,

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,376
I would've done so earlier.

208
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,961
You insolent brat.

209
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,839
Stand up and get out of my house!

210
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,093
Is that how you kicked my sister out…

211
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,388
like she's some dog?

212
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,642
Get out.

213
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,226
Why?

214
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,855
Are you afraid of me?

215
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,943
Because you know you can't beat me,

216
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,947
unlike those two women that
you scare and manipulate.

217
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,031
Get out!

218
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,076
Yolanda, Meding, Francisco!

219
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,410
Come this instant!

220
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,663
Now I understand

221
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,209
why Uncle Julio cheated on you

222
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,420
and fell in love with our mother.

223
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,631
Because you're a terrible person.

224
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,265
You are a pitiful woman.

225
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:21,522
The day will come when you'll
be left all alone and no one…

226
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,733
will love you because you're rotten!

227
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,195
Francisco, throw this man out!

228
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,279
Right now!

229
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,472
You scoundrel! You have no shame!

230
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,351
Meding! Yolanda! Call the constable!

231
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,936
I will have that man arrested!

232
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,148
Who, Mama?

233
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,235
Who else but the shameless
brother of that bastard?

234
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,239
What did my brother do to you?

235
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,159
That's right, Mama. Why
would you have him arrested?

236
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,578
Because he hurt me!

237
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,580
That man slapped me.

238
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,831
He's so cruel.

239
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,625
He even hurt an old woman like me.

240
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,294
So, Meding…

241
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,047
Meding! Yolanda! Call the constable!

242
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,466
I will have that man arrested!

243
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,677
Wait a moment.

244
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,305
Wait, wait.

245
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,685
Wait, señora.

246
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,729
Did my brother really hurt you?

247
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,814
Why? Don't you believe me?

248
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,444
Mama, Eduardo may act foolish,
but he wouldn't hurt a woman.

249
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,946
Have you two forgotten?

250
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,616
He hurt me when you were little children!

251
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,580
Eduardo, don't!

252
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,041
Did you really think he
wouldn't do that again?

253
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,459
He did it right now!

254
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,378
That man hit me.

255
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,006
My face still hurts from what he did!

256
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,927
Señora, I'm asking for your
forgiveness for my brother.

257
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,640
- Please, forgive him.
- I don't need your apology!

258
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,185
I will have your brother arrested!

259
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,062
Please don't.

260
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,271
Don't…

261
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,902
That's right!

262
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,321
Tell your brother to be scared

263
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,325
because I will have him
arrested by the constables!

264
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,702
Mama…

265
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,704
Calm down, Mama.

266
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,500
Insolent brats.

267
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,136
Hey.

268
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,183
Wait, did you…

269
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,102
Did you leave Adelina behind?

270
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,397
I've had enough of their señora.

271
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,901
If I didn't leave, who knows
what I could've done to her!

272
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,241
Eduardo!

273
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,953
What's wrong with you?

274
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,373
You hit women now? Why
did you hurt Señora Carmela?

275
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,084
What do you mean? I didn't even touch her!

276
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,794
You didn't?

277
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,882
But she told us you hit her so many times.

278
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,551
That's why she's calling
the constable as we speak.

279
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,388
Look at what you've got yourself into now!

280
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,142
I know what to do.

281
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,768
Let's stay at Auntie Amalia's for now.

282
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,520
-You hide there for now... -Wait.

283
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,523
Me? Hide? Why should I hide?

284
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,277
I didn't do anything
wrong! I only scolded her!

285
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:01,533
I will not leave this place even
if she calls an army of constables!

286
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
Now you see, Teresita.

287
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,262
They are nothing but trouble!

288
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,641
They don't even respect your own mother.

289
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,768
Mama, enough.

290
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,145
That's enough talking for now.

291
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,731
Meding.

292
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,905
Where are they? Where are the constables?

293
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,365
They are on their way, señora.

294
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,824
Good.

295
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,373
Rest now, Teresita.

296
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,500
I will wait for them.

297
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,588
Teresita.

298
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,092
Get some rest.

299
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,304
All right, Mama.

300
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,857
Get away from me, Eduardo.

301
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,192
Be quiet, Teresita.

302
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,948
How dare you. Why did you hurt Mama?

303
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,242
And you believed her?

304
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,663
Teresita, on my and Adelina's lives,

305
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,349
I swear I didn't raise even a
single finger against your mother.

306
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,712
She is only making up
her accusations against me.

307
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,174
Are you saying that Mama is lying?

308
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,092
Teresita, you know me.

309
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,389
Ever since we were small, even
if I am poor, I am not a liar.

310
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,852
And I am not someone who just hurts others.

311
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,105
I don't know who is telling the truth.

312
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,526
But she stands by her word,
she will have you arrested.

313
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,238
I hope you are telling the truth, Eduardo.

314
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,910
Because your life will surely
be ruined if you are found guilty.

315
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,004
I saw that Eduardo slap you, señora?

316
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,090
Yes.

317
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,760
And that's what you'll tell
the constables when they get here.

318
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,098
That way, I have a witness
to what that man did to me.

319
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,103
Are you asking me to lie
to get that man arrested?

320
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,188
Why, yes.

321
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:23,151
Because I've always hated that vagabond.
I really want to teach him a lesson.

322
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,739
And I really want those siblings
to disappear from my daughter's life.

323
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,867
They are becoming such a
bad influence on Teresita.

324
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,207
And I think I better start with Eduardo.

325
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,754
Where did Eduardo go?

326
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,258
Don't worry.

327
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,428
There he is.

328
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,684
Eduardo, where did you go this time?

329
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,767
Listen.

330
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,523
When the constables arrive,
I will go with them willingly.

331
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,859
You won't interfere, do you understand?

332
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,611
But you didn't do anything wrong.

333
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,406
That's why I will go willingly.

334
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,076
I know the truth will come
out. I can take care of myself.

335
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,376
Anybody home?

336
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,336
-Anybody home? -Anybody home?

337
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
Good evening.

338
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,070
We were told that Mrs. Borromeo
has something to report to us.

339
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,347
Yes, I am Mrs. Borromeo.

340
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,100
I do have someone I want you to arrest.

341
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,059
He's over there.

342
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,563
A man hit me and threatened my life.

343
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,815
-Hurry! -Let's go.

344
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,901
Hurry.

345
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,663
Show them, Francisco.

346
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,124
Here they come.

347
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,087
-There he is. -Oh, no.

348
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,219
Yes, that's him.

349
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,138
Eduardo.

350
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,890
Eduardo, listen to me.

351
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,686
Let's just go to Auntie
Amalia while we still can.

352
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,233
I won't run away. I am not a criminal.

353
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,619
Eduardo, let's go.

354
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,537
It's that man. The mestizo.

355
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,374
He's the one. Please arrest him.

356
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,667
Don't believe her!

357
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,711
She's only making up her accusations!

358
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,296
What are you talking about?

359
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,674
My driver was there.
He witnessed everything.

360
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,552
Francisco, tell them what
happened. Tell them what you saw.

361
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,846
What my señora said is true.

362
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,183
I witnessed how that man hit her.

363
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,768
-You lying snake. -Eduardo!

364
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,478
-You weren't there! -Eduardo!

365
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,188
You are just like your señora.

366
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,318
See? That man is really violent.
Arrest him! Take him to prison!

367
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,778
Wait! Let go of me!

368
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,073
- Don't resist!
- I'm not resisting! I will go with you!

369
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,827
Please go easy on him. Not too tight.

370
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,579
-He won't run away. -Let's go!

371
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,132
Teresita!

372
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,883
Teresita, help us!

373
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
Please help Eduardo!

374
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,682
Teresita! Don't get involved! Get inside!

375
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,064
Teresita, help us! Help us!

376
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,527
Tasyo, I
have no money to pay for a lawyer.

377
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,552
Me neither.

378
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:22,182
But if memory serves
me right, your brother saved some money.

379
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,392
I know Eduardo is innocent, Mama.

380
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,104
That you fabricated
everything to keep me away from them!

381
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,482
Do not accuse me of that!

382
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,485
- Mama!
- It's been so long since I came here.

383
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,820
How are my Filipino childhood friends?

384
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:40,367
Teresita, Eduardo, and Adelina?

385
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,661
Our first attack in this country
will take place in December.

386
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,122
First, Pearl Harbor.

387
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,792
And then, the whole nation.

388
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,354
We need to
prepare for our performance tomorrow.

389
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,148
The people will
finally watch Adelina and Teresita tomorrow.

390
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,591
We can't miss it.

391
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,844
I have arranged for your orders.

392
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,971
My friends have taught them a lesson.

393
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,181
Carry him!

394
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,393
COMING UP

395
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:13,316
