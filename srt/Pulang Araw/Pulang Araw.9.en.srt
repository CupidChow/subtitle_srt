1
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,618
Teresita, don't let what
the señora said get to you.

2
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,537
You will only feel worse.

3
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,214
Adelina, maybe vaudeville
really isn't for me.

4
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,720
You should pursue it alone.

5
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,058
Teresita, no…

6
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,271
There you go again.

7
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,360
We already talked about this.
Why are you giving up now?

8
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,826
Adelina, I don't want Mama to separate us.

9
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:03,998
You are more important
to me than my dreams.

10
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:14,092
So don't let us stop you from reaching it.

11
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,014
You must continue our dream.

12
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,603
Even if you're all alone.

13
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,982
I will still be happy for you.

14
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,401
No.

15
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,531
Teresita, I don't want to do it alone.

16
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,161
Remember, this is our dream.

17
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,123
That's why we need to
reach our dreams together.

18
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,417
I can't do it alone.

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,588
We won't give up.

20
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,090
We're going to fight for this, all right?

21
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:58,928
But I know Mama is true to her word.

22
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,140
She's going to kick you out of here.

23
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,936
Even if I'm against it.

24
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,442
Adelina, I already lost Papa.

25
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,280
I don't want to lose you too.

26
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
That's never going to happen.

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,455
Fine.

28
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,918
If that's what the señora wants,
if she wants me to leave, I'll leave.

29
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,463
But that doesn't mean
you're going to lose me.

30
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,673
If that happens,

31
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,636
I will just stay at my brother's hut.

32
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,640
Just look out the window, we
can still see each other every day.

33
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,142
What can the señora do about that?

34
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,312
You're right.

35
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,024
See?

36
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,359
Don't worry.

37
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,984
You went to school,

38
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,780
but you're not exactly the
sharpest tool in the shed.

39
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,827
Now you're laughing at yourself.

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,207
Just remember, Teresita.

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,212
For Dad and his theater.

42
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,882
We won't give up.

43
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,095
We won't give up.

44
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,805
We won't give up.

45
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,973
We won't give up.

46
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,130
It's not enough.

47
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,467
-No, it's not. -Eduardo!

48
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,843
Hey!

49
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,926
It's Adelina.

50
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,059
You know, Adelina, you get
more beautiful every day.

51
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,226
Do you know that?

52
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,437
-A little. -Go away.

53
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,149
Stop hitting on my sister
or you'll get some from me.

54
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,275
-What? -Get lost!

55
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,693
Eduardo.

56
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,863
- What's this?
- I snuck out some lunch for you.

57
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,990
Nice, I'm eating good again today.

58
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,289
Why isn't Teresita with you?

59
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,086
Señora won't let her out.

60
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,588
She's locked in her room.

61
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,301
So we're just lying low
until the señora calms down.

62
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,138
If that's the case, I feel sorry for her.

63
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,269
My boss is here. You should go.

64
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,187
Mr. Tanaka.

65
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,944
What does he mean by, "he is fine"?

66
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,257
Seriously? That's all he had to say?

67
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,928
How about you? Have you
heard anything from Hiroshi?

68
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,390
-Hey. -Ouch!

69
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,725
-Tell me the truth. -What?

70
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,644
Do you still have feelings for Hiroshi?

71
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,813
Is that why you keep asking about him?

72
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,440
Come on, Adelina.

73
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,859
You're a woman. You shouldn't
be chasing after a man.

74
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,445
Shut up. I was just curious.

75
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,405
I just want to know.

76
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,283
You're so quick to judge. I'm leaving!

77
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,034
You better.

78
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,497
Idiot. Watch where you're going.

79
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,377
You, Filipino. Call your master.

80
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,713
Tell him Watanabe is here.

81
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,008
Watch how you talk to
me. I am not your slave.

82
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,136
Eduardo. Hey.

83
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,763
You might get into trouble again.

84
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,517
Mr. Tanaka!

85
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,404
Mr. Watanabe.

86
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,325
Is it done?

87
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,827
Yes.

88
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,711
That man looks familiar.

89
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,880
I'd love to land a punch on that jerk.

90
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,259
I think you're just hungry.
No wonder you're so sour.

91
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,137
-Just eat already. -And you should go home.

92
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,307
-Go, leave. Thanks. -Bye.

93
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,070
Were you able to capture
everything important?

94
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,153
Yes.

95
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,453
Who is that nosy girl?

96
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,623
No one.

97
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,544
Don't worry about her. You can go.

98
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:17,974
My dear
Hiroshi, I hope you are doing well.

99
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:30,486
In the ten years
you've been gone, our city has changed a lot.

100
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,077
You might not recognize
Manila anymore if you ever do come back.

101
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:40,663
The fields we
used to play in when we were kids are gone.

102
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:13,112
That part of
Avenida is now filled with theaters, eateries,

103
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,156
and commercial buildings.

104
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,652
The Philippines
also has its second president.

105
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,956
He is President Manuel Quezon,

106
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,961
who was elected last November 15, 1935,

107
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,297
under the Commonwealth government

108
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,885
as we prepare
our country for its independence,

109
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:42,725
which America promises to grant in 1946.

110
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,729
Finally, like your country, Japan,

111
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:52,068
the Philippines
will be a free and independent nation.

112
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,780
Just as I pray for my father,

113
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,783
I pray that you come back too.

114
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,953
So you can
witness more of the beautiful changes

115
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,830
here in your birthplace.

116
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,999
And just like my brother,

117
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,085
you can be with us.

118
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,879
I hope.

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,382
Always hopeful…

120
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,052
Your friend, Adelina.

121
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,690
Good day, señora.

122
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,280
I will be going out and I'll be home late.

123
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,535
But that doesn't mean
you can sneak out again.

124
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,671
Just try and involve my
daughter in your foolishness,

125
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,092
I won't just send you away,

126
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,057
I will break your bones too.

127
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,644
Is that clear?

128
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,437
America seems to be afraid.

129
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,690
Who are you listening to?

130
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,362
Roosevelt, the President of America,

131
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,699
declared a state of emergency

132
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,411
against the threat of the Nazis and Italy.

133
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,788
Fools!

134
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,334
Don't they know they should fear

135
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,670
our honorable country and Emperor?

136
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,467
Especially as this country's
independence from the Americans draws near.

137
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,805
Long live the Emperor!

138
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,098
Long live!

139
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,059
Long live!

140
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,936
Long live!

141
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,122
Adelina, is it true that Mama's not home?

142
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,374
Yes, she left a while ago.

143
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,252
How are you?

144
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,421
Don't worry about me.

145
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,006
Come on, let's get dressed.

146
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,592
-We're leaving. -Where are we going?

147
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,636
This is our only chance.

148
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,307
We're going to the theater
of that old impresario.

149
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,103
We will convince him
to let us audition again.

150
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,273
Who knows, he might say yes.

151
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,442
But what about the señora?

152
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,404
She'll be really angry once
she finds out we're gone.

153
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,283
Do you know what she will do to me,

154
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,952
to us, if we disobey her again?

155
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,677
As I said,

156
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,514
this is our only chance.

157
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,523
Adelina, I'll ask you the same question.

158
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,152
Are you willing to give up our dreams

159
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,155
just because we're afraid of Mama?

160
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,753
Hold on.

161
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,838
Let me get dressed.

162
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,383
Then we'll pick up my brother.
We need him there with us.

163
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,386
Okay. Just be quick. Let's go.

164
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,353
-Good afternoon! -Good afternoon.

165
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,403
I applaud you for coming back here.

166
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,738
All right, I'll give you a chance.

167
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,743
But please don't waste my time again.

168
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,832
Because, if you fail again,

169
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,630
I won't allow you to come
back to my theater again.

170
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,507
Is that clear?

171
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,260
-Thank you very much. -Go ahead.

172
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,595
You may start with your audition.

173
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,847
We will.

174
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,604
Are you ready, Adelina?

175
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,898
I'm really nervous.

176
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,567
But I won't give up.

177
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,236
Then let's start.

178
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,555
Wherever
you are Be it the city or the country

179
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:42,144
You will
always bump into The naughty clown

180
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,521
Here he comes, making noise

181
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,149
With his loose pants

182
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:52,780
And there like
a fool Roaming the streets, growling

183
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,863
Ouch

184
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,365
Oh, no

185
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,325
Silly clown

186
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,618
Hey!

187
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,535
Ouch

188
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
Oh, no

189
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,788
Silly clown

190
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,955
Hey!

191
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,711
Hey!

192
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,795
Hey!

193
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,926
Even his forehead

194
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,636
He already shaved

195
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,558
His walk and moves have changed

196
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,646
Roaming the streets, singing…

197
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,025
In English without lyrics…

198
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,902
And with a ukelele!

199
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,406
Greet him, "How are you?"

200
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:42,538
And he replies, "Well, see for yourself!"

201
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,915
- Hey!
- Tagalog

202
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,601
-Mi -No habla

203
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:51,839
You silly, silly clown

204
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,570
Hey! Tagalog?

205
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,197
Mi, no speak!

206
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,743
You silly, silly…

207
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,079
- Clown!
- Clown!

208
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,710
Clown!

209
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,338
Bravo!

210
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,300
That's the new talent I'm looking for!

211
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,470
Congratulations!

212
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,899
Thank you.

213
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,193
Thank you. Thank you, señor.

214
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,781
My God.

215
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,410
Teresita, we're finally
making our dreams come true.

216
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,829
-Thank you. -Thank you.

217
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,814
Almost everyone who comes
here to eat looks wealthy.

218
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,192
We will definitely meet
a lot of people for sure.

219
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,779
And maybe we can find a suitable
man for your daughter here.

220
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,530
I hope so.

221
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,702
Your table is ready.

222
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,829
-Please follow me. -Thank you.

223
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,667
Do you know that Japanese man?

224
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,214
-Mrs. Carmela. -Yes.

225
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,801
The Japanese businessmen here have money.

226
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,472
So it's a good thing you
accepted his invitation.

227
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,603
Maybe we'll find a worthy
husband among them for Teresita.

228
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,438
Except…

229
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,485
Do you really want your
daughter to marry another race?

230
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,823
I don't care what her husband's race is.

231
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:27,119
What's important is, I marry her off
so she can have a good and quiet life.

232
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,619
Let's go.

233
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,667
Mr. Tanaka.

234
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,230
May I?

235
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,994
I still can't believe it, Teresita!

236
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,829
Me too. Thank you, Heavenly Father.

237
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,540
You two were great earlier.

238
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,335
Adelina, did you come up with
the song you performed earlier?

239
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,544
Of course.

240
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,048
I remember Mom taught me that song before.

241
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,133
You laughed the whole time too, remember?

242
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,302
Not only did you make me laugh now,

243
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,889
you also made me cry because
I remembered our mother.

244
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,893
Oh, my. A thug like you can cry after all.

245
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,314
I was just joking.

246
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,483
Me? Cry?

247
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,276
I'm a man, but…

248
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,614
your performance earlier was
really great and entertaining.

249
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,616
If that's how you'll perform all the time,

250
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,161
I'm sure people will be
delighted to watch you.

251
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:56,458
One day, everyone will look
up to and admire you two.

252
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,503
I wish for that too.

253
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,588
Me too, Eduardo.

254
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,050
Oh, Teresita.

255
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,678
Once we become real stars,

256
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,306
maybe Dad will come home.

257
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,476
Especially after we
rebuild his theater, right?

258
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,105
Hear our prayers, Lord. Hear us.

259
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,944
Let's go.

260
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,071
-Your treat? -Where do you want to go?

261
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,038
Do you have any information
about this, Mr. Tanaka?

262
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,961
Our Emperor opposes the
invasion of other nations,

263
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,924
unlike what the Nazis and
Italians are doing in Europe.

264
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,286
Of course, Mrs. Haruka.

265
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,913
I've known Hiroshi
since he was a little boy.

266
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm glad he's coming
back to the Philippines.

267
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,766
Not a single word to Mama
that we went out earlier, okay?

268
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,767
-Yes, Miss. -Yes, Miss.

269
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,144
I'm not a snitch.

270
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,064
Thank you very much, Yolanda, Meding.

271
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,026
All right, you may rest now.

272
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,536
Teresita.

273
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,997
We should pray that your
mama goes out more often,

274
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,833
so we can sneak out too.

275
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,296
But that rarely happens.

276
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,841
What are we going to do once
we start doing vaudeville?

277
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,636
How can we hide that from your mother?

278
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,932
We'll find a way. I don't
want to think about it for now.

279
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:22,270
What's important is we took the first
step towards fulfilling our dreams.

280
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,356
It's just a shame.

281
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,651
Papa isn't here.

282
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,364
I'm sure he'll be the
first one to congratulate us.

283
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,869
I would love to see the
smile on his face right now.

284
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,958
And I'm sure he's going
to give us a big hug.

285
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,919
I can't wait to hug Dad again.

286
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,838
Come here, you.

287
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,258
Why don't you give me a hug instead?

288
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,564
Johnny!

289
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,610
Julio?

290
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,282
-Johnny Duque! My friend! -It is you!

291
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,789
-How are you? -I'm great! How are you?

292
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,416
May I talk to you?

293
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,459
Why, sure.

294
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,295
I have a favor to ask you.

295
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,297
Have you eaten?

296
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,217
-Let's talk in my office. -All the better.

297
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,763
You look great.

298
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,810
Do you still remember the lot

299
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,646
where your father's burned-down theater is?

300
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,733
What does that have to do with Mr. Tanaka?

301
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,193
I'm going to sell that lot to him.

302
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,530
Keep your hands off my
father's lot and theater!

303
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,198
That belongs to my father, not you!

304
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,491
-You insolent child! -Mama!

305
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:04,331
Now I understand why
Uncle Julio cheated on you.

306
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,707
You're a terrible person.

307
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,584
COMING UP

308
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,210
Meding! Yolanda!

309
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,962
Call the constable!

310
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,589
I will have that man arrested!

311
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,758
How dare you. Why did you hurt Mama?

312
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,426
And you believed her?

313
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,261
I will go with them willingly.

314
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,971
But you didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,806
I know the truth will come out.

316
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,266
I can take care of myself.

317
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,566
