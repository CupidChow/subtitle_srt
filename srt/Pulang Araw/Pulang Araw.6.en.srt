1
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,173
Adelina.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,222
Do you know that a person
only prays when they're on the verge of death?

3
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,728
That's because, in moments like this,

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,917
there's nothing
else for someone like me to hold on to.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:34,010
Do you also know,
Adelina, in the moment of an untimely death,

6
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,473
you'll feel
the urge to return to our mother's womb?

7
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,141
Mom…

8
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,311
Adelina…

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,022
I don't want to die.

10
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,026
I can't die just yet.

11
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,403
Don't move!

12
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,116
I'm not ready to leave you.

13
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,201
Not so soon, Adelina.

14
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,262
Don't worry. You're saved.

15
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,222
You'll live.

16
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,977
What about my comrades?
Did any of them survive?

17
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,156
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,784
You're the only survivor.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,751
Juan. Where's Juan?

20
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,835
Juan!

21
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,336
Juan!

22
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,171
Juan.

23
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,818
Juan, wake up.

24
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,587
This war
is truly detestable, my dear sister.

25
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,967
Especially when
it cuts the lives of children like Juan.

26
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,094
Juan.

27
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,980
I was putting away the clothes I ironed

28
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,151
when I noticed that the
señor's things were gone.

29
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,034
Teresita?

30
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,746
Teresita?

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,414
Teresita!

32
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,098
Teresita.

33
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,517
Teresita!

34
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,144
What's wrong?

35
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,230
Your father, he's gone.

36
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,109
-What? -He took all his clothes.

37
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,529
Your worthless father left us.

38
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
Teresita.

39
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,396
Mr. Juanito, where is Papa?

40
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,316
I don't know.

41
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,153
I woke up and his car was gone.

42
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,782
Teresita, do you think he'll come back?

43
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,576
Don't get your hopes up.

44
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,413
There's no one here to blame but you!

45
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,415
You ruined my family!

46
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,668
-You wretched bastard! -Mama!

47
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,214
This is not her fault, Mama.

48
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,884
It was you and Papa!

49
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,511
This is all your fault.

50
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,014
I despise both of you!

51
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,189
Teresita…

52
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,318
-Adelina! -Teresita!

53
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,819
Teresita!

54
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,957
Adelina!

55
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,668
Adelina.

56
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,546
Adelina, where are you going?

57
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,841
Your mother is right, Teresita.

58
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:28,221
I am also at fault. My
mother and I did this.

59
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,390
We messed up your lives, Teresita.

60
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,728
Forgive us, Teresita, especially my mother.

61
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,818
I don't blame you, Adelina.

62
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,695
Hush now.

63
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,908
Papa has already left us.

64
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,869
Are you going to leave me too?

65
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,665
Please have mercy on me, Adelina.

66
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,673
Adelina!

67
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,716
Eduardo.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,261
What happened to you two?
Why are you both crying?

69
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,055
Eduardo, our father is gone.

70
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,850
Papa left us.

71
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,562
Why?

72
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,522
Teresita.

73
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:24,986
I don't believe Dad would
leave us just like that.

74
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,363
If that's true, then where is he?

75
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,615
I don't know, Teresita.

76
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,455
His theater! Maybe he's there.

77
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,915
Come on!

78
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,250
Wait for me!

79
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,139
-Dad? -Papa?

80
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,682
-Papa! -Dad!

81
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,765
Papa?

82
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,685
-Papa? -Dad?

83
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,108
Uncle Julio?

84
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,163
Where's Dad?

85
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,543
-Dad! -You won't find him here.

86
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,588
Mr. Borromeo isn't here.

87
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,548
What?

88
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,967
He can speak Tagalog after all.

89
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,887
Unbelievable. You tricked us.

90
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,223
I didn't know how to talk to you.

91
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,577
You could speak Tagalog all this time?

92
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,144
Enough of that, Adelina.

93
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,524
Hiroshi, how do you know Papa isn't here?

94
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,197
At this very same place.

95
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,378
Hiroshi, can I ask you a favor?

96
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,130
Please tell my children…

97
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,970
not to worry about me.

98
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,017
I just need to get away for a while.

99
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,355
Otherwise, I'll have no use in this world.

100
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,024
Just tell them…

101
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
I love them very much.

102
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,829
I will.

103
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,658
Did he say where he was going?

104
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,496
He left us.

105
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,540
Teresita…

106
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
Dad…

107
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,629
Dad…

108
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,507
Come back.

109
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,847
We haven't heard anything from our boss,

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,226
nor do we have any idea
where your husband went.

111
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,356
He's not on our farm either.

112
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,817
Our caretaker came here earlier.

113
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,531
Never mind. Thank you
very much for visiting.

114
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,283
I'll go ahead now.

115
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,165
Have you found my daughter yet?

116
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,086
We don't know where she and Adelina went.

117
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,057
Adelina. Teresita.

118
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,143
Don't cry anymore, okay?

119
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,937
Your father will come back.

120
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,691
Here, I bet you're hungry.

121
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,570
Eat it while it's still hot.

122
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,368
Where did you get the
money to buy this, Eduardo?

123
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,788
Don't tell me you stole
money from Uncle and Auntie.

124
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,374
Don't think of me like that.

125
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,504
Hiroshi, why won't you get any?

126
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,882
Thank you.

127
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,720
To the four of us.

128
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,807
To true friendship.

129
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,603
Well? Are you just going to sulk?

130
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
Come on. Cheers.

131
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,881
What if your mom scolds me again?

132
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,427
Don't worry, I'll defend you.

133
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,347
Me too. That's why I'm taking you home.

134
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,559
Don't come with us, Eduardo.

135
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,354
She'll surely get angrier if she sees you.

136
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,358
Hiroshi.

137
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,404
Is it okay if you take us home instead?

138
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,157
Her mom is nice to you.

139
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,868
I'm sure she won't say
anything once she sees you.

140
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,623
Sure. I'll take you home.

141
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you, Hiroshi.

142
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,043
I'll go with you.

143
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,171
I'll make sure not to show myself.

144
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,130
Let's go.

145
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,060
What's the matter, Hiroshi?

146
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,728
Hiroshi.

147
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,898
Come here.

148
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,657
Why did you leave
without asking permission?

149
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,035
Don't you have many things to do here?

150
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,747
I'm sorry, Father. Please forgive me.

151
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,961
No! Stand here.

152
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,925
Clench your teeth.

153
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,867
Poor Hiroshi.

154
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,371
His father is really very strict.

155
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,000
He's not like our mother.

156
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,295
She would never spank us.

157
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,214
She only made us kneel on salt.

158
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,430
I know you're still mourning our mother.

159
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,891
I am too.

160
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,019
I think of her often.

161
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:02,151
I'm an orphan too, now
that my father's gone.

162
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,780
Especially since I don't know
if Papa will still return to us.

163
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,033
He'll come back, Teresita.

164
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,911
Let's just believe he'll return.

165
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,247
He'll come back to us.

166
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,043
Let's hold on to that.

167
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,306
Teresita.

168
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,642
Teresita!

169
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,269
What took you so long?

170
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,647
What took you so long?

171
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,818
And you? What are you doing here?

172
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,613
Do you want me to report
you to the constable?

173
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,906
Eduardo, go home.

174
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,406
Now.

175
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,411
You should've gone home by yourself.

176
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,789
Why did you have to bring her along?

177
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,501
Now that your father is gone,

178
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,463
his bastard child doesn't
have to live with us.

179
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:10,260
Forgive me, Mama. But if
my sibling leaves this house,

180
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,263
I will go with her.

181
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,105
I never had a sibling until now.

182
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,775
So if Adelina leaves…

183
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:30,572
I'll leave you as well, just like Papa.

184
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,242
You really take after your father.

185
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,498
All right.

186
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,959
Go inside now.

187
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,304
Thank you, Mama.

188
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,169
Teresita?

189
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,172
Teresita?

190
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,383
Thank you for earlier.

191
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,887
You defended me from your mama.

192
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,388
Come.

193
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,228
Don't thank me.

194
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm only following Papa's request.

195
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,984
What request?

196
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:55,199
That I will accept and love
you like a real sibling would.

197
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,912
So from now on, even with Papa gone,

198
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,416
I will never leave your
side no matter what happens.

199
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:10,089
And from now on, you
will be sleeping in my room

200
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,925
so we can always be together.

201
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,802
Dad may have left us,

202
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,065
but you're still going to take care of me.

203
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:21,350
And for that, I'd like
to thank you very much.

204
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,987
If anything
good came from our father leaving,

205
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,531
this was it.

206
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,035
Teresita and I became even closer.

207
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,679
Bravo, you two!

208
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,721
Bravo.

209
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,713
Señorita, I shall take my leave.

210
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,840
I will go to school now.

211
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,471
Where is Teresita?

212
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,182
She is still asleep.

213
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,979
I didn't wake her since her
classes start in the afternoon.

214
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,606
Is that right?

215
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,618
Because of you, my daughter detests me.

216
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,121
Because of you, my husband left me.

217
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,790
Why are you insisting on staying here?

218
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,126
Don't cry.

219
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,922
Don't cry and don't tell
Teresita anything about this.

220
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,926
Why can't you just disappear?

221
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,804
Or perhaps die?

222
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,018
That way, I'll never see you again.

223
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Dad.

224
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,183
Why did you have to leave?

225
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,313
How could you leave me…

226
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,401
just like Mom?

227
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,323
Dad…

228
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:32,124
Chasing rabbits on the mountain

229
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,255
Fishing for small carps

230
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,466
By the river

231
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,888
Such dreams will wander

232
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,726
In my mind

233
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:57,733
Chasing rabbits on the mountain

234
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:06,533
Fishing for small carps by the river

235
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:15,459
Such dreams will wander in my mind

236
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,592
Dreams of the hometown I cannot forget

237
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,808
What a sad song.

238
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,686
What are you doing here?

239
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,064
You should go. I want to be alone.

240
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,150
What's with the attitude all of a sudden?

241
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,070
I'm not doing anything.

242
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,614
I don't want to leave.

243
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,325
I don't want to go to school.

244
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,745
Eduardo might notice…

245
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,915
my eyes are swollen.

246
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,336
Who knows what he might
do to Señorita Carmela.

247
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,214
Why? What did she do to you?

248
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,801
Just tell me about the song
you were singing earlier.

249
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,761
It sounded very lovely.

250
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,721
"Furusato."

251
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,598
What does that mean?

252
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,141
"To my hometown."

253
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,229
That's what "furusato" means.

254
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,439
"Furusato"?

255
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,359
I will remember that.

256
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,571
That song is about Japanese people like me

257
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,450
who live away from our country.

258
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:35,664
It talks about how we
long for our homeland.

259
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,250
So that's why I liked your singing.

260
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,505
It really is difficult to live in
a place that isn't your real home.

261
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,714
Just like me.

262
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,805
Hiroshi.

263
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,684
What happened to you?

264
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,395
Why do you look sad?

265
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:03,525
My father wants me to return
to Japan as soon as possible.

266
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,485
He said I will be studying there.

267
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,197
He said goodbye to me on that day.

268
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,575
The nice Japanese boy

269
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,496
will leave me, just like Dad and Mom.

270
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,130
I can't be mistaken.

271
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,381
Those are Japanese planes.

272
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,717
Are they going to conquer us next?

273
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,886
COMING UP

274
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,229
I hope you'll be as great as your father.

275
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,940
You will not do vaudeville.

276
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,986
Put an end to that worthless
dream of yours, do you understand?

277
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,663
