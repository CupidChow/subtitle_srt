1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,712
Did you notice that there seem
to be more Japanese coming here?

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,383
Do you think the rumors are true,
that they will be invading us next?

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,761
The Japanese are good people.
Look at our boss, Mr. Tanaka.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,929
Long live the Emperor!

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:18,393
American rule is about to end.
Japan will be the next to govern here.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,145
Why do you think so, Father?

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,606
Does your family know who you really are?

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,652
Mr. Arata. No, they do not.

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,488
Mr. Tanaka, get ready.
The attacks are about to happen.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,408
What did they want from you?
And what were you talking about?

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,578
He is asking you
to find connections with the locals.

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,789
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,167
I'm in love with someone else.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,418
Who is it?

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,961
Adelina.

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:48,006
Why don't we have Adelina
marry Hiroshi instead?

17
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,427
What use is a bastard to the Tanakas, huh?

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,553
You passed.

19
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,848
-With flying colors.
-Thank you very much, sir.

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,975
I thought I was going
to disappoint my lover.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,603
They will marry me off
to Hiroshi in December.

22
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,313
Don't marry Hiroshi.

23
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,275
-Come with me. Let's run away…
-What kind of life will you give me?

24
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,778
I thought you weren't looking down on me?

25
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,558
Homma's orders are clear.

26
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:27,564
It is crucial that we succeed
here in the Philippines.

27
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:34,946
Yes, but this will surely affect
many innocent civilians.

28
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:48,334
We should think about
our victory, Colonel.

29
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,840
Even if it costs the lives

30
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:59,804
of thousands of innocent Filipinos.

31
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,945
Hiroshi.

32
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,330
May I speak with you?

33
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,919
What can I do for you, Eduardo?

34
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,170
I understand that

35
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,131
you and Teresita are getting married.

36
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,682
You are very fortunate
that she is the woman chosen for you.

37
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,393
Please take care of her.

38
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,314
Don't do anything that will hurt her.

39
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,445
And support her in her career.

40
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,661
Ever since we were kids, she's always
wanted to do vaudeville with Adelina.

41
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,956
So please,

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,542
do not stop her even when you're married.

43
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,425
Wait.

44
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,303
I only learned now that

45
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,724
Adelina and Teresita
are vaudeville performers.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,936
Can you accompany me?

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,689
When is their next show?

48
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,941
They have a performance tomorrow.

49
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:41,197
But I cannot accompany you
because I am going back to school.

50
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,824
I need to keep working.

51
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,370
I will go with you instead.

52
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:53,042
Hiroshi, I also want to see
the Filipino vaudeville.

53
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,962
Sure! We can watch together.

54
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,563
Dear Hiroshi,

55
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,900
this may be the last letter
I will write to you.

56
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,741
The letters that I have never sent
nor shown to you…

57
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:32,665
These letters are the only way
to express my hidden feelings and secrets.

58
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,086
Do you know how happy I was
when I learned that

59
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,464
you wanted to watch us perform?

60
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,968
Your words made me so nervous.

61
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,444
Wherever you are

62
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,654
Be it the city or the country

63
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,616
You will always bump into

64
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,285
The naughty clown

65
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,912
Here he comes, making a noise…

66
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,955
Did you know
that you were the first person

67
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,208
I looked for in the audience
at that moment?

68
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,086
-And there like a fool…
-And when I saw you,

69
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,631
I felt your piercing gaze towards me,

70
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:27,178
which made me feel
more nervous but also joyful.

71
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,347
Hey!

72
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,768
I didn't know that, at that moment,

73
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,563
my sister was also looking
for someone in the audience.

74
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,027
A presence that has always been there
since we started vaudeville,

75
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,030
but no longer.

76
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,698
My brother.

77
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,037
Silly clown!

78
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,804
Mr. Tanaka allowed my brother
to work all night

79
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,850
so he could attend school during the day.

80
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,158
Sometimes, my brother
would still visit me at our house.

81
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,755
He is still a kind
and caring brother to me.

82
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,011
-What's this?
-Pork-filled hopia. Your favorite.

83
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,139
Wow! It's still warm. Thank you, Eduardo.

84
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,726
Would you like me
to have dinner at your place later?

85
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,701
But he completely cut off
any connection he had with Teresita.

86
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,203
Teresita!

87
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,539
Well, how was it?
Have you seen your wedding dress?

88
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Yes, but I did not try it on.

89
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,294
They said I can't,
since the wedding might not…

90
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,255
-Is it beautiful? Let me see!
-Adelina, I'll go ahead.

91
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,050
-Take care.
-Eduardo!

92
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,851
How are you?

93
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,023
I'm doing fine. Thank you.

94
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,157
Yolanda.

95
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,745
Let's go inside.

96
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,424
We're not like how we used to be.

97
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,886
We're no longer complete and happy.

98
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,056
Everything has changed for us.

99
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,775
Come on, let's make a toast.

100
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,413
Where's Eduardo?

101
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,417
I invited him last night.
Why isn't he here?

102
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,255
Leave him be, Dad.

103
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,299
He's just busy with his studies.

104
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,219
Don't look for someone
who's not here, Papa.

105
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,473
Let's just toast.

106
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,310
To Papa's new theater.

107
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,523
May this be the start
of realizing the dreams

108
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,317
of a family who may seem crazy,

109
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,111
but is always ready
to meet life's challenges.

110
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,448
-Cheers to that!
-To Papa's new theater!

111
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,453
But you filled the gap
my brother left, Hiroshi.

112
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,248
You were always there
supporting our family.

113
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,877
-Teresita, your boyfriend's here.
-Mr. Borromeo.

114
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,255
Teresita, this is for you.

115
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,757
Thank you.

116
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,092
I'm glad you came, son.

117
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,386
I'm late. I had something to take care of.

118
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,971
Forgive me.

119
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,975
-This is for you all.
-Perfect timing.

120
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,394
Wait. I'll get you a glass.

121
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,482
My gown has arrived.

122
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,485
Has your suit arrived too?

123
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,195
It did, earlier.

124
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,534
Adelina.

125
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,495
Just a moment.

126
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,582
For you.

127
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,304
Thank you.

128
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,644
I'll go ahead.

129
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,689
I just need to get something
from Dad's car, Teresita.

130
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,911
Here, Hiroshi.

131
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,912
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

132
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,248
-Come, let's make a toast.
-Thank you.

133
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,113
I always see you, Hiroshi.

134
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,658
No matter how much I try to avoid you.

135
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,212
That one thing annoys me.

136
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,301
How can I ever forget you
when you always show up?

137
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,649
-Francisco.
-Yes?

138
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,569
Help Yolanda take out
the Immaculate Conception later.

139
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,820
Yes, señora.

140
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,699
Finally! Everything I ordered has arrived!

141
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,078
Francisco, how come
these only arrived now?

142
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,040
-Why didn't you go to the pier sooner?
-The ship arrived late, señora.

143
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,709
All right.

144
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,669
Mama.

145
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,088
These are so beautiful. So elegant.

146
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,173
That's true, my dear.

147
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,552
These are really beautiful because

148
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,721
I had them made and bought in America.

149
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,890
I don't want to embarrass us

150
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,560
with cheap wedding souvenirs
for our guests.

151
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,936
So beautiful.

152
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,106
Julio.

153
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,818
Can you take a look at these?

154
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,237
You're just sitting there
as if you don't care.

155
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,614
These are for your daughter's wedding.

156
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,827
Okay, here I come.

157
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,416
Let me see.

158
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,500
Look at that.

159
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,501
Ouch.

160
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,923
-How lovely.
-Wow.

161
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,927
You're right, these are lovely.

162
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,137
See?

163
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,847
Let me see.

164
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,641
How lovely.

165
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,745
This one.

166
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,998
Hiroshi?

167
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,265
It's past midnight.
What are you still doing here?

168
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,021
Do you need anything from my sister?
Just a moment, I'll call her, okay?

169
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,523
Adelina.

170
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,737
I really came to see you. Do you know why?

171
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,199
What did you say? I don't understand.

172
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,162
I can't stop thinking about you.

173
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:44,169
I feel sad that we no longer talk.
That you are avoiding me.

174
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,465
I love you.

175
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,593
I love you so much, Adelina.

176
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,530
What…

177
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,464
Hiroshi? Adelina?

178
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,762
What is the meaning of this?

179
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,765
I can never forget that night.

180
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,517
Because, along with the explosion

181
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,395
of suppressed emotions
between Hiroshi and me,

182
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,776
came the unexpected start of the war.

183
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,305
Teresita.

184
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,473
Teresita.

185
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,021
Why were you kissing him?

186
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,817
Teresita, don't get mad at her.

187
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,944
Let me explain.

188
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,494
Hiroshi.

189
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,039
Let me talk to my sister, okay?

190
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
Adelina, I will not leave you.

191
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,633
The three of us should talk.

192
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,855
Julio, what is that sound?

193
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
Julio.

194
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,162
Mr. Tanaka.

195
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,046
Hiroshi!

196
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,425
Why are you here at this hour?

197
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,886
Son! Go home!

198
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,640
You two! Get inside now!

199
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,776
Teresita, come inside.

200
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,902
Teresita.

201
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,364
Teresita, wait.

202
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,829
Let's talk.

203
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,208
Didn't you promise me
you would avoid Hiroshi?

204
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,795
-What happened was an accident.
-An accident?

205
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,173
But I clearly saw you kissing him back!

206
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,928
Yolanda! Yolanda!

207
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,182
Why are you still here? Go upstairs!

208
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,267
Yolanda!

209
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,727
Yolanda!

210
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,604
We will continue this later.

211
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,578
Mr. Tanaka!

212
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,956
Mr. Tanaka!

213
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,799
Get ready.
The attacks are about to happen.

214
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,967
When?

215
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,138
Our first attack in this country
will take place in December.

216
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,807
What is going on?

217
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,517
Haven't you heard the news?

218
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,394
War has erupted in Hawaii.

219
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,897
The military officials are holding
an urgent meeting.

220
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,182
Go to Akio right away
and find out what's going on.

221
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,350
Yes, sir!

222
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,653
Sir, you dropped this earlier.

223
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,618
Why is my father's name on the list?

224
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,006
Major Tyler Campbell, sir.

225
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,306
Why is my father's name
included on that list?

226
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,016
What is that for, sir?

227
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,818
I tried to avoid him, Teresita.

228
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,279
But what could I do if he approached me?

229
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,573
Is that why you kissed him back?

230
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,409
Why don't you ask your fiancé?

231
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:17,038
Are you afraid he will admit
that he can't stand to marry you?

232
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:22,878
War has erupted in the Asia Pacific.
The Philippines will be next.

233
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,422
Maybe you're here in the Philippines

234
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,340
because you want to bomb
and invade our country?

235
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,217
Ruthless Japanese!

236
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,594
Get out of our country!

237
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,803
Fellow Filipinos!

238
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,223
Why do you have to involve the innocent
and peaceful Japanese people living here?

239
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,268
Have you also lost compassion
for your fellow human beings?

240
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,561
They are here.

241
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,522
Our army has arrived.

242
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,400
COMING UP

243
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,818
God Almighty.

244
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,613
The war has reached our country.

245
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,495
