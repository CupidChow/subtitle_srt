1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,712
Adelina, I will do everything
to find Teresita.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,296
I hope you do find her.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,173
Because if you don't,

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,635
consider me one of the many
enemies of your country.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,389
Sorry, this is all we've gathered
for the guerrillas.

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:18,643
Where are Miss Teresita and Adelina?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,313
Teresita was abducted
by Japanese soldiers this morning.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,651
Rest assured, I will not let this pass.

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,445
What do they really want from me?

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,323
Just do what they say
so they won't make it harder on you.

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,535
Help! Let me out of here!

12
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,120
Señora, tell us.

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,623
Are you the one behind
your own daughter's arrest?

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,083
PREVIOUSLY

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,544
I would never betray my daughter!

16
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,129
I'd rather die.

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,465
They're abducting our women,

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,010
and now they're dictating
what we can perform?

19
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:57,015
This is just the start
of our oppression under them.

20
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,349
Eduardo.

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,019
I don't know who to ask for help.

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,147
I don't even know what awaits me here.

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,609
Don't you know
they have abducted many women?

24
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:12,781
They bring them to the garrison
to become comfort women.

25
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,492
Am I also going to suffer
under those Japanese men?

26
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,171
Good evening, Adelina.

27
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,631
Mr. Luis.

28
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,552
Do you have any news about…

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,721
My sister still hasn't been found.

30
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,268
My apologies for asking.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,979
Please stay strong during this time.

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,439
Thank you.

33
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,697
I guess you've realized

34
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,159
the Japanese were never truly our friends,

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,911
but our enemies.

36
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,082
You're right.

37
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:53,756
Now, both of my siblings have been hurt
because of them.

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm beginning to despise them.

39
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,724
Use that wrath to help save
our country, Adelina.

40
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,893
Help?

41
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,896
How? How can I help?

42
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,900
Our guerillas need eyes.

43
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,986
-Eyes?
-Spies.

44
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,243
Since your family is
very close with the Japanese,

45
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,330
you can help us gather intel,

46
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,585
which can help our soldiers
fight for our freedom.

47
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,129
Adelina.

48
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,757
Our guerillas need us.

49
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,384
So I hope…

50
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,222
you'll join us.

51
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,239
Eduardo?

52
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,993
What are you writing?

53
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,750
It's a letter to my sister and fiancée.

54
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,800
Writing to them calms me.

55
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,471
I know you're upset
because you got scolded earlier.

56
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,766
But to me, you're a hero.

57
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,396
You managed to slip past
the soldiers in the garrison.

58
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,689
Thank you, Juan.

59
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,901
I'm actually writing about that
in my letter to Adelina.

60
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,362
I just hope

61
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,157
there's a quicker way
for my letters to reach them.

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,328
I don't want them to worry about me.

63
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,247
But…

64
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,001
how are you going to send that letter?

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,713
Now that we're so far away.

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,216
I don't know.

67
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,512
It's late. Get some rest.

68
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,894
Juan, let's go.

69
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,271
It's time for bed.

70
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,828
Please stop!

71
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,163
Don't be afraid.

72
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,207
-Please stop!
-They won't touch you.

73
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,796
For now, you're safe.

74
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,216
We'll be safe in here.

75
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,428
Just don't make a sound.

76
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,264
Be quiet.

77
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,692
Don't listen to their screams
and cries for help.

78
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,113
Please stop!

79
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,218
Quiet!

80
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,894
If we all work together,

81
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:39,190
we can easily overcome
and drive the enemies out of our country.

82
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
Adelina.

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,198
Can we count on you?

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,425
Mr. Luis, I'm going to need more time
to think about this.

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,850
I'm not rushing you.

86
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,186
When you're ready,

87
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,981
you know where to find me.

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,528
Goodbye, Adelina.

89
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,955
My apologies for disturbing you, señora.

90
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,584
I just wanted to ask for your help.

91
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,628
My child is sick.

92
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,548
And I need money to buy medicine,

93
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,758
can you lend me some?

94
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,385
All right.

95
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,682
But…

96
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,810
on one condition.

97
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,896
Anything, señora.

98
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,814
I have something for you to do.

99
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:08,821
I want Adelina gone
from our lives as well as the Tanakas.

100
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,228
Dad.

101
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,272
Go change and get some rest.

102
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,567
How can I rest?

103
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,491
I can't stop thinking about…

104
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,538
what they might do…

105
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,292
to your sister.

106
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,299
Miss.

107
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,718
Please help me.

108
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,513
I want to get out of here.

109
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,515
You heartless monsters!

110
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,350
-You heartless monsters!
-I beg you.

111
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,358
You can't escape.

112
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,069
Many have tried,

113
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,489
and they ended up getting beaten.

114
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,495
Just eat.

115
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,331
Go and eat.

116
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,125
Don't you pity these women?

117
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,921
Pity?

118
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,091
What good can pity do?

119
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,092
Come here.

120
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,885
Come here.

121
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,388
Look.

122
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,561
Let us in! Hurry up in there!

123
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,355
It's our turn!

124
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,275
Hey! Open the door!

125
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,407
What if they take away her dignity?

126
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,242
Rape her?

127
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,330
I don't know what I'll do…

128
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,291
if that happens.

129
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,049
Dad.

130
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,057
Worrying won't help us solve our problems.

131
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,813
I know it's hard.

132
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,318
But we need to stay strong.

133
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,617
I am here.

134
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,799
Señora, I can't do that to Adelina.

135
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,885
She has been so kind and respectful to me.

136
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,140
If that's the case, Francisco…

137
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:11,981
why should I lend you money
to buy medicine for your sick child?

138
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,070
I can…

139
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,824
fire you, you know.

140
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,992
But…

141
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,038
what's going to happen
to your family if I do that?

142
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,338
How are they going to survive these times

143
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,092
if you're jobless?

144
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,223
I'll do whatever you want.

145
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,393
Just tell me.

146
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,154
Please stop!

147
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,115
Please!

148
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,120
Please stop! Have mercy!

149
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,417
Please stop!

150
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,632
Help!

151
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,051
Help!

152
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,184
Please stop!

153
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,621
No, sir! Please no!

154
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,515
Have your fill!

155
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,661
God Almighty.

156
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,590
Mama.

157
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,346
Papa.

158
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,686
Adelina.

159
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,693
Hiroshi.

160
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,533
Eduardo.

161
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,289
Eduardo, my love.

162
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,083
Where are you?

163
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,339
Help me.

164
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,973
Why did I dream about Teresita?

165
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,394
God Almighty.

166
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,564
I hope my princesses are safe.

167
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,288
Juan?

168
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,917
Juan?

169
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,421
Pablo.

170
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,090
Have you seen Juan?

171
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,301
No.

172
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,886
I just woke up.

173
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,929
Juan?

174
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,516
-Juan!
-Juan?

175
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,602
Juan?

176
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,688
Juan?

177
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,023
Juan?

178
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,235
Juan!

179
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,404
I must not lose hope.

180
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,284
I need to fight.

181
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,266
What's wrong, Eduardo?

182
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,852
Didn't I place my letters in my pocket?

183
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,313
Now they're gone.

184
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,234
Who's that letter for, sir?

185
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:12,197
-Is it for Chinita and Morena?
-Yes.

186
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,285
I want to let them know that I'm well.

187
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,245
Now, my only problem is…

188
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,290
how am I going to send this to them?

189
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,960
I can deliver your letters for you
if you want.

190
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,004
It's dangerous for you to travel alone.

191
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,256
Are you underestimating me again, sir?

192
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,760
After all we've been through,
you still don't trust me.

193
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,929
Could it be…

194
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,059
that Juan might've taken them?

195
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm drunk.

196
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,032
There might be a snake there!

197
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,833
Let's go!

198
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm coming!

199
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,899
Juan?

200
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,653
Juan!

201
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,158
Where did he run off to?

202
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,743
Juan!

203
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,164
Juancho, have you seen Juan?

204
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,708
-No, I haven't…
-Get down!

205
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,692
Evacuate to the tunnel uphill!

206
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,944
-Go!
-Eduardo, let's go!

207
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,446
Where are you going?

208
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,368
Let's go!

209
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,870
Mario!

210
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,996
Mario!

211
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,565
Alberto!

212
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,694
Our men have reached
the other side of the river!

213
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,779
Let's go!

214
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,449
Hurry!

215
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,168
Alberto.

216
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,876
Thank you!

217
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,762
I am not a prostitute.

218
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,139
I am a nun.

219
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,642
And you defiled me!

220
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,502
No, please.

221
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,797
Please stop. Please.

222
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,425
Please.

223
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,598
Please stop. Please.

224
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,592
Stop!

225
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,680
Let me go!

226
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,977
Help! Help me!

227
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,648
Eduardo!

228
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,843
You're disgusting!

229
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,602
Help!

230
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,021
Mr. Gouki!

231
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,606
Mr. Gouki!

232
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,574
Give me the key.

233
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,720
Get behind me!

234
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,188
It's a grenade!

235
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,648
Thank you.

236
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,277
Thank you very much for your help.

237
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,696
Don't thank me.

238
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,325
That man wasn't afraid of me.

239
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,410
He's afraid of our master.

240
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,622
Who is your master?

241
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,046
I got you fresh clothes to change into.

242
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,382
Who is your master?

243
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,969
Stop asking questions.

244
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,266
Just be thankful you won't end up
like the women here.

245
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,060
But why?

246
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,229
How am I different from them?

247
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,231
Miss, please.

248
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,400
My name is Dolores.

249
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,694
Miss Dolores.

250
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,490
Why won't you answer me? Who is he?

251
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,618
Does he know what's going on here?

252
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,828
Do you think he doesn't?

253
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,793
He's a very brutal man
and the mastermind behind all of this.

254
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,253
Who is he?

255
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,924
-What's his name?
-Don't worry.

256
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,885
You'll meet him soon.

257
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,035
-Captain!
-Why are you here again, Hiroshi?

258
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,580
I'm just hoping to see
if our colonel is here.

259
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,958
Are you also going to ask for his help?

260
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,626
I need to find Teresita.

261
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,212
The Filipinos think we're evil,

262
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,381
especially the Borromeos.

263
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,175
They don't deserve
to be treated this way, Captain.

264
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,428
Anything can happen, Hiroshi.

265
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,264
Since we're at war.

266
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,473
Anything?

267
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,183
And why is that?

268
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,561
What wrong did Teresita do?

269
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,147
And you, Captain.

270
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,151
Have you done anything to find Teresita?

271
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,403
I tried asking, but no one knows.

272
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,823
It seems that her arrest was a secret.

273
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,992
And for what reason?

274
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,828
You better ask the Colonel.

275
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,623
He'll know the answer to that.

276
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,974
I never wanted this
to happen to my sister.

277
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,643
I don't need to hear
any explanation from you.

278
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,978
I heard everything.

279
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,439
What you went through was terrifying.

280
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,733
-Did they rape you?
-No.

281
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,778
Looks like God loves you more than us.

282
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,738
Keep your guard up, Teresita.

283
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,240
They will all defile you.

284
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:45,538
I don't like Hiroshi Tanaka's tone
and actions towards me.

285
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,540
Take him away from Manila.

286
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,544
Away from his father and Adelina.

287
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
I won't stop until I find Teresita.

288
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,259
Now, I don't know
who they will take from me next.

289
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
Is it my father?

290
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,846
Or me?

291
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,435
I want to report
that Adelina has been lying to you.

292
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,106
Colonel, would you like me to order
Adelina Dela Cruz's arrest right away?

293
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,149
COMING UP

294
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,031
