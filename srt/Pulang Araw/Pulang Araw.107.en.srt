1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,837
Who are these people, Sister?

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,089
<i>I saw them on the street.</i>

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>You keep bringing people here out of pity.</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,802
<i>What if one of them is a Makapili?</i>

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,303
<i>Or a spy of the enemy?</i>

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,266
<i>I can't die in this war
without earning her forgiveness.</i>

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,643
<i>You're going to look for her?
It's too dangerous, my friend.</i>

8
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,272
Once the guerrillas and the Americans
defeat the Japanese,

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,443
we'll demand justice
for the deaths of our Mama and Papa.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,237
Why, Adelina?

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>Do you know who killed our father?</i>

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,366
<i>I spoke to him, Teresita.</i>

13
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,995
Adelina, give me a name.

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,163
Who was it?

15
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>I'm Haru Akiyama, sir.</i>

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>Imperial Japanese Army, Infantry Regiment</i>

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>under the Colonel Ichiro Adachi.</i>

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,255
<i>We were right to trust you, Hiroshi.</i>

19
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>You've proven yourself
to be a Japanese with a Filipino heart.</i>

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,429
Hiroshi is our friend, isn't he?

21
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,264
He's still Japanese, just like Yuta.

22
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>They're our enemies, Adelina.</i>

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,769
<i>She's very angry with Hiroshi.</i>

24
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,645
What about you? Do you believe him?

25
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>My heart knows
that Hiroshi is telling the truth.</i>

26
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,944
<i>Don't mind Teresita.</i>

27
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>She was just driven by her emotions.</i>

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,408
Who is this man? Hiroshi?

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>Why isn't Adelina asleep yet?</i>

30
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>A Japanese soldier
has just arrived outside.</i>

31
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,749
I heard his name is Hiroshi.

32
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,709
<i>Do you still hate me?</i>

33
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>Have I completely lost you, Adelina?</i>

34
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,214
<i>Because I'm still the same.</i>

35
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>Yo're still the woman I truly love.</i>

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,554
PREVIOUSLY

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,347
Rosing, have you seen Miss Myla
and her son anywhere?

38
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,893
They were not in their rooms.

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,605
I don't know where they went, Sister.

40
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,660
Does your embrace mean
you forgive me, Adelina?

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,540
How can I not, my love?

42
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,045
But you shouldn't be here?

43
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:58,511
What if a soldier or a guerilla sees you
in that uniform?

44
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,513
Adelina, I have no fear.

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,726
I'll brave the storms for you.

46
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,352
You know that.

47
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,815
But you shouldn't have put
yourself in danger.

48
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,068
You shouldn't have come here anymore.

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,862
Why, Adelina?

50
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,455
Don't you want me to meet the man
who killed our father?

51
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,420
- You monster!
- Teresita!

52
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,172
You monster!

53
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,049
Why did you kill my papa?

54
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,301
Why did you kill him?

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
Tell me why!

56
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,138
- Tell me why!
- Teresita.

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,641
Why did you kill him of all people?

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,100
Tell me why!

59
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,436
You're a monster!

60
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,994
Is this woman the one looking for me?

61
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,288
Yes, Colonel.

62
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,332
Mrs. Myla Ramos is one of our spies.

63
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,001
She works for us.

64
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,796
Good evening, Colonel.

65
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,801
Do you have anything to report?

66
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:26,099
I know where to find Adelina Dela Cruz
and Teresita Borromeo.

67
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,271
I will tell you where they are

68
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,316
in exchange for food and shelter
for me and my son.

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,407
I will give you what you want.

70
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,619
Where are they?

71
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,623
- Teresita, that's enough!
- You monster!

72
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,917
Please, Teresita! Enough!

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,044
Please calm down.

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,713
Didn't I tell you?

75
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
What Hiroshi did was an accident.

76
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,383
Listen to me.

77
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,594
Teresita, I'm telling the truth.

78
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
I didn't mean to shoot Mr. Borromeo.

79
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,021
Where's your proof?
How can you prove that to me?

80
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,400
How can you make me convince
that you're telling the truth?

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,071
My group is gone.

82
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,450
My comrades are dead.

83
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,327
So where's your proof?

84
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,912
How can I believe you?

85
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,248
Tell me, Hiroshi?

86
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,083
Tell me how!

87
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,711
Teresita, we're friends.

88
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,589
We grew up together.

89
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,844
I could never lie to you.

90
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,473
Really, Hiroshi?

91
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,768
Really?

92
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,854
You never told us that your dad was a spy!

93
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:59,984
So how can I trust anything
from a Japanese like you?

94
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,027
Teresita.

95
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,945
Teresita, look at me.

96
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,785
Hiroshi has saved me from danger
and death countless of times.

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,913
He has risked his life for me.

98
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,917
I believe him,
and I'm hoping you'll believe him too.

99
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,002
He's a Japanese.

100
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,005
Are you going to choose him
over our father?

101
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,260
Let me ask you the same question,Teresita.

103
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,933
Have you gone mad with your hatred
towards the Japanese

104
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,437
that you can no longer trust
our childhood friend?

105
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,858
That's enough.

106
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,944
Stop fighting.

107
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,949
Hiroshi.

108
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,911
If you truly believe I'm guilty…

109
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,874
Hiroshi.

110
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,460
…take my gun.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,048
Shoot me.

112
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,849
Take it.

113
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,351
Shoot me, Teresita.

114
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,145
Teresita!

115
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,187
Teresita…

116
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,693
Pull the trigger.

117
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,365
You can punish me in any way you want
if that will give you peace in your heart.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,747
They're here.

119
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,731
Eduardo, we'll go ahead.

120
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,399
We have something important to do.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,735
Wait a minute, sir.

122
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,663
We have no news about him, son.

123
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,845
Hiroshi.

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,515
Teresita, don't.

125
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,020
Move away, Adelina.

126
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:41,979
Just go, Adelina.

127
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,566
Respect your habit, Teresita.

128
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,028
You're a novice. Why would you kill?

129
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,239
- I said move!
- Teresita, no.

130
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,240
Teresita.

131
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,459
Fine.

132
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,756
If you're going to kill Hiroshi
for revenge, then shoot me too.

133
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,467
- Shoot me.
- Adelina.

134
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,803
I don't want to live anymore knowing

135
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,516
that my sister
will kill the man I love most.

136
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,601
So shoot, Teresita.

137
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,814
Kill us both! Do it!

138
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,360
End my suffering because I'm so tired!

139
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,281
I'm so sick and tired of this life!

140
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,408
I'm done!

141
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,661
So, go. Pull the trigger, Teresita.

142
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,539
Shoot us dead! Go on!

143
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,677
My God!

144
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,306
My God!

145
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,729
My God, why are you doing this to us?

146
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,902
Have mercy on us!

147
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,822
Please have mercy!

148
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,327
I'm really sorry.

149
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,955
Please believe me.

150
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:29,211
I really didn't mean to shoot your father.

151
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,341
I hope you won't hate me.

152
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,520
Adelina.

153
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:53,569
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you,
but our new guests are missing.

154
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,073
I've been looking all over for them,
but they're not here at all.

155
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,394
"Tyler Campbell."

156
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,418
Eduardo.

157
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,109
Forgive me for intruding.

158
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,320
Where's Major Campbell?
I brought him some food.

159
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,738
He just left.

160
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,657
They have an important mission.

161
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,535
I'm just worried, sir.
I think we need to leave.

162
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,538
Those soldiers might come back.

163
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,832
We'll wait for the return of my…

164
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,462
of Major Campbell and Juan.

165
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,215
This is where they left us, so we'll stay.

166
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,052
We were not even given
a chance to meet again.

167
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,560
I never got to achieve my greatest desire.

168
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,066
Now my father will never know
I was his son.

169
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,738
I know it's hard, Eduardo.

170
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,827
But sometimes,
we don't really get what we want.

171
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,707
You may not get
the recognition from your father.

172
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,834
But your courage,

173
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,463
your love for our country…

174
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,010
Those things make you worthy
of appreciation.

175
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,345
Not just as a son.

176
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,139
But as a citizen of our motherland.

177
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,861
Let's go.

178
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,047
Find them this instant! Quickly!

179
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,467
Go! Go!

180
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,494
Colonel, there's no one here.

181
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,582
Looks like they have all escaped
before we came here.

182
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,134
Where are they?

183
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,260
Colonel.

184
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,596
I swear they were just here.

185
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,889
Believe me!

186
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,891
You lied to me!

187
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
Colonel, it's too dangerous here.

188
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,011
We need to leave now.

189
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
Let's go!

190
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,140
Yes, sir!

191
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,523
<i>Once again, we escaped from the devil.</i>

192
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,695
<i>Another night of fear
and terror will pass.</i>

193
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:53,285
<i>In the following days,
the Americans reclaimed Leyte</i>

194
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,748
<i>and the war continued
in some parts of the Philippines.</i>

195
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,253
<i>As the war raged on,</i>

196
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,966
<i>casualties kept destroying our nation,</i>

197
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,594
<i>our dreams,
and our most cherished memories.</i>

198
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,713
<i>But we still continue
to fight for survival. </i>

199
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,801
<i>Even if sometimes,
we forget what we're fighting for.</i>

200
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,972
<i>Is it for a country stripped
of its face and dignity?</i>

201
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,934
<i>Or is it for our dreams
that have been devoured by the war?</i>

202
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,893
Follow me.

203
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Our dreams filled with hope
and precious memories.</i>

204
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,109
Stop!

205
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,570
In this devastating war,

206
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:16,493
can you still consider a friend
you once knew your enemy now?

207
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,828
Lower your weapon.

208
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,583
Eduardo.

209
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,044
Well, I'll be damned. It's only Hiroshi.

210
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,672
You're right.
He's a friend of Auntie Adelina.

211
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,757
Yeah.

212
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,218
Put down your weapons. He's a friend.

213
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,477
Eduardo, what are you doing?
That's Hiroshi!

214
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,730
He's still an enemy.

215
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,989
Put your gun away!

216
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,657
Put that down!

217
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,668
He said put it down, not hide away.

218
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
I'm not your enemy, Eduardo.

219
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,632
I never was.

220
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,385
So just let me go if you don't trust me.

221
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,937
Just follow his orders, Hiroshi.
Put your gun down.

222
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,814
Surrender yourself.

223
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,568
Why should I surrender
when I am not the enemy?

224
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,363
But your uniform says otherwise, Hiroshi.

225
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,116
I'm only wearing this
to avoid being targeted.

226
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,579
I'm here to find food for Adelina.

227
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,211
How can I be sure
you're telling the truth?

228
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,255
Then come with me!

229
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,757
Teresita is also with us.

230
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,515
Where are they?

231
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,102
They're in an abandoned building.

232
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,272
Near San Sebastian Church.

233
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,068
Well? Are you coming with me?!

234
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,825
Leave now, Hiroshi.

235
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,078
Tell them I'm still alive.

236
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,172
Men, ready your weapons.

237
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,756
We're going into battle.

238
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,633
Let's go!

239
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,095
<i>We continued to live
under the shadows of the war.</i>

240
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,140
<i>Our lands became battlefields.</i>

241
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,018
Our seas turned into graveyards.

242
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,483
We have critically depleted our resources.

243
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,113
No aid is coming through anymore.

244
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,741
But…

245
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:07,623
we can't just give up on this war

246
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,002
against those damned Americans

247
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,298
for the sake of our country.

248
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,763
We will still fight!

249
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,601
Store up on ammunition.

250
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,771
Use your bayonets.

251
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,861
Officers, deploy your units now.

252
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,823
We must fight back.

253
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,536
Kill the Americans.

254
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,210
Don't show mercy against Filipinos

255
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,755
who are against us.

256
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,799
- Yes, Colonel!
- Yes, Colonel!

257
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,561
How much longer can we hold on?

258
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,402
The shooting isn't over yet.
Where are you going?

259
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,862
<i>Adelina, I can't hide
like a coward forever.</i>

260
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,115
<i>I want to help the guerrillas.</i>

261
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,534
Don't back down! Attack!

262
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,535
COMING UP

263
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,578
<i>Hiroshi, please don't leave.</i>

264
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,249
<i>Don't worry, Adelina.
I'll come back for you, I promise.</i>

265
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,501
<i>We have nowhere else to escape!</i>

266
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,462
<i>We're going to get shot
if we step outside!</i>

267
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,880
<i>So let's just stay here!</i>

268
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,176
<i>Adelina's right!
Let's all stay here together!</i>

269
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>God Almighty!</i>

270
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,099
<i>Please don't abandon us!</i>

271
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>Save us all!</i>

272
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,354
Long time no see, Colonel. Remember me?

273
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,197
