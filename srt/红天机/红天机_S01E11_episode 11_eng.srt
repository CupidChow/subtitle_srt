 The characters and settings of this drama are fiction and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,320
 What? 

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,370
Supervisor Ha was found with his dead father when he was little

9
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,670
and the corpse of his father, Ha Seong Jin, looked lifeless and strange?

10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,410
 She is with Supervisor Ha. 

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,900
 She is in danger. Grave danger. 

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,040
Supervisor Ha, you are under arrest for the guards' corpse incident

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,470
at Inwang Mountain.

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,280
No! Don't do this.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,630
- There must be a mistake. 
 - Step aside.

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,840
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,710
I told you to step back!

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,660
No.

19
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,010
How dare you!

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,420
Let me walk there on my own, Your Highness.

21
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,380
Thank you...

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,630
for everything.

23
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,890
Scholar Sir!

24
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,310
Why do you speak like that?

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,980
As if you will never see me again?

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,460
Withdraw your swords, all of you.

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,490
Do not resist and follow, Supervisor Ha.

28
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,200
Scholar Sir. Scholar Sir.

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,700
Scholar Sir. Scholar Sir! Scholar Sir!

30
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,100
You can't. No, don't do this!

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,130
Scholar Sir! Scholar—

32
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,430
Scholar Sir!

33
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,720
Scholar Sir!

34
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,630
Scholar Sir...

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,040
Make sure that woman gets home safely.

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
Yes, Your Highness.

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,370
 Who is there? 

38
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,200
 I missed you... 

39
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,840
 so much. 

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:21,070
♫  All the flowers in the world wither again  ♫

41
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,970
 I deeply cherish you. 

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,510
♫  Even if you lose that light when despair comes  ♫

43
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,800
 It seems 

44
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,550
 we are not meant to be together. 

45
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,110
♫  Like a lie I will wait once more for my love.  ♫

46
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,510
 Leave. 

47
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,180
 Far away from me. 

48
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,600
 I beg you. 

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:55,500
♫  Like a lie I will wait once more for my love.  ♫

 Episode 11 
 Ring of Fate 

51
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,400
 Royal Investigation Bureau 

52
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,410
 Interrogations Confinement 

53
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,220
This is a special cell at the Investigation Bureau,

54
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,100
so you cannot leave, and you cannot meet with anyone.

55
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,680
It is becoming clear that you are the culprit who murdered the guards,

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,580
so stay here until the royal portrait is finished.

57
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,630
Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,840
- Step away for a moment.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,010
The days have grown warmer, but the nights will still be cold.

60
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,530
I shall have someone put in more hay.

61
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,940
Your Highness.

62
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,420
What is it?

63
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,710
Has Maiden Hong made it back safely?

64
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,170
Do not worry. She did.

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,360
I had someone follow her and made sure she got back.

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,040
I apologize.

67
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,670
I feel...

68
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,980
I feel relieved.

69
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,100
Do you remember?

71
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,700
On the day we met for the first time in the palace,

72
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,830
I fell because I could not see and you helped me up

73
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,430
and you said,

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,370
"I'm sorry."

75
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,300
Why should Your Highness be sorry for my blindness?

76
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,550
For my crime?

77
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,700
Why should Your Highness have to be sorry?

78
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,400
I should be going.

79
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,030
Did you get in trouble?

80
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,140
What is it now?

81
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,560
Did something happen?

82
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,730
No, nothing.

83
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,300
I heard Headmaster lectured you not to go to the palace for a while.

84
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,750
Is that why you are like this?

85
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,830
- How did you know?
 - I heard from Uncle Chunbok.

86
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,300
Where on earth have you been?

87
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you truly want to be locked up in the shed again?

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,510
- I keep telling you not to go to the Painting Bureau— 
 - Stop scolding—

89
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,830
- Cheon Gi!
 - Cheon Gi!

90
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,940
- Cheon Gi!
 - Cheon Gi!

91
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,850
Goodness, Cheon Gi!

92
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,140
- Cheon Gi!
 - Cheon Gi!

93
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,190
Cheon Gi! Cheon Gi!

94
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,870
What do we do?

95
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,920
She is as hot as coal.

96
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,690
Look, my daughter is dying.

97
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,680
But... where is my daughter?

98
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,660
Where did she go?

99
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,620
Cheon Gi.

100
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,710
- Cheon Gi!
 - She is right h...

101
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,040
 The scent of peach blossoms comes every spring 

102
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,550
 but I can no longer see the girl who was there. 

103
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,420
 The road of revenge, after I lost my sight, devoid of any warmth. 

104
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,570
 When we met each other again, somewhere along that road, 

105
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,480
 she made me who cannot see smile with a painting 

106
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,120
 and made me quiver like a branch in the wind. 

107
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,400
Ha Ram!

108
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,900
 The memories disappear and only nightmares remain. 

109
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,900
 It makes my heart ache. 

110
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,200
 He says to prove our love by parting. 

111
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,930
 Is it a curse or retribution? 

112
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,490
 My cruel fate. 

113
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,880
 How miserable. So miserable. 

114
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,760
♫  I hope we don't pass each other like the passing wind.  ♫

115
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,070
♫  I am here.  ♫

116
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,760
 Do you dare to attempt to paint me? 

117
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,220
 I will paint it. 

118
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,180
 No matter what. 

119
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,800
Father, it's time for your medicine.

120
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,770
Hush.

121
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,070
Father, here.

122
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,570
Father.

123
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,060
Father, you know...

124
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,410
For the first time, I think I will have to...

125
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,620
paint for someone else instead of you.

126
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,270
Just this once.

127
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,740
Just this once, for the first and last time,

128
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,700
I will paint for someone else.

129
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,410
I will finish...

130
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,560
the painting that you once painted.

131
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,680
 Father. 

132
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,000
 Help me just this once. 

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,690
 So I can succeed. 

134
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
What is so serious that you made us lock the door?

135
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,940
I will paint the royal portrait.

136
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,400
- What?
 - Are you crazy?

137
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,470
Why are you suddenly being like this?

138
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,590
The Scholar...

139
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,420
Ma Wang is...

140
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,860
inside Ha Ram's body!

141
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,690
I want to help somehow.

142
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,800
What are you talking about? Supervisor Ha is a what?

143
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,500
Gosh. That doesn't make any sense.

144
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,010
The scholar was taken to the Investigations Bureau.

145
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
As a suspect in the guards' corpse incident at Inwang Mountain.

146
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,940
If I don't do anything, the scholar and other people could be in danger.

147
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,380
I'm not sure of all the details.

148
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,900
Anyhow, I have to finish the royal portrait to save everyone.

149
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,390
You will be in danger if you finish the royal portrait.

150
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,670
Did you forget what Headmaster said?

151
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,520
Just look at your father.

152
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,580
I came here determined.

153
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
I beg you.

154
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,830
You two are my only friends.

155
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,140
I beg you just this once.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,400
 Interrogations Confinement 

157
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,400
Supervisor Ha of Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau.

158
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,340
Ha of Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau...

159
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,870
So he has come all the way here.

160
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,980
I suppose it is time for me to leave.

161
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,480
Leave us.

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Have some. It is the sparrow tongue tea that you like.

163
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,660
I apologize, Your Highness.

164
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,610
But, at least during the interrogation, please forget that we were friends.

165
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,460
On the day of the Seokcheok Rain Ritual,

166
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,970
there was a fire at Gyeongwonjeon.

167
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,600
I was looking at King Yeongjong's royal portrait with Hyeong-nim Juhyang then.

168
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,300
 Doesn't royal grandfather's portrait seem truly alive? 

169
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,880
I suspect Ma Wang's seal was broken when the painting caught on fire

170
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,010
and it entered your body.

171
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,030
Is that so?

172
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,410
I cannot believe Ma Wang was inside you all this time...

173
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,610
How long has Your Highness known this?

174
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,780
I found out after the incident at Gyeongwonjeon.

175
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,160
I still cannot forget how your nails grew longer

176
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,000
and the look in your eyes changed.

177
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,840
But you do not remember it.

178
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,610
Because it is not your memory.

179
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,080
If I had known this earlier,

180
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,150
I would have bound myself in chains.

181
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,460
Are you admitting that you could harm someone

182
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,350
every time you lose your memories?

183
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,790
Yes.

184
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,380
I am.

185
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,850
You seem to realize how dangerous Ma Wang inside you is.

186
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,060
So I will not ask further.

187
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,890
Now there is only one path left for you.

188
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,160
Cooperate in the sealing ritual.

189
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,790
That is the best for all of us and for you.

190
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,480
 We must bring Ma Wang out from your body. 

191
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,690
 No matter what happens. 

192
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,770
Then, I'd like to ask you one thing.

193
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,780
Go ahead.

194
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,850
Are you certain that a royal portrait is required for the sealing ritual?

195
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes.

196
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,380
But that royal portrait cannot be drawn by just anyone.

197
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,640
Unless they are a divine painter like Maiden Hong.

198
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,230
Her father became mad after finishing King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

199
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,520
Can you be certain that this will not happen to her?

200
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,430
- That is— 
 - If the royal portrait is mandatory for the ritual,

201
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,790
I do not wish to proceed with it.

202
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,980
Do you believe that finishing the royal portrait will harm Painter Hong?

203
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,780
I hear the painter who finishes King Yeongjong's royal portrait

204
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,010
will be cursed at the sealing ritual.

205
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,490
Just as Painter Hong Eun Oh was.

206
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,900
Is that true?

207
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,020
Yes, Your Highness.

208
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,800
Will you still insist on finishing the royal portrait?

209
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,330
If you truly care for the maiden,

210
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,020
please stop the royal portrait re-creation.

211
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,020
 Every time I lose my memory, the people I care about die. 

212
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,900
 Without the sealing ritual, he will be inside my body forever. 

213
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
 Ma Wang. Just why? Why? 

214
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,210
 Why are you inside me? 

215
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,070
You are here.

216
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,290
Are you all right?

217
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,930
Yes.

218
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,690
Do you blame me?

219
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,230
That ring…

220
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,680
The scholar gave it to me.

221
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,030
I could not help it.

222
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,470
- Yes.
 - I also feel horrible, but

223
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,680
it had to be done.

224
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,290
For your sake as well.

225
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,060
I will rest for a while.

226
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,890
- Don't do this.
 - Let me ask you.

227
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,730
What am I to you?

228
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,300
You are this nation's grand prince.

229
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,400
I am asking you what I am to you as a man.

230
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,560
Would you like me to be honest?

231
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,820
Tell me.

232
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,140
A wretch.

233
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,840
A wretch?

234
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:01,580
♫  Do you see? My feeling for you  ♫

235
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,730
♫  Like destiny always cannot leave your side  ♫

236
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,860
♫  On a day still like this, can you hug me?  ♫

237
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,860
 Do you know what kind of star the Big Dipper is? 

238
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,160
 It is the star that watches over all the good and bad, lucky and unlucky aspects of life 

239
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,110
 ever since a person is born, allotted a span of life, by Grandma Samshin. 

240
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,040
 Then, is a person's destiny is decided at birth? 

241
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,490
 It is not easy to change the fate assigned to you. 

242
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,230
 I suppose that is true. 

243
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,940
♫  I hope we don't pass each other like the passing wind.  ♫

244
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,040
♫  I am here.  ♫

245
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,380
Painter Hong?

246
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,630
Painter Hong, are you here?

247
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,430
 Goodness. 

248
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,470
 When did she create a sketch like this? 

249
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,380
Remarkable.

250
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,820
It is as if I am seeing Royal Father alive.

251
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,280
Then, we shall now wrap up the sketch of the royal portrait.

252
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,340
Do so.

253
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,890
Now then, the sangcho* must begin.
  (Process of putting final sketch on silk)  

254
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,430
Once the sangcho begins,

256
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,990
any behavior that may bring bad luck must be forbidden.

257
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,640
From now on,

258
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,190
forbid the divine painter from leaving the palace.

259
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,560
What are we to do?

261
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,530
If Master is interrogated

262
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,980
and admits to a crime he did not commit,

263
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,780
everything will be ruined.

264
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,540
We must gather all the information at Wolseongdang to save him.

265
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
The master left this in case anything happened.

266
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,150
 If you are reading this letter, something has happened to me. 

267
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:36,750
 Do not be alarmed. Deliver this letter to Grand Prince Juhyang through Mu Yeong. 

268
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,250
Grand Prince Yangmyeong has arrested Supervisor Ha for the guards' murder incident at Inwang Mountain.

269
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,230
- Yul did?
 - Yes.

270
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,640
 Has he found out about Ma Wang's existence? 

271
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,190
Nothing must happen to Supervisor Ha until we transfer Ma Wang.

272
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,690
But it seems Grand Prince Yangmyeong already knows.

273
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,380
What do you mean?

274
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:11,190
Grand Prince Yangmyeong has been the one to oversee the restoration of the royal portrait.

275
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,100
How could that be?

276
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,190
Royal Father…

277
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,920
 Your Highness, there is a letter here for you. 

278
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,270
 I shall share the first method for Your Highness to seize the golden opportunity. 

279
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,530
So this is the map of the Investigations Bureau where the scholar is kept?

280
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,020
Listen up.

281
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,320
You go through the entrance, and there is the interrogation yard.

282
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,570
Painters sit right here in the yard and paint the criminals' appearance.

283
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,330
But other than that place, I have no idea about other places.

284
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,470
No one answers me properly, even if I ask.

285
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,390
What is this here?

286
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,420
Now that is the cells.

287
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,470
But this is only a normal cell,

288
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,890
so if you give some money to the guards, they say you can go in.

289
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,040
But the problem is...

290
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,210
Here. Here.

291
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,770
What did they say again?

292
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,200
Anyhow, it is a special cell built of rocks.

293
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,810
Here, not even the ordinary guards can approach.

294
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,670
So all of that said, you think Supervisor Ha is in there?

295
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:41,880
I asked anyone and everyone from everywhere, from every corner,

296
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,730
but no one knows.

297
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,600
Then the answer is right here.

298
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,490
Here, it has to be the rock cell.

299
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,140
They are locked away so secretly

300
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,610
that no one knows whether they are dead or alive once they go in there.

301
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,770
Right here.

302
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,760
Then, how about a way to get in?

303
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,990
I found out all I could while I was at the Investigations Bureau.

304
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:08,840
But unless you have a written command from the Grand Prince, there is no way in.

305
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,250
Should we make it? The written command?

306
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,520
Hey, hey.

307
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,340
Stop talking nonsense and finish the royal portrait.

308
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,820
He is right.

309
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,580
That will be faster than sneaking in like this.

310
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,290
I will finish the royal portrait, without a doubt.

311
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,740
I could finish even faster if you both helped me.

312
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,370
But didn't you say ordinary people couldn't paint it?

313
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,790
What, you both are ordinary people?

314
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,050
You are still painters who made it to the third round at Maejukheon Painting Contest.

315
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,410
That is not it.

316
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,450
He and I don't have that divineness. The divine power.

317
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,210
 The painting to seal Ma Wang, 

318
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,270
 King Yeongjong's royal portrait. 

319
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,260
 But not everyone can paint it. 

320
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,940
 How did Father do it? 

321
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,800
 Sealing Ma Wang. 

322
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,050
That little girl ...

323
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,290
 Can you see me? 

324
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,600
 As expected. Evil eyes. 

325
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
 Break up with Ma Wang now. 

326
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
Hey.

327
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,100
Little girl? I prepared some tea, the tea you like.

328
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,300
Won't you come out and have some?

329
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,890
I have forsythia tea, apricot tea, all of it.

330
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,250
Hey, little girl—

331
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,870
Excuse me.

332
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,950
Excuse me.

333
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,460
Who is the little girl here, baby?

334
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,690
You scared me.

335
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,720
I am Ho Ryeong of Inwang Mountain.

336
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,680
Ho Ryeong?

337
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,300
So, you ... 
   *uses casual style with no honorifics)  

338
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,830
I mean...

339
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:41,130
So, Madam Ho Ryeong, you are a spirit from Inwang Mountain that guards the palace, yes?

340
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,970
Have you finally figured that out, baby?

341
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,230
I must ask you something.

342
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,700
- What?
 - You know how before...

343
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,140
you told me to break up with Ma Wang…

344
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,650
What does that mean?

345
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,440
Oh, that?

346
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,530
I meant Ma Wang will chase you with every chance he gets,

347
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,470
so stop seeing him.

348
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,910
I'm not sure I understand what you…

349
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,570
You could die.

350
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,150
Pardon?

351
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,790
What a dimwitted human.

352
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,060
How do you think you can see me?

353
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,370
What do you think is the reason that Ma Wang,

354
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,860
who is a threat to you, keeps appearing in front of you?

355
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,440
That's...

356
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,220
Because I am the painter who will paint the royal portrait to seal him?

357
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,530
Yes, that's it.

358
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,920
That is why Ma Wang keeps manifesting every time you two touch.

359
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,030
 Avoid him when you meet him. 

360
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,780
 You never know when you could die. 

361
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,600
 Watch yourself and finish the painting. 

362
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,820
 What do you think is the reason that 

363
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,010
 Ma Wang who is a threat to you keeps appearing in front of you? 

364
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,000
Because of me...

365
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,560
Ma Wang manifests because of me...

366
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,770
What on earth is all that?

367
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,070
- The struggle with the groundwork sketch is now over. 
 - Pardon?

368
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,810
His Majesty was pleased with it.

369
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,340
He ordered an auspicious date to be set,

370
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,780
so you shall begin sangcho soon.

371
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,180
And once sangcho begins, you must stay at the palace

372
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,520
until the final version is finished.

373
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,100
You mean I cannot leave the palace?

374
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,760
That is right.

375
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,660
You cannot meet anyone or go anywhere where you might attract negative energy.

376
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,950
What is the matter?

377
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,040
If I cannot leave the palace until the royal portrait is finished,

378
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
- please let me see the scholar again before I begin. 
 - What?

379
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,830
I think I could only focus on the painting once I make sure he is doing well.

380
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,190
No, I forbid it.

381
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,200
Your Highness, just this once. I beg you.

382
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,650
Will you really behave this way?

383
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,910
Even when you know that evil, vicious being is inside Supervisor Ha?

384
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,250
I do not know how else to ask you for your help.

385
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,540
- Get up.
 - I will not get up until you agree to help me.

386
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
You truly...

387
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:27,940
This is... truly unlike you.

388
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,820
Your Highness, a painter's brush is said to be moved by her heart, rather than by her hand.

389
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,630
Then, how much more so for King Yeongjong's royal portrait that must be infused with divine power?

390
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,130
Shouldn't my heart be free from any trace of regret?

391
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,500
So, please.

392
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,440
Please let me see the scholar at least once.

393
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,620
I beg you.

394
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:58,290
 Was her love for him this deep? 

395
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,710
 Grand Prince Juhyang, 

396
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,990
 there was a message that the crown prince is in grave condition in the palace. 

397
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,240
 Call the royal physician and confirm that the crown prince is unconscious 

398
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,610
 and make this fact public. 

399
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,820
Are you Heo Yu, the physician in charge of treating the crown prince?

400
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,900
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:43,020
I hear the crown prince's health has been deteriorating with each passing day.

402
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,340
I hear he is completely unconscious.

403
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,450
P-Pardon?

404
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,560
H-how did you…

405
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,660
If the king tries to walk down the wrong path,

406
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,350
it is the basic duty of one serving him to stop him.

407
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,420
Why are you not giving His Majesty the proper counsel?

408
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,160
Do you not realize what crisis the court will suddenly face

409
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,670
if anything happens to the crown prince?

410
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,060
That's...

411
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,790
Will you continue to sit by and watch the current situation?

412
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,660
Now, His Majesty will change his mind, even if by a little.

413
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,710
Would his mind change so easily?

414
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,360
The crown prince's illness is nothing new.

415
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,570
Isn't that why His Excellency Seong Jin Gi is making his move on my behalf?

416
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,090
- But— 
 - Enough.

417
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,670
I like Il Wol Seong's game plan.

418
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:54,750
It is unlikely for the crown prince to regain his health now, is it not?

419
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,010
He is confined to his bed and barely breathing.

420
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,220
What would happen to this country if we continue to look on idly?

421
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,110
But what can we do?

422
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,710
As royal physicians receiving salaries from the nation, how can we keep our mouths shut

423
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,800
and look on with indifference without advising the king?

424
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,000
You mean I should prepare for the worst?

425
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,520
Not only is the crown prince's illness not improving,

427
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,610
but he has also been unconscious for several days now.

428
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,660
Now, you must think of the nation.

429
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,230
What do you think about this?
 (Seong Jin Gi, Minister of Personnel) 

430
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,250
It is not a new matter, so it is not wise to judge hastily.

431
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,690
However, I believe it is right to fend off possible chaos at court.
 (Kim Hong Seo, Left State Minister) 

432
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,610
That is not all.

433
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:58,360
If something happens to the crown prince before you can appoint the successor,

434
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,400
a political war will ensue among the courtiers to maintain their power.

435
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,190
You speak as if you wish something does happen to the crown prince.

436
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,190
That is absolutely not true, Your Majesty.

437
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,150
I am advising you with utmost loyalty.

438
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,140
Please take it into consideration.

439
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,630
I fully understand your counsel.

440
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,530
Let us leave it for now.

441
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,390
♫  As though nothing happened  ♫

443
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,220
♫  Even our memories will be erased  ♫

444
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:18,130
♫  Even if we could  turn back time like a lie  ♫

445
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,240
♫  your heart won't do what I want.  ♫

446
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:32,840
♫  Even when the seasons change and the flowers wilt   ♫

447
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,700
♫  the memory that we loved will remain beautiful.  ♫

448
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:47,910
♫  Even if every day is long and cold  ♫

449
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:52,270
♫  I will still be here  ♫

450
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:58,900
♫  Even if it is said the long wait is like a long slumber  ♫

451
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:06,100
It was truly wise of you to set the physicians into action.

452
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,920
Shouldn't we stoke the fire now?

453
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,370
Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,690
The scholars who studied with me under the same teacher will lead their young students.

455
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:21,630
It will be difficult for His Majesty to ignore the matter further.

456
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,560
Your Highness.

457
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,670
Among the court officials, His Excellency Seong Jin Gi continues to bring up the appointment of next crown prince.
 (Sim Jeong Wu, Researcher at the Hall of Worthies) 

458
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,040
His Excellency  Seong Jin Gi is a long-time follower of Grand Prince Juyhang.
   

459
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,560
Why do you come to me, speaking of these disloyal matters?

460
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,000
When His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is still well and alive.

461
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,810
Leave at once.

462
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,130
- Your Highness.
 - I said leave!

463
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,170
 Hyeong-nim, what do you want me to do? 

464
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,260
 Just what am I supposed to do? 

465
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,110
So, things are moving as Master Il Wol Seong planned.

466
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,060
Yes.

467
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,640
The appointment of the next crown prince is being discussed at the royal palace.

468
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,810
Whatever happens, we cannot turn back now.

469
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,870
We shall see this revenge through to its bitter end.

470
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,180
 Interrogations Confinement 

471
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,770
 There are discussions of appointing the next crown prince. 

472
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,440
 We are waiting for your next command. 

473
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,500
 Scholar Sir, are you well? 

474
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,520
 Outlining on the silk canvas based on the groundwork sketch is finally finished. 

475
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,220
Apples do not fall far from the tree.

476
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,920
She is truly a divine painter.

477
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,500
What is the next step?

478
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,030
Now that the outlining is finished, it is time to apply color.

479
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,830
Coloring will consist of filling in the colors on the back of the silk canvas,

480
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,530
and then, filling in the colors on the front.

481
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,590
In about ten days, you shall be able to examine it and order any improvements to be made.

482
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,240
All of you have worked hard.

483
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,560
I shall reward Painter Hong separately.

484
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,750
I am greatly honored, Your Majesty.

485
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,620
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Yangmyeong is here.

486
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,290
Good, I was about to summon you.

487
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,440
In about ten days, King Yeongjong's royal portrait will be finished.

488
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,920
Start preparing for the sealing ritual in time for the set date.
 (Wol Seon, 5th Head Shaman of the Royal Shamanist Bureau) 

489
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,690
Royal Father.

491
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,590
Please let Royal Shaman Wol Seon inspect the outline work.

492
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,460
It is not yet colored.

493
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,260
What is the reason?

494
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,700
Although it is not the finished royal portrait,

495
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,510
I will be able to feel its divine powers.

496
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,510
It is an extremely important step in order to seal Ma Wang.

497
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:49,190
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya sa ba ha

498
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,360
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya o sa ba ha...

499
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,700
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya o sa ba ha...

500
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,830
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya o sa ba ha...

501
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,210
Sa ba ha...

502
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,430
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya...

503
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:13,220
Da tan ya baro gijae sa ba ra ya o sa ba ha...

504
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,110
What is the matter?

505
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,040
Your Majesty, forgive me for saying this,

506
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,220
but this painting has no divine power.

507
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,060
- What?
- Is that true?

508
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:48,440
If it were divine, the painting would have absorbed the talisman.

509
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,060
Impossible...

510
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,650
It is so well-drawn that even I would immediately think of my royal father.

511
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:03,100
What Your Majesty needs is not a well-drawn royal portrait but a divine one.

512
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,000
There is definitely no divine power in this painting.

513
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,980
No divine powers in a royal portrait drawn by a divine painter?

514
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,170
How could this be?

515
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,780
I am extremely sorry.

516
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,430
What on earth happened?

517
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,850
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

518
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,230
What are we to do?

519
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,470
Your Majesty, we shall do it again.

520
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,170
You said ten days?

521
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,820
How did it go?

522
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,860
Is something wrong?

523
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,090
There is no divine power in the outlined work.

524
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,250
So it will be impossible to have the sealing ritual with that royal portrait.

525
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,690
Pardon?

526
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,820
But how...

527
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,990
I painted it with everything I've got...

528
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,880
Do you truly not realize...

529
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,050
why it did not have divine power?

530
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:44,600
Please, at least while you paint the royal portrait,

531
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,700
forget about Supervisor Ha.

532
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,900
That is the only way. I beg of you.

533
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,900
Let us start again.

534
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,520
We do not have many days left.

535
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,520
 Maiden Hong, are you well? 

536
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,380
 I miss you more than ever today. 

537
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,790
Hey, you!

538
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,650
How will you get your revenge if you are so lily-livered?

539
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,760
Who is there?

540
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,730
You are only fit to carry an A-frame loaded with poop all your life.

541
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:37,740
People will swarm to this place on this moonlit night because of your reeking poop stench.

542
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,200
Do I know you?

543
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,440
Ha of the Astronomy Bureau.

544
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,740
So you must be the son of Ha Seong Jin.

545
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,110
Do you know my father?

546
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,530
I did want to know him well.

547
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,080
Do you know your father well?

548
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,800
Yes, I do.

549
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,870
I see you were close with him.

550
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,020
Listen carefully.

551
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,150
Tonight, people will swarm in.

552
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:20,300
Out of them, only one person will reach out her hand to you.

553
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:28,280
The divine painter who could save or kill you.

554
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,350
You must grasp her hand tightly.

555
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,410
What does that mean?

556
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:42,410
Hello? Hello?

557
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,980
No divine power...

558
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,100
Divine...

559
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,770
Scholar Sir.

560
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,560
What am I to do?

561
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,390
I have a lot to tell you.

562
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:21,120
The grand prince will not help.

563
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,930
Be quiet.

564
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,990
Cheon Gi. Cheon Gi!

565
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,190
Is that Obnoxious One?

566
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,980
Hey. Why is she like this?

567
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,530
What is it?

568
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,440
Hey. Hey.

569
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,260
You're worrying us. It took us ages to find this place.

570
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,690
They really are bad at giving directions.

571
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,130
- Hey, Jeong.
 - What?

572
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,370
Are you... No way!

573
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,920
No.

574
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,130
 Royal Investigation Bureau 

575
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,880
What is it?

576
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,850
Now, now. We are here to draw criminals' features.

577
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,640
Good work out here.

578
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,340
Drawings of criminals' faces at this hour?

579
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,800
We... have no time to waste...

580
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,100
 Grand Prince Yangmyeong 

581
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,330
Grand Prince Yangmyeong's seal?

582
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,260
Hurry and take us to the stone prison.

583
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,000
Follow me.

584
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,930
- Let's go, hurry.
 - Let's go.

585
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,080
 Royal Investigation Bureau 

586
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,350
You are working hard.

587
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,870
Have you slept a little?

588
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,580
Why are you not answering me?

589
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,740
Raise your head!

590
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,450
You scared me.

591
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,750
You, Painter Choi Jeong!

592
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,450
I have sinned gravely, Master Painter Han.

593
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,700
I have sinned gravely.

594
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,170
Act naturally.

595
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,600
Who is it?

596
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,570
They are painters here to draw criminals' faces.

597
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,400
What?

598
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,780
 Grand Prince Yangmyeong 

599
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,120
You mean to tell me that the grand prince ordered you to do this at this hour?

600
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,400
Let me see you for a moment.

601
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,920
Now.

602
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,040
Arrest them!

603
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,490
Your Highness!

604
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,420
What is it?

605
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,600
Big trouble, Your Highness.

606
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:02,300
Painter Hong was arrested while trying to sneak into the Royal Investigation Bureau.

607
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,910
What?

608
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,400
What will we do now?

609
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,470
Sorry.

610
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,260
You Obnoxious One, seriously!

611
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,650
Hey, there is no other way now.

612
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,560
What will we do?  Isn't that obvious? We should at least try to escape.

613
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,330
Escape?

614
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,990
You mean, prison break?

615
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,060
Hey, I, I just said it for the fun of it.

616
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,280
- Don't scare me, acting so serious and all.
 - Painter Hong.

617
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,700
Yes, Painter Hong.

618
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,640
Get up.

619
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,390
You have less than ten minutes.

620
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

621
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,410
Scholar Sir.

622
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,650
Maiden?

623
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,100
How did you get in here?

624
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,870
Your face has grown so thin.

625
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,360
I am all right.

626
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,870
It is all because of me.

627
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:16,110
Because you met me...

628
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,840
Do not say such things.

629
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,660
- This is not your fault.
- No.

630
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,610
It is my fault.

631
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:29,630
When you and I touch, Ma Wang manifests.

632
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,600
What are you saying?

633
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,880
It is because I am the painter to lock in Ma Wang.

634
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,030
Everything is my fault.

635
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,930
Who told you that?

636
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,470
You may not believe me, but

637
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:50,730
a divine spirit of Inwang Mountain called Ho Ryeong told me.

638
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,500
Ho Ryeong?

639
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,790
 Was that the reason for Ma Wang's manifestation? 

640
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,170
What is it?

641
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,830
My thoughts are jumbled.

642
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:14,970
 Even so, if the royal portrait puts you in danger... 

643
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,100
 If that is so... 

644
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:22,270
As I said before, you must leave this place.

645
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,190
You are saying that because I may be in danger.

646
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,940
It is because I may be in danger.

647
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,090
Not you, but me!

648
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,000
No.

649
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,750
I cannot do that.

650
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,130
You cannot be stubborn about this.

651
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:54,310
My father also said this to me once.

652
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,940
That living as we did would only be a burden to me,

653
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,860
so he told me to abandon him and leave.

654
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:10,300
"This is not for you, but for me."

655
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,230
He told me to leave for his sake.

656
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,560
But how does that make any sense?

657
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,030
Father is the reason I live.

658
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,660
So even if you tell me this,

659
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,660
it is no use.

660
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,980
No matter what, I want to stay with you.

661
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,910
As it is, it was not easy to find each other again.

662
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,900
Once I finish the royal portrait, everything will work out for the best.

663
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,890
Please don't.

664
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,760
Leave...

665
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,550
while you can.

666
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,060
This is the king's command...

667
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,460
and also my fate.

668
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,150
You will regret it.

669
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,450
I will regret it, then.

670
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:28,900
As long as I can finish the royal portrait and seal Ma Wang.

671
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:37,820
 Tonight, the divine painter who could save or kill you. 

672
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,430
 You must grasp her hand tightly. 

673
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,540
Give me your hand.

674
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,060
What do you mean?

675
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,620
We must not touch—

676
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Let us check. What that fate of ours is.

677
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:30,140


678
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,000
♫  The seasons change  ♫

679
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,930
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

680
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,670
 Ha Ram! Ha Ram! 

681
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,020
 What on earth happened? 

682
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,350
 What has happened to Supervisor Ha? 

683
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,450
 Supervisor Ha fainted? 

684
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,460
 What happens to the painter who finishes the royal portrait? 

685
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,120
 Aren't we asking the painter to undertake too cruel a task? 

686
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,900
 I must finally hear what you have to say, Royal Father. 

687
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,480
 How long will you treat me as if I do not exist? 

688
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,840
 Insolence! 

689
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,300
 Your Highness, please help the scholar. 

690
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,800
 I am truly sorry. 

691
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,610
 - Open the door.
- What is it that you want? 

692
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,390
 Give Ma Wang to me. 

693
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,950
♫  All you have to do is come to me  ♫

694
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,200
♫  the one person who can heal and make a sick me all better like this  ♫

695
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:38,900
 Lovers of the Red Sky
