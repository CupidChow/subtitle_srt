1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,250


2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,800
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,220
 Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob 

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,850
 Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang 

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,100
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,510
 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,280
If it's not discourteous, I would like to know your name.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,390
My name?

9
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,220
It's Hong Cheon Gi.

10
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,120
What is your father like?

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,470
My father?

12
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,870
He is a painter...

13
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,130
who paints on the market streets everyday.

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,400
 Is it truly her? 

15
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,510
I see.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,690
I will repay you for your kindness.

17
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,550
I shall remember your name.

18
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,960
There's no need.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,170
You saved me first.

20
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,300
But why are you out here?

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,150
You should be lying down.

22
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,920
No one was here, so I came out to seek a way for myself.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,340
- I just met you and caused so much trouble.
 - Not at all.

24
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,300
You and I are acquaintances now.

25
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm afraid you will catch a cold.

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,090
You should go inside until the physician comes.

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,860
I will help you.

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,800
All right.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,330
Are you really better?

30
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,430
Isn't that the missing Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau? 
  (Seomungwan: a government office in charge of astronomy, weather, and making almanacs) 

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,140
Pardon?

32
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,050
That man?

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,630
 That is the son of Ha Seong Jin, 

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,600
 that divine child from back then. 

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,670
 As expected, Ma Wang entered that child's body on the day of the Rain Ritual. 

36
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,360
Your Highness.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,110
We should move after observing a little longer.

38
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,560
 (Yi Hu, Grand Prince Juhyang, second son of Seongjo) 

39
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,480
Thank you.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,300
Well then. Rest here for a while.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,970
 Episode 4: Red String of Fate 

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,500
 (Yi Yul, Grand Prince Yangmyeong, third son of Seongjo) 

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,710
Is anyone here?

44
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,530
Who are you?

45
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm looking for someone.

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,480
Have you seen a man in an Astronomy Bureau uniform last night, by any chance?

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,180
Astronomy Bureau uniform?

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,660
 Was that an Astronomy Bureau uniform? 

49
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,510
 I should pretend not to know for now. 

50
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,060
No, I haven't seen any.

51
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,420
- I must check.
 - Wait!

52
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,660
What are you doing barging into someone's house?

53
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,650
There is a man who is ill here.

54
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,310
-You cannot barge in without the owner's consent.
 - You!

55
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,560
How dare you get in my way!

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Insolence!

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Do you know who I am?

58
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,410
You!

59
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,170
How should I know that?

60
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,680
This will not do.

61
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,710
I am a man of good looks,

62
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,740
called the Man of Three Skills

63
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,420
for my excellence in poetry, literature, and painting.

64
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,720
I am the grand prince of this nation,

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,300
Yangmyeong.

66
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,320
I truly meant to show you my utmost respect.

67
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,450
If you are the Grand Prince Yangmyeong,

68
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,360
I am...

69
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,220
the Grand Princess Consort* of that Grand Prince Yangmyeong!
 (Title of a Grand Prince's wife) 

70
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,330
You are quite bold.

71
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,170
I may be wearing smelly clothes now, but—

72
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,290
Gutsy?

73
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,740
Gutsy?

74
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,870
All right.

75
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,610
Let us pretend you are the Grand Prince.

76
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,050
Then do people like us

77
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,730
not have the right to protect our homes if Your Highness comes in?

78
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,580
What law is that?

79
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,050
Is the name Grand Prince Yangmyeong a pass?

80
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,000
I have never experienced something like this in my life.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,580
This is quite awkward.

82
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,170
I was born as a grand prince and lived as a grand prince.

83
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,430
Thus, I only know how to speak like a grand prince.

84
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,070
One would think you really were the Grand Prince.

85
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,430
But that won't work with me.

86
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,420
You cannot ever go inside.

87
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,470
You must hurry and go back.

88
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,310
I say I am the Grand Prince.

89
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,790
- Let me just— 
 - Go back!

90
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,570
- I only want to see the ins— 
 - Go back!

91
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,720
Maiden.

92
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,190
What is it?

93
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,570
Is someone here?

94
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,100
Supervisor Ha!

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,990
Scholar Sir!

96
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,960
You were alive! You survived!

97
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
Is it not Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

98
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,760
Yes.

99
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,030
Are you all right?

100
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,290
- You are not injured anywhere?
 - No.

101
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,890
I'm not gravely injured.

102
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,570
My, that is a relief.

103
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,190
Do you know how worried I was?

104
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,850
My apologies, Your Highness.

105
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,650
Milord Grand Prince Yangayeong!

106
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,250
Milord Grand Prince Yangayeong!

107
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,500
Supervisor Sir!

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,670
- Supervisor Sir!
- Milord Grand Prince!

109
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,790
Yes, Man Su.

110
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,200
Are you all right?

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,300
- Are you really all right?
 - I'm all right.

112
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,730
Did you walk all the way here all night?

113
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,240
I was on my way to the Inwang Mountain observatory last night

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,260
and fainted inside the palanquin.

115
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,490
I do not remember anything after that.

116
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,840
When I woke up, I was here.

117
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,660
Gosh. What a mystifying incident.

118
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,770
Anyhow, I am glad you are safe.

119
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,450
Come.

120
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,480
- Let us go back.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,830
Let's go down.

122
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,620
- Yes, Your Highness.
  - Yes, Your Highness! 

123
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,790
Wait, stop!

124
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,180
Go Pil.

125
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,240
Where did that gutsy woman go?

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,870
A woman? I did not see her.

127
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,510
She was about this tall and wearing a red skirt.

128
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,220
That woman.

129
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm not sure...

130
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,240
Your Highness, there was a lady who cared for me through the night.

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,520
Perhaps you are looking for her.

132
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,590
I see...

133
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,660
Perhaps she was trying to protect you.

134
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,330
Where did she go?

135
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,300
I do not know.

136
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,640
She hid somewhere like a stray cat.

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,060
I cannot see her all of a sudden.

138
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,880
Well then. We shall go back down with Supervisor Ha.

139
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,810
- Let's go!
  - Yes, Your Highness. 

140
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,320
One moment, Your Highness.

141
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,840
- Are you finished?
 - Yes.

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,640
All right, let us go.

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,930
Let's go.

144
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,150
 Supervisor Ha and Yangmyeong. 

145
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,600
 Are they just friends? Or... 

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,260
As expected, Supervisor Ha is suspicious, Your Highness.

147
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,510
Why were there no signs all these years?

148
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,850
We will find out once we investigate.

149
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,270
Gosh, I'm dying here.

150
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,330
Cheon Gi.

151
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,050
Where is he?

152
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,010
 There no trace of life left in those bodies...  It must be the doing of Ma Wang. 

153
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,640
 It was a m-monster. 

154
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,760
 It does not make sense if it was not a monster! 

155
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,990
 I fainted inside the palanquin. I do not remember anything. 

156
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,070
  Supervisor Ha is suspicious, Your Highness. 

157
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,070
 Wounds like these do not heal on their own. 

158
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,890
 You must encounter the being that first gave you this wound. 

159
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,820
 It was Ma Wang. 

160
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,800
 It was Ma Wang who came into my body and gave me this incurable wound. 

161
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,630
 I must find him. 

162
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,400
 Without fail. 

163
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,120
What?

164
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,140
Did something inhuman kill the royal guards?

165
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,360
Yes. I have never seen corpses like those.

166
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,070
They looked like sword wounds, but they are black as if burnt

167
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,820
and their life force seems to have been sucked dry.

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,650
I see.

169
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,200
Yul.

170
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,940
How are the preparations for Maejukheon Painting Contest* coming along? 
 (lit: Painting Gathering at Plum Blossom and Bamboo Manor) 

171
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,830
The preparations are underway as planned.

172
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,580
I must ask you a favor in regard to the contest.

173
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,200
Please order me to do anything, Royal Father.

174
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,590
Your Majesty, Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy Bureau is here.

175
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,600
You realize what you have done wrong.

176
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,120
You did not take care of yourself and protect yourself.

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,650
That is your wrongdoing.

179
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,540
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

180
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,150
I shall forgive you if you can give a clear explanation

181
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,160
of something ominous that happened while you were away.

182
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,130
- Ask, Your Majesty.
 - A parliament of owls cried at Eunjeongjeon last night.

183
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,570
Every time owls cry, people say that they are begrudging spirits of this nation.

184
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,510
Your Majesty, owls represent wealth.

185
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,470
It is because after acquiring food, they stock them.

186
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,630
It could be read as wealth and authority for the throne.

187
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,210
Additionally, owls are animals of wisdom that brighten up the darkness.

188
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,140
That such sacred animals sat on the roof of Eunjeongjeon...

189
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,550
You mean this is a good omen?

190
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,420
But the royal guards have lost their precious lives.

191
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,240
Is all this only coincidence?

192
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,790
Your Majesty, I may speak out of turn, but

193
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,610
is it truly the owls that cause you unease?

194
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,940
I cannot deceive you.

195
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,950
Sit comfortably.

196
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,660
A month later, the envoys from Yeon Empire will arrive.

197
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,400
The Emperor's brother, Yu Si Hong, will be a part of the envoy.

198
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,800
The Crown Prince is inexperienced and won't be able to deal with them.

199
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:05,180
I shall take care of this and then abdicate, making the Crown Prince ascend the throne.

200
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,270
So, find me an auspicious day for the abdication.

201
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,960
Do you mean...

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,700
Yes.

203
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,840
It is time for me to step down.

204
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,370
My health is declining rapidly.

205
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,420
I cannot help but worry for the country.

206
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,950
However, Your Majesty,

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,600
I hear an unknown disease is spreading in the Crown Prince's body.

208
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,470
Yes.

209
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,350
I heard from the royal physician.

210
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,310
He will gradually recover from his sickness.

211
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,920
Your Majesty, I put my life on the line to say a word.

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,000
We cannot disregard the possibility of the Grand Prince Juhyang

213
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,170
with his great spirit, or the Grand Prince Yangmyeong who's highly respected by the court, ascending the throne.

214
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,250
Abdicating hastily and giving the throne to the ill Crown Prince in the midst of such a state of affairs—

215
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,270
You must know...

216
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:08,710
that neither my father nor I were the eldest, thus the rightful heir.

217
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,180
Every time there was drought and famine, the people would criticize me,

218
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,410
saying that the heavens do not approve of me.

219
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,940
Your Majesty, how could you say such things?

220
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,550
You do not understand the animosity of the people when the rightful eldest doesn't ascend the throne.

221
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:35,990
Thus, the Crown Prince must ascend the throne as soon as possible and have his legitimacy acknowledged.

222
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,110
No matter what happens after that.

223
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,770
♫  Can you see my feelings for you?  ♫

224
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,200
 I wonder if he made it back safely. 

225
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,550
♫  I hold onto you like destiny and can't leave you  ♫

226
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,620
 I wonder if she made it back safely. 

227
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,760
♫  I am still like this  ♫

228
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,260
 Ilhwaekseong.* 
 (the spirit of the artist shown at the moment the brush touches the paper) 

229
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,820
 It means you end with a single brush stroke. 

230
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,960
 It also means you cannot undo a stroke. 

231
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,600
 Only when you can contain vitality, meaning, and virtue into a single brushstroke, 

232
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,730
 you can express the vividness and liveliness of a painting. 

233
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,970
♫  I love you, I love you, only you  ♫

234
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:13,830
♫  So we don't pass each other like the passing breeze,  ♫

235
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,150
♫  I will be here  ♫

236
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,610
True, how could I have hoped for such a thing?

237
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,210
It's impossible for me to have such a relationship.

238
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,870
 (Gyeonju Daek: Baegyu Painting Institute's housekeeper) 

239
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,660
What are you muttering about?

240
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,290
Are you still thinking about that scholar or that "divine being" at the paint-making house?

241
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,310
Fine.

242
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,400
I did something good, and now I should forget.

243
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,750
Forget about it.

244
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,180
Cheon Gi, what are you doing?

245
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,480
- Come see this.
 - What?

246
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,950
Come on.

247
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,650
Come.

248
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,890
What is it?

249
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,240
Ah! It has happened, finally. Finally, it's happening.

250
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,450
The anticipated and longed-for Maejukheon Painting Contest.

251
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,930
The Grand Prince Yangmyeong, skilled in painting and literature

252
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,910
has prepared this contest for the sake of daubers like us.

253
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,230
It has been so many years since the last one.

254
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,900
 If you are the Grand Prince Yangmyeong, 

255
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,930
 I am the Grand Princess Consort of that Grand Prince Yangmyeong! 

256
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,790
- This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
 - Goodness!

257
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,330
Don't shove your face everywhere.

258
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,660
Cheon Gi, the headmaster is looking for you.
 (Kang Chun Bok: Chief Steward at Baegyu Painting Institute) 

259
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,860
 (Choi Won Ho, Headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute) 

260
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,430
Do you know why I called you?

261
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,550
You don't want me to attend the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

262
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,830
No.

263
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,400
You can attend the contest.

264
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,530
- Do you really mean it?
 - Of course.

265
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,510
Once you finish the commissioned sehwas

266
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,240
and finish the hwajohwa folding screen for Lord Choi—

267
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,160
You're just telling me not to go.

268
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,850
I only mean you should finish your work before you go.

269
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,380
I never said you couldn't go.

270
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,330
Fine.

271
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,180
If I finish them on the appointed date,

272
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,840
you will put my name on the contest participant list.

273
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,820
Don't go back on your word.

274
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,840
That, that...

275
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,870
What if she really finishes them?

276
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,940
Why would you promise her such a thing?

277
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,900
It would take all the painters working together a week to finish it.

278
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,850
By the appointed date? Never. Impossible.

279
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:54,290
♫  I prayed earnestly and searched the darkness  ♫

280
00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:01,030
♫  The moon once covered by clouds shines upon us  ♫

281
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:08,280
♫  Even though my heart is torn and tears blur my vision  ♫

282
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,810
♫  I cannot hold your hands for you  ♫

283
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:22,620
♫  Our love hurt so and our love was earnest  ♫

284
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,240
♫  I won't let go anymore  ♫

285
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,430
♫  I will protect you by your side  ♫

286
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,840
 The fifth star in the constellation is shining. 

287
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,510
 The 27th constellation is two degrees to the right. 

288
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,100
♫  My heart is full of your scent  ♫

289
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:47,000
♫  Deep within it, there is only you  ♫

290
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,990
Gather, everyone.

291
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,550
Here is the list of attendees for the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

292
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,660
- I'm there!
 - My name is there.

293
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,470
Me, too!

294
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,010
Headmaster!

295
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,890
Have you really excluded my name?

296
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,880
First bring me the paintings you promised to finish by today.

297
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,870
Hey.

298
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,510
What are you...

299
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,030
- What are you doing?
 - I'll add my name to the list.

300
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,860
No. If the headmaster finds out, he will have my head.

301
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,730
Give that back.

302
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,340
Since when did you obey the headmaster?

303
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,540
I wonder if the headmaster knows that you meet Gangho Daek in the neighboring town every day.

304
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,520
- Gangho Daek!
 - How did you..? That's a secret!

305
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,000
- Gangho Daek!
 - Hush! Promise me.

306
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,750
All right.

307
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,000
 (Hong Cheon Gi) 

308
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,200
There.

309
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,860
Here you go.

310
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,670
Cheon Gi, deliver this list yourself.

311
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,250
- What?
 - I'm too nervous to take it.

312
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,060
I don't know anything about this. Nothing, nothing!

313
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,220
All right, I'll take care of it!

314
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,700
Wait. I need to go to Maejukheon to deliver the list.

315
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,970
And there...

316
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,180
Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

317
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,060
What should I do?

318
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,200
 He wouldn't recognize me like this, right? 

319
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,140
This is too stuffy.

320
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,300
 Cheon Gi, you cannot sully these clothes. 

321
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,520
 You must make sure to return them to me by tomorrow. 

322
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,590
Well. I'll just be careful and return quickly.

323
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,140
 Scholar Sir... 

324
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,170
 how was your day today? 

325
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,990
Maejuk...

326
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,960
Is it here?

327
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
How grand.

328
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,560
 I wonder if you have recovered. 

329
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,660
There are carps.

330
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,280
 If we meet again like that day by chance, 

331
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:09,430
 I would like to paint your face then. 

332
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,070
Who...

333
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,060
goes there?

334
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,860
 I see the wine pot of Gao Wen Ji 

335
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,140
I asked who you are.

336
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,250
 He wouldn't remember even if I told him. 

337
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,780
I'm here to deliver the attendee list from Baegyu Painting Institute.

338
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,330
 It's that woman from the paint-making house. 

339
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,510
Grand Prince Yangmyeong is not in at the moment.

340
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,230
Then, I shall leave the list here and go.

341
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,410
- Well then.
 - Wait.

342
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,160
Could it be...

343
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,570
What are you doing?

344
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,270
Your voice is familiar.

345
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,890
Are you not Hong Cheon Gi from the paint-making house?

346
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,570
Pardon?

347
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,710
Have I offended you so much that you will not greet me?

348
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,480
No!

349
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,420
No.

350
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,460
That's not it...

351
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,830
The truth is, I've been disrespectful to the Grand Prince—

352
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,480
What, did you confess your feelings for him?

353
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,230
The Grand Prince looked for you as we left the paint-making house.

354
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,880
I was wondering what had happened.

355
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,270
Well...

356
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,020
That day at the paint-making house, I said to the Grand Prince Yangmyeong...

357
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,930
 "If you are the Grand Prince Yangmyeong, I am... 

358
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,580
 the Grand Princess Consort of that Grand Prince Yangmyeong!" 

359
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,410
I said that aloud.

360
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,550
Don't laugh like that.

361
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,560
I knew you would not understand

362
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,740
how serious this is.

363
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,570
 So... 

364
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,540
 what are we doing here? 

365
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,350
 You would not understand even if I told you. 

366
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:35,230
So why did you come all the way to Maejukheon, risking to be seen by Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

367
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,140
I had to deliver the list of attendees to the painting contest.

368
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,610
Give that to me and go on your way.

369
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,240
I shall relay it to him.

370
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,850
- You would do that?
 - Of course.

371
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,720
I will work out your misunderstanding, as it was my fault.

372
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,760
Apologies- I mean,

373
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,200
you have graced me with your kindness!

374
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,650
Then, I shall leave the list with you and get going.

375
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,550
One moment.

376
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,240
Supervisor Ha, you're here.

377
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
Your Highness.

378
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,010
Hold on.

379
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,330
Who are you?

380
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,450
That woman is...

381
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,670
the stray cat from the paint-making house.

382
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,310
Your Highness.

383
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,000
You!

384
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,470
Wait.

385
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,670
I was looking for you.

386
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,500
I don't know what you mean.

387
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,100
I think you have mistaken me for someone else.

388
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,350
Is that so?

389
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,090
I will know if you face me.

390
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,230
 (Baegyu Painting Institute) 

391
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,070
What are you doing?

392
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,430
Forgive me!

393
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,720
 (Baegyu Painting Institute) 

394
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Baegyu Painting Institute.

395
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,030
I know Headmaster Choi well.

396
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,650
Are you from Baegyu Painting Institute?

397
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,950
No, I'm...

398
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,360
I shall take this list.

399
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,040
Oh, no.

400
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,800
I will send it again more officially.

401
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,180
Give that to me.

402
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,050
No, no.

403
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,970
Come now.

404
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,730
I will send it again!

405
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,710
Are you all right?

406
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,670
Yes.

407
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,890
Geez! What were you thinking?

408
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,840
Let us go inside, Your Highness.

409
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,250
Maiden.

410
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,330
So, why did you run?

411
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,840
When I found out that you, whom I saw in Inwang Mountain,

412
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,020
are indeed the Grand Prince Yangmyeong,

413
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,650
I did not have the courage to face you.

414
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,650
And if you saw the list that I gave you,

415
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,870
how could I not be at a disadvantage?

416
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,590
I am a Grand Prince of this nation.

417
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,270
I would not use a mere painter list to get revenge.

418
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,480
"Mere painter list?"

419
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,470
You indeed only know how to speak as a grand prince as you have only lived as one.

420
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,400
You were right.

421
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,660
To a high-born grand prince like yourself,

422
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,140
it may just be a mere painter list.

423
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,750
But, this list, at the very least, has...

424
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,360
my friends' lives and the honor of Baegyu Painting Institute,

425
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,110
and my life's hope written in it.

426
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,190
So who told you to act so boldly at the paint-making house?

427
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,790
This would not have happened had you not said such shameless things.

428
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,100
But that is...

429
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,060
I just...

430
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,960
How could I have known you were truly Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

431
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
Come on.

432
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,240
Are you talking back to me?

433
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,650
All right, it is clear now.

434
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,850
Maiden Hong was trying to protect me

435
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,770
and made a mistake, not knowing who you are.

436
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,810
Forgive her for not recognizing Your Highness

437
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,690
with your generosity as vast as the ocean.

438
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,920
I have already forgiven her.

439
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,130
You may not have recognized him, but he is still this nation's Grand Prince.

440
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,890
You, too, must beg for proper forgiveness for your rude actions.

441
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,150
Grand Prince Yangmyeong, I deserve to die.

442
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,250
I cannot hear you.

443
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,440
That day, with my benighted vision,

444
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
I did not recognize Your Highness and committed a sin deserving of death.

445
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,500
Louder!

446
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,780
I deserve to die!

447
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:03,210
Of course, those who disrespect a royal deserve to die.

448
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,710
But that is enough.

449
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,580
I did not realize you were a painter either.

450
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,410
I take back what I said about a mere painter list.

451
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:21,080
Besides, if I kill you, I would become a widower.

452
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,380
Pardon?

453
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,320
You said you were my grand princess consort.

454
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,900
No, that's...

455
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:37,290
I even forgave you for swinging at me earlier because you are my grand princess consort.

456
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,630
Forgive me, Your Highness.

457
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,350
I have disrespected you as I am blind.

458
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,860
That is all right.

459
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,510
It was a mistake, after all.

460
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,630
Sit up now.

461
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,940
If you are finished talking, you should leave.

462
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,120
Yes.

463
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,320
I shall be going now.

464
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,880
Yes.

465
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,850
You should take your leave.

466
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,940
How is your recovery?

467
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,830
Thanks to you, I feel much better.

468
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,870
I came to thank you.

469
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,450
I was about to call you as I have something for you.

470
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,160
Here.

471
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,850
What is this?

472
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,490
It is an invitation to the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

473
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,900
This time, the first place will be chosen by an auction,

474
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,550
so you, the richest man in Gwanyang, should attend

475
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,970
and grace the contest.

476
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,550
I have been already wondering about the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

477
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,970
We were thinking along the same lines.

478
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,500
 Notice 

479
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,330
This isn't your usual yearly painting competition!

480
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,380
The eldest son of Old Man Kang Son Ju, from whose household hails the prior first place winner,

481
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,240
the godly brushstroke, Gang Hi Yeon!

482
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,090
They say this man wields his brush with astonishing adroitness.

483
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,320
The Painting Bureau's consummate brushstroke, Choi Jeong!

484
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,850
Jeolla Province's most talented,

485
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,330
Monk Man Yu!

486
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,320
Gyeongsang Provinces's spellbinding brush lines,

487
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,780
the magical Sim Sat Gat* 
  (His name means "conical straw hat") !

488
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,660
Now, everyone, wager on the first place winner of your guess!

489
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,450
The so-called life's all-in game!

490
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,850
Maejukheon's gamble for the first place winner!

491
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,760
 Have you prepared the painting supplies? 

492
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,880
 Yes, Your Highness. 

493
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,180
Go Pil.

494
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,840
Make absolutely certain you mark every drawing paper.

495
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,420
Do not worry, Your Highness.

496
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,850
Deok Soe.

497
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,070
Yes, Your Highness?

498
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,990
The location of this incense altar is...

499
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,900
You seem busy with preparation for the competition late into the night.
 (Han Geon: Master Painter of the Painting Bureau) 

500
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,010
Master Painter Han, you're here.

501
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,440
I am almost finished.

502
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,380
The marketplace's gallery lane and painting institutes

503
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,100
are all hustling and bustling at the long-awaited painting competition.

504
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,380
I am most excited to see which painter

505
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,260
will surprise me this year.

506
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,740
Oh, yes.

507
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,620
Have you looked into that cheeky imitation painter?

508
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes. I tried, but...

509
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,330
Wolseongdang is closed now

510
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,080
and it is difficult to find out right away.

511
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,750
If you could give me more time...

512
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,350
Blast.

513
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,880
Is that so.

514
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,230
There is a chance that the guy could compete at this contest, too.

515
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,440
With his talent, he absolutely could.

516
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,480
I would like to see that man's face.

517
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,950
Your Highness.

518
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,090
What? A divine painter?

519
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,920
You mean we must find a divine painter

520
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
to recreate the predecessor King's portrait?

521
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,630
Yes, Your Highness.

522
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,790
From generation to generation, the predecessor king's portrait could be drawn only by a painter with divine powers

523
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,870
or that painter's descendants.

524
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,050
So, we must find such a divine painter from this contest.

525
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,290
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:20,080
 But is there a method to recognize such a painter? 

527
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,220
Father!

528
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,690
Father! Father!

529
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,700
Father! Father!

530
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,560
Father! Please help me!

531
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,670
Help me! Father!

532
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,630
It is too late.

533
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm sorry?

534
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,760
What do you mean by that?

535
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,860
If he has another fit of madness in the future,

536
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:24,680
he will continue to live semi-unconscious and die soon after.

537
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,480
What?

538
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,390
What do you mean die?

539
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,670
Please save him, physician!

540
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,930
My father has had to live his whole life alone in a feeble state of mind.

541
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,690
Please, save him this once! Please, I beg you!

542
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,070
There is one medicine I can prescribe.

543
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,590
But I'm not sure if it would work.

544
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,990
What is it?

545
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,020
 Cheongsimwon.*
 (medicine made of Calculus Bovis and Dioscoreae Rhizoma among other components) 

546
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,080
 It is the best medicine known to remedy lunacy. 

547
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,450
 Perhaps royals could get it. 

548
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,000
 We cannot get it here. 

549
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,090
A precious medicine only used in the palace.

550
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,950
How am I to obtain it?

551
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,480
Hey.

552
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,190
Why are you making that face? Did you cry?

553
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,920
Is it because of your father?

554
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,830
- Is he unwell?
 - How can he not be?
 (Cha Yeong Uk, Baegyu Institute Painter) 

555
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,390
He is always sitting out in the market streets.
 (Choi Jeong, Painter at the Painter Bureau) 

556
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,640
It is incredible that he hasn't fallen ill already.

557
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,720
Hey! Cheon Gi!

558
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,170
Hey, Cheon Gi.

559
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,350
Hey...  Aigoo...

560
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,030
Are you all right?

561
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,470
Maejukheon drawing contest.

562
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:07,210
All the nation's rich and powerful, magnates and nobles gather at Grand Prince Yangmyeong's Maejukheon painting contest.

563
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,220
The monetary award is enormous.

564
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,160
If you were to win the first place,

565
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,320
you would have enough to buy the medicine.

566
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,570
I heard His Highness even granted the wish of the previous winner.

567
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,850
But I hear all the great paint slingers of the eight provinces of the nation who are worth their name will gather there.

568
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,970
Won't it be hard just to pass the first round?

569
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,560
- Is that true?
 - Of course, Cheon Gi.

570
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,570
You don't know how wide the world is,

571
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,380
- but there are plenty of hidden teachers—
 - Not that.

572
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,220
Is it true that Grand Prince Yangmyeong will grant your wish if you win first place?

573
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,200
Y... yes, of course.

574
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,010
Cheon Gi!

575
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,070
Where have you been to show your face only now?

576
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,830
The neighboring town's Lord Kim ordered as his sehwas a Seonyeodo  (drawing of fairy)  and a Sanshindo  (drawing of mountain god) .

577
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,550
The munbaes  (door painting to repel evil spirits)   for Sajikdong's Scholar Seo—

578
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:06,160
Do you truly have no intention to send me to the painting contest?

579
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,510
Men and women each have their place, and the rules of social class are strict.

580
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,510
So instead of going to the contest, I should just do what I'm told. Is that it?

581
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,900
I never said that.

582
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,830
I said I would let you go if you finished all your work.

583
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,820
Headmaster, are you afraid that I would sully Baegyu Painting Institute's honor at the drawing competition?

584
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,800
J-j-just listen to the way you talk.

585
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,210
How dare you spew out such a thing to me?

586
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,920
Forget the painting competition. You are not to leave this place for the time being.

587
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,270
I don't want to.

588
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,490
You dare defy my words?

589
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,850
Why?

590
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,630
Because you think I'll go mad like Father while painting?

591
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,470
That...

592
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,600
Cheon Gi, that's not it...

593
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,380
It's no use even if you say that to me!

594
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,590
You have no idea...

595
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,220
You, you...

596
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,040
Geez, my head...

597
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,920
 Father... 

598
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,320
 What should I do? 

599
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,710
 Maejukheon Painting Contest. The award money is enormous. 

600
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,390
 Grand Prince Yangmyeong is hosting it. 

601
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,640
 He is this nation's most skilled painter, calligrapher and a man of letters, favored by His Majesty. 

602
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,790
 Yes. If you get first place, His Highness will grant whatever you wish. 

603
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,380
All right.

604
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,110
Let's do it.

605
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,060
Please wait a little while, Father.

606
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,070
 Simcheonggak 

607
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,890
I was so shocked when I heard you had disappeared. 
  (Mae Hyang: Head gisaeng of Simcheonggak) 

608
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,700
How is your health?

609
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,070
Your job is not to worry about me.

610
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,320
What about the task I gave you?

611
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,000
As you ordered, I obtained the property records of the Supreme General.

612
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,060
Good work.

613
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,310
 Grand Prince Juhyang is here. 

614
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,980
I'm coming.

615
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,770
I shall be going.

616
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,880
Be particularly careful with your actions.

617
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,630
He is full of suspicion.

618
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,220
Yes, I will.

619
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,790
You're here.

620
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,840
This is the beginning.

621
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,120
Yes, Sir.

622
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,630
But, must you do it at Maejukheon?
 (Mu Yeong: Il Wol Seong's bodyguard) 

623
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,600
I worry your identity will be revealed.

624
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,990
I understand your concern.

625
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,310
But...

626
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,380
now that His Majesty has revealed his thoughts

627
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,390
is the right time to get my revenge.

628
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,660
Yes, Sir. And I investigated the woman from the paint-making house as you asked.

629
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,030
And?

630
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,960
Hong Cheon Gi is her real name.

631
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,550
She lost her mother at a young age.

632
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,270
She is an ordinary painter who paints to support her father.

633
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,450
Her father was once a painter at the Painting Bureau,

634
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,100
 but now he is mentally ill ... 

635
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,680
 and works on the market streets. 

636
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,220
 It is her. 

637
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,240
 It has to be her. 

638
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,230
What is it?

639
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,540
What happened to her eyes?

640
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,780
What do you mean?

641
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,210
How is she able to see now?

642
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,810
Was she blind before?

643
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,300
 My revenge is just within my reach. 

644
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,360
 Now of all the times ... 

645
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,780
- Sir?
 - It is nothing.

646
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,720
Let's go.

647
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,900
I heard that His Majesty will abdicate the throne 
  (Seong Jin Gi: Minister of Personnel) 
 (Ahn Yeong Hoe: Grand Prince Juhyang's strategist) 

648
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,630
in favor of the crown prince after the visit of the envoy from the Yeon Dynasty.

649
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,000
The Crown Prince?

650
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,780
I hear none of the myriad medicines the Royal Physician's Office used has any effect on the crown prince. 
  (Seo Gi Jeong: Advisor at the Office of Special Advisors)  

651
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,380
His Majesty ordered the Astronomy Bureau to find an auspicious date. So it is for certain.

652
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,390
What we expected has only been moved up.

653
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,700
Your Highness.

654
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,550
Is this what you expected?

655
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,300
Forgive me, Your Highness.

656
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,630
Because of his illness, I hear...

657
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,450
Hyeong-nim has trouble falling asleep.

658
00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:00,780
Gifting him with a deeper slumber would be another way to cure him, wouldn't it?

659
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,200
But it is too soon.

660
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,460
- Too soon?
 - Yes.

661
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,870
Even if we succeed in the coup,

662
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,170
we need the support of the ministers and officers of the court.

663
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:21,900
In the court, we still lack those who trust and follow Your Highness.

664
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:29,220
We must turn Grand Prince Yangmyeong to our side.

665
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,130
- Yul?
 - Yes, Your Highness.

666
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,300
How about attending Maejukheon Painting Contest this year?

667
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,400
It is a good opportunity to test Grand Prince Yangmyeong's willingness.

668
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,850
I will be attending the contest as a judge.

669
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,870
Should Your Highness attend, I shall attend to you closely.

670
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,880
 Your Highness, it is Mae Hyang. 

671
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,380
Mae Hyang?

672
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,740
Enter.

673
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,470
My name is Yeon Ji.

674
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,620
My name is Myeong Wol.

675
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,060
You made a promise to me last time.

676
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:39,040
When you returned to Simcheonggak, you promised to call on me.

677
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,390
My heart has been tied to this one place ever since that day.

678
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,420
What man would open his heart to such

679
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,570
pickup lines often heard in a courtesan house?

680
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,850
When it comes to men...

681
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,950
all is good, but they are all tediously the same.

682
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,500
They feign aloofness, pretend to be a righteous scholar,

683
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,310
but they become a little child in my lap.

684
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:28,330
I cannot hide my affection for Your Highness tonight.

685
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,990
I summoned you to this room today as a gesture of good will toward your interest in me.

686
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,170
Nothing more, nothing less.

687
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,000
Do you understand?

688
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,260
Yes, Your Highness.

689
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,310
Should you try to test me again,

690
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,680
I shall not laugh it over.

691
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,080
I will keep that in mind.

692
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,200
Well, then. Let us drink.

693
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,400
Yes, let us.

694
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:06,570
Have another.

695
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:11,450
Then, shall I trust you and bet a large sum at the Maejukheon painting contest?

696
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,670
I am honored, Your Highness.

697
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,590
Why is it so hard to find the outhouse?

698
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,310
Starting tomorrow, we shall open Wolseongdang again.

699
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,460
Yes, sir.

700
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,560
What shall I do with the deputy leader, Jeong Soen Nae?

701
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,370
Make sure he does not set foot into Gwanyang* again. 
  (Fictional capital of the fictional Dan Dynasty] 

702
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,980
Yes, sir.

703
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,540
- Il Wol Seong?
 - He's talking about you, isn't he?

704
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,860
Geez! Are you deaf?

705
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,300
Let's go to Wolseongdang. 
 (Jeong Soen Nae : Deputy Chief of Wolseongdang)

706
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,660
What? Hyeong-nim, now?

 (Long Teng: Years of Rainwater) 

708

Get everything worth the money.

709
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,650
Yes, Hyeong-nim.

710
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,540
My life is ruined because of that dirty wench.

711
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,070
Hong Cheon Gi.

712
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,200
Wait until I catch you.

713
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,550
I will break you.

714
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:28,340
Since she's a painter, she must be busy preparing for the painting contest herself.

715
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,500
Of course.

716
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,190
The prize money is enormous.

717
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,750
Wait.

718
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,120
Prize money?

719
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,230
What did you do with the attendee list?

720
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,420
By chance, did you write down

721
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,290
your name on the list?

722
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,720
Yes.

723
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,870
You don't heed my words, do you?

724
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,120
At first, I wrote it because I was angry.

725
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,940
But now, I have an important reason to participate in the contest.

726
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,490
- Please give me a chance.
 - Shut it!

727
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,390
- Chun Bok.
 - Yes, Headmaster?

728
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,670
Send her to the Shed of Truth.

729
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,870
- Yes.
 - Headmaster!

730

Wait, Uncle!

731
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,510
Uncle, wait!

732
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,400
- Come on, let's go.
 - That's not it!

733
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,580
Please don't do this, Headmaster!

734
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,970
Headmaster!

735
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,440
Headmaster!

736
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,380
- Reflect on your actions and finish your paintings.
 - Please open the door!

737
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,590
Please!

738
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,210
Headmaster!

739
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,270
Headmaster, Father is-

740
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,190
Father...

741
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,970
 No. Headmaster won't have any good answer either. 

742
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,370
 The only way is to win in the painting contest.

begin with a line and end with a line.

746

Do not forget.

You must put all your painterly strength into a single brush stroke.

  - Yes, Headmaster!

- Good morning, Headmaster.
 - Yes...

- Do not be so nervous.
 - Yes.

 Yes. 

760

Welcome, Grand Prince Juhyang.

761
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,290
You are hard at work. Where Is Yangmyeong?

Headmaster!

765
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,100
You said your lifework is to teach the ways of painting

766
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,110
and not block the paths of the painters,

767
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,660
but you lock me up like this.

768

Yes, Sir. Of course. One moment.

Not yet ready?

No, you can't!

776
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,780
It is locked.

00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,010
A dog walking down the street would laugh.

813
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,760
If you don't have a contestant's identification stick, you cannot go inside. So there.

814
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,650
Next, next. Hurry up and wrap it up.

815
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,270
- Wait...
- Hurry, hurry.

816
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,610
Let's go while I'm being polite. Let's not waste energy.

817
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,840
Wait, hold on!

818
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,230
What is going on here?

819
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,080
Let go of that hand right now.

820
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,250
Palanquin?

821
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,580
Sir Scholar.

822
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,100
I see.

823
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,130
So, you two are in that kind of relationship, huh?

824
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,360
Watch your mouth!

825
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,060
- This is-
- Man Su.

826
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,000
Yes, Sir.

827
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,870
I will take her with me.

828
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,970
Who says? Come here!

829
00:59:53,260 --> 01:00:00,300


830
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:16,800
♫  I was you and you were me  ♫

831
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:23,930
♫  I love you, I love you, only you  ♫

832
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:31,740
♫  So we don't pass each other like the passing breeze  ♫

833
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,860
♫  I will be here  ♫

834
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,000
♫  I'm afraid it will all be a dream when I open my eyes  ♫

835
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,490
♫  Is this the love you speak of?  ♫

836
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,470
♫  You can try to deny it  ♫

837
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,000
 Lovers of the Red Sky
