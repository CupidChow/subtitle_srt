 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,400
Are you all right? The palanquin is...

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,590
S-Scholar Sir?

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,390
What is wrong?

10
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,890
Are you unwell?

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,580
- I think you should get off now.
- Pardon?

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,990
So suddenly?

13
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,420
Man Su, stop the palanquin.

14
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,950
Pardon?

15
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,560
 Yes, Supervisor Sir. Stop the palanquin. 

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,540
Scholar Sir?

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,430
Scholar Sir, at least tell me your name.

18
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,630
Hurry, let's go.

19
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,190
- Man Su.
- Y-yes...

20
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,950
Yes, Supervisor Sir.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,190
 Supervisor? 

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,380
Be careful on your way home.

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,750
Let's go.

24
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,930
 One, two, three! 

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,860
So suddenly...

26
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,360
Wait, Scholar Sir! Your name!

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,890
Sir...

28
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,500
Do I smell of sweat?

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,740
Darn.

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,290
 Episode 3: Ma Wang 

31
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,830
Will she be all right alone at night?

32
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,550
The capital is just ahead, but...

33
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,190
Sir?

34
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,770
I mean, how could he just tell me to get off so suddenly?

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,870
Is this the right way?

36
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,540
I wonder how Annoying One and Long Face are doing.

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,730
Whoa.

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,290
What's wrong with these people...

39
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,080
Hold on tightly.

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,620
The road is rough here.

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,600
The palanquin keeps shaking!

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
No, wait.

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,540
It's shaking too much.

44
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,010
Hold on!

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Put down the palanquin!

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
What are you doing?

47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,400
S-Sir, are you all right?

48
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
Whoa...

49
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,890
Sir?

50
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,670
What is that?

51
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,620
A tiger.

52
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,130
- A tiger!
- No!

53
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,920
It's a monster! A monster!

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,810
 (Ha Ram Ma: when Ma Wang sealed in Ha Ram's body manifests himself) 

55
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,060
Sir!

56
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,600
He's not here.

57
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,000
 Dongang Gate 

58
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,670
Run!

59
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,940
Hurry!

60
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,960
Get away!

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,510
 You have made a mistake, Ha Ram. 

62
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,790
 You have left the palace on the winter solstice, when the yin energy is at its fullest*  
(the day with most demonic and ghostly activities)

63
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,610
I found ...

64
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,620
my eyes.

65
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,110
 (Changjeong Gate) 

66
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,950
 (King Seongjo, 4th king of the Dan Dynasty) 

67
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,300
Your Majesty.

68
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,590
Your Majesty.

69
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,150
Are you all right?

70
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,960
Left State Minister, so you must have heard if you have ears.

71
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,300
There is a rumor...

72
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,920
that those owls are begrudging spirits, who had died unfairly at the palace.

73
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,650
The bloodshed by the late king in the palace

74
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,890
returned as begrudging spirits.

75
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,370
One or many...

76
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,170
they are only wild animals.

77
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:11,940
It is undeniable that every time an owl cries, someone falls ill or dies

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,660
It's the owls' nature to cry at night.
 (Kim Hong Seo: Left State Minister, Senior 1st Rank) 

79
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,180
Please do not concern yourself.

80
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,050
However, the old saying goes that
  (Seong Jin Gi: Minister of Personnel, Senior 2nd Rank) 

81
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,630
every time an owl cries in the village, a household is bereaved.

82
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,550
Minister of Personnel ...

83
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,800
do not cause worry for His Majesty with such foul words.

84
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,210
Your Majesty, there is no doubt it is an ominous foreshadowing.

85
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,900
Has Supervisor Ha not returned from Inwang Mountain yet?

86
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,030
I must discuss it with him in person.

87
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,730
He is on duty at the astronomical observatory until tomorrow morning.

88
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,010
Why do you seek a man like Supervisor Ha every time something like this happens?

89
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,990
I will ask Supervisor Jang of the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau to relay to Supervisor Ha to return immediately.

90
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,730
How can a king earn his people's respect

91
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,900
should such strange happenings continue?

92
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Senior Eunuch, tell them to perform the Cleansing Ritual as soon as dawn breaks.

93
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,450
Are you not the attendant who works for Supervisor Ha?

95
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,700
What are you doing here like that?

96
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,500
 (Man Su: page belonging to Ha Ram's household) 

97
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,920
Supervisor Jang, please find Supervisor Ha!

98
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,610
There has been a disaster in Inwang Mountain.

99
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,900
What...

100
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,340
What disaster? Tell me more.
 (Jang Wuk Jin: supervisor of the geography division at the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau) 

101
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,740
We were passing the upper mountains

102
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,120
when we heard the sky rip open

103
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,830
and the palanquin broke

104
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,120
and something like a monster appeared in the sky.

105
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,480
And Supervisor Ha...

106
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,940
Child, where are you going in such haste?

107
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,280
Grandma, what are you doing here?

108
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,390
Come here and get warm.

109
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,870
Oh, the fire.

110
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,200
Thank you for the offer, but I must be going.

111
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,230
It's cold.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,580
You will be very cold.

113
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, my...

114
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,940
Why is it suddenly so cold?

115
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,220
I will stay for only a little while.

116
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,630
This is the payment for your father's painting.

117
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,580
Father's painting...

118
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,020
You should pay me separately for that, Grandma.

119
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,800
This is plenty. Don't speak nonsense.

120
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Nothing is free in this world.

121
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,360
My goodness, you young thing. So stubborn.

122
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,300
Grandma, you shouldn't be in a place like this on the winter solstice.

123
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,780
You should go down with me later...

124
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,550
I smell it for certain.

125
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,870
Is it there?

126
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,820
Please hurry.

127
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,040
W-w-what is that?

128
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,800
- What is that?
- A monster!

129
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,530
A monster!

130
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,650
What?

131
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,830
How long was I here?

132
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,990
Oh, no. I'll get a lecture from Gyeonju Daek again.

133
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,140
I should be going, Grandma.

134
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,880
Wait, it is not time yet.

135
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,520
I have a long way to go.

136
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,670
You should come down soon, Grandma.

137
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,630
- W-wait, hold...
- Come down soon!

138
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,250
Wait, no, no, no, no!

139
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,400
Is it there?

140
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,270
Blast it.

141
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,490
She is making it difficult.

142
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,950
I cannot let her meet Ho Ryeong.

143
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,310
Ho Ryeong?

144
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,510
I am Ho Ryeong, guardian spirit of Inwang Mountain.

145
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,660
This is the land I rule.

146
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,700
Be gone from this mountain!

147
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,910
Foolish divine beast.
   

148
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,510
Long time no see, Ho Ryeong.

149
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,690
Long time no see, grandmother Sam Shin.

150
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,260
Wait.

151
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,340
It is not time yet.

152
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,300
Are you asking me to let Ma Wang go?

153
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,960
Ma Wang doesn't die.

154
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,210
He is only trapped in that body.

155
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,880
Once that man dies, Ma Wang will be released and free.

156
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,530
Sam Shin...

157
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,170
We must expel Ma Wang from that man's body

158
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,730
and seal him in an eternal vessel.

159
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,680
An eternal vessel?

160
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,530
That child will make it.

161
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you truly believe that a defenseless girl can make the vessel that will seal Ma Wang?

162
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,830
When the time comes, she will make it.

163
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,310
She is the child of destiny.

164
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,800
We must protect those two until then.

165
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,420
However, my powers only extend to this mountain and the king's palace.

166
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,480
I cannot guarantee that I will be able to do it.

167
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,100
To protect the humans is to protect the mountain.

168
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,770
When Ma Wang awakens,

169
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,400
blood will be shed again.

170
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:29,510
Om ahum sabaha.

171
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,210
Om ahum sabaha.

172
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
I was walking just now.

173
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,510
Where am I?

174
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,470
Why am I here?

175
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,210
Ow... my head.

176
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,830
Help me!

177
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,320
Hey, get off...

178
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,190
What?

179
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,740
Hello?

180
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,630
S-Scholar sir?

181
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,920
Sir!

182
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,270
Sir!

183
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,430
Wait, where did those palanquin bearers go?

184
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,130
Sir! Sir!

185
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,850
Sir! Open your eyes, Sir!

186
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,390
Sir, get up!

187
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,630
I have never in my life been so benevolent.

188
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,260
I cannot do this for nothing in return.

189
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,940
Hello?

190
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,820
Madam Seosan Daek?

191
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,800
Help me!

192
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,590
Have they all gone to find firewood for the winter?

193
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,310
This is where they make paint...

194
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,810
It may smell quite pungent,

195
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,960
but it cannot be helped.

196
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,690
Hold on.

197
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,870
The room is too cold.

198
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,380
Wait right here, Scholar Sir.

199
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,060
I've got it!

200
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,490
♫  My feelings for you?  ♫

201
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,860
♫  I hold onto you like destiny and can't leave you  ♫

202
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:09,970
♫  I was you and you were me  ♫

203
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:16,010
♫  I love you, I love you, only you  ♫

204
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,440
What should I do?

205
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,810
♫  So we don't pass each other  ♫

206
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,330
If I don't finish the painting by tonight, the headmaster will have a fit.

207
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,720
♫  I will be here  ♫

208
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,500
Whatever. Let me save him first.

209
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,580
No fever.

210
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,140
Breathing well.

211
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,700
Scholar Sir?

212
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
Scholar Sir! Wake up!

213
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,750
- Stop it!
 - Ha Ram! 

214
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,380
 I can't see! 

215
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,760
No!

216
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,180
What on earth has happened to him?

217
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,690
Help me!

218
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,560
Help me!

219
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,470
Help me! You have to help me.

220
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,710
What is it?

221
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,630
They are dead.

222
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,310
They are all dead.

223
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,520
What do you mean all the royal guards died last night?

224
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,410
Are you saying Supervisor Ha also died?

225
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,250
- What of Supervisor Ha? 
 - Supervisor Ha is nowhere to be found.

226
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,200
We have selected nimble guards to search every corner of Inwang Mountain, Your Majesty.

227
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Senior Eunuch, send a eunuch to Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

228
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,090
He is close to Supervisor Ha, so he will know where he could be.

229
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,490
Your Majesty, forgive me,

231
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,740
but you cannot send His Highness to find a mere supervisor.

232
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,520
Enough!

233
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,360
That is enough.

234
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,440
 (Mu Yeong: Il Wol Seong's bodyguard) 

235
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,350
 Simcheonggak 
 (Name of the gisaeng house) 

236
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,660
 Urgent Report: Il Wol Seong disappeared near Imwang Mountain. 

237
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,040
Boss, Boss, Boss!

238
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,530
Boss, something's happened! Something big!

239
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,970
- Something big has happened. Elder Il Wol Seong has disappeared. 
 - Is that true?

240
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,890
What? Sir Il Wol Seong has disappeared?

241
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,810
What? Il Wol Seong has disappeared?

242
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,510
Move!

243
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,590
How does that even make sense?

244
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,630
I told you to catch Hong Cheon Gi and you give me this unbelievable excuse?

245
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,380
It's true...

246
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,480
Did she disappear in the sky or into the ground?

247
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,420
What is taking you so long to catch Baegyu Painting Institute's Hong Cheon Gi just within the marketplace?

248
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,400
I was dragged to the Police Bureau and closed down Wolseongdang because of her.

249
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,060
Get out and bring her here!

250
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,840
Yes, Hyeong-nim!

251
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,250
I hear her mad father is always on the market streets.

252
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,810
Should I bring him instead?

253
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,970
Hey, you should break that wench's hand.

254
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,430
What are we going to do with that crazy man?

255
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,130
What did I tell you when you first came here?

256
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,150
I told you to keep your boundaries even as a thug, no?

257
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,170
Listen carefully!

258
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:41,330
We... don't mess with the elderly and children.

259
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,840
Got it?

260
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,250
Yes, sir.

261
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,950
Wise words.

262
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,820
Boundaries are meant to be kept, not to be crossed.

263
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,790
- I hear there was an unseemly incident. 
 - Yes, sir.

264
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,000
There was a minor misunderstanding that we had sold fake paintings.

265
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,300
A minor misunderstanding made you go to jail?

266
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,680
No, not the jail. I was only questioned briefly at the bureau.

267
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,300
- I was released without charges.
 - Was it really a misunderstanding?

268
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,230
That you pocketed the money for fake paintings?

269
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,970
That is absolutely untrue! I would never!

270
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,430
This painting must be real.

271
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,910
Your face is pale.

272
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,660
I will deal with you when I get back.

273
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,780
When the master returns, he will make an appropriate judgement.

274
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,870
When he comes back?

275
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,720
Il Wol Seong is really missing?

276
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,840
Master has disappeared.

277
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,050
Soma... let's go.

278
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,500
 (Yi Yul, Grand Prince Yangmyeong, third son of Seongjo)
(Han Geon: Master Painter of the Painting Bureau) 

279
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,930
As expected, the master of Sansuhwa*,
 (landscape painting) 

280
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,530
Park Yi deserves his fame.

281
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,390
Observe this mountain drawn like the head of the cloud, and like furled mist.

282
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,740
The clean ink use gives off the effect of dreamy clouds.

283
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,350
The boulders look like moving clouds.

284
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,830
Looking at the mountain, the trees, and the boulders,

285
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,660
I'm in complete awe at the exquisite brush strokes.

286
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,910
It is a true masterpiece with the spirit of nature filling the empty spaces.

287
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,740
You know what you are talking about.

288
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,890
This Sochundo* truly is a divine realm 
 (small spring scape) 

289
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,690
eagerly to be looked upon, visited, and roamed in.

290
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,520
But...

291
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,280
what is this?

292
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,890
Is this not a butterfly?

293
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,450
That is impossible.

294
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,850
Could this be...

295
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,250
It seems to be a counterfeit!

296
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,850
Counterfeit?

297
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,830
Yes.

298
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,710
I hear imitation artists leave secret signatures on their works.

299
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,550
Who would dare make a copy of Park Yi's work?

300
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,810
Is it even possible to copy the aura as well?

301
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,810
Is this truly counterfeit?

302
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,350
I bought this from Wolseongdang.

303
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,650
Jeong Soen Nae.

304
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,340
It must be true that the merchant was taken to the Police Bureau for selling fake paintings.

305
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,250
What a ridiculous new-born puppy!

306
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,700
Your Highness, someone is here from the palace.

307
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,750
Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau disappeared last night during field work.

308
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,940
What?

309
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,100
That gentle soul, Supervisor Ha has disappeared?

310
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,060
You mean he is missing?

311
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,300
Yes, Your Highness.

312
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,900
All the guards who left to search for him returned as corpses.

313
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,500
Corpses?

314
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,680
What is the meaning of this?

315
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,800
As of now, no one knows what has happened.

316
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,600
The Royal Investigation Bureau has started investigating, so there will be news soon.

317
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,170
But His Majesty asks Your Highness to search for Supervisor Ha personally,

318
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,230
as time is of the utmost importance.

319
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,930
I understand. You may go now.

320
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,350
I shall go at this moment.

321
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,920
This way.

322
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,930
Goodness.

323
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,880
Look, Master Painter Han.

324
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,730
While I look for Supervisor Ha,

325
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,740
find me that cheeky imitation painter.

326
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,750
Yes, Your Highness.

327
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,600
Is it true that Supervisor Ha disappeared and the royal guards died?

328
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,410
Yes, Your Highness.

329
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,730
- And the culprit?
 - They have not caught him yet.

330
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,650
This incident is particularly mysterious.

331
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,100
Mysterious?

332
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,660
Your Highness, it is I, Mi Su.

333
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,470
 (Yi Hu, Grand Prince Juhyang, second son of Seongjo) 

334
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,530
Have you heard about the tragic ends of the guards?

335
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,500
Yes.

336
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,120
In addition, a parliament of owls cried at the palace last night.
 (Mi Su: 4th Head Shaman of Seongjucheong, the Royal Shamanist Bureau) 

337
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,010
A parliament of owls?

338
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,690
They say if a parliament of owls cry on the ridge of the palace roof,

339
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,010
calamities occur. Thus we perform the Cleansing Ritual.

340
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,650
On the night of the winter solstice, when the energy of yin is the strongest,

341
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,170
owls cried, and the guards met horrific deaths.

342
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,520
It cannot be a coincidence.

343
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,340
Then...

344
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,420
I must check the corpses of the dead guards.

345
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,020
Goodness, Father!

346
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,550
Goodness!

347
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,600
Aigoo!

348
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,630
The night was cold, and the room was small, so I...

349
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,660
I've shamelessly disrespected you.

350
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,000
Forgive me.

351
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Forgive me, Scholar Sir. Forgive me.

352
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,940
Judging by his clothes,

353
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,180
he seems to be a high-ranking noble.

354
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,560
You are so gorgeous.

355
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:55,510
After leaving me in such a hurry, you should have arrived at your destination safely.

356
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,960
If I had known that this would happen,

357
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,670
I would have thrown a fit until you told me your name.

358
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,520
Scholar Sir? Are you awake now?

359
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,930
Wait one moment.

360
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,660
Scholar Sir, do you hear me?

361
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,260
Open your eyes.

362
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,540
Scholar Sir!

363
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,310
Scholar Sir!

364
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,650
Who are you?

365
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,380
Speak! Where am I?

366
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,750
This is a pigment studio in Inwang Mountain.

367
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,360
I saw you unconscious

368
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,970
-  Her voice is familiar. 
- and it didn't feel right to leave you there.

369
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,640
So I brought you to a place I knew nearby.

370
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,270
 It's that woman from yesterday. 

371
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm the painter that you saved inside the palanquin yesterday.

372
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,400
Are you all right now?

373
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,030
I apologize.

374
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,860
What has happened to me?

375
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,790
That is what I would like to ask you, Sir.

376
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,840
You were lying unconscious by the roadside.

377
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,390
There was no one around?

378
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,310
No. The palanquin bearers were gone

379
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,510
and your clothes were tattered.

380
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,200
Do you not remember anything?

381
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,720
My head feels as if it's splitting open.

382
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,350
I do not remember anything.

383
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,140
You can take your time remembering then.

384
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,120
For now, you must take care of yourself...

385
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,910
Sir?

386
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,810
Sir!

387
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,010
Oh, no...

388
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,520
This won't do. I'll call a trustworthy physician.

389
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,800
So... Man Su, is it?

390
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,460
Yes, Your Highness.

391
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,030
You do not know precisely when Supervisor Ha disappeared?

392
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,480
Would you believe that yourself?

393
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,780
Why did you leave Supervisor Ha by himself to disappear?

394
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,200
Could it be that you did it intentionally?

395
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,030
I would never!

396
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,370
That is absolutely untrue.

397
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,020
The mountain path was dark

398
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,500
and the palanquin exploded suddenly

399
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,410
so I could not take care of the supervisor properly.

400
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,050
This is all my fault, Your Highness.

401
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:51,010
Who keeps the ledger of the property records of Supervisor Ha, the richest man in Gwanyang?

402
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,280
I... I would not know about that...

403
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,690
I see.

404
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,350
Could it be that you conspired in Supervisor Ha's kidnapping to find that out?

405
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,010
No, Your Highness!

406
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,120
I sensed the presence of a monster.

407
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,540
It could have been a tiger.

408
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,840
Did you have a dream?

409
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,230
A monster in our bright and luminous world? Does that even make sense?

410
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,000
Think about it.

411
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,700
Except for Supervisor Ha, the palanquin carriers and you, all survived.

412
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,180
What could be the reason for that?

413
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,240
Man Su.

414
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
It is not difficult.

415
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,260
Only speak of what you know.

416
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,480
Spill the beans while I am telling you nicely.

417
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,600
Before I bring out a cudgel to have you beaten up

418
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,910
This is not fair, Your Highness...

419
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,800
I may only be a palace page,

420
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,260
but I swear to the heavens I have never been disloyal to the supervisor.

421
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,670
How could I...

422
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,570
How could I do that to Supervisor Ha...

423
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,330
I'm desperate to find him.

424
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,030
Enough. Enough.

425
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,040
You are still a child.

426
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,520
Come on. Mum.

427
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,200
Stop crying.

428
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,040
I see you are not lying.

429
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,470
Well, how... How could you even suggest—

430
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,650
Well then. Let's go.

431
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,390
Where to, Your Highness?

432
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,530
The place where Supervisor Ha disappeared.

433
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,370
Gyeonju Daek! Gyeonju Daek!

434
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,900
 (Gyeonju Daek: Housekeeper at Baegyu Painting Institute) 

435
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,140
Gyeonju Daek is busy.

436
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,580
Come now, Gyeonju Daek.

437
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,050
It is urgent.

438
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,760
Where did a full-grown woman stay out all night?

439
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,500
Can't you even tell me where you're going?

440
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,360
The headmaster didn't sleep a wink, worried sick.

441
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,190
Do you not think of those waiting for you?

442
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,180
Gosh, he blamed me so much, saying it was all my fault.

443
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,250
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

444
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,330
But something truly urgent has happened.

445
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,980
Just listen to me this once!

446
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,720
Did you stuff my instructions into the gutter?

447
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,700
Headmaster.

448
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,730
I seem to have let you be too relaxed these days.

449
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,450
What were you thinking-

450
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,130
Did I not tell you that the right hand is a painter's dear life?

451
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,720
Why did you hurt yourself again?

452
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,980
I'm sorry.

453
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,710
Please do not be so angry, headmaster.

454
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,380
There is a scholar who had an accident.

455
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,440
Please help him, headmaster.

456
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,450
A scholar?

457
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,940
I see that you're not remorseful.

458
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,480
Must I punish you to make you come to your senses?

459
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,500
That's not it! He is the man who saved my life.

460
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,860
He is unconscious now, so I have not heard his story,

461
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,600
but he surely had an accident.

462
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,210
Please just help him first and then I'll accept any punishment.

463
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,350
Please, headmaster!

464
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,960
This won't do. Lock her in the shed immediately!

465
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,200
- Yes, Sir! 
- No!

466
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,480
Headmaster, you can't!

467
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,500
Please help me, just once!

468
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,750
Headmaster!

469
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,810
Gyeonju Daek!

470
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,930
Gyeonju Daek! Uncle Chun Bok!

471
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,840
Headmaster!

472
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,170
Aigoo. A man is all she could think of.

473
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,640
She failed to think on her feet.

474
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,650
All right, sit.

475
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,760
Your paw.

476
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,060
- Are you sure it doesn't bite?
 - No.

477
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,230
- Go Pil.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,910
Aigoo...

479
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,470
I have prepared as you asked,

480
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,100
but among all this chaos, must we bring along search dogs?

481
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,510
Go Pil! This is a matter of great urgency.

482
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,860
Do you think Supervisor Ha went sightseeing or something?

483
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,840
Aigoo. Of course not, Your Highness.

484
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,730
Good. As long as you know.

485
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,880
Man Su.

486
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,790
- You take the lead.
 - Yes.

487
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,890
Pardon?

488
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,400
 What are you doing? 

489
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,870
 I shall draw with you. 

490
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,600
 FInish that sehwa before sundown! 

491
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,300
Ah!

492
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,740
 I'm coming in. 

493
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,600
Aigoo.

494
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,110
Gyeonju Daek, you have to help me.

495
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,570
Gyeonju Daek can't hear you.

496
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,280
I met a handsome man as fair as a fairy in the mountain.

497
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,510
Seriously, I've heard that countless times.

498
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,190
I meant to ask this earlier.

499
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,790
Did you have a dream or something?

500
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,620
If you don't believe me, come with me then.

501
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,300
This isn't the first time I've been tricked by your foolery.

502
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,390
Don't you have any conscience?

503
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,570
Eat up.

504
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,960
How can I eat right now?

505
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,200
I say someone is dying! Isn't everyone being too indifferent?

506
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,720
I'm not eating!

507
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,360
My gosh...

508
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,090
And?

509
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,120
That man dropped straight from the sky and just fainted.

510
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,170
Maiden!

511
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,380
Where are you?

512
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,750
 I don't know which family he is from, 

513
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,930
but he seems to be highly educated.

514
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,200
He is dressed like a noble scholar.

515
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,860
The man can't even see...

516
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,940
and he fainted again right after he woke.

517
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,040
I couldn't tell where he was injured.

518
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,120
Could it be...

519
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,810
he is being chased because he is part of a group who plotted treason?

520
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,890
Nonsense, my goodness.

521
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,500
In any case, if that is true,

522
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,860
how unfortunate is that...

523
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,240
What should we do?

524
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,260
Maybe we have to call a Chim Ui*?
   

525
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,390
Yes! That's it!

526
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,510
I came down here to call a physician.

527
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,010
There is no time to waste like this.

528
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,470
We must hurry to the pigment studio in Inwang Mountain.

529
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,480
You like that scholar that much?

530
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,410
What are you talking about?

531
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,470
I owe him my life.

532
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,330
I see.

533
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,650
All right.

534
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,570
Then I must help you.

535
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,400
You mean it? You'll help me?

536
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,500
Yes, I will.

537
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,580
But are you sure he is not married?

538
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,460
Gosh. What in the world are you talking about?

539
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,290
 I don't remember anything. 

540
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,000
 This is the first time after Father passed away. 

541
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,240
 Last night in the palanquin, I encountered a woman exuding a strong scent of ink. 

542
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,830
 I thought she headed to town after getting off the palanquin, 

543
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,170
 but she nursed me... 

544
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,870
 while I was unconscious. 

545
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,750
 Could this be a mere coincidence? 

546
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,950
 My missing memories... 

547
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,340
 and meeting of a maiden who resembles her... 

548
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:06,350
 What on earth... could this all mean? 

549
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,840
 Take your time. 

550
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,310
 Careful, careful. 

551
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,310
 Pull gently. Right. 

552
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,190
There is no trace of life left...

553
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,440
It must be the doing of Ma Wang.

554
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,110
As expected.

555
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,980
Is it related to Supervisor Ha's disappearance?

556
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,520
Darn it.

557
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,800
I do not know who you are, but you can't be here.

558
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,520
Leave.

559
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,720
How Insolent!

560
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,180
He is the Grand Prince Juhyang.

561
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,390
Goodness!

562
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,060
We did not recognize you, Your Highness!

563
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,790
He is following his majesty's secret order and covertly searching for the truth behind this case.

564
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:14,500
You must not speak of the fact that his highness came here.

565
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,280
You must watch your mouth!

566
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,810
Yes, madam.

567
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,760
Secure the corpses of the guards

568
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,680
and be careful of what you say.

569
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,250
 I'm sure Mu Yeong must be looking for me. 

570
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,210
 Seeing as Soma can't get here right away, 

571
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,530
 I must be deep in the mountains. 

572
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,000
 Where did that woman go? 

573
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,290
 Why? 

574
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,850
 The memories... 

575
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,910
 of the peach tree field girl ... 

576
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,070
 keep overlapping with that woman. 

577
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,890
My goodness!

578
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,600
Is this the spot?

579
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,850
The site of the guards' murder.

580
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,450
- I do not know who you are, but you can't-
 - Insolence!

581
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,740
This is Grand Prince Yangmyeong!

582
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,900
My goodness!

583
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,950
Aigoo!

584
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,980
We did not recognize you, Your Highness.

585
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,490
- Why does this keep happening today?
 - I don't know.

586
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:46,400
There is no quality of living beings in these bodies.

587
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,990
It is truly bizarre.

588
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,520
So, what seems to be the cause of their death?

589
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,360
It is truly mysterious.

590
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,470
They are not normal cut wounds caused by swords and spears,

591
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,850
but strange tears and partial burns on the skin.

592
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:05,050
Judging by the external appearance, it does not seem to be done by a human being.

593
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,630
Not done by a human being?

594
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,420
This leaf here...

595
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,040
 I sensed the presence of a monster. 

596
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,200
 It could have been a tiger. 

597
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,560
Are there any survivors?

598
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,700
Supervisor Jang Wuk Jin of the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau was the sole survivor.

599
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,340
Is that so?

600
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,020
Listen up. We must find Supervisor Ha before sundown.

601
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,120
- Do you understand?
  - Yes, sir! 

602
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,790
Chase them.

603
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,500
Gyeonju Daek! I didn't realize you are so fast, like a flying squirrel.

604
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,000
You say he is a nobleman.

605
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,720
I'm dying here.

606
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,560
Slimming down while working.

607
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,120
We're killing two birds with one stone! Exert yourself a bit more!

608
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,420
Cheon Gi!

609
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,210
What?

610
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,010
Oh, no. Scholar Sir!

611
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,640
Sir!

612
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:39,710
- Darn it.
 - Your Highness!

613
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,690
My goodness! Are you all right?

614
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,660
Dear me!

615
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,590
This is expensive.

616
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,910
Over here! Come help me!

617
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,220
Yes, sir.

618
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,310
Aigoo. Here.

619
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,540
You must be cold.

620
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,940
Agh, Go Pil!

621
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,760
This smell is too...

622
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,160
This is all because I work hard for you.

623
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,280
The dogs seem to have caught a scent.

624
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,600
- Go follow them.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

625
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,150
Follow the dogs!

626
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,590
Follow the dogs! Let's go.

627
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,410
Soma, you're here.

628
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,600
- I've looked everywhere for you. 
 - You're here.

629
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,860
What has happened?

630
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,760
I don't remember at all.

631
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,330
- How did you find me here? 
 - I followed Soma.

632
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,800
Grand Prince Yangmyeong is looking for you himself.

633
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,280
Why did even the grand prince get involved?

634
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,250
I hear misfortune has befallen the royal guards who were sent to look for you in Inwang Mountain.

635
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,000
I also saw Grand Prince Yangmyeong's group on my way here.

636
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,990
They had search dogs with them, so it is a matter of time before they get here.

637
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,620
Then I must wait here.

638
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,040
Yes, sir.

639
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,540
Someone is coming.

640
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,350
Scholar Sir! You are awake.

641
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,430
I was worried sick about you.

642
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,240
Are you feeling better?

643
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,860
- It is you. 
 - Yes, it's me.

644
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:41,140
Did someone come by already?

645
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,850
No.

646
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,710
Where have you been?

647
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:52,680
I thought you were in urgent need of care so I left to bring a physician.

648
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,460
You're not well.

649
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,530
Please go inside. The wind is cold.

650
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,780
I feel better now.

651
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,030
Well... If it's not discourteous,

652
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,510
I would like to know your name.

653
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,480
My name?

654
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:21,120


655
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,290
Hong...

656
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,440
Hong...

657
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,550
- Hong...
- Hong Hong Hong?

658
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,620
Is your name truly Hong Hong Hong?

659
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,850
I mean... No, that's not it.

660
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,390
It's Hong Cheon Gi.

661
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,510
 Hong Cheon Gi? 

662
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:59,130
 The peach tree field... from 19 years ago. 

663
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,810
 She has the same name as that girl. 

664
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:09,900
♫  Whichever way the wind blows  ♫

665
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:17,350
♫  Wherever my feet lead me  ♫

666
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:24,770
♫  I can walk without a moment's rest  ♫

667
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:32,140
♫  Wherever you are, I ask you to stay  ♫

668
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:39,170
♫  Even on sunny days filled with the most radiant sunshine  ♫

669
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:45,860
♫  Only you could blind me  ♫

670
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:53,030
♫  I don't think I can live without you  ♫

671
00:58:53,030 --> 00:59:00,430
♫  I miss you no matter what I do  ♫

672
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:08,020
♫  Is it me who lives in your heart?  ♫

673
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,060
♫  The one you miss endlessly?  ♫

674
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:23,000
♫  I may not be, you may hate me  ♫

675
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:30,940
♫  I'll stay by your side like destiny.  ♫

 Preview 

677
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,910
 You and I are acquaintances now. 

678
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,870
 - Is anyone here?
- Who are you? 

679
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,090
 Insolence! Do you know who I am? 

680
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,220
 Do people like us... not have the right to protect our homes if Your Highness comes in? 

681
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,640
 Maejukheon Painting Contest. 

682
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,690
 If you get first place, His Highness will grant whatever you wish. 

683
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,350
 Must you do it at Maejukheon? 

684
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,910
 This is the beginning. 

685
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,290
 Do you truly not intend to send me to the painting contest? 

686
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,010
 Never. 

687
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,200
 Because you think I'll go mad like Father while painting? 

688
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,970
 I'm from the Baegyu Painting Institute. 

689
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,570
 That woman... 

690
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,920
 Her voice is familiar. Could she be ...? 

691
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,850
♫  Is it me who lives in your heart?  ♫

692
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,400
♫  The one you miss endlessly?  ♫

693
