1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:08,750


2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,830
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,320
 Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob 

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,100
 Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang 

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,700
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,300
 The characters and settings of this drama are fiction and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,180
In Supervisor Ha's body ...

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,860
Ma Wang lies dormant.

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,970
What do you mean by that?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,590
We shall discuss this in detail during our next game.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,900
It will be a very long talk.

12
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,290
Yes, Your Highness.

13
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,710
Now, you are the only one who can restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

14
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,490
That means...

15
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,700
the King Yeongjong's royal portrait that I am to restore is...

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,650
Yes.

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,430
Father.

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,900
The royal portrait is to seal Ma Wang.

19
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,900
Ma Wang is near us.

20
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,530
 Supervisor Ha. 

21
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,250
 You do not have the physiognomy of one person. 

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,000
 Divine and evil aura coexist within you. 

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
 Evil aura? 

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,300
 Two auras within me? 

25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,350
 You were lying unconscious by the roadside. 

26
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,850
 Your clothes were tattered. 

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,760
 You lost your memories when you had that incident on Inwang Mountain? 

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,660
 Did you walk all the way here all night? 

29
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,750
 Can it be inside me? 

30
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,780
 Is that what's making me lose my memory? 

31
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,340
 The memories right after the rain ritual 19 years ago have yet to come back to me. 

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,160
 The memories become fragmented. 

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
 I do not remember well. 

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,730
 I do not remember anything. 

35
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,810
 Ma Wang dwells inside Supervisor Ha. 

36
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,970
 It is impossible. 

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I cannot believe it. 

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,050
 How can something exist within me without my knowledge? 

39
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,370
Is there any more information about Ma Wang?

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,470
No.

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,060
- I am searching everywhere, but— 
 - Investigate...

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,400
King Yeonjong's royal portrait that was used at the sealing ritual.

43
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,330
Investigate in detail what happened to all the painters

44
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,940
after finishing the royal portrait.

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,480
Therefore the divine painter must restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait as soon as possible.

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,730
I shall do my best to fulfill your order.

48
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,920
Good.

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,500
Please accomplish it.

50
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,240
 Episode 10: The Royal Portrait Painter 

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,490
Your Highness.

52
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,300
I have something to ask you.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,710
Go ahead.

54
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,780
King Yeongjong's royal portrait is not an ordinary portrait.

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,720
And?

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,570
Could I also go mad like my father while painting the royal portrait?

57
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,950
I am not certain,

58
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,340
but I cannot guarantee that nothing will happen.

59
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,800
But I shall cherish and protect you as my own life.

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,590
But if something does go wrong with me, my father—

61
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,830
I promise I shall protect both you and your father.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,470
Why are you saying such a thing?

63
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,550
Are you worried I cannot?

64
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,280
That is not it.

65
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,950
Why would Your Highness take responsibility for us?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Because I deeply cherish you.

67
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,900
Your joke went too far.

68
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,110
Yes, I did go too far with my joke this time.

69
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,630
Yes.

70
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
We are here. I shall go now.

71
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,190
I shall see you tomorrow.

72
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,630
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,180
Do not have feelings for her any longer.

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,580
Your Highness and that girl are not meant to be.

75
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,730
Who are you? Reveal yourself.

76
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,520
I am Wol Seon, the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau.

77
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,910
 It is not easy to change the fate assigned to you. 

78
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,720
Fate...

79
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,460
The stars are especially bright tonight.

80
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,280
 Your eyes were not red like now, 

81
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,880
 but they were reddish-black. 

82
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,700
 Do my eyes turn reddish-black every time I lose consciousness? 

83
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,340
 Do you not remember anything? 

84
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,130
 Do you not remember anything? 

85
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,580
 Could my losing consciousness at Inwang Mountain... 

86
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,490
Man Su.

87
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,430
Yes, Supervisor Sir.

88
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,730
Do you remember when the palanquin exploded at Inwang Mountain?

89
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,760
How could I forget that incident?

90
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,590
 First, there was something like a thunder sound. 

91
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,770
 When I turned around, the palanquin's roof flew off into the sky. 

92
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,750
It was a chaos.

93
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,630
 When I opened the palanquin in the midst of the chaos, 

94
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,800
 somehow you had disappeared. 

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,860
Even now I still see it in my dreams sometimes.

96
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,780
That monster.

97
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,370
- A monster? 
 - Yes.

98
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,180
That monster in black clothes who burst out of the palanquin.

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,620
 Is that... 

100
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,040
 the Ma Wang inside me? 

101
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Ma Wang...

102
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,870
Goodness.

103
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,160
What is happening?

104
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,820
What am I to do?

105
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,300
Should I ask the scholar?

106
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,520
That's absolutely crazy.

107
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,470
He will think I am crazy if I go at this hour.

108
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh, well.

109
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,190
All right.

110
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,630
I thought I heard Cheon Gi.

111
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,110
Did I hear wrong?

112
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,040
I guess you did.

113
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,930
I am here to buy a painting.

114
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,480
I said I am here to buy a painting.

115
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,310
What painting in the middle of the night?

116
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,440
He is here again.

117
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,870
He is the customer who only asks for Cheon Gi.

118
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,660
I need Painter Hong's painting.

119
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,310
I shall tell Cheon Gi to paint something—

120
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,680
I shall not go back empty-handed tonight.

121
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,400
Let me meet the painter.

122
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Gan...

123
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,800
Gan Yun Guk?

124
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,810
You've lost your mind again.

125
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,780
Why are you suddenly bringing up Gan Yun Guk?

126
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,280
Ga—

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,410
Gan Yun Guk?

128
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,510
 Sir, what is wrong? 

129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,900
Aigoo, Master Gan.

130
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,060
You were alive.

131
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,890
This man is not Gan Yun Guk.

132
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,770
What do you mean?

133
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,940
Hwa-Hwacha. It is Hwacha.

134
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,100
The p-painting-crazed goblin?

135
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
When we were painting King Yeongjong's royal portrait,

136
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,340
Hwacha possessed Gan Yun Guk.

137
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,900
Gan Yun Guk. It is Gan Yun Guk.

138
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,260
Gan Yun Guk!

139
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,170
Where is my painter right now?

140
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,400
Should I go in? No.

141
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,010
- Who are you?
 - Pardon?

142
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,290
Painter Hong, are you all right?

143
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,970
Yes...

144
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,980
 Why is Cheon Gi here? 

145
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,630
What brings you here at this hour?

146
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,190
I suppose I must look for her myself.

147
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,850
If that is the painting goblin, wouldn't he harm our Cheon Gi?

148
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,390
Now, tell me.

149
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,890
Well...

150
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,780
I had something to ask you...

151
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,820
and I also wanted to see you.

152
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,620
Is it not all right for me to just come when I miss you?

153
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,410
No.

154
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,600
I suppose you did not miss me.

155
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,550
That is not true.

156
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,230
I did miss you.

157
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,930
How much?

158
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,310
In the sky...

159
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,080
In the sky?

160
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,180
What about the sky?

161
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,890
As much as the stars in the sky.

162
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,620
Truly?

163
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,830
Yes.

164
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,080
So, is something the matter?

165
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Actually... I heard a scary story

166
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,400
that the royal portrait I am painting is very dangerous.

167
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,990
I am not certain,

168
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,820
but painting the royal portrait was the reason why my father became mad.

169
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,220
So, I became fearful and...

170
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,600
hesitant to paint the royal portrait.

171
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,000
What do you mean he became mad while painting the royal portrait?

172
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Have you perhaps heard of Ma Wang?

173
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,260
- Pardon?
- They tell me the royal portrait...

174
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,890
that I am working on is to seal Ma Wang, a very very evil god.

175
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,360
I do not think...

176
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,040
painting well alone will take care of this.

177
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,900
But who said such a thing?

178
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,680
His Majesty did.

179
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,630
Did you meet His Majesty?

180
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,180
Yes.

181
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,100
 Even the King knew of Ma Wang. 

182
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,150
Come to think of it, that evil aura must have caused the fire at Gyeongwonjeon

183
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,400
and burned the royal portrait.

184
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,890
I wonder if the remaining evil aura made you act strange

185
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,800
when we went to Gyeongwonjeon.

186
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,120
It is already late.

187
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,470
I understand.

188
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,720
I shall think over your concern as though it were my own.

189
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,200
The night is late. You should go home now.

190
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,210
 I don't want to just go like this, 

191
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,940
 but it is too late to say I want to stay. 

192
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,970
Yes, I will.

193
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,240
Are you all right from hurting yourself earlier?

194
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,120
Oh, I am all right.

195
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,240
It is only a tiny bit troublesome to walk.

196
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,340
You should have told me.

197
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,790
I did not know and had you standing out here.

198
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,700
I shall lend you my palanquin. Ride it home.

199
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,840
Oh no. No.  I actually get sick on palanquins.

200
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,080
When I rode on it last time, I felt nauseous and dizzy.

201
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,890
And if I take it home, my folks at Baegyu Painting Institute will get suspicious...

202
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,490
Then, would you like to stay here tonight?

203
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,360
But how could I.

204
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,570
There are plenty of rooms. You can stay comfortably.

205
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,950
Then, perhaps not the whole night.

206
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,130
I shall rest only for a while.

207
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,930
Follow me.

208
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,320
That painting...

209
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,310
It is your Hodo that you left last time.

210
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,180
Finally it has found its owner again.

211
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,730
They say each painting has its own will.

212
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,740
I think that is true.

213
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,040
What kind of will do you mean?

214
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,990
A will to find its way to its owner.

215
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,150
It is an honor.

216
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,840
It is a painting of Painter Hong, the first place winner.

217
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,310
Please, eat.

218
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,710
Thank you for the food.

219
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,710
Do you play the geomungo?

220
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,860
I occasionally play it to pass my time.

221
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,040
What refined taste you have.

222
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,570
Could you please play something now?

223
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,350
Nineteen years ago, at the Seokcheok rain ritual,

224
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,680
Ma Wang was released from confinement

225
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,590
when King Yeongjong's royal portrait burned.

226
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,420
That day, the fate of this country's royal family changed.

227
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,710
What does that mean?

228
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,450
The fate of the two grand princes

229
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,150
who were at Gyeongwonjeon on the day of the ritual.

230
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,570
And the child's fate began while the child who should have died

231
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,920
as the rain ritual sacrifice came back to life.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,100
Do you mean Supervisor Ha and King Yeongjong's portrait at Gyeongwonjeon have some kind of connection?

233
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,300
You saw his powers at Gyeongwonjeon.

234
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,200
That is not the power of the living.

235
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,470
Then, do you mean Ma Wang went in Supervisor Ha's body on the day of the rain ritual?

236
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,010
That is my assumption.

237
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,400
But what do you mean when you tell me not to have feelings for Painter Hong any longer?

238
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,320
The divine painter has a predestined match.

239
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,340
Could that predestined match be Supervisor Ha?

240
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,960
What is it?

241
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,180
Forgive me.

242
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,550
You were crying.

243
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,990
I am all right.

244
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,990
All right.

245
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,300
I must have played too intensely.

246
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,670
I shall play you something softer next time.

247
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,270
That painter has the aura to harm Your Highness.

248
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,380
You will certainly be harmed if you involve yourself with her further.

249
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,340
How dare you...

250
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,020
say such things?

251
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,910
You must escape while you can.

252
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,980
Your Highness has a sacred destiny to lead this country.

253
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,200
This is the heaven's will bestowed upon Your Highness.

254
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,080
I shall not avoid it.

255
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,580
I shall not avoid whatever hardship comes my way.

256
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,740
A fate is destined, you say?

257
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,770
I shall overcome it.

258
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,410
I shall protect it myself.

259
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,540
Both Painter Hong and this country.

260
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,340
Is it true there are signs of manifestation?

261
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,520
Yes, Your Highness.

262
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,810
There was a sacred revelation.

263
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,480
A sudden manifestation?

264
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,030
What is happening now?

265
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,980
The will of the divine cannot be foretold.

266
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,670
But tonight is a full moon with an intense yin energy.

267
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,800
What happens after manifestation?

268
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,720
I shall make an attempt to communicate with Ma Wang.

269
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,260
If Your Highness would like to join,

270
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,680
you must think of the revelation 19 years ago at Gyeongwonjeon.

271
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Now then, we shall begin.

272
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,130
Sa basa sa da hae...

273
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,720
Sa basa sa da hae...

274
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,180
Sa basa sa da hae...

275
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,730
Sa basa jin sa da hae...

276
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,070
 In death, the floating clouds extinguish. In life, the floating clouds drift.  

277
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,490
My eyes are near.

278
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,840
This aura...

279
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,720
A divine painting?

280
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,540
Ma Wang.

281
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,810
Scholar Sir?

282
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,500
 Those reddish-black eyes. 

283
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,300
 - My eyes.
 - I saw them at Gyeongwonjeon. 

284
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,530
Um chai na ro ma um da.

285
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,410
Um chai na ro ma um da.

286
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,530
No one can touch my painter.

287
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,980
That is Hwacha.

288
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,210
Why to me...

289
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,420
Hwacha?

290
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,060
Who was that?

291
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,750
That is...

292
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,930
Speak in detail!

293
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,730
A counterattack...

294
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,340
Wake up, wake up!

295
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,230
 There are no detailed records on Seomungwan's Supervisor Ha's past. 

296
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,170
 He is the only son of Lord Ha Seong Jin, who was the head of the Taoist Bureau, 

297
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,800
 and His Majesty suddenly bestowed him the eighth rank position in the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau. 

298
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,220
 His hometown is Yangju. 

299
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,100
 No records and earned his place by the King's orders... 

300
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,710
- Is anyone there?
 - Yes, Your Highness.

301
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,780
You need to go to Yangju.

302
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,670
Who is that?

303
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,760
Scholar Sir.

304
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,550
Maiden?

305
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,770
Yes.

306
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,960
What are you doing in my room?

307
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Do you not remember again?

308
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,150
Remember what?

309
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,880
Wait.

310
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,510
Before that, what are you doing in my room?

311
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,270
This is the room I was staying in.

312
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,900
Why would I be here...

313
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,400
Do you really not remember anything?

314
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,210
How did I get here?

315
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,280
That is what I would like to ask you.

316
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,240
Last night...

317
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,020
Last night?

318
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,620
Last night, you suddenly came into my room...

319
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,460
and just slept.

320
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,080
I was truly surprised.

321
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,670
Is that the truth?

322
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,300
Did I do something horrible to you again

323
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,220
- and lose my memory?
 - The only horrible thing you did is

324
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,600
that you came into this room.

325
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,780
Did you have any dreams at all?

326
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,350
No.

327
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,710
No dreams.

328
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,160
 It definitely seems like the same situation like that day at Gyeongwonjeon. 

329
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,270
My underclothes...

330
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,910
W-wait!

331
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,320
Do not look here.

332
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,250
Do not look here either!

333
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,170
But I cannot see anyway—

334
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,870
- Turn around! 
 - Yes, ma'am.

335
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,060
- M-Maiden— 
 - Do not turn around!

336
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,770
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,540
Painter Hong, are you up?

338
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,660
I have prepared breakfast for you.

339
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,100
Where is the master? He isn't in his room.

340
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,900
Impossible. His shoes were still there.

341
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,520
What do I do?

342
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,240
If someone were to see this situation, could it arouse misunderstanding?

343
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Do you think it wouldn't?

344
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,750
I shall come out after getting dressed!

345
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
Yes, take your time.

346
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,990
You do not have to wait at the door and make me feel uncomfortable.

347
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,210
I shall go to the reception room myself.

348
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,600
All right.

349
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,740
Hurry up and get up! Qucikly!

350
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,290
Did you just hit me?

351
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,900
Are you talking back to me right now?

352
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,470
Try getting up.

353
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,070
All right.

354
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,120
Scholar Sir?

355
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,500
Why do you have that jeogori...

356
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,780
Your attire is...

357
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,900
Scholar Sir.

358
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,920
Let me look first.

359
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,170
You have to get down.

360
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,300
All right. Let us go.

361
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,850
All right.

362
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,960
- Maiden.
 - Scholar Sir.

363
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,330
Please be quiet.

364
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,610
Scholar Sir.

365
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,840
What is the situation?

366
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,560
It's being caught between a rock and a hard place.

367
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,600
Well, this is, you know...! You don't have to pretend as if you didn't notice.

368
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,100
You can still greet us. This is not what it looks like.

369
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,170
I'm not sure what you are thinking,

370
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,950
but we just came out for a walk on this beautiful day and it got so hot—

371
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,550
Maiden.

372
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,290
I am all right.

373
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,740
Pardon?

374
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,460
What do you mean you're all right when you look like this?

375
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,630
Aigoo, give that back to me.

376
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,160
Look after him, please.

377
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,320
Nothing happened.

378
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,510
- Do not make me uncomfortable.
 - Of course.

379
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,870
We did not misunderstand.

380
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,600
So nothing happened, right?

381
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,690
Man Su, you always understand me so well.

382
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,400
What kind of binyeo* should I get for you?
 (Hairpin for married women) 

383
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,670
I said nothing of that sort happened!

384
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,800
Yes, yes. We all know that is not the case.

385
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,830
But I don't think you could get a binyeo at this hour.

386
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,720
I hear the jewelry shop called Yeonjeong* in the market has everything you need. 
 (means romantic affection) 

387
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,570
It is all a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!

388
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,600
I wonder what the misunderstanding is.

389
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,780
Come here, both of you.

390
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,010
Come here, I say.

391
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,880
It is not what you think. You hear?

392
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,770
Have you looked into it?

393
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,440
I investigated King Yeongjong's royal portrait as you asked,

394
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,780
and it appears there was another painter in charge

395
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,390
other than Painter Hong Cheon Gi's father, Painter Hong Eun Oh.

396
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,850
There was another?

397
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,180
Gan Yun Guk, a Master Painter at the Painting Bureau at the time.

398
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,440
Gan Yun Guk?

399
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,100
Furthermore, King Yeongjong's royal portrait was simply known to have played an important role in the sealing ritual,

400
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,300
- but it turns out...
- What is it?

401
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,270
Tell me.

402
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,600
The royal portrait was a divine item used to seal Ma Wang

403
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,500
that was inside the previous King Yeongjong's body.

404
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,800
Ma Wang was also in King Yeongjong's body?

405
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,310
Yes.

406
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,120
They were attempting to seal it inside the painting.

407
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,610
 Then what the maiden spoke of is true? 

408
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,820
The scholar indeed does not seem to know.

409
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,110
 My eyes. 

410
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,620
 My eyes... 

411
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,630
What could it be?

412
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,280
Hey, Obnoxious One.

413
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,980
- Hey.
 - Hey!

414
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,220
What did you do all night to come back now?

415
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,660
- Hey you, be quiet!
 - What did you—

416
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,330
- What did you do?
 - That Obnoxious One.

417
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,970
What is she doing out all night?

418
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,940
So, to sum it up,

419
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,640
the king secretly commanded you to restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

420
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,440
And that royal portrait is the one your father, Painter Hong, painted

421
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,730
and moreover, it is, in fact, a painting that acted as a talisman to seal in an evil god?  Is that what you are saying?

422
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,380
Yes.

423
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:19,420
I think it is true that father fell mentally ill while painting it.

424
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,950
I have to do it since it is the king's command.

425
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,620
- But if I become like that, too—
 - Hey. That is unacceptable. Hell no!

426
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,090
Why would you risk your life to paint a portrait?

427
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,200
No way. For now, avoid it.

428
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,820
And then?

429
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,400
You'll have to figure that out.

430
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,260
Just because it isn't your business.

431
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,130
What am I supposed to do, then?

432
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,260
Should I paint it in your place?

433
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,240
Yes! Hey, that's it.

434
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,860
Will you paint it for me?

435
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,120
- What nonsense!
 - Hey, hey.

436
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,420
That is not doable.

437
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,170
And if you get caught? You will both be buried alive.

438
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,980
Then what am I supposed to do?

439
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,840
I cannot live like that, for my father's sake.

440
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,930
Aigoo. Dear heavens. What should...

441
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,000
- Han Geon, that bastard!

442
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,410
Headmaster! Headmaster!

443
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,010
Headmaster, Headmaster!

444
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,360
- Headmaster, do not do this.
 - Move! You rascal!

445
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,990
Did I or did I not tell you to inform me if something like that happens?

446
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,610
- Han Geon, that son of a dog!

447
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,220
Headmaster! It was the king's orders.

448
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,530
This is not something we can disregard.

449
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,000
- Let me go. Let me go!
 - Headmaster!

450
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,700
You should not do this. This will only cause Cheon Gi more trouble.

451
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,460
That scoundrel, I'll ...

452
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,710
- Move! 
 - Headmaster!

453
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,340
Move! Move!

454
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,250
Cheon Gi.

455
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,790
We must find a way for you to escape the Painting Bureau.

456
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,680
But, Headmaster.

457
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,720
- Did Father become like that while painting the royal—

458
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,360
No need for long explanations.

459
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,280
We must find a way to escape the king's orders.

460
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,690
What way could there be?

461
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,900
For now, when you go to the Painting Bureau today,

462
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,430
tell them you are unwell and come back quickly.

463
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,910
You must absolutely avoid becoming the royal portrait painter.

464
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,480
I understand.

465
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,320
 You saw his powers at Gyeongwonjeon. 

466
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,080
 That is not the power of the  living. 

467
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,300
 Then, you mean Ma Wang possessed Supervisor Ha? 

468
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,430
 I was on my way to the Inwang Mountain observatory last night and fainted inside the palanquin. 

469
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,940
 Judging by the external appearance, it does not seem to be done by a human being. 

470
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,360
Could Supervisor Ha truly be...

471
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,150
I am here to verify something.

472
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,470
Yes, Your Highness.

473
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,930
Please ask.

474
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:08,740
Do you have any evidence that Ma Wang is inside Supervisor Ha?

475
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,710
Please sit.

476
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,950
I shall show you proof.

477
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,410
Om do naba, om do naba ra...

478
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,720
Om do naba, om do naba ra...

479
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,440
Om do naba ra...

480
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,580
 - My eyes!
 - Ha Ram. 

481
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,310
 Has Ma Wang been indeed inside Supervisor Ha all this time? 

482
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,340
It is not a being I can drive out with my powers.

483
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,500
But why does Ma Wang inside Supervisor Ha only manifest near Painter Hong?

484
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:13,340
Ma Wang manifesting near the divine painter cannot be a coincidence.

485
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,090
Not a coincidence?

486
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,820
Then?

487
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,820
They are connected by a string of fate.

488
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,140
One of the two will surely meet death.

489
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,100
 If Cheon Gi finishes her painting, 

490
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,480
 could it become possible to chase out Ma Wang from inside me? 

491
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,690
There is new information about King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

492
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,520
They looked for the other painter besides Hong Eun Oh, who was in charge of painting

493
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,560
the royal portrait, Gan Yun Guk.

494
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,640
But no one even knows whether he is dead or alive.

495
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,430
Afterwards, among the painters,

496
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,860
a rumor went around that whoever became the royal portrait painter would fall under Hwacha's curse.

497
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,980
- Hwacha's curse?
 - Yes.

498
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,180
I think the rumor began because all the painters who finished

499
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,750
a royal portrait became mad or died.

500
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,850
 Will Cheon Gi be in danger if she finishes the royal portrait? 

501
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,640
Are you concerned that Painter Hong will be in danger?

502
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,060
They are only rumors so far.

503
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,560
 Even if for Cheon Gi's sake, 

504
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,180
 I must hurry and find out the truth as soon as possible. 

505
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,140
There is one person still alive who knows

506
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,530
what happened at the sealing ritual.

507
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,870
Who...

508
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,510
The former Royal Shaman, Mi Su.

509
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,950
Supervisor Sir, Grand Prince Yangmyeong is here.

510
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,140
You and I are alone here, so I shall be straightforward.

511
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,660
Yes, Your Highness.

512
00:40:52,660 --> 00:41:00,480
Have you thought of the connection between the incidents at Gyeongwonjeon and Inwang Mountain?

513
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,500
Yes, I have.

514
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,390
I would like to hear your thoughts.

515
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,560
Before I give you an answer,

516
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,750
I would like to ask you something.

517
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,750
Does the restoration of King Yeongjong's royal portrait

518
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,210
really have something to do with re-sealing that being called Ma Wang?

519
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:27,200
How do you know about Ma Wang, the royal secret?

520
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,580
Did you hear it from Painter Hong?

521
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,880
- No.
 - Then?

522
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,200
I found out after the incident at Gyeongwonjeon.

523
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,820
Do you also know that it is inside you?

524
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,530
Yes.

525
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,380
Then do you realize...

526
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,760
that you are a truly dangerous person to Painter Hong?

527
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,920
Yes, Your Highness.

528
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,150
Do not meet Painter Hong again...

529
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,570
until the royal portrait is finished.

530
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,730
When the one carrying Ma Wang and the one trying to seal it meet,

531
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,560
what would happen?

532
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,310
One of you will certainly die like a criminal.

533
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,730
If I catch you meeting her again,

534
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,600
I shall never forgive you.

535
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,880
I shall be going now.

536
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,550
Your Highness.

537
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,170
What will you do with me now?

538
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,690
Once the royal portrait is finished, a sealing ritual will  follow.

539
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,360
Stay put until then.

540
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,500
Is restoring King Yeongjong's royal portrait

541
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,780
and sealing Ma Wang in it the only way to expel it from inside me?

542
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,870
As far as I know, yes.

543
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:08,080
Is there... nothing I can do?

544
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,560
It is beyond any human power

545
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,910
until a divine painter finishes the painting and seals Ma Wang there.

546
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:22,500
I would like to hear the reason behind your conviction that it is the only way.

547
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,280
Because my royal grandfather, the prior King, fought with it his entire life.

548
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,050
This was the only method he ever found.

549
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,770
If you continue like this,

550
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,060
your body may not be able to contain Ma Wang further and will break down.

551
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,800
I shall prepare a quiet place for you to stay until the royal portrait is finished.

552
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,720
Stay low until then.

553
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,750
 Cheon Gi's painting is needed to expel Ma Wang from within me. 

554
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,770
 But the painter who finishes a royal portrait could be cursed. 

555
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,930
 Royal portrait? 

556
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,980
 Not the royal portrait! 

557
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,770
 No! 

558
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,720
 You must never paint the royal portrait! 

559
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,120
 You must absolutely avoid becoming the royal portrait painter. 

560
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,420
 It is still the king's command. 

561
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,750
 Can I keep avoiding painting the royal portrait? 

562
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,900
Why is the scholar not here?

563
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,250
 No. 

564
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,460
 I cannot put Cheon Gi in danger. 

565
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,910
Scholar Sir, you are here.

566
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,250
Maiden Hong.

567
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,800
Yes?

568
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,030
I have a favor to ask of you.

569
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,170
A favor?

570
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,480
Will you paint me a portrait?

571
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,530
Pardon?

572
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,720
A portrait?

573
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,320
It is someone you should be very thankful to.

574
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,410
Who is that?

575
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,650
You will see.

576
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,380
Well, painting is not hard to do, but...

577
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,090
Do not worry.

578
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,710
I will prepare enough money to pay for the portrait.

579
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,220
It is not about the payment.

580
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,500
I am only curious why you suddenly asked me.

581
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,900
Who is it and where is he from?

582
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,120
We've been having a fine weather.  How about painting outside?

583
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,770
Do you have a location in mind?

584
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,320
How about Mureung Gorge?

585
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,550
It is a beautiful place with clean air and pure water.

586
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,810
I also know that place.

587
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,720
We used to go there when we went painting outdoors at Baegyu Painting Institute.

588
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,670
You know that place as well?

589
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,380
It is on the way to the Mount Inwang astronomical observatory.

590
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,370
Would tomorrow be all right with you?

591
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,160
Yes, it sounds good.

592
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,380
Your Highness.

593
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,170
Yes. Have you looked into it?

594
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,580
They say she did stop by the map restoration room.

595
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,560
Then is she unwell?

596
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,190
Look. How is this?

597
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,260
Are they a good match?

598
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,100
This is precious clothing. Gyeonju Daek lent it to me.

599
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,180
How can you be so cheerful after defying the King's command?

600
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,180
- Aren't you even worried?
 - Hey.

601
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,010
Will anything change if I worry?

602
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,030
And how can I not worry?

603
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,710
I am only trying not to think of it.

604
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,030
How about this one? This color?

605
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,730
What if they come looking for me from the palace?

606
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,400
Annoying One and I tried to figure it out.

607
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,900
We will just  make some excuse about how you are feverish and bed-ridden.

608
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,000
Good.

609
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,100
That's that. What about Mureung Gorge? Are you really going?

610
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,470
Is that a question or a brain fart? Of course, I should go.

611
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,950
- I shouldn't be doing this right now but...
 - Hey, hey hey.

612
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,730
Don't get your hopes up.

613
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,040
He might really want you just to draw his portrait.

614
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,020
No.

615
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,330
I don't think it is an entirely false hope.

616
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,100
A man gave her a ring and asked her to meet up at such and such a place.

617
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,040
Isn't the game over, right there?

618
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,340
You suppose so?

619
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,710
Stop looking at it. You'll wear it out.

620
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,400
Your father would still be happy.

621
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,200
The dim-witted daughter is finally getting married.

622
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,500
You...

623
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,100
- Let me see.
 - See what?

624
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,710
The ring.

625
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,210
Hey, careful.

626
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,340
Isn't this fake?

627
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,910
- Hey.
 - It is fake.

628
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,680
Fake... Give that back.

629
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,230
- Give that back!
 - Take it.

630
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,180
- Give that back, you...
 - Take it.

631
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,610
Hey, give that back.

632
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,910
I said give that back.

633
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,170
Take it.

634
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,380
Is anyone inside?

635
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,140
Your Highness.

636
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,640
What brings you all the way here?

637
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,730
It is not a question you should ask when you did not show up at the atelier tonight.

638
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,070
Forgive me.

639
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,650
I was feeling unwell today...

640
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,100
and could not make it to the atelier.

641
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,580
If you are unwell, you should have told me.

642
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,490
I was worried.

643
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,740
Forgive me.

644
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,410
This will not do. There will be a punishment.

645
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,880
Tomorrow at the atelier,

646
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,900
you shall paint all the royal portrait's background.

647
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,610
The fur rug on the floor, the work throne, and the footstool.

648
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,480
Pardon?

649
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,500
How could I draw all of that in one day...

650
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,140
You are unwell because you are wrapped up in other thoughts right now.

651
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:31,600
Once you start filling in repetitive patterns, you will begin to focus.

652
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,000
Your Highness, to draw all that on my own in one day is...

653
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,150
I am still unwell...

654
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,200
and I am not skilled enough...

655
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,990
Why are you lying so earnestly?

656
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,400
- That is not it—
 - You know ...

657
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,960
I've always got what I wanted.

658
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,950
Do not think I only mean paintings.

659
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,040
I shall be waiting.

660
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,600
If you do not come, I will come find you.

661
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:05,140
I really don't think Grand Prince Yangmyeong will just sit back and take this.

662
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,240
Ah, whatever.

663
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,550
Let's not think about this right now.

664
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,440
 When the moon rises brightly, 

665
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,530
 How beautiful is my love! 

666
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,290
This will do.

667
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,600
 When she wears a pensive look, 
 How distraught is my heart! 

668
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,930
She wouldn't miss today again, would she?

669
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,570
♫  Come hither, let us play with you on my back...  ♫
 (famous pansori love song from Chunhyang-ga),  

670
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,570
Your Highness.

671
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,660
- I am back.
 - All right.

672
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,820
Have you found anything at Yangju?

673
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,480
Yes, Your Highness.

674
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,200
What?

675
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,440
Scholar Sir.

676
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,630
Maiden, you are here.

677
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,220
Have you waited long?

678
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,050
Not at all. I'm glad you're here.

679
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:27,110
So, where is the person whose portrait I will be painting?

680
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,560
Right here.

681
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:40,190
My, Scholar Sir. How could you fool me like this?

682
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,750
You said I should be thankful to this person.

683
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,040
Who else should you be thankful to if not me?

684
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,750
All right, then.

685
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,810
I shall be paid grandly for today's portrait.

686
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,010
Do not worry about that.

687
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:15,380
♫  Even if it hurts, I will not hate you  ♫

688
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:21,120
♫  Scared that the memory will be hurt  ♫

689
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:28,100
♫  I will miss you and want to see you  ♫

690
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,800

692
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,980
♫  I will be fine  ♫

693
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,080
Scholar Sir.

694
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,470
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

695
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:53,040
I want to show you.

696
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,370
Will it be all right?

697
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,500
Just trust me and follow me.

00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,270
Is it finished?

713
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,910
Yes, it is done.

714
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,570
♫   what I thought each moment every scene   ♫

715

♫  Even if time passes  ♫

717
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,770
Thank you.

718
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,220
Really?

719
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,600
Then, since I have finished the painting,

720
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,360
I must ask you for my payment.

721
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,850
What is this?

722
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:59,760
As soon as you go down from the mountain, take your father and go to Mapo Dock.

723
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,810
If you give this letter at the gate, they will provide you a passage to the Yeon Empire.

724
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,710
Yeon Empire?

725
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,750
Yes.

726
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:16,070
Leave this country with your father.

727
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,300
I do not understand what you mean.

728
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,370
The other day,

729
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:31,370
you said that you were very worried about painting a royal portrait to seal Ma Wang, did you not?

730
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:35,920
You wondered if your father became mentally ill after finishing the royal portrait.

731
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,400
And?

732
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,900
That Ma Wang's hiding place ... is inside me.

733
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,630
When I lose my memory,

734
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,480
I may strangle you again.

735
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,270
It seems...

736
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:08,230
we are not meant to be together.

737
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,960
You are joking, are you not?

738
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,140
Leave.

739
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,550
Far away from me.

740
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,850
I beg you.

741
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,460
Your Highness.

742
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:03,700
Supervisor Ha, you are under arrest on charges of killing the royal guards at Inwang Mountain.

743
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,800
No! Don't do this.

744
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,300
There must be a mistake.

745
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,070
- Step aside.
 - Your Highness!

746
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,570
Why on earth are you doing this?

747
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,250
I told you to move aside!

748
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,150
No.

749
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,590
In whose presence do you dare!

750
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:37,800


751
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:50,340
♫  Am I it? The person who lives in your heart  ♫

752
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:57,530
♫  The one person you long for endlessly  ♫

753
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:05,400

754

♫  I'll stay at your side like destiny  ♫

755
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,510
♫  Although I'm still slow and overwhelmed  ♫

756
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,170

758
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,990
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

759
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,080
 Ma Wang is inside Ha Ram's body. 

760
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,710
 I shall paint the royal portrait. 

761
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,880
 You will be in danger if you finish the royal portrait. 

762
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,120
 We must extricate Ma Wang from your body. 

763
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,490
 I heard the painter who finishes King Yeongjong's royal painting will be cursed. 

764
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:46,010
 This is the king's command and my fate. 

765
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,250
 If the royal portrait puts you in danger... 

766
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,660
 - That ring...
 - The scholar gave it to me. 

767
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,800
 Please forget about Supervisor Ha. 

768
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,660
 If you are reading this letter, something must have happened to me. 

769
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,900
 Scholar Sir, it is finally finished. 

770
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,630
 There is trouble, Your Highness. 

771
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,700
 Painter Hong... 

772
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,410
 - Cheon Gi, Cheon Gi!
 - Cheon Gi! 

773
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:05,500
 - Goodness, Cheon Gi!
 - Cheon Gi! 

774
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,700
