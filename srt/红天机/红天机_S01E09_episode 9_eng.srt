00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,020
 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,790
Stay here.

8
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Supervisor Ha, are you all right?

9
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,240
Your Highness!

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,260
Your Highness, Your Highness!

11
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,920
Wake up, Your Highness!

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,040
Your Highness, are you all right?

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,930
Your Highness!

14
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,480
Scholar Sir.

15
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,570
My eyes.

16
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,440
 This is... 

17
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,300
 This is not Ha Ram. 

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,700
Don't come closer. Don't come.

19
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,230
Those are my eyes.

20
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,250
My eyes!

21
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Ha Ram.

22
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
It's me, Cheon Gi.

23
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,330
Wake up.

24
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Ha Ram!

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,170
Ho Ryeong.

26
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,890
Ma Wang.

27
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,890
This is the king's palace. 
    

28
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,510
You cannot use your powers here.

29
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,760
Ho Ryeong.

30
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,370
Begone! Back to where you were confined.

31
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,580
How dare you!

32
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,040
I will not let this pass.

33
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,080
Madam Royal Shaman, what is the matter?

34
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,930
 Ma Wang's aura has been cut off. 

35
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,980
 Someone has certainly suppressed Ma Wang... 

36
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,780
 within the palace. 

37
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,700
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

38
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,100
Supervisor Ha, Supervison Ha, are you all right?

39
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,000
 He shall recover soon. 

40
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,900
Supervisor Ha. Supervisor Ha!

41
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,490
Supervisor Ha!

42
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,520
Scholar Sir.

43
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,870
Scholar Sir. Scholar Sir!

44
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 Episode 9: Immortal Physiognomy 

45
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Supervisor Sir, what is happening again?

46
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,880
Do not worry.

47
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,490
I stopped by the royal physician's clinic and he came today.

48
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,040
Your Highness, I am so grateful.

49
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,450
What will happen if the scholar does not wake?

50
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,240
The royal physician said that he would regain consciousness once day breaks.

51
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Let us wait a while.

52
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,200
But does Supervisor Ha faint often like this?

53
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,900
P-pardon? What do you mean?

54
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,820
It reminds me of the night

55
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,510
Supervisor Ha went missing on Inwang Mountain.

56
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,060
Now that I think of it,

57
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,060
I could not believe when he said he passed out so suddenly.

58
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,130
 Supervisor Ha, are you all right? 

59
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,650
 I was on my way to the Inwang Mountain observatory last night and fainted inside the palanquin. 

60
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,120
 I do not remember anything after that. 

61
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,150
 Dare I think?  Could Supervisor Ha be connected 

62
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,720
 to the guards' corpses incident at Inwang Mountain? 

63
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,610
Is your neck all right?

64
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,130
Pardon?

65
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes, it's all right.

66
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,650
I am more worried about the Scholar.

67
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,280
What has been bothering you since earlier?

68
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,620
It's nothing.

69
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,500
Nothing?

70
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,540
Why is your face so pale and your eyes in a daze?

71
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,970
It is strange.

72
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,830
What is?

73
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:25,300
How could something like that happen at a sacred place where the kings' royal portraits are kept?

74
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,400
As soon as Supervisor Ha wakes up,

75
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,430
I should take him to the Inspection Office at the Royal Investigation Bureau for questioning in detail.

76
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,340
Inspection Office?

77
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,670
Is that not where they inspect copses?

78
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,260
They do not only inspect corpses there.

79
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,700
Because they investigate all types of incidents, they have many records of human life, death and sickness.

80
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,470
It will provide an opportunity to inspect Supervisor Ha's condition.

81
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,810
Then, do you mean they will inspect inside his body?

82
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,000
If need be. What else can be done?

83
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,700
Supervisor Ha seemed deranged and you and the royal portrait guards were injured.

84
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,650
You could have died.

85
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,900
What is more, this is also for Supervisor Ha's sake.

86
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,230
But this does not seem to be solely the scholar's problem.

87
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,560
I also had an incident when I went to Gyeongwonjeon.

88
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,650
Shouldn't the order be to inspect Gyeongwonjeon first before investigating the scholar?

89
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,650
The scholar is only a man who cannot see.

90
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,520
Please reconsider your decision.

91
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,130
I shall think about how to deal with this.

92
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,860
Until then, no one must know of this.

93
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,110
Yes. I understand, Your Highness.

94
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,830
Aren't you leaving?

95
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,930
I will stay by the scholar a while longer.

96
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,840
All right, then.

97
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:30,730
♫  I, who had prayed desperately on the day we wandered in the darkness 

98
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,090
♫  covered by clouds that moonlight shines brightly on us  ♫

99
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:44,850
♫  Our love which hurts and hurt  ♫

100
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,390
♫  I won't let go now. I will protect you by your side  ♫

101
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,320
♫  The world is filled with fragrance  ♫

102
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
 Do you know? 

103
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,110
 You are so precious to me, Scholar Sir. 

104
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,680
You must wake up soon.

105
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,500
Why am I so sleepy?

106
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,450
Ma Wang will not manifest anywhere for a while now.

107
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,450
Why on earth are you using such an inconvenient method?

108
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,340
Ma Wang has been in this world for an eternity.

109
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,560
We cannot get rid of him in an instant.

110
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:31,350
This child must open her eyes to divinity soon.

111
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,810
So that she can make the eternal vessel to contain Ma Wang.

112
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,240
All that talk about the vessel.

113
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,900
Only these two young ones can accomplish it.

114
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,100
- Scholar Sir? 
 - Maiden.

115
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,040
Have you woken up?

116
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,720
 Scholar Sir? 

117
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,590
What is the matter?

118
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
 No. 

119
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,510
 No, he is Ha Ram now. 

120
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,800
Have you regained consciousness?

121
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,560
Yes.

122
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,670
That is a relief.

123
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,050
- I apologize, Scholar Sir. 
 - Stay there for a moment.

124
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,900
What happened at Gyeongwonjeon?

125
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,730
Do you not remember anything?

126
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,260
No.

127
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,520
So, it was... Your eyes rolled back...

128
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,780
My eyes rolled back?

129
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
No, no, not rolled back.

130
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,560
They turned reddish-black and your nails grew long—

131
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,830
My nails grew long ... What do you—

132
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,600
You strangled with those hands and your strength grew like a monster...

133
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,360
Did you have a dream?

134
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,910
Pardon?

135
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,650
What can I say to someone who does not remember anything?

136
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,220
Tell me in detail.

137
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,120
Never mind. If I continue to talk, I will seem like a deranged person.

138
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,920
That's why I am asking you to tell me in detail.

139
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,680
But ... Are you grilling someone who looked after you all night?

140
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,810
Who grilled whom?

141
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,750
You just did. You're grilling me now.

142
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,570
You save someone from drowning, and they ask if you got their belongings.

143
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,910
All right. Tell me slowly.

144
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,200
For free?

145
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,590
For free?

146
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,590
My stomach has been feeling empty since morning.

147
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,220
I think I would only be able to speak after putting some food in it.

148
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,910
Eat up.

149
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,250
Thank you for the food.

150
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,150
Where did the handkerchief go?

151
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,720
Scholar Sir, the wound on your neck has healed.

152
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,280
It was healed when I woke up.

153
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,900
Healed overnight?

154
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,520
Yes.

155
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Here is the handkerchief.

156
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,560
I did not think you would've still kept it.

157
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,540
It is important to you.

158
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,910
I had meant to return it to you.

159
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,550
I am truly grateful.

160
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,980
Please, eat. It will get cold.

161
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,560
All right.

162
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,630
Last night at Gyeongwonjeon, you suddenly seemed deranged,

163
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,130
as if you were possessed by something.

164
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,230
And your eyes were reddish black.

165
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,760
 Reddish black eyes? 

166
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,370
Sir.

167
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,270
Have you found out about Ma Wang?

168
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,710
There are reports from all over the country.

169
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,730
But they are all what traveling entertainers would say. They are only baseless rumors.

170
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,550
What are they?

171
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,370
It is only a speculation that Ma Wang is a powerful evil spirit who's existed since a long time ago.

172
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,340
And 26 years ago, Ma Wang's sealing ritual was related to King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

173
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,120
 Ma Wang's sealing ritual... 

174
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
What of Grand Prince Juhyang's activity?

175
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,450
There is nothing.

176
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,520
It is finally time to meet him as Il Wol Seong.

177
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,000
What has happened?

178
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,110
A divine spirit guarding the king's palace

179
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,670
has certainly suppressed Ma Wang.

180
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,230
I think it was aided by the barrier created when building the palace.

181
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,710
We have searched for Ma Wang for 20 years.

182
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,670
Find out everything you can. Do not leave anything out.

183
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,480
But, Your Highness,

184
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,900
if it is His Majesty's intention to restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait and reseal Ma Wang,

185
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,230
might I suggest waiting until the portrait is restored?

186
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,560
You mean my father knows of Ma Wang's whereabouts?

187
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,500
If not so, what other reason  would he have to restore King Yeongjong's portrait?

188
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,070
But Ma Wang will not be found simply because the royal portrait is restored.

189
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,970
That is why I suggest waiting! To see how much His Majesty has prepared.

190
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,460
But if the Shamanist Bureau makes a move first, we shall lose the initiative.

191
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,580
We must take action first.

192
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
Enough!

193
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,830
Enough.

194
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,740
Yes, Your Highness.

195
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,080
Have someone follow Yangmyeong. I must know what happened at Gyeongwonjeon.

196
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,430
And send a message to Il Wol Seong.

197
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,490
Why do you need to see Il Wol Seong?

198
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,670
 By nature, there is one who interprets the stars in the sky and one who draws them. 

199
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,110
 You should enjoy the stars. 

200
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,450
 Stay among them. You shall be safe that way. 

201
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:52,530
 I must make certain if Royal Father suspects my intentions. 

202
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,810
What happened last night?

203
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,480
I do not... remember well.

204
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,900
Don't you remember?

205
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,900
Do you have any idea how much we suffered because of you?

206
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,400
The portrait guards and I collapsed, and Painter Hong injured her neck.

207
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
What happened?

208
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,580
Maiden Hong injured her neck?

209
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,510
I did not see because I was unconscious because of you.

210
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,090
But it was bruised.

211
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,910
Very badly.

212
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,890
 Cheon Gi was hurt because I lost my consciousness. 

213
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,220
It's very hard to believe.

214
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,450
I understand. If you do not remember the events of last night, I shall not speak further of it.

215
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,300
Come with me to the Investigation Bureau and let us inspect your body.

216
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,440
Body inspection?

217
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,830
As the word describes, we shall inspect whether you have any sickness.

218
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,720
But I really don't...

219
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Until we find the reason,

220
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,840
I hope you do not see Painter Hong for a while.

221
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,990
Your Highness.

222
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,300
This is also for your good.

223
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,600
Is he truly all right?

224
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,080
A white tiger?

225
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,780
Oh, wait...

226
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,750
Who is it?

227
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,340
Hey, wait, who is...

228
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,780
Where did it go?

229
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,300
Who are you?

230
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,720
Why are you dressed...

231
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,900
What?

232
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,320
Can you see me?

233
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,840
Of course. Why would I not?

234
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,050
So you can truly see me.

235
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,480
- Ouch, hey!
- I see...

236
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,410
As expected. Evil eyes.

237
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,970
Evil eyes?

238
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,140
Why? Are you curious?

239
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,000
Bring me some good tea then.

240
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,380
"Bring me..."

241
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,680
Hey! You little thing. You look younger than me.

242
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,520
How old are you?

243
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,500
Age... I am not sure.

244
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,320
Not sure after the first 500 years.

245
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,770
Five—

246
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,170
Hey. How did you get in here? Huh?

247
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,090
Doesn't even know I saved her life.

248
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,890
Save my...

249
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,300
This is why we should not deal with thick-headed humans.

250
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,140
This is not somewhere you can enter without permission, little girl!

251
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,850
Baby, hurry and bring me tea.

252
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,380
Tea made of dried chrysanthemums.

253
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,100
It was just here... miss.

254
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,080
Still. You made the tea yourself, baby.

255
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,080
Look, you are finished.

256
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,640
If you are done, get going. Go, please.

257
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,560
Now, listen to me carefully.

258
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,370
Break up with Ma Wang now.

259
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,140
- Pardon? 
 - You almost died because you were with him last night.

260
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,180
What is she saying?

261
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,200
I might get scolded by Samshin, but I'll tell you one more thing.

262
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,880
Samshin or Ma Wang or whatnot. Hurry up and go home!

263
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,850
I'll call someone!

264
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,330
Who are you talking with?

265
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,860
Oh, Supervisor Sir.

266
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,660
This child here.

267
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,980
Where?

268
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,100
This child right ...

269
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,510
Where did she go? Huh?

270
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,610
- What... 
 -  Your eyes... 

271
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,340
 will return to their original owner. 

272
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,380
Did you hear that?

273
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,130
She was just drinking tea here

274
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,600
and with that white hair—

275
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,040
Stop that. Why are you doing that? You are scaring me.

276
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,570
Here, here.

277
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,600
Finish these by next week.

278
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,520
Two copies each.

279
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,520
Did she leave?

280
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,470
That day 19 years ago...

281
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,530
 There was a fire at Gyeongwonjeon, and King Yeongjong's royal portrait was burned. 

282
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,520
 There was the Seokcheok Rain Ritual. 

283
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,550
 There was an accident and Supervisor Ha lost his sight. 

284
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,330
 What happened yesterday? 

285
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,160
 I do not... 

286
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,990
 remember well. 

287
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,600
There is a secret within King Yeongjeong's portrait.

288
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,700
What brings you here at this late hour?

289
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,420
I have come to ask you something, Royal Father.

290
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
What is it you wish to know?

291
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,390
The divine painter who was restoring King Yeongjong's royal portrait

292
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,500
fainted at Gyeongwonjeon.

293
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,390
How could this be...

294
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,880
That is not all.

295
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,920
Supervisor Ha also shocked us by acting possessed in front of Gyeongwonjeon.

296
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,820
But that incident reminded me of...

297
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,520
  Hyeong-nim Juhyang's actions 20 years ago. 

298
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:09,670
I wondered if perhaps there were an unknown secret regarding King Yeongjong's portrait.

299
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,110
Yul.

300
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,300
Yes.

301
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:22,890
It seems the time has come for you to know everything.

302
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:31,210
Have you heard of Ma Wang?

303
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,650
Ma Wang?

304
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,480
Ma Wang has existed since ancient times and is an embodiment of evil.

305
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,640
 The return of Ma Wang causes death in nature 

306
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,240
 and also in the human world. 

307
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,380
Once he possesses a member of the royal family, there is revolt,

308
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,110
 and a history of bloodshed begins. 

309
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,950
Just as it happened with your grandfather, the predecessor king.

310
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,440
 After abdicating, King Yeongjong sealed Ma Wang  

311
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,120
 who was in his body, inside his royal portrait 

312
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,000
painted by the divine painter.

313
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,340
Royal Grandfather did?

314
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:33,240
King Yeongjong's royal portrait has to be restored in order  to seal Ma Wang in.

315
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,580
Royal Father, are you all right?

316
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,470
Father.

317
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,070
It is not something that can be done easily.

318
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,660
No one should hear of this, and it cannot fail.

319
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,760
Your duty is of grave importance.

320
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,910
Make it succeed.

321
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,900
Regardless of the mean or method.

322
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,530
Certainly... I will certainly be mindful of it, Royal Father.

323
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,430
A portrait begins with accepting the subject with your heart.

324
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:42,990
That is because the portrait must not only capture the subject's face but also his personality and nature.

325
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,430
 The future of this nation's royal family is at your hands. 

326
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,690
 I shall get this done without failure, together with you. 

327
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,110
 The garment folds must be drawn in subdued lines of even thickness, just to hint at the material. 

328
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,690
 If they are too prominent, it spoils the subject's aura. 

329
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,330
All in all, in a portrait, the Five Elevations and Four Depressions must be utilized

330
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,430
to depict the highs and lows of the facial structure.

331
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,430
The Five Elevations include the forehead,

332
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,550
nose, chin,

333
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,500
and two cheekbones. The Four Depressions are...

334
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,520
Now, compare them.

335
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,450
The different features, personalities and auras of the three kings, I mean.

336
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,550
Their aura is truly different.

337
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,110
Royal Grandfather, King Yeongjong, whom you will paint,

338
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,750
had the eyes of the phoenix.

339
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,660
When he got angry, his eyes were fierce, as if they were set aflame...

340
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,910
Follow your feelings to draw his royal face.

341
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,690
The lines must be even, not out of place.

342
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,330
- The line is quite...
 - The thickness of the line...

343
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,500
fluctuates too much.

344
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,410
I drew with consistent pressure. But why...

345
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,930
A line is both drawn and executed.

346
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,760
As you must capture the model's personality and aura in it, too,

347
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,510
it is not easy.

348
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,870
- It is not easy, but— 
 - Let's try again.

349
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,450
Yes.

350
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,090
I apologize.

351
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,500
I'm so tired.

352
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,410
Why are they making me do this?

353
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,330
I will die if I keep going like this.

354
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,530
 I see the Big Dipper there. 

355
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,640
 Do you remember? 

356
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,300
 It was the first star I drew. How could I forget it? 

357
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:52,670
♫  Even when you are far, I hear your voice as if you are near  ♫

358
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:57,490
♫  Even when you are far, I hear your voice as if you are near  ♫

359
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,080
♫  Stars, stars, stars, shining tonight, tonight  ♫

360
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,440
♫  Stars, stars, stars, shining tonight, tonight  ♫

361
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,830
Why on earth...

362
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,060
Why can I not complete a proper line?

363
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,840
Why is it so hard?

364
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,700
- Headmaster.
- Yes.

365
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,150
What are you still doing up?

366
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,850
Aigoo. Does our work ever end?

367
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,100
Earlier in the day, Eun Oh regained his clear mind for a short time.

368
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,530
Really?

369
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,550
The cheongsimwon seems to be working.

370
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,410
Headmaster!

371
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,690
Father!

372
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,060
Father.

373
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,210
It's me, Cheon Gi. I'm here.

374
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,180
Your daughter.

375
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,710
My daughter is still a child.

376
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,260
I know, I know.

377
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,420
That child has already grown up like this.

378
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,720
Wow, what did you draw?

379
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,910
Shall I paint you something?

380
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,100
Oh, no. I drew and saw countless paintings at the Painting Bureau today.

381
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,300
Painting Bureau...

382
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,000
Lately, I started repainting the royal portrait that you painted.

383
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,460
Royal portrait...

384
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,180
There must never be a royal portrait.

385
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,050
No!

386
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,500
Father, what is it?

387
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,840
You must never paint the royal portrait!

388
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,430
Royal portrait... no... no...

389
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,820
- No! 
 - Father! Father.

390
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,490
Father, what is it?

391
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,550
Eun Oh!

392
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,470
Please pull yourself together.

393
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,060
Father.

394
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,530
What did you say to make him have such a fit?

395
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,450
I told him that I was painting at the Painting Bureau.

396
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,000
But, Headmaster.

397
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,220
I heard Father could have become this way while painting the royal portrait. Is that true?

398
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,540
Who says such a thing?

399
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,410
Grand Prince Yangmyeong did.

400
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:53,850
Well. It is hard to confirm or deny it.

401
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,980
But why do you suddenly bring up the royal portrait?

402
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,970
Oh... I just remembered what we talked about.

403
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,230
It is nothing.

404
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,950
By chance, Han Geon didn't order you to paint something like a royal portrait, did he?

405
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,890
Should I not paint a royal portrait?

406
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,660
A royal portrait puts an immense toll on the painter.

407
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,850
If one concentrates on it too hard...

408
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,550
 Hwacha the goblin will visit. 

409
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,780
 In other words, you will go insane. 

410
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,000
- Never mind. It's nothing.
 - Pardon?

411
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,410
Anyhow, if Geon tries to make you paint one, you must tell me.

412
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,380
You must never be a royal portrait painter.

413
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,510
Understand?

414
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,450
Scholar Sir.

415
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,930
Yes, it is I.

416
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,950
Are you feeling better now?

417
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,770
 What should I say first? 

418
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,320
 I cannot bear to utter words. 

419
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,540
Yes, thanks to you.

420
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,010
It is truly a relief.

421
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:36,030
I hear some concern in your voice. Is something the matter?

422
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,700
It is nothing. I'm only a bit frustrated.

423
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,870
Shall we talk over some tea?

424
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,720
Please, sit.

425
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,950
All right.

426
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,790
What kind of tea is this?

427
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,810
It is sparrow tongue tea. 
  (Expensive black tea made from young tea leaves shaped like sparrows' tongues) .

428
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,950
This is the tea the royal family uses in the fresh crop offering ceremony every February.

429
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,630
It is very precious tea.

430
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,700
Thank you.

431
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,590
Ouch, it's hot.

432
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,420
Are you all right?

433
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,210
You must slowly take in the tea's scent first.

434
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:23,390
So, why were you so down earlier?

435
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,150
The thing is... Well...

436
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,030
I paint the royal portrait every night in secret.

437
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,450
But the physiognomy and face reading are quite difficult.

438
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,910
More than anything, I cannot execute a line very well.

439
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,770
Since it is a portrait, it is quite different from a Sansuhwa  (landscape painting) .

440
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,080
I think I must study physiognomy.

441
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,450
 I have someone to introduce to you for that. 

442
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:08,200
 He is the one who foretold that King Hyejo would rise to the throne. 

443
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,730
 The country's best physiognomist, Master Im Jang Hyeon. 

444
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,130
Now, shall we take a look together?

445
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,740
Yes, Sir.

446
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,320
Those are what you call peacock eyes.

447
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,170
Eyes big like a peacock's with deep double eyelids

448
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:34,330
and clearly defined eye shapes are called peacock eyes.

449
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,550
I do not know which family you come from, but do not worry, Madam.

450
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,910
You will not have to worry about money all your life.

451
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,440
Brows of a dragon are like his.

452
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,660
They are powerful, like a dragon, and dark with a slight arch.

453
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,940
They are called Dragon's Brows.

454
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,790
What are people with Dragon's Brows like?

455
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,990
They are exceptional writers and very wise.

456
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,700
They are known to rise to high ranks.

457
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,990
Hello.

458
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,130
Jeong Soen Nae?

459
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,670
Master, how do you interpret his features?

460
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,860
He is the evil and avaricious type. He is vengeful

461
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,010
and would do anything to pay back any injury.  Just vile.

462
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,330
I knew it.

463
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,700
Good day.

464
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,040
I plan to set up a gambling shop. Will I be able to make some money...

465
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,010
- Please read my face. 
 - Money, my ass.

466
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,850
Let me take a look.

467
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,210
Does he make you feel uneasy?

468
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,700
Pardon?

469
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,880
As far as I know, the country's most vicious man has just arrived.

470
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,040
Shall I just beat him up for you?

471
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,660
No, that's all right.

472
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,480
Thank you so much for today.

473
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,000
Do not mention it.

474
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,190
Supervisor Ha, could I talk with you for a moment?

475
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,150
Please wait a moment.

476
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,640
All right.

477
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,290
Next.

478
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,640
My child suddenly cannot see.

479
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,930
I came to see the physiognomist hoping I could at least find out the reason.

480
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,780
Leave.

481
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,690
Please, let me meet him just once!

482
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,250
What should I...

483
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,280
If you want to meet the physiognomist, bring some money.

484
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,690
Are you all right?

485
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,460
How cruel you are to a woman with a child who is unwell!

486
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,630
What?

487
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,500
Let me help you up.

488
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,400
Does the physiognomist know this is happening outside?

489
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,490
You wench. Who are you, anyway?

490
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,810
I'll just...

491
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,840
Do you want your hands cut off?

492
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,000
What is this now?

493
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,150
Shall I inform you?

494
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,290
Will a sudden misfortune set your mind straight?

495
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,460
Forgive me! Forgive me.

496
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,200
Hey, you! You cannot go in like that.

497
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,290
Are you all right?

498
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,210
Why did you cause trouble to yourself by getting involved?

499
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:51,240
She was a woman with a boy who could not see.

500
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,370
I couldn't ignore

501
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:59,320
the poor and unwell being mistreated.

502
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,480
Forgive me.

503
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:08,070
Still, you almost got hurt. Be careful from now on.

504
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,280
I will. Thank you, Scholar Sir.

505
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,520
There are multiple kites flying in the sky.

506
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,870
How beautiful.

507
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,210
- Kites? 
 - Yes.

508
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:30,410
I think they are flying kites to repel misfortune for Daeboreum* 
  (Holiday on the first full moon of the year) .

509
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,670
Would you like to fly one?

510
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,580
Pardon?

511
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,270
Ah, well...

512
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:41,440
Why? You think I am not able?

513
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,200
I was quite good at flying kites when I was younger.

514
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,970
Give it to me. I shall unwind the thread for you.

515
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,740
It's just that it is the first time after I lost my sight.

516
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,330
I know.

517
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,430
One moment.

518
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,620
I shall give it to you after I have it in the air.

519
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,230
All right.

520
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,720
Scholar Sir! Scholar Sir!

521
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,520
Thank you.

522
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,540
How is it?

523
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,860
Do you feel the movement of the wind?

524
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,170
How high up is the kite?

525
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,500
Your kite is flying the highest.

526
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,910
You are quite good.

527
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,430
There is a saying about "Luck and Talent 73."

528
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,640
Kite flying is also a matter of luck, don't you think?

529
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,020
You mean "70% of Luck and 30% of Talent."

530
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,470
Pardon?

531
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,100
"70% of Luck and 30% of Talent." That is what I said.

532
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,990
Same thing either way.

533
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,130
Stop laughing.

534
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,540
I apologize. I laughed too loudly.

535
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,860
To you, what kind of memory is the young boy from your childhood?

536
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,810
I could not see then, so I thought of him as a snot-nosed child.

537
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:00,120
Is it different now that you see him?

538
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,550
Yes. He is a very fine-looking male fairy.

539
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,640
Then, do you like that boy because he is good-looking?

540
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,030
Don't say such things.

541
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,850
Who knows? Perhaps he was a runny-nosed child back then.

542
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,640
Do not be alarmed even if you do not see me for a few days.

543
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,930
I shall come back without fail.

544
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,260
What do you mean?

545
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,390
I will go to the Inspection Office with Grand Prince Yangmyeong because of what happened at Gyeongwonjeon.

546
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:38,950
Nothing would happen, but it may take a few days, so I wanted to tell you in advance.

547
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,070
His Highness truly means to take you there.

548
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:48,480
It cannot be brushed aside, as it happened at the king's palace.

549
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,960
And what is more, you almost got injured as well.

550
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,600
I am only...

551
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,550
I am all right.

552
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:05,180
Do not worry. I will be released if there is no problem.

553
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,180
What is it?

554
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,180
Your kite thread has been cut off.
  (kite sounds the same as link between destinies) 

555
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,510
I apologize. It must have been my mistake.

556
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,370
It is all right. This kite is meant to fly off with all bad luck.

557
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,670
Is that so?

558
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,250
Yes. I shall cut mine, too, and let it fly it away.

559
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,370
♫  Our love hurt so...  ♫

560
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,740
The two kites are flying together.

561
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,980
They are flying away with all the bad luck.

562
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:48,590
♫  I won't let go now. I will protect you by your side  ♫

563
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,180
♫  The world is filled with the fragrance  ♫

564
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,340
Maiden.

565
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,470
Yes?

566
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:02,420
♫  You're still the only person deep in my heart.  ♫

567
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,680
Please accept it.

568
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,780
What is this?

569
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:17,340
It is the one and only jade ring that my father gave to my mother when they were alive.

570
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,960
I hope you will keep it much longer than the handkerchief.

571
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,870
Why would you give me such a precious thing...

572
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,520
I'm not sure it is right for me to keep this...

573
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,930
I ...

574
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,680
I love you.

575
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:48,510
♫  Our love which hurts and hurt and was so ardent.  ♫

576
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:55,100
♫  I won't let go now, I will protect you by your side  ♫

577
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,300
♫  The world is filled with the fragrance  ♫

578
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,910
♫  of one person who is you  ♫

579
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,530
♫  Deep in my heart  ♫

580
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:12,200
♫  the stars will always shine on just us.  ♫

581
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,570
Why are you so late?

582
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,450
I went out to the streets and studied the people's faces and bone structures.

583
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,030
Forgive me.

584
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,640
Do you understand portraits better now that you have studied physiognomy?

585
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,340
I realized physiognomy is truly profound and mysterious.

586
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,220
Is that so?

587
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:48,540
But, Your Highness, I have something to ask you.

588
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,280
Ask me anything.

589
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,600
What is the reason that you are making me restore

590
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,120
King Yeongjong's royal portrait instead of officially selecting a royal portrait painter?

591
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,150
Restoring King Yeongjong's royal portrait can only be done by chosen painters

592
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,600
like your father, Painter Hong.

593
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,070
What do you mean by chosen painters?

594
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,950
Let us go and get some fresh air.

595
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,310
Welcome, Your Highness.

596
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:38,260
Finally, we meet.

597
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,910
 A strange mask. 

598
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,770
Please, sit.

599
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,340
What brings you here tonight?

600
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,910
I have a private matter I must confer with you about.

601
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,550
Are you prepared to pay the price?

602
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,820
As much as you want.

603
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,140
Then, how about playing a game of baduk* with me?
  (Korean name of the Chinese game known as "go") 

604
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,310
 A baduk board for the blind? Could he be...? 

605
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,150
A game of baduk as payment?

606
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,910
Yes. This will do for today.

607
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:33,940
Your father had divine powers, unlike other painters.

608
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,360
Just as butterflies landed on your painting during the painting contest.

609
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:44,270
Then, are all royal portraits drawn by divine painters?

610
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:49,100
No. It is only for King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

611
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:54,600
Because that royal portrait must be especially infused with divine powers.

612
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,220
Have you heard that the crown prince will ascend the throne soon?

613
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,080
You are wondering when you can seize

614
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,040
the card that will bring straight victory to you, are you not?

615
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,300
I am.

616
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,630
Then, why not conquer the center first?

617
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:27,430
Saying that, why don't you take the center yourself?

618
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,860
All things require preparation.

619
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:41,010
I have taken the center for you.

620
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,500
What are you doing? Is this not cheating?

621
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,540
Baduk is a game where both players hide their own intentions

622
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,300
and calculate their moves as their hidden goals require.

623
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:00,130
Who can accuse whom of cheating in this game?

624
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,150
What is the ultimate winning card for Your Highness?

625
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:08,560
Would it not be the rarely chanced upon golden opportunity earned by taking out your political opponent?

626
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,400
Take out my political opponent?

627
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,430
'Sacrifice pieces for the bigger goal,' from the ten tactics of baduk.

628
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,810
It means you must give up what is valuable to you to go forth.

629
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:23,170
 Does he mean I should eliminate Yul? 

630
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:28,720
 Yes, grow your dark desire and dream of what you must not dream. 

631
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,530
 That is my revenge towards this nation's 

632
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,870
 royal family. 

633
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,650
A brilliant move. Truly.

634
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,640
I have something to ask Your Highness as well.

635
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:54,470
What is it? I shall pay grandly for tonight's advice.

636
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,150
Your Highness.

637
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,290
What is Ma Wang?

638
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,200
Have you heard of Ma Wang?

639
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,990
What is it exactly?

640
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,280
It is chaos that should not come forth in this world.

641
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,010
It is an evil god living off of humans' dark desires.

642
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,580
Ma Wang?

643
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,770
Yes. I said, Ma Wang.

644
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,920
Why are you searching for Ma Wang?

645
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,050
Do you truly wish to be on my side until the end?

646
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,210
If I did not regard you as my sovereign in the first place,

647
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,740
I would not have revealed myself to you.

648
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,400
I have to find Ma Wang to sit on the throne.

649
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,880
The predecessor king said that the world is always unstable

650
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,850
and the throne is not secure.

651
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,990
In the countryside the remaining supporters of the prior dynasty

652
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,800
still grasp at any chance to revive that dynasty

653
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:27,700
and the King's palace is in the hold of those courtiers with questionable loyalty.

654
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,600
Therefore, that is why I must

655
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,760
become king.

656
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:44,050
Before Royal Grandfather passed away, he had his royal portrait made

657
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:49,580
and sealed Ma Wang in it, to stop ill-fortune from befalling his descendants.

658
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,460
But it was burned.

659
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:57,570
Ma Wang disappeared that day, and there was no way to restore the royal portrait

660
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:02,400
because your father, Painter Hong, became mentally ill.

661
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,390
 So that is why Father... 

662
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,700
 You must never paint the royal portrait! 

663
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,470
 You must never be a royal portrait painter. 

664
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:15,310
 That is why Headmaster was so against it. 

665
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,170
Now you are the only one who can restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

666
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:26,120
So... the King Yeongjong's royal portrait that I am to restore...

667
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,880
Yes.

668
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,530
Royal Father.

669
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:43,590
That royal portrait is to seal Ma Wang in it.

670
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,370
Ma Wang is near us.

671
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:57,250
What can I assist you with?

672
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,830
Do you know Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy Bureau?

673
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,880
I hear he is an astronomer who is favored by His Majesty.

674
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,960
In Supervisor Ha's

675
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,830
body,

676
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,340
Ma Wang lies dormant.

677
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:46,400


678
00:59:46,400 --> 01:00:00,170
♫  Someday, all things will start again as if nothing had happened &nbsp;♫

679
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:06,870
♫  When that time comes, your love will come  ♫

680
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:13,970
♫   I wait for my love again  ♫

681
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,800
♫  Do not worry so much  ♫

682
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,940
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

683
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,380
 They tell me the royal portrait is to imprison Ma Wang. 

684
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,460
 They say there was a rumor about the painter of the royal portrait falling under Hwacha's curse. 

685
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,410
 Hwacha. He said Hwacha? 

686
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,590
 The painting-crazed goblin? 

687
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,250
 No one can touch my painter. 

688
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,740
 Could I also go mad while painting the royal portrait? 

689
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,310
 I shall cherish and protect you as my own life. 

690
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,780
 Is there no way to drive out Ma Wang from within me? 

691
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,270
 Do not meet Painter Hong again. 

692
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,990
 Maiden Hong, I have a favor to ask of you. 

693
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,000
 A favor? 

694
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:59,500
 If I catch you meeting her again, I shall never forgive you. 

695
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,600
♫  When that time comes, your love will come  ♫

696
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,600
