 Lovers of the Red Sky

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,440
 Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,250
 Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,360
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,600
 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,930
Is your wrist all right?

7
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,320
I think I can paint.

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,070
Let us begin.

9
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,050
Will Supervisor Ha come? 
  

10
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,780
He will. The scholar will definitely come.

11
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,890
And if he comes?

12
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,320
She almost died last time.

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,830
Do you really think nothing will happen today?

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,260
Supervisor Ha is being unfair.

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,330
Did he have to disappear like this when we're going through this ruckus secretly again

16
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,040
without the court officials knowing what we're doing?

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,900
I wish we could stop painting the royal portrait already.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,900
You really... how can you speak like that?

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,200
Stop. That is enough!

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,260
If we cannot seal Ma Wang today,

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,310
the scholar becomes one with Ma Wang.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,330
I believe that the scholar would know how I feel.

23
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,330
 So, he will come. 

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,220
 He will definitely come. 

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,950
There is no use in sealing me.

26
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,110
Are you afraid that you will be confined again?

27
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,080
I have taken over your body almost completely,

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
human with the power of water.

29
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,950
 Episode 16: Lovers of the Red Sky 

30
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,350
Your Highness.

31
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,540
Tonight's sealing ritual has to succeed at all costs.

32
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,420
If we lose our chance again this time,

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,930
no one will be able to stop Ma Wang's rampage.

34
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,540
What will you do if Supervisor Ha does not come?

35
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,380
He will definitely come.

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,110
So, prepare yourselves.

37
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,120
How can you be so certain?

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,830
Supervisor Ha has the predecessor king's ring.

39
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,690
The ring has already been broken.

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,130
He broke it himself, so he definitely will come.

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,220
Give it to me.

42
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,050
Done.

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,010
No need.

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,370
Keep going.

45
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,200
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,790
Has the scholar come?

47
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,880
Not yet.

48
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,900
But he will be here soon.

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,330
You must complete the painting within the next four hours, when the full red moon will reach its zenith.

50
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,130
Yes, Your Highness.

51
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,300
Seal the door until the royal portrait is finished, to prevent evil auras from entering.

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,940
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,500
Sa ra sa ra baya hara.

54
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,130
Gara hum ba ta.

55
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,160
Sa ra sa ra baya hara.

56
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,170
Now then, let us start the coloring inside the outline.

57
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,960
Yes.

58
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,280
Careful.

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,100
Wow. So this is the deal with Hwacha.

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,710
So unbelievably fast.

61
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,720
I cannot believe it, even if I see it with my own eyes.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,620
Hold this for me.

63
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,710
What happens if Ma Wang does not come and the sealing ritual cannot take place?

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,210
Tonight the fifth planet from the sun enters the moon.

65
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,430
If they miss the night of the full red moon,

66
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,050
they will have to wait another thousand years.

67
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,430
Ma Wang must be sealed tonight.

68
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,400
I am worried because Ha got rid of the ring of moderation.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Ma Wang will certainly come to find his eyes.

70
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,920
Right.

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,650
He cannot stay away, for he has to regain the demon eyes.

72
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,660
Do not stop me tonight.

73
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,420
Even if you suppress Ma Wang with your powers,

74
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,230
the fight will continue endlessly.

75
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,190
Therefore, sealing is the only answer.

76
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,920
Now everything is up to that child who will make the divine vessel.

77
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,110
Supervisor Ha is here.

78
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,370
- Can we start the sealing ritual now?
 - He's here.

79
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,790
Be quiet and guard your posts.

80
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,810
Get ready.

81
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,000
 You came. 

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,690
 It is good that you came, Ha Ram. 

83
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,300
 I am glad, truly. 

84
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,990
We must finish the painting faster.

85
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,990
Let's hurry.

86
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,730
Supervisor Ha, you are here.

87
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,400
Your Highness.

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,940
Thank you. Take your place.

89
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,700
 Hurry and kill me. 

90
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,750
Are you all right?

91
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,390
Supervisor Ha.

92
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,120
That man is not Supervisor Ha.

93
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,320
It is Ma Wang!

94
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,780
 My eyes. 

95
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,440
It is the building where Painter Hong is.

96
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,200
What is happening?

97
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,730
What do you think?

98
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,400
- That Ma Wang or something— 
 - Do not pay attention to what happens outside.

99
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,790
Focus.

100
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,330
We must finish the painting.

101
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,600
No one can enter here!

102
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,500
He sa ba yahal dan...

103
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,120
sa bara jiya bara...

104
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,780
nam san dan...

105
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,700
bara-

106
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,770
Hurry, pick up your paintbrush again.

107
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,020
Found you.

108
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,400
My eyes.

109
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,400
I can't see.

110
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,440
I can't...

111
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,810
Ha Ram.

112
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,300
Ha Ram.

113
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,920
Ha Ram.

114
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,750
Ha Ram.

115
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,590
Ha Ram.

116
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,240
 We shall deal with Ma Wang. You must complete the royal portrait. 

117
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,290
Father ...

118
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,230
 Grandma Samshin. 

119
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,910
I shall deal with you now.

120
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Giri ha bara sa...

121
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,080
Giri ha bara sa...

122
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,810
Jeonya bara...

123
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,870
Giri ha bara sa...

124
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,900
 How foolish. 

125
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,750
Giri ha bara sa...

126
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,410
Giri ha bara sa...

127
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,630
Giri ha bara sa...

128
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,870
Giri ha bara sa...

129
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,750
Giri ha bara sa...

130
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,500
Giri ha bara sa...

131
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,670
Father ...

132
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,540
It is all over now.

133
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,640
Painter Hong, are you all right?

134
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,470
Your Highness?

135
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,740
I cannot see.

136
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,150
What are we to do now?

137
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,660
What do you mean?

138
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,610
It is not over yet.

139
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,890
If you finish the royal portrait, Ma Wang can be sealed.

140
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,950
 Is this man Hwacha? 

141
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,770
Hurry, divine painter.

142
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,340
Ma Wang will be back.

143
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,660
How can she paint if she cannot even see?

144
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,750
I must complete it somehow.

145
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,230
Your Highness, hand me the paintbrush.

146
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,000
- Painter Hong.
 - Hurry!

147
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,050
I must finish the eyes and the wrinkles on the face.

148
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,310
Your Highness.

149
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,580
Here.

150
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,340
He is whole now that he has regained his eyes.

151
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,270
Be careful!

152
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,810
This is the king's palace.

153
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,490
We can still win.

154
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,080
Samshin. Ho Ryeong.

155
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,360
You are all finished now.

156
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,070
Painter Hong, are you all right?

157
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,600
 Father. 

158
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
 Please help me, Father. 

159
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
Father ...

160
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,180
 Cheon Gi. 

161
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,200
 My daughter. 

162
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,580
- Father.
 - Yes.

163
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,150
Father.

164
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,400
I cannot see.

165
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,880
I must complete the royal portrait.

166
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,570
Everything is up to me.

167
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,010
But I cannot see.

168
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,880
Do not worry, my daughter, Cheon Gi.

169
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,270
Trust your father.

170
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,700
 The last eye is all yours. 

171
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,090
It is complete now.

172
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,410
Is that true, Father?

173
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,810
I am so proud of you, my daughter.

174
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,340
Now,

175
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,200
I must get going.

176
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,110
Father.

177
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,880
Thank you, Father.

178
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,750
Thank you.

179
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,640
I am so sorry

180
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,510
that I could not do anything for you while I was alive.

181
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,910
Father.

182
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:14,800
Om ma muk hwa sal sadama shidae um...

183
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,910
 That light... 

184
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,030
 Could it be... 

185
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,220
The royal portrait has been completed.

186
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,530
Ma Wang will be back.

187
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,700
Hurry and prepare the sealing ritual.

188
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,780
I will.

189
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,300
Help me, all of you.

190
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,880
We must stand the royal portrait upright.

191
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,510
Painter Hong, here. You must gather strength.

193
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,220
Hold on.

194
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,780
 Ma Wang. 

195
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,970
 I shall seal you if my life depends on it. 

196
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,510
Bara ha bara...

197
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,150
 It must end now. 

198
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,130
 No. You must not. 

199
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,770
 No! 

200
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,880
 Good work, Cheon Gi. 

201
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,900
 Now, the fate of the two people will be joined. 

202
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,540
Samshin.

203
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,640
How could she go like this?

204
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,350
 Your Majesty. 

205
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,180
 It is all finished now. 

206
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,750
 Royal Shaman. 

207
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,570
 You have fulfilled your duties. 

208
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,790
 Rest in peace. 

209
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,780
Everything has ended now.

210
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,050
Is that true, Your Highness?

211
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,650
Yes.

212
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,210
I still cannot believe it myself.

213
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,740
Are your eyes all right?

214
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,690
The scholar.

215
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,490
Where is the scholar?

216
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,730
Ha Ram. Ha Ram.

217
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,090
Ha Ram.

218
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,370
Painter Hong.

219
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,120
Lean on me.

220
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,170
What...

221
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,170
Cheon Gi.

222
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,290
Hong Cheon Gi.

223
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,680
- Hong Cheon Gi.
 - Scholar Sir.

224
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,000
Scholar Sir.

225
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,980
Maiden.

226
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,600
Maiden.

227
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,750
Scholar Sir.

228
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,310
Scholar Sir!

229
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,140
- Mai— 
 - Scholar—

230
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,530
Maiden.

231
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,340
Maiden.

232
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,010
Scholar Sir.

233
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,090
Yes, it's me.

234
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,150
Aren't you hurt?

235
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,310
Are you all right?

236
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,560
Your eyes...

237
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,700
What happened to your eyes?

238
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,870
Can you see me?

239
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,170
Can you truly see?

240
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,590
I can.

241
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,720
I...

242
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,000
see you clearly.

243
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,420
I am glad.

244
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,860
I am so glad.

245
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,870
I am glad.

246
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,750
But were your eyes... taken by Ma Wang?

247
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,320
Yes.

248
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:24,330
Now I cannot see, just like when we first met.

249
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,870
What should we do?

250
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,450
You are responsible for me now.

251
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,160
I shall be responsible for you my whole life.

252
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,650
Scholar Sir.

253
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,110
Are you crying?

254
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,690
It is all right.

255
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:25,340
Now, everything has found its place.

256
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,770
 Back to where it was originally. 

257
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:51,400
♫  Whichever way the wind blows  ♫

258
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,110
♫  Wherever my footsteps lead me  ♫

259
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,900
♫  I can walk without a moment's rest  ♫

260
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,520
♫  Just stay wherever you are  ♫

261
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:21,690
♫  Is it me who lives in your heart?  ♫

262
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:28,750
♫  The one person you long for endlessly?  ♫

263
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:36,610
♫  Even if you say it's not so or you hate me  ♫

264
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:44,030
♫  I'll stay at your side like destiny  ♫

265
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,980
 Five years later, the 34th year of King Seongjo's reign 

266
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,410
- Headmaster.
 - Come now.

267
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,710
I mean, haven't you forgotten something?

268
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,200
Why are you like this?

269
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,300
You really are putting on a good show from the morning.

270
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,400
Uncle Chun Bok, you're up early.

271
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,070
Yes. Today is Cheon Gi's birthday.

272
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,070
Oh, right! Goodness, where is my mind?

273
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,760
That means it is also Son-in-Law Ha's birthday.

274
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,840
You forgot his gift again?

275
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,370
I should at least gift-wrap some ginger tea that he likes.

276
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,100
Goodness. Hurry up, Wife.

277
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,670
I will, Husband.

278
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,070
I see you have woken up early to visit Cheon Gi.

279
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,700
But why are you dressed in your taskmaster uniform?

280
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,460
Oh, Obnoxious One doesn't know that Annoying One has become a taskmaster yet.

281
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,120
How can he resist showing off?

282
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,670
Hey.

283
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,520
Well then. Let's go.

284
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,370
Is the crown prince going with you?

285
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,080
No, His Highness has probably left already.

286
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,080
I keep telling you not to follow me.

287
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,740
Still, I must guard the crown pri—

288
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,990
- Quiet!-
 - You—

289
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,750
Well.

290
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,920
Keep your mouth shut.

291
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,990
Be quiet, I said.

292
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,530
Yes.

293
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,610
I shall be back safely.

294
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,720
Goodness, I apologize.

295
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,090
Be careful, Wife.

296
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,310
Headmaster, one moment.

297
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,920
All right.

298
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,580
What is it, this early in the morning?

299
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,280
I hear you are on your way to see Painter Hong.

300
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,710
The weather is quite ...

301
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,880
No.

302
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,110
We are only heading out to visit our families.

303
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,460
Is that so?

304
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,190
If anyone is looking for this, give it to that person.

305
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,330
What is this?

306
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,800
Is this not Obnoxious One's sketchbook?

307
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
I picked it up in the atelier a while back.

308
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,040
I kept it since the sketches were so good.

309
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,070
But now, it seems it must be returned to its owner.

310
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,180
One moment.

311
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,300
Won't you return to the Painting Bureau?

312
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,760
I was born a street painter, so I must wander following the clouds and water.

313
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,370
I cannot live in such a suffocating place.

314
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,440
Well then. Be well, everyone.

315
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,850
There is no time. Let us leave.

316
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,990
- The next boat?
 - It will come in four hours.

317
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,600
You are certain they are leaving to meet Hong Cheon Gi?

318
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,880
I shall definitely catch that wench this time.

319
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,080
 Royal Investigations Bureau 

320
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,540
Is this truly what Royal Father wishes?

321
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,260
Your Highness!

322
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,640
I am all right.

323
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,390
You must hold on just a bit longer.

324
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,400
Tonight, is it?

325
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,440
Yes.

326
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,480
Our people are already spread throughout the Royal Investigations Bureau.

327
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,580
This time,

328
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,300
I shall make them pay even for their crimes from that day five years ago.

329
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,830
I shall... stake my life on it.

330
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,910
So, the two disappeared.
    

331
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,800
You mean that Painter Hong lost her sight again?

332
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,490
Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

333
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,320
She lost her sight after she finished the royal portrait.

334
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,750
So where have Painter Hong and Supervisor Ha gone to now?

335
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,220
That I do not know. Or whether they are dead or alive.

336
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,430
But is it not shocking that the evil thing called Ma Wang or something

337
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,600
has existed since the predecessor king's reign?

338
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,220
How absurd...

339
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,540
You do not believe me?

340
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,320
Ehh— no way...

341
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:41,190
But where is the royal portrait with Ma Wang sealed in it?

342
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,010
That royal portrait

343
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,510
 was taken by Hwacha, who bargained with Painter Hong. 

344
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,130
 - Hwacha?
 - Yes. 

345
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,750
 The goblin who likes paintings. 

346
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,990
 Painting of a divine painter. 

347
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,070
It is known that if he absorbs the aura of a thousand divine paintings,

348
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,320
he will become Hwaseon.*
  (God of painting) 

349
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,490
Then, what happens if he absorbs the royal portrait with Ma Wang sealed in it?

350
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,430
The royal portrait where Ma Wang is sealed ...

351
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,300
I did not think that far.

352
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,720
Humans ...

353
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,800
They are still talking about this after all this time?

354
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,570
Anyhow, I wonder if that Ha and that child are doing well.

355
00:38:53,370 --> 00:39:00,120
♫  Do you see it? My feeling for you  ♫

356
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,680
♫  Like destiny always cannot leave your side  ♫

357
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,860
♫  On a day still like this, can you hug me?  ♫

358
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,590
♫  I am waiting again just for you  ♫

359
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,980
♫  I am you and you are me.  ♫

360
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:39,960
♫  I love you. I love you. Only one person.  ♫

361
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,910
♫  I hope we don't pass each other like the passing wind.  ♫

362
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:53,150
♫  I am here.  ♫

363
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,530
Mother.

364
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,650
- Father.
 - Young Master, do not run!

365
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,300
Ha Jung, I told you not to run.

366
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,880
Ha Jung. You must listen to your mother.

367
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,730
I will.

368
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,320
He has grown up so much.

369
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,790
Supervisor Ha.

370
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,970
Painter Hong.

371
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,160
- Welcome.
 - Have you been well?

372
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,110
Yes. Have you both been well?

373
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,060
Together, you two look like a picture.

374
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,930
How adorable.

375
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,740
You must be busy overseeing our country.

376
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,680
Why did you come so far?

377
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,950
The busier one is, the more time one must take.

378
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,100
I must get out like this and get some air.

379
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,940
I also get to see how things are going in the real world.

380
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,540
You have not changed one bit.

381
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,140
Come now ...

382
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,050
They say that if a person suddenly changes, it means they're about to die.

383
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,470
Why did you bring so much?

384
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,520
It is nothing.

385
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,210
It is your birthdays.

386
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,540
Let us go inside.

387
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,620
- All right.
 - I will take them.

388
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,890
- Please follow us.
 - Let us go.

389
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,740
Let us go.

390
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,330
Father, I'm sleepy.

391
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,000
Let us go inside and sleep, Ha Jung.

392
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,380
Is it here?

393
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,900
I am honored that you came all the way here to visit us.

394
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,890
You think I am here because it is your birthday?

395
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,850
I am here for Supervisor Ha's birthday.

396
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,720
They are the same.

397
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,950
Yes. That is true.

398
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,950
You two were born on the same day, after all.

399
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,290
Can you see well now?

400
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,680
Yes. I can see very well.

401
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,700
So well that I still cannot believe it.

402
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,380
It is a truly incredible miracle.

403
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,400
I would not have believed it if I did not witness it.

404
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,690
Every time I think of that day, it still feels like a dream.

405
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,910
What could have happened that day?

406
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,520
 Now, the fate of the two people will be joined. 

407
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,210
 Everything will find its rightful place. 

408
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:46,360
 Your descendants will never paint again! 

409
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:57,880
 Child, Ma Wang's curse has been broken. 

410
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,340
How has Your Royal Highness been?

411
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,100
Well. I have kept myself busy.

412
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,990
I attend Sigangwon 
 (Office of Royal Lectures, in charge of the crown prince's education) .

413
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,650
With Royal Father bedridden, I manage the government affairs at the court, too.

414
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,910
Time goes by so quickly.

415
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,260
Yes.

416
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,160
Is Supervisor Ha good to you?

417
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,830
He is wonderful.

418
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,490
He is constant and affectionate.

419
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,080
That was a pointless question.

420
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,810
I should rather have checked Supervisor Ha's wellbeing.

421
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,680
Your Royal Highness.

422
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,210
My Lady, the wind is cold. Please hurry inside.

423
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,670
Yes, My Lord.

424
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,300
Come inside, Your Royal Highness.

425
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,600
I will.

426
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,990
Well, well.

427
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,680
So she knew how to make a face like that?

428
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,280
I am glad to see you two so happy.

429
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,260
Have you been well?

430
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,070
Yes.

431
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:33,300
I am so busy taking care of state affairs in place of Royal Father.

432
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,210
Seeing you are so busy, it seems you are doing well. I am relieved.

433
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,660
How could you call this doing well?

434
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,370
I think I can only do well if you return.

435
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,390
Forgive me.

436
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,530
Is Grand Prince Juhyang...

437
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,850
Hyeong-nim is still in the stone cell of the Royal Investigations Bureau.

438
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,620
The one where you once stayed.

439
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,390
The stone cell would mean...

440
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,050
that it would be difficult for him to get released.

441
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,690
What took you so long?

442
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,760
I was putting away the gifts that His Highness had brought us.

443
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,590
Have you missed me already?

444
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,670
Enough of that.

445
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,840
- Forgive us.
 - Forgive us.

446
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,030
What is this?

447
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,860
It is a small present for you two.

448
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,120
Your Royal Highness, is this not the hard-to-find Hwacho rock inkstone  (inkstone with naturally occurring flower-plant shapes) ?

449
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,680
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

450
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,200
Isn't this a royal edict bestowing posthumous titles?

451
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,940
Yes.

452
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:18,350
Royal Father commanded that the deceased Lord Ha Seong Jin's honor be restored.

453
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:22,580
Supervisor Ha, sit facing the north. 
 (toward the king's palace) .

454
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:31,200
"Edict.  The late Ha Seong Jin, former Head Taoist of the Taoist Bureau, an official of the junior fifth rank,

455
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,140
shall be bestowed with the posthumous title of Minister of Personnel, of senior second rank."

456
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,370
Your royal grace is infinite.

457
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,630
Now, your descendants will have no problem

458
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:49,480
taking the state exam or applying for highly regarded and powerful government positions.

459
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,300
Now then.

460
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,160
Sit comfortably.

461
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,800
Your Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.

462
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,090
I am truly grateful.  Your grace has no limit.

463
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,510
Your grace has no limit, Your Royal Highness.

464
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,980
I wish you two happy birthday with all my heart.

465
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:34,310
It was with a smile just like this one that you sent us off, on the night when we ran away

466
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,430
in secret after the sealing ritual.

467
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,960
Your Highness will become a truly wise ruler.

468
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,320
Your Royal Highness, please hold the people of this nation dear to your heart

469
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,100
just as you are showing kindness to us now.

470
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,120
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

471
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,620
It has already been five years since we left the capital.

472
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,700
We are grateful enough that you come to see us,

473
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,270
but you even reinstated our title.

474
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,310
We do not know how to repay you.

475
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,420
Be happy.

476
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,500
That is all I ask.

477
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,160
Sir, madam.

478
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,910
Guests from Baegyu Painting Institute are here.

479
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,280
Baegyu Painting Institute?

480
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,610
I said I would carry it.

481
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,230
Hey, you said it was heavy.

482
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,640
Headmaster!

483
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,700
Cheon Gi!

484
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,880
Headmaster.

485
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,080
Have you been well? Why have you grown so thin?

486
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,990
She looks perfectly healthy.

487
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,020
Hey! How have you been?

488
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,280
Long Face!

489
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,500
Well, she really didn't change, after all this time.

490
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,370
Hey, what is this outfit?

491
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,500
Have you become a taskmaster?

492
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,430
It is old news.

493
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,180
It was the day before yesterday.

494
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,550
Watch your mouth.

495
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,840
- Welcome.
 - Oh, Son-in-Law Ha.

496
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,530
Your Royal Highness!

497
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,500
No need.

498
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,930
Speak with ease.

499
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,410
Your Royal Highness Crown Prince!

500
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,580
What are you all doing here?

501
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,340
We realize it is disrespectful, but we have urgent news.

502
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,370
All right.

503
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,000
It is nothing.

504
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,800
The palace is not running smoothly as I am not there.

505
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,390
I must be going.

506
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,910
- So suddenly?
 - All right, Your Highness.

507
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,150
You must hurry back to the palace.

508
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,740
Be well.

509
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,510
 You have both suffered for a long time. 

510
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,240
 Only be happy from now on. 

511
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,850
 Goodbye. 

512
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,640
My Lady.

513
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,900
You had a long day.

514
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,860
It was nothing.

515
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,980
But do you think His Royal Highness is all right?

516
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,380
He looked a bit downcast.

517
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,480
You don't think something happened again, right?

518
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,860
Probably not.

519
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,620
The second star in the Jami constellation* has lost its light,
  (that represents the royal family) 

520
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,230
so it will be all right.

521
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:23,300
 Please be safe, Your Highness. 

522
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,590
My Lady.

523
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,790
I have prepared a special birthday present.

524
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,660
What? A present?

525
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,060
Wait one moment.

526
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,170
Get on.
 ♫  I had prayed desperately  ♫

527
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,580
♫  on the day we wandered in the darkness  ♫

528
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:14,060
♫  covered by clouds that moonlight shines brightly on us  ♫

529
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:21,860
♫  Our love which hurts and hurt and and our love was so ardent  ♫

530
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,460
♫  won't let go anymore.  ♫

531
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,410
♫  I will protect you by your side.  ♫

532
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,640
♫  The world is filled with the fragrance.  ♫

533
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,300
♫  of one person who is you.  ♫

534
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,030
♫  Deep in my heart  ♫

535
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:48,200
♫  of one person who is you  ♫

536
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,210
Isn't this a peach tree orchard?

537
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,280
Why suddenly here?

538
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,800
I apologize for being late.

539
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,410
It is not the peach from back then,

540
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,270
but I wanted to keep the promise, no matter what.

541
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,240
Thank you.

542
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,270
One moment.

543
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,930
What is this?

544
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,300
Nothing is free in this world.

545
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,400
It is a birthday present that I prepared for you, My Lord.

546
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,160
This is...

547
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,470
the old me?

548
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,640
Yes.

549
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,240
You didn't even smile much back then.

550
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,970
Thank you. I shall treasure it.

551
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,850
Would you stay by my side for the rest of our lives and paint my portraits?

552
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,990
For free?

553
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:40,210
♫  Am I it?  The person who lives in your heart.  ♫

554
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:47,310
This is my payment for the painting.
♫  The one person you long for endlessly  ♫

555
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:55,400
♫  Even if you say it's not so or you hate me  ♫

556
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:03,620
♫  I'll stay at your side like fate  ♫

557
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:12,720
♫  Even any day under the sun all day  ♫

558
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,570
 Live  happily ever after. 
♫  Since my eyes have never been blinded by anyone but you   ♫

559
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:27,060
 You two were meant to be together from the beginning. 
♫  No matter what, I don't think I can live without you  ♫

560
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:36,240
♫  No matter what day I'm living, I long for you continuously  ♫

561
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,820
♫  Am I it?  The person who lives in your heart.  ♫

562
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,420
What rascals are there?

563
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,630
You two!

564
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,880
Run, My Lady!

565
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,110
Yes, My Lord!

566
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,150
Aigoo, you two!

567
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,090
Stop right there!

568
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:06,260
♫  I'll stay at your side like fate  ♫

569
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:12,910
♫  Although I'm still slow and overwhelmed  ♫

570
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:20,030
♫  I can't live even for a day without crying  ♫

571
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:26,200
♫  I will not regret giving you the rest of my life  ♫

572
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

573
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,900
 (Loose Ends) 
 - Where is this?

574
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,530
Are you sure this is where Hong Cheon Gi lives?

575
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,270
It doesn't seem right, Hyeong-nim.

576
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,730
It doesn't look like anyone lives here, Hyeong-nim.

577
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,200
You.

578
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,800
Do your job properly!

579
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,960
Seriously, how long will you go on like this?

580
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,730
We must stop this and find something new in life.

581
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,430
You little...

582
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,060
Do you all want to become fish food?

583
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,180
Find Hong Cheon Gi.

584
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,550
Go find Hong Cheon Gi!

585
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,570
Find Hong Cheon Gi!

586
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:03,660
Hong Cheon Gi!

587
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,600
Blast it.

588
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,820
Where are you going? Take me with you.

589
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,210
Let us go to Eunjungjeon.

590
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,030
I must meet Yul.

591
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,170
Yes, Your Highness!

592
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,720
Are you certain Hyeong-nim started a coup de d'etat?

593
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,870
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

594
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,510
Grand Prince Juhyang's soldiers have taken over Jeonganjeon and are headed to Eunjungjeon.

595
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:57,030
Position the soldiers to the east and west gates of the royal palace

596
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,670
and the royal guards shall head to Eunjungjeon.

597
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,580
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

598
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,300
Hyeong-nim.

599
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:16,400
The old saying goes that brothers are like a person's hands and feet.

600
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:23,180
So if they start acting separately, how can they coordinate again?

601
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,110
Do not worry.

602
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,990
We may be brothers of the same blood now,

603
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,310
but the moment I rise to the throne,

604
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,660
we shall be king and subject.

605
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,650
Little Brother.

606
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,200
That seat...

607
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,080
belonged to me from the beginning.

608
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,280
- Attack!
 - Attack!
