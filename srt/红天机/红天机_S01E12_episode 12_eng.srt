 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,010
Give me your hand.

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,420
What do you mean?

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,950
We must not touch—

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,300
Let's confirm this fate.

11
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,460
 I can see. 

12
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,160
 I can see! 

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,150
Scholar Sir.

14
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,900
Maiden?

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Are you all right?

16
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,570
Is it really... you?

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Can you... see me?

18
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,750
I can.

19
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,780
I can...

20
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,580
see you.

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,090
How is this possible...

22
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,140
Scholar Sir!

23
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,730
Who are you?

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,620
Ma Wang?

25
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,690
 Is this the power of a divine being? 

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,980
 Those are my eyes. 

27
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,290
Scholar Sir!

28
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,190
Scholar Sir!

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,530
What are you doing?!

30
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,220
Stop, stop it!

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,600
You must escape...

32
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,880
Scholar Sir!

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,190
 Maiden! 

34
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,300
 Maiden! 

35
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,350
 - No.
- Scholar Sir! 

36
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,740
 - No!
- Scholar Sir! 

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,400
 My eyes. 

38
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,000
 My eyes. 

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,480
Ha Ram! Ha Ram!

40
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,180
Ha Ram!

41
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,190
Ha Ram!

42
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,210
Ha Ram, Ha Ram!

43
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,330
Ha Ram!

44
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,530
What's going on?

45
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,740
What has happened to Supervisor Ha?

46
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,230
- Ha Ram!
- You must leave for now.

47
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,760
No, Ma Wang is in there!

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Your Highness, it is dangerous to leave him like this.

49
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,980
Let go of me!

50
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,880
Ha Ram, wake up! Ha Ram!

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,100
- Will you keep acting up? 
 - Your Highness.

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,290
Please save Ha Ram somehow.

53
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,200
I beg you. I will do anything.

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,100
Please, save him.

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,840
Is anyone there?

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,320
Ha Ram.

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,700
Call a physician immediately.

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,240
An important prisoner has collapsed.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,760
Yes, Your Highness.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,210
It is dangerous for you to be here.

61
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,470
- Let us get out.
 - No!

62
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,180
Ma Wang is in there. Ma Wang is there.

63
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,900
It is dangerous to leave him there like that.

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,360
The Scholar is in danger.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,500
At least let me see him wake—

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,290
There is no use doing this.

67
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,690
Do you not understand?

68
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,210
Then what should I do?

69
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,910
What do I do?

70
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,410
What do I do?

71
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,320
Do we only watch until I finish the royal portrait?

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,710
Your Highness...

73
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,760
Let us get out of here first.

74
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,480
Om je sae je ya me ta na ta om...

75
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,740
Om je sae je ya me ta na ta om...

76
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,360
Om je sae je ya me ta na ta om...

77
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:01,260
Om je sae je ya me ta na ta om...

78
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,810
That ring has the power to protect the will of the heart

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,820
even when you are possessed by Ma Wang.

80
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,780
It is made of the bones

81
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,300
of the god of balance, whom Ma Wang swallowed.

82
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
Before the sealing ritual,

83
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,830
that ring will be the only thing  which can oppose Ma Wang.

84
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,860
 Episode 12: Fight to the Death 

85
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,170
Are you saying Supervisor Ha collapsed?

86
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,010
The physicians were sent to examine his pulse.

88
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,960
And?

89
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,410
There was nothing wrong physically.

90
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,400
They said he would wake up soon.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,110
 Is Ma Wang trying to wake before the sealing ritual? 

92
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,530
Supervisor Ha collapsed in prison?

93
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,850
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,730
What do you make of this?

95
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,690
There must have been signs of Ma Wang's manifestation again.

96
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,010
Is that possible in prison?

97
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,730
But I hear when Supervisor Ha collapsed,

98
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,420
Grand Prince Yangmyeong was by his side.

99
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,230
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

100
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,000
Supervisor Ha collapsed after meeting Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,580
Did Yul try to drag out Ma Wang?

102
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,910
The sealing ritual is soon, so that is unlikely.

103
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,600
Yet, there has to be a reason the manifestation has become frequent.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,460
We must get Supervisor Ha out somehow.

105
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,720
When day breaks, I shall go see Royal Father.

106
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,680
I must beg him myself for Supervisor Ha's release.

107
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,460
Drink it.

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,980
It will calm you down.

109
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,220
I must hurry to redraw the royal portrait.

110
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,190
You...

111
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,530
must be afraid.

112
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,160
What is the reason?

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,030
I have no choice but to tell you to paint,

114
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,890
but what is the reason that you came back to paint

115
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,510
even when you knew you could become mad like your father?

116
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,530
Because...

117
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,980
I love the Scholar.

118
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,360
I would rather be locked up in that rock cell in his place.

119
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,440
Do you love him that much?

120
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,910
That you would be locked up in his place?

121
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,310
It is all my fault.

122
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,660
I should not have been greedy.

123
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,940
Earlier in the cell, I saw Ma Wang inside the Scholar.

124
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
How did you see him?

125
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,520
I do not know how, but

126
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,760
I saw him with my own two eyes.

127
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,960
How terrified and fearful he must be alone.

128
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,140
Come now.

129
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,180
Have some tea.

130
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,460
It is still warm.

131
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,120
Your Highness, please help the Scholar.

132
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,400
How pitiful, foolish and hopeless...

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,200
Supervisor Ha and you both are so.

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,690
You, who would paint the royal portrait knowing you could become mad.

135
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,030
Supervisor Ha, refusing the sealing ritual, knowing he could be swallowed by Ma Wang.

136
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,960
You two are the same.

137
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,250
What madness is all of this?

138
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,490
What in the world could Ma Wang be

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,860
that I have no choice but to ask you to undertake this dangerous task.

140
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,700
I am sorry.

141
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,990
I am truly sorry.

142
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,580
 It is the one and only jade ring that my father gave to my mother when he was alive. 

143
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,970
 I cherish you deeply. 

144
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,980
I must get rid of it.

145
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,060
Even for a little while.

146
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,530
 Do you dare to attempt to paint me? 

147
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,180
 Come... 

148
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,240
 Come closer. 

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
 Come to me. 

150
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,280
 Ha Ram, I saw it. 

151
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,760
 I finally saw it. 

152
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,780
No. No.

153
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,570
No!

154
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,860
Maiden.

155
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,670
Maiden?

156
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,570
Maiden? Maiden?

157
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,300
 You must escape... 

158
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,860
 - Scholar Sir!
- No! 

159
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,380
 Those are my eyes! 

160
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,990
 Cheon Gi is in danger. 

161
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,790
 Baegyu Painting Institute 

162
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Headmaster, we will be going.

163
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,080
The thing is... as you both know—

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,340
Where is Cheon Gi?

165
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,850
Royal Father, why have you summoned me so early in the morning?

166
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,850
I heard the news about Supervisor Ha last night.

167
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,700
Has he regained consciousness?

168
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes. Thankfully, I hear he has woken up this morning.

169
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,540
That is a relief.

170
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,510
Royal Father, what happens to Supervisor Ha...

171
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,360
once the sealing ritual ends safely?

172
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,090
After the sealing ritual,

173
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,320
- Supervisor Ha will be free.
 - Then...

174
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,260
what happens to the painter... who finishes the royal portrait?

175
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,910
The fate of the painter is up to the heavens.

176
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,800
The father of the divine painter could not escape the curse, either.

177
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,330
Yet, painting a divine painting to seal Ma Wang for the good of all the people

178
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,120
is the painter's divine fate bestowed by the heavens.

179
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,170
Then, aren't we asking the painter to undertake too cruel a task?

180
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,390
Yul.

181
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,430
Do you remember?

182
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,890
The day of the fire at Gyeongwonjeon.

183
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:51,930
 I was curious why there were parts of it unburned. 

184
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,660
Now I finally understand.

185
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,570
The surviving parts of the painting were its will.

186
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:07,780
So, the divine painter's fate will also be decided by the painting.

187
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,800
Move aside.

188
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,590
Grand Prince Yangmyeong is inside now.

189
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,100
What? Yul?

190
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,370
Yul.

191
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,310
I know you are aware of the petition from the Confucian scholars of Seonggyungwan.

192
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,280
The petition is to appoint a new crown prince

193
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:42,270
as the crown prince's illness shows no sign of improvement.

194
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,800
But Royal Father, you must not give up hope for the crown prince.

195
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
No.

196
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,500
The Confucian scholars are not wrong.

197
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,110
I'm the one who has regrets as a father.

198
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,240
Regrets of not being able to abandon an ill child.

199
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,860
Royal Father, how could you call it regret?

200
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,930
Forgive me.

201
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:16,590
How could I understand your struggle, since I am merely a son?

202
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,920
No.

203
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,320
Grand Prince Juhyang is outside.

204
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,150
What?

205
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,410
Please wait a moment while I announce to His Majesty.

206
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,120
What are you doing?

207
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,390
- Go ahead and announce it.
- Yes...

208
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,540
- W-wait...
 -  Once the sealing ritual ends, 

209
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,950
I shall appoint you as the Crown Prince.

210
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,130
 Royal Father, please retract your words. 

211
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,990
The second eldest hyeong-nim is perfectly well and strong.

212
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,240
Why would you do this?

213
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,070
Hu is intelligent and strong, but he is not wise.

214
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,720
 Moreover, ever since the fire at Gyeongwonjeon, 

215
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,810
he has been searching for Ma Wang.

216
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:25,720
The Ma Wang that the predecessor king has fought all his life to seal.

217
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,830
 Thus, if Hu sits on the throne, 

218
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,870
 what will happen to this nation and the royal family? 

219
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,520
Yul.

220
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,270
This is my command...

221
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,750
not as your father,

222
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,780
but as this nation's king.

223
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,520
I understand.

224
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,180
Why...

225
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Your Highness, what is the matter?

226
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,660
Since we followed Il Wol Seong's scheme, the king has grown anxious

227
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,650
and chose Yangmyeong as the next crown prince.

228
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,660
If the crown prince cannot fulfill the descent of the line,

229
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,050
the next in line should rightfully be Your Highness, so how...

230
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,230
The king's heart leaned toward Grand Prince Yangmyeong from the moment

231
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,970
he appointed him to oversee the re-creation of the royal portrait.

232
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,000
I will do whatever it takes from now on.

233
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,250
As for Supervisor Ha ...

234
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,600
I will take Ma Wang from him even if I have to slice his stomach open.

235
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,270
Do you understand?

236
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,760
 Yes, Your Highness. 

237
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,130
Let me go! I must tell His Highness something.

238
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,210
- Let me go!
 - What is it?

239
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,040
This man tried to barge in.

240
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,900
Who are you?

241
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,100
I must tell you something regarding Il Wol Seong. 
  Jeong Seon Nae,  deputy manager of the Wolsungdang 

242
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,990
Il Wol Seong?

243
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,210
You bastard!

244
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,770
You crazy scoundrel!

245
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,500
Let us go inside.

246
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,900
Look around you.

247
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,010
- Consider your status as the headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute.
 - Look around?

248
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,180
You think I can look around right now?

249
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,070
Sit.

250
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,060
- Listen, our Cheon Gi— 
 - Is Eun Oh's daughter.

251
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,160
Yet you make her paint the royal portrait?

252
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,220
It is the king's command.

253
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,150
Look. How can a woman draw a royal portrait?

254
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,040
I am not lying.

255
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,840
I am not so bold as to tell such a lie.

256
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,590
Han Geon.

257
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,610
It must be hell for Cheon Gi to draw the royal portrait

258
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,000
as she has only known to draw freely.

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,040
And if she ends up like her father—

260
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,120
Did Cheon Gi see Hwacha?

261
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Are you asking when you already know?

262
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,530
That Cheon Gi could become like her father?

263
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,410
 Do not worry about Supervisor Ha any longer. 

264
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,070
 They say he regained consciousness. 

265
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,630
 I miss you so much, Ha Ram. 

266
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,220
- Come on.
 - What do you want me to say?

267
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,600
You tell her.

268
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,730
What?

269
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,200
H-H-Headmaster...

270
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,930
 Headmaster was asking where you were, and we had to tell him. 

271
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,250
 He should be in Master Han's office now. 

272
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,630
 Geon, let me ask you one thing. 

273
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,420
 Do you wish to see Cheon Gi's last painting before she goes mad, or 

274
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,460
do you wish madness upon the daughter of Hong Eun Oh,

275
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,990
the one painter whom you envied all your life?

276
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,580
 What is it that you really you want? 

277
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,800
I guess you wish to see her last painting.

278
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,150
 No matter if Cheon Gi goes mad or not. 

279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You are just the same as Gan Yun Guk.

280
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,600
You know that Hwacha helps

281
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,400
a divine painter to accomplish the work of their lifetime, only once.

282
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,660
You know she will go mad after she is finished.

283
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,700
Cheon Gi... has an ability we do not possess.

284
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I cannot gain that ability, no matter how much I struggle, or even if I sell my soul.

285
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,000
A deal with Hwacha? We cannot do that even if we wish to.

286
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
So, is she painting the royal portrait knowing all of this?

287
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,840
 Did you tell her? 

288
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,580
 That she will make a deal with Hwacha? 

289
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,310
Does she know that the royal portrait

290
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,700
will be her last painting before she goes mad?

291
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,440
 I will make sure her sacrifice is not wasted. 

292
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,540
That painting will be the ultimate masterpiece

293
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,910
that Cheon Gi can paint and that all other painters dream of—

294
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,790
You evil scoundrel.

295
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:44,500
You have no self-respect as a friend nor as a painter.

296
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Before she is Eun Oh's daughter, she is also mine.

297
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,140
I will not let her go mad like Eun Oh.

298
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,000
 Scholar Sir. 

299
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,180
 Ha Ram! 

300
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,690
 Why does my heart suddenly ache? 

301
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,440
Are you counting the days?

302
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,380
I heard you had woken up. So I came to see you.

303
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,320
I apologize.

304
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,480
Let us talk.

305
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,210
- Head Eunuch!
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,460
Tell the Shamanist Bureau to prepare the Cleansing Ritual

307
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,760
and call Supervisor Ha of Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau.

308
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,450
Supervisor Ha is in prison right now.

309
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,250
Oh, right.

310
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,980
I keep forgetting things recently.

311
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,120
It is all right. You may go.

312
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,930
But, Your Majesty ...

313
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,140
What is it?

314
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,560
Grand Prince Juhyang came by earlier

315
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,220
and heard Your Majesty and Grand Prince Yangmyeong talking, and left at the door.

316
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,050
Hu came by?

317
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:06,380
 That means Hu knows my intention to appoint Yangmyeong as crown prince. 

319
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,720
 If that is so, Juhyang is searching for Ma Wang, 

320
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,370
 so the only place he would go is... 

321
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
 Interrogations Confinement 

322
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,380
Although Painter Hong knows she could go mad if the sealing ritual proceeds,

323
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,350
she is working hard to finish the royal portrait.

324
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,760
Soon, the divine royal portrait will be finished.

325
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,450
Then, the sealing ritual will proceed as planned.

326
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,700
Please do not make Painter Hong's efforts be for naught.

327
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,720
You shouldn't refuse the sealing ritual any longer.

328
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
Don't try to convince me.

329
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,770
No matter how many times you ask, my answer is...

330
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,510
Your Highness, I smell blood.

331
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,430
Please hide for now.

332
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,230
- What do you mean?
 - Your Highness.

333
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,200
All right.

334
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,240
- Open the door.
 - Yes.

335
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,580
- Send everyone away.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

336
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,740
Supervisor Ha.

337
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,160
Grand Prince Juhyang.

338
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,850
I heard it was quite a tense situation.

339
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,280
Still, how could they do this to you?

340
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,050
I shall receive punishment for any crime I have committed.

341
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,730
What crime could you have committed?

342
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,470
You only have a being inside you that you cannot control.

343
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,430
Ma Wang...

344
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,420
The one you asked me about before.

345
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,050
Yes.

346
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,350
Since Yul has started to be interested in it,

347
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,130
he will interrogate you until he finds out.

348
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,420
You will suffer more tomorrow than today,

349
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,650
and more the day after than tomorrow.

350
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,300
What is it that you want?

351
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,990
Hand over...

352
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,300
Ma Wang to me.

353
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,180
Hand over?

354
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,570
What do you mean?

355
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,500
You will be free from Ma Wang if you hand it over to me.

356
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,070
Is it something I can hand over as I wish?

357
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,910
All you have to do is consent.

358
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,570
What will happen...

359
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,720
if I refuse to hand it over to you?

360
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,940
You will suffer like this until the sealing ritual.

361
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,360
Do you know the meaning of 'Death awaits the dog after the hunt'?

362
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,390
A dog that finished its job of hunting the rabbit is bound to be killed after the hunt.

363
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,590
After the sealing ritual, everyone involved will die

364
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,150
or run away.

365
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,190
Is that not so,

366
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,550
Il Wol Seong?

367
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:34,880
How long did you think you could deceive me?

368
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,340
 Il Wol Seong? 

369
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Who is there?

370
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,800
Reveal yourself!

371
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,150
Yul?

372
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,570
Hyeong-nim.

373
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,770
Give me some time to think.

374
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,680
Unfortunately, I am not here to hear your answer today.

375
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,690
Come in.

376
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,300
Your Highness!

377
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,070
Hyeong-nim, what is the meaning of this?

378
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,900
What do you think you are you doing?

379
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,940
Put away your sword this instant.

380
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,390
What is the meaning of this?

381
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,080
Where will you snatch a prisoner of the Royal Investigation Bureau and take him to?

382
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,630
Who is snatching anyone?

383
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:58,950
Why don't you go tattletale to Royal Father?

384
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,060
Hyeong-nim.

385
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,810
Have you forgotten your dignity as a grand prince?

386
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,310
Dignity?

387
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,000
Now that you have a dignity to protect,

388
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,520
does your elder brother seem a fool to you?

389
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,770
How dare you...

390
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,370
as a younger brother...

391
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,740
covet my place...

392
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,280
His Majesty, the king.

393
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,700
Raise your heads, all of you.

394
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,330
What is the reason you are all gathered here?

395
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,880
What is the reason Royal Father keeps Supervisor Ha here

396
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,950
when you know he has done nothing wrong?

397
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,060
What did you say?

398
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,970
I heard Supervisor Ha was arrested as the suspect

399
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,020
of the guards' murder incident at Inwang Mountain.

400
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,420
And?

401
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,730
Is there any proof?

402
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,350
- That is—
 - Do not step in.

403
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,390
I am asking Royal Father right now.

404
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,700
Follow me.

405
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,340
I must speak with Juhyang.

406
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,800
 Royal Investigations Bureau 

407
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,800
Now that everyone is gone, please tell me.

408
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,760
How long will you be this arrogant and impudent?

409
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,240
And Royal Father, how long will you treat me as if I do not exist?

410
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,130
- What did you say?
 - I must finally hear your reasons today.

411
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,030
For commanding Yul to oversee the royal portrait,

412
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,370
for having the royal portrait secretly redone, and...

413
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,190
for choosing Yul as the next crown prince.

414
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:34,240
Don't you know that a member of the royal family must not seek power for private gain?

415
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,470
No matter what it is, what I say is...

416
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,530
the king's command.

417
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,160
Are you saying you will rebel against it now?

418
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,740
I only wanted to hear it from you as your son.

419
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,340
How dare you!

420
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,880
I turned a blind eye even when you killed the former inquisitor who had served the predecessor king!

421
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,770
So did you place the inquisitor, who had served only kings since the time of the predecessor king, by my side

422
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,850
to keep an eye on me, Royal Father?

423
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,630
Was I that untrustworthy to you?

424
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,370
Shut your mouth!

425
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,960
I will exile you temporarily to Jeju.

426
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,170
I cannot stand the sight of you.

427
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,560
Get out this instant!

428
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,760
Royal Father!

429
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,610
What are you waiting for?

430
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,650
Royal Father has collapsed!

431
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,000
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Royal Father!

432
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,990
Royal Father!

433
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,220
Royal Father!

434
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,740
How is Royal Father?

435
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,060
 Heo Yu, Royal Physician 

436
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,930
Tell me.

437
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,460
Yes. In truth, the king has been

438
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,520
suffering from a liver and heart disease for a long time.

439
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,780
There is not much time left until heaven takes his life.

440
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,290
Then...

441
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,690
why did no one know?

442
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:38,180
Since the next crown prince had not been appointed yet,

443
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,300
he commanded us not to tell anyone.

444
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:54,460
You will have to do... what you must do.

445
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,180
Do you understand what I mean?

446
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,300
Yes, Your Highness.

447
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,390
Leave us now.

448
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,250
 Royal Father. 

449
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,830
 You obviated the need for me to become an unfilial son. 

450
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,270
 I shall repay the kindness by being good toward this nation and its people. 

451
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,120
 Grand Prince Yangmyeong is here. 

452
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,840
Royal Father, Royal Father!

453
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,170
Hyeong-nim, what happened?

454
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,290
Royal Father.

455
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,670
 And the kindness of letting me undo your appointment of Yul 

456
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,210
 as the crown prince with my own hands. 

457
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,590
 I will... engrave it in my heart forever. 

458
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,310
 Do not worry, Headmaster. 

459
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,360
 I will never make a deal with Hwacha. 

460
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,790
 At that time, I thought he was a human for sure. 

461
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,140
 I only saw him taking paintings from Eun Oh. 

462
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,700
 But now that I think about it, that man was Hwacha. 

463
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,460
 If one meets Hwacha, does one always end up that way? 

464
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,870
 To us, Hwacha is a being whom we wish to 

465
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:55,080
 both avoid and meet at least once before we die. 

466
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,090
 Painting after making a deal with him 

467
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,220
 will produce the painter's masterpiece of a lifetime. 

468
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,750
 But that painter will either die or go mad. 

469
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,600
 Because while working on that painting, the painter will lose all his energy. 

470
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,980
 Perhaps Eun Oh... 

471
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,880
 wanted to finish the royal portrait that badly. 

472
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,830
 That is the secret behind the title of "divine painter." 

473
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:27,020
 Even if the time comes when I must make a deal, 

474
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,990
 I am not afraid of going mad. 

475
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,770
 As long as I can save Ha Ram. 

476
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:59,010
♫  As if nothing had happened  ♫

477
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,740
♫  Our memories will be erased  ♫

478
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:15,620
♫  Even if you can turn back time like a lie  ♫

479
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:22,010
♫  your heart won't do what I want  ♫

480
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,950
♫  The seasons change  ♫

481
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,710
 Goodness. 

482
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,340
 Even the outlining is almost finished. 

483
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,400
 To get to outlining from the groundwork sketch takes four days at the very least. 

484
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,500
 How could she accomplish it in one day? 

485
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,120
♫  Like a long slumber  ♫

486
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,590
 Did His Majesty finally collapse? 

487
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,180
 Now chaos will reign. 

488
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,980
 Now all I have to do is pass Ma Wang to Grand Prince Juhyang. 

489
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,150
 I can save Cheon Gi. 

490
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,170
Now more than ever, we must manage well.

491
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,320
The two of us.

492
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,540
What will happen to Royal Father?

493
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,770
Get up.

494
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,010
The court officials are waiting for us in court.

495
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,690
I will release Supervisor Ha.

496
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,740
Hyeong-nim.

497
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,870
Is that important, when Royal Father is unconscious?

498
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,400
Yes. It is.

499
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,230
Wasn't Supervisor Ha incarcerated with His Majesty's approval?

500
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,400
Is there any evidence that Supervisor Ha killed the guards?

501
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
Hyeong-nim!

502
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,430
When I asked Royal Father for the evidence,

503
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,370
he did not give me an answer.

504
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,930
But we cannot ask him now.

505
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,210
Since he is unconscious.

506
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,380
Then let Supervisor Ha be

507
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,220
and ask Royal Father when he has woken up.

508
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,960
That is loyalty and filial duty.

509
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,020
Why is the codified law of this country for?

510
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,980
What law says that a man must be presumed guilty

511
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,510
and be locked up without evidence?

512
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,620
Just tell me truthfully.

513
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,580
- Tell you what?
 - Ma Wang.

514
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,910
That's what you're after.

515
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,800
It will swallow you, and furthermore...

516
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,250
swallow this country as well.

517
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,280
Are you... daring to lecture me?

518
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,540
You must change your mind now.

519
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,690
Do you remember what I told you at Maejukheon?

520
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,700
The arrow has already left the bowstring.

521
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,100
 Ma Wang will never be yours. 

522
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,390
 Because I will not fail to seal it. 

523
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,320
As you all know, 
  (Seong Jin Gi, Minister of Personnel) 

524
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,520
His Majesty is unconscious

525
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,850
and the crown prince has been lying sick for quite a while.

526
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:03,010
Then, how would it be for the next in line, Grand Prince Juhyang,

527
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,180
to guide us through this crisis?

528
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,430
You are right.

529
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,530
We cannot leave the throne empty like this.
   

530
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,670
The eldest son, the crown prince is in such a condition.

531
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,120
The next in line is, of course, Grand Prince Juhyang.

532
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,690
What more is there to say?

533
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,020
Now, now. You must all watch your mouths.
 (Sim Jeong Wu, Researcher at the Hall of Worthies) 

534
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,910
No one can tell for certain yet.

535
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,430
No one can tell?

536
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,520
We urgently need a leader who will summon all the civil and military officials

537
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,080
of the court and look after the affairs of the nation.

538
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,940
His Majesty's preference lay with Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

539
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,860
As soon as King Yeongjong's royal portrait is finished,

540
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,780
he wished for Grand Prince Yangmyeong to continue on the royal line, that is what I heard.
 (Lee Hyeon Mo, Section Chief of Ministry of War) 

541
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,790
This was not officially expressed to us.

542
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:53,860
Has anyone here heard of such an intention?

543
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,370
If His Majesty did not hand down his last will,

544
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,020
the one to rightfully follow in His Majesty's footsteps to look after the nation

545
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,200
is Grand Prince Juhyang.

546
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,220
 When two suns rise, 

547
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:54,820
 one of them will lose its radiance and fall into darkness. 

548
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,670
 I have put all of my heart into it. 

549
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:45,280
 Please let it have divine powers. 

550
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,680
I heard the appointment of the next crown prince was discussed at court yesterday.

551
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,100
That is not the problem.

552
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,710
My heart is heavy that Royal Father is not improving.

553
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:06,110
I worry whether the preparations for the sealing ritual will be affected.

554
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,830
- You are here.
 - Yes.

555
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,230
Are you all right?

556
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,740
Yes.

557
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,840
I just finished the outline work on the silk canvas.

558
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,920
I will go rest for a while.

559
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,770
Do so.

560
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,900
Bullseye!

561
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,740
The world is yours now, Your Highness.

562
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,510
Congratulations.

563
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,190
Now, now.

564
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,080
How can you speak with such levity,

565
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,200
when we must wish for Royal Father's recovery?

566
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,370
Do not behave so thoughtlessly until we secure Ma Wang.

567
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,820
 Wounds like these do not heal on their own. 

568
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,500
 You must encounter the being that first gave you this wound. 

569
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,010
Your Highness, the public opinion at court is leaning toward you.

570
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,530
Must you be so hasty to chase after Ma Wang?

571
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,170
You do not know yet...

572
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,510
what Ma Wang means to me.

573
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,560
Where is the royal shaman?

574
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,400
She is preparing to carry out the sealing ritual and is praying at the shrine.

575
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,950
There is something we must do first.

576
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,930
What is it?

577
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,900
We must pull him out.

578
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,340
Tell everyone to leave.

579
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,520
Yes, Your Highness.

580
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,300
You are here.

581
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,200
I have a debt to repay to you.

582
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,320
Yes. Please speak.

583
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,760
Why did you use such a scheme on me?

584
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,790
Was it to pass down the throne to Yangmyeong?

585
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,540
The king's heart leaned to Yangmyeong after I followed your plan.

586
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,500
Didn't I tell you?

587
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,830
That I would help Your Highness grab the ultimate winning card.

588
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,520
 Could he possibly...? 

589
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,100
Then...

590
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,930
are you saying you knew Royal Father would collapse?

591
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,030
I watch the movement of the stars.

592
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,890
The aura of the first star* of the Jami constellation in the Jami Heavenly Enclosure was waning,
 (* represents the king) 

593
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,450
so I already knew that the king's body was unwell.

594
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,210
 When he was in such a condition, I caused him to worry about the crown prince appointment. 

595
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,150
His Majesty, prone to attacks under psychological strain, actually collapsing

596
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,920
 Royal Father! 

597
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,990
 Royal Father! 

598
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,420
was only a matter of time.

599
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,000
 Was all of this really part of Il Wol Seong's plan? 

600
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,510
Your Highness also came here today

601
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,340
to take me away.

602
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,800
Is that not so, Your Highness?

603
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,810
In that case,

604
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,770
I suppose you have prepared yourself?

605
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yes. But ...

606
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,840
I have a favor to ask of you.

607
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,470
What is it?

608
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,580
I shall choose an auspicious date.

609
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,910
 Why is my heart so tight? 

610
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,580
 When even the heaven's will favors His Highness... 

611
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,220
His Majesty collapsed

612
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,000
and they say Grand Prince Juhyang was chosen as the next crown prince.

613
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,490
The crown prince is still well and alive.

614
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,130
How disrespectful.

615
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,940
Aigoo, this Painting Bureau really is full of rumors.

616
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:14,000
When will I stop hearing about other people's news?

617
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,180
It's been a while.

618
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,650
I have been a bit busy.

619
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,740
What favor do you want to ask,  that made you deign to come all the way here and visit us ?

620
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,860
You...

621
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,900
My, look how she livened up since then.

622
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,840
What were you talking about?

623
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,420
Why are you all so serious?

624
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,900
His Majesty collapsed.

625
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,700
What?

626
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,130
His Majesty?

627
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,960
Why are you so surprised?

628
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,050
Do you know His Majesty personally?

629
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,750
Master Painter Han, where is His Highness?

630
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,990
He left to stop by the Royal Investigation Bureau.

631
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,140
The Royal Investigation Bureau?

632
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,200
 Ha Ram. 

633
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,140
What are you doing?

634
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,360
You are here, Your Highness.

635
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,020
Yes.

636
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,650
Where are you taking Supervisor Ha?

637
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:29,000
There was an order to release Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy and Meteorology Bureau.

638
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,180
Whose orders?

639
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,320
Mine.

640
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,420
- Hyeong-nim.
 - Yes.

641
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,820
Do you have complaints against my instructions?

642
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,730
That's not it.

643
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,210
- But Supervisor Ha is still a criminal—
 - Haven't you thought

644
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,230
that you have kept him too long in prison without evidence?

645
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,270
That is...

646
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,980
I was just about to call on you to speak with you.

647
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,180
Good.

648
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,300
- What is it?
 - You must hasten...

649
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,420
the sealing ritual.

650
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:26,180
I shall preside over it myself.

651
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,880
That is the proper thing to do between brothers

652
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,140
and our last act of filial duty towards Royal Father

653
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,710
as our last farewell.

654
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,420
 The sealing ritual... 

655
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,460
 What about the sealing ritual? 

656
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,340
 No! 

657
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,240
Ride the palanquin outside.

658
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,940
You shall stay at my house until the sealing ritual.

659
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,850
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,580
Help him.

661
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,410
 Answer me. 

662
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,200
 Will you give up even your talented wrist? 

663
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,400
Wait a moment.

664
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,420
We shall get you your clothes and cane.

665
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,230
 Ma Wang no longer matters. 

666
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:51,380
 I am standing on the road of revenge anyway. 

667
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:57,220
 The royal family's selfishness that used up my father and me has not changed. 

668
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:02,000
 Now, I will make them pay for it. 

669
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,530
Scholar Sir.

670
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,380
Maiden.

671
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,840
What were you thinking, getting on this palanquin?

672
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,160
You were suddenly leaving with Grand Prince Juhyang.

673
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,540
I was worried.

674
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,370
I am fine.

675
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:52,530
I heard His Majesty collapsed.

676
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,100
I'm not sure what will happen to the sealing ritual.

677
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,500
The sealing ritual will happen.

678
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,650
How do you know that?

679
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,380
What is it?

680
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,000
Forgive me, Your Highness. My hand slipped.

681
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,720
Set the palanquin down for a moment.

682
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,610
Are you all right?

683
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,700
Yes, I am. We should get going.

684
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,640
Open the palanquin door.

685
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:56,180


686
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:04,790
♫  Even when the seasons change and flowers wilt too  ♫

687
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:12,700
♫  The memory that we loved will remain beautiful  ♫

688
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:19,920
♫  Even if every day is long and cold  ♫

689
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,220
♫  I will still be here  ♫

690
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:28,920
♫  Even if it said that waiting is like a long slumber  ♫

691
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,950
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

692
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,370
 It is a divine item to help hold onto consciousness. 

693
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,650
 It means I can use Ma Wang's power as I please. 

694
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,420
 Supervisor Ha and Ma Wang will become one soon. 

695
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:42,170
 Are these memories the spirit of Ma Wang? 

696
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,790
 I wish for Ma Wang to be sealed in the royal portrait. 

697
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,730
 Never ever come to the sealing ritual. 

698
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,230
 We shall repay all our grudges at this sealing ritual. 

699
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,910
 Even to Yangmyeong and the king. 

700
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:55,540
 Forgive me for saying this, but the only way is to kill him on the spot. 

701
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,480
 Heavens, I pray. 

702
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,640
 Let me have my revenge on those who say and do evil things 

703
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,750
 and please protect her. 

704
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,170
 Begin. 

705
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,880
♫  I will still be here  ♫

706
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,900
 Lovers of the Red Sky
