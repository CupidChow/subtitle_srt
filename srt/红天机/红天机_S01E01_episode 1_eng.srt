00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,200
 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and unrelated to any historical fact. 

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,290
 Once upon a time, there was a time where humans and creatures of the earth 

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,960
 lived in harmony with unseen beings. 

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,880
 Among them was Sam Shin*, 
(Goddess of childbirth) 

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,660
 three gods merged into one body. 

11
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,430
 The first god blessed life. 

12
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,850
 The second god controlled death. 

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,490
 The third god maintained the balance between the two. 

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,500
 One day, the demonic god of death who thirsted for blood gobbled up the god of balance. 

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,040
 Once the balance between life and death was broken, 

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,240
 the world fell into terror and chaos. 

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,740
 From then on, Ma Wang, the demon king who was severed from the body of Sam Shin, 

18
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,460
 lived within the dark desires of humans. 

19
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,560
 One day, a woman who lost her lover to Ma Wang's rampage 

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,980
 created a painting. 

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,350
 Sam Shin responded to her prayers and became one with the painting. 

22
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,880
 Ma Wang, who had caused chaos in the world, was sealed in the holy painting. 

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,290
 Afterward, the woman disappeared without a trace. 

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,790
 Episode 1: Red Sky 

25
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,000
 (Dan Dynasty, the first year of King Seongjo's reign) 

26
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,000
 (The abdicated king Yeongjong was able to conquer the world with the power he acquired when Ma Wang entered his body.) 

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,700
 When he became afraid of Ma Wang's increasingly rampant bloodshed, he passed on the throne to his son Seongjo. 

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,740
 In order to eliminate Ma Wang, a ritual is held to seal the demon king inside king Yeongjong's portrait. 

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,150
Eun Oh, have you heard the news?

30
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,480
I hear this royal portrait will be gifted to the subjects to prevent evil.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,100
Something terrible is to be lifted from the abdicated king's body and sealed into this painting.

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,940
Please hear my prayers.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,830
Please help my husband finish the royal portrait without trouble.

34
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,220
Please hear my prayer.

35
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,130
 (Hong Eun Oh's wife) 

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,360
That is all. You are excused.

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,720
But sir, I am a shaman of the Shamanist Bureau—

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,200
The sealing ritual will be carried out by the Taoist Bureau.

39
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,840
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,140
 (Hong Eun Oh: A royal painter) 

41
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,270
 (Gan Yun Guk: A painter) 
 How can a painting be this powerful?

42
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,610
It is truly remarkable.

43
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,600
Now it truly is...

44
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,460
up to the gods.

45
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,370
My baby...

46
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,500
Buddha!

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,140
Gods of heaven and earth!

48
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,110
Sam Shin!

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,770
Anyone, please...

50
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,300
Please protect my baby!

51
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,040
Sam Shin!

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,970
Please protect my baby!

53
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,570
Please... my baby...

54
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,510
 Cheon Gi... Cheon Gi... 

55
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,890
 (Grandmother Sam Shin: 
 a goddess who blesses a child with life) 

56
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,080
My poor Cheon Gi, what shall we do with you?

57
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,510
 (Mi Su: Royal shaman) 

58
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,200
 (Ha Seong Jin: Head of the Taoist Bureau, which conducts rituals dedicated to the sky and stars
) 

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,690
Sir! Sir, what's wrong?

60
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,460
Sir! Sir!

61
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,500
Royal Father...

62
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,060
 (King Seongjo: Fourth king of Dan Dynasty) 
 Is it truly possible

63
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,740
  (King Yeongjong: Third king of Dan Dynasty) 
  to seal Ma Wang into your portrait?

64
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,840
That is the only way to banish that demon from this land.

65
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,200
Today, I will make sure to put an end to the endless bloody war with Ma Wang.

66
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,870
Begin.

67
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,210
Om mani...

68
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,920
Om mani padme hum*. 
  (Sanscrit Buddhist mantra) 

69
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,470
Om mani padme hum!

70
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,710
 (Demon King Ma Wang: a god of death)  
 Who dares wake me from my slumber?

71
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,560
You dare wake me?

72
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,390
Insolent fool!

73
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,230
He is the king of the living land!

74
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,740
Show your respect, demon of the underworld!

75
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,320
Don't look into his eyes! You must never look into his eyes!

76
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,680
King, come closer.

77
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,890
Accept me.

78
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,730
You cannot escape me.

79
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,510
Look, is anyone out there?

80
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,140
 (Hwa Cha: a goblin that lives by absorbing power from paintings) 

81
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,140
Sam Shin!

82
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Sam Shin, how dare you!

83
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,930
From this day forward, you will all suffer from drought and famine!

84
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,710
Your descendants will be lost in darkness!

85
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,540
Your descendants will never paint again!

86
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,520
How dare he blind you?

87
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,620
Ma Wang, that demon is truly unchanging and cruel.

88
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,030
Dear child, I cannot undo the curse...

89
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:50,950
but I shall bless you with a destined partner who can help you avoid the curse.

90
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,360
My Lady, it's a boy!
 (Ha Seong Jin's house in Yangju) 

91
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,900
Sweet baby, your name is Ram.

92
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,070
 Ha Ram: Ha Seong Jin's son 

93
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,080
The eldest son of the noble household of Ha.

94
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,690
- Ha Ram.
- What a beautiful name!

95
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,710
What is the matter?

96
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,110
Will this truly bring peace to the world?

97
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,280
I am afraid the seal will be broken.

98
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,000
Do not fear any longer.

99
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,270
Your reign will be filled with peace and prosperity.

100
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,720
The curse troubles me.

101
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,480
The drought and famine.

102
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,430
What is the meaning of this?

103
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,720
You will not get away with this!

104
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,800
Once the abdicated king finds out—

105
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,140
The abdicated king has chosen the Shamanist Bureau.

106
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,240
It is time for Your Excellency to step down.

107
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,950
Strike him!

108
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,490
Everyone, scatter!

109
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,830
 Death awaits the hunting dog once the hunt is over. 

110
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,670
I only did what I had to do to safeguard the royal family

111
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,900
and the people of this country!

112
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,570
 Nine years later, the ninth year of King Seongjo's reign 

113
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,500
 The sealing ceremony was successful, 

114
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,880
 but the Dan dynasty suffers from drought and famine for nine years because of Ma Wang's curse 

115
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,270
 So the Royal Shaman, Mi Su, searches for a seokcheokdongja to sacrifice during the rain ritual... 

116
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,300
What does that say?

117
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,020
 Divide the crop into ten grades and pay taxes based on how much you salvage  
 I don't know. I can't read.

118
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,390
What do you mean he is not virtuous?

119
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,020
- The king should take charge and...
 - How dare you?

120
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,790
That is why it doesn't rain!

121
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,610
- Do you know how many years it has been?
 - Clear the path!

122
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,970
Make certain not a single grain of rice is taken out!

123
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,320
- Do you understand?
 - Yes, My Lord!

124
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,020
That boy has extraordinary powers!

125
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,930
- It's right here.
 - You are certain this is where the water is?

126
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,110
Come on, let's dig!

127
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,940
He said there is water! We must dig!

128
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,170
Water! It's water!

129
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:31,570
That child is truly blessed with the divine power of water.

130
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,820
- Father! 
 - Yes.

131
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,460
Ram! You are back.

132
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,900
 - That man... 
 - Yes, Father.

133
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,500
 - is His Lordship Ha Seong Jin. 
 - Come inside. Come.

134
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,310
 So he was alive. 

135
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,050
It has been too long, Sir.

136
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,330
What business have you here?

137
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,130
I realize sorrow and resentment still haunt you after all these years.

138
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,010
You should watch your mouth.

139
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,070
I only followed the abdicated king's orders back then.

140
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,050
Before I put an end to your life right this minute,

141
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,330
tell me your reason for coming to my house.

142
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,070
I am here to summon your son.

143
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,460
You sick wench.

144
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,610
I'm sure you are not ignorant of the fact that your son was born with the divine power of water.

145
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,770
- I will pretend I did not hear you.
 - Lord!

146
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,620
This country has suffered from drought for the past nine years.

147
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,600
We need your son for this year's Seokcheok* rain ritual.
  (ritual using a lizard) 

148
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,990
How dare you!

149
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,970
Shut your mouth and leave!

150
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,810
Your divine powers have grown stronger.

151
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,610
I am now the head royal shaman of the Shamanist Bureau. 
  (The head shaman is the one who conducts national rites)  

152
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,530
I will take your son for the ritual as the seokcheokdongja*.
  (=“lizard boy”. A child to lead the lizard  rain ritual)  

153
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,760
You do not have a choice in this matter.

154
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,110
Make your preparations.

155
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,810
I shall leave with your son tomorrow as soon as dawn breaks.

156
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,190
 (Gwanyang: The capital city of Dan dynasty) 

157
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,680
What is the most important part of a portrait?

158
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,600
 (Hong Cheon Gi) 

159
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
It is not my eyes that look upon it.

160
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,660
It is the eyes that look upon me.

161
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,630
There's the maniac and the eye demon.

162
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,490
My mom says their house is haunted.

163
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,110
Ghosts? Really?

164
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,240
Do you really believe that?

165
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,530
Ghosts don't exist. Look carefully.

166
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,210
Come and get it! Come and get it!

167
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,480
- Come and get it!
 - Give that back! That's my father's painting!

168
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,940
- Come and get it!
 - Give it back!

169
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,840
Dirty rat!

170
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,570
Dirty rat.

171
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,150
Disgusting. Scram!

172
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,610
Don't mess with my daughter Cheon Gi!

173
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,740
- Don't touch Cheon Gi!
 - What's wrong?

174
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,240
Father, stop! Father, I'm all right! Father!

175
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,270
Father, please! I'm all right.

176
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,130
Father!

177
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,340
Let's go! Come on!

178
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,670
Run!

179
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,430
- Let's go!
 - Hurry, run!

180
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,550
Make way!

181
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,990
Make way!

182
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,860
Don't look into his eyes.

183
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,460
- We must not look into the eyes.
 - Father?

184
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't look into his eyes.

185
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,860
Don't look into his eyes!

186
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,090
 I sense demon energy. 

187
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,750
- Must not look into the eyes...
 - Father...

188
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,270
Stop!

189
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,080
Please stop!

190
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,440
 What is this energy? 

191
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,000
My father is not mentally well.

192
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,190
Where am I?

193
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,130
Father. Father.

194
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,620
- Cheon Gi...
 - Father.

195
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,170
Do you recognize me?

196
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,350
- Cheon Gi!
 - Father.

197
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,170
My Cheon Gi!

198
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,490
Eun Oh!

199
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,360
H-Hong Eun Oh!

200
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,800
Is... Is it really you?

201
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,320
It is you...

202
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,330
You were alive!

203
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,130
Sir Ha Seong Jin!

204
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,600
It is so good to see you again.

205
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,890
 Shamanist Bureau: 
managed shamans and conducted rituals for the royal family 

206
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,940
Are you all right?

207
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,140
Your manic attack earlier seemed quite severe.

208
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,190
The seizures began after that day

209
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,340
and ever since, my memories gradually slip away.

210
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,230
I am worried to death for my little Cheon Gi because of my illness.

211
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,360
She was born that day in the year of the ox.

212
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,720
My son was also born on the same day.

213
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,470
Was your son not affected?

214
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,720
Ha Ram, go play in the yard.

215
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,580
- Yes, Father.
 - Cheon Gi, go with him.

216
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,240
Then may I go to the Baegyu   (White Elm)    Painting Institute?

217
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,050
- Father, please.
 - What a bright child.

218
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,670
Ha Ram, why don't you go with her?

219
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,550
Yes, Father.

220
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,490
It is a path I know well.

221
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,970
I am not following you.

222
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,500
You don't own this land.

223
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,290
 Baegyu Painting Institute 

224
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,160
- Where is this?
 - Goodness!

225
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,000
You've followed me, after all.

226
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,670
I was walking ahead of you.

227
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,480
Was that supposed to be a joke?

228
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,230
Where is this?

229
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,800
This is the Baegyu Painting Institute.

230
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,940
- It is a painters' institution. 
 - Painters' institution?

231
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,390
They make paintings and sell them.

232
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,250
 Transfer Simulation: imitation technique  
 The painting for today's replication lesson is not an old one.

233
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,930
 (Choi Won Ho: Headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute)  

234
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,520
It is a painting that I drew

235
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,400
of the street vendors' cock fight when I was a student at the painting school.

236
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,830
 (Gyeonju Daek : Baegyu Painting Institute's housekeeper) 

237
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,010
Oh, Chun Bok!

238
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,430
 (Kang Chun Bok: Chief Steward of the Baegyu Painting Institute)  
 Yes, sir?

239
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,920
Watch over the kids while they paint.

240
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,870
Headmaster?

241
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,300
Headmaster, where are you going?

242
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,130
Headmaster?

243
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,950
All right. Elements to learn from this painting is...

244
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,160
So what are we doing here?

245
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,710
You would not understand even if I told you.

246
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,630
Come now, tell me.

247
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,650
Do you expect me to answer you for free?

248
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,320
Do you expect me to pay you?

249
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,730
Nothing in this world is free.

250
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,290
Never mind, then!

251
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm not curious in the slightest.

252
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,890
This moment of them flying into the air...

253
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,960
- All right.
- sets an anticipatory atmosphere...

254
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,890
Close your eyes.

255
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,040
What if I don't?

256
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,870
If you close your eyes like this, you can hear sounds.

257
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,860
Do you hear them?

258
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,710
This is the sound of brushes against the paper.

259
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,810
Gliding...

260
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,060
and sliding...

261
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,110
You are a fast learner.

262
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,800
As you listen to the sounds, you begin to imagine the painting.

263
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,020
And as you imagine the painting, you feel content.

264
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,300
Because I see the world through sound.

265
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,800
Here... 
  (Gyeonju Daek: the house owner and housekeeper)  

266
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,450
Gyeonju Daek*... 
 (= "woman from Gyeonju". But it's used instead of her name) 

267
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,190
Headmaster...  (Gyeonju Daek: thehouse owner)  

268
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,880
Gyeonju Daek.

269
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,790
Ajeossi!

270
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,040
Ch-Cheon Gi!

271
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,530
We have run out of vermilion dye at home.

272
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,520
Could I take your leftovers?

273
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,750
Sure, go ahead.

274
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,440
All right. Thank you, sir.

275
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,960
- Ajeossi?
 - What? What is it? What?

276
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,330
Where did Gyeonju Daek go?

277
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:57,600
She said she would give me something, but I do not think she's in the kitchen.

278
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,710
The bundle in the shed. The bundle in the shed.

279
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,970
The bundle in the shed.

280
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,480
She says there is a bundle in the shed.

281
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,800
That's right!

282
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,570
The bundle in the shed! What a bright young man.

283
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,070
- Why don't you go look for it with her?
 - Yes, sir.

284
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,920
Let's go, Cheon Gi.

285
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,500
Gyeonju Daek...

286
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,640
Headmaster, we've finished—

287
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,210
- I quit! I say, I quit!
 - Headmaster, please!

288
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,000
I quit! Is that what you want? I quit!

289
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,920
You dim-witted fool!

290
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,170
It was a mistake taking you in!

291
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,860
I wonder...

292
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,770
how did you know the bundle was in the shed?

293
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,380
That's... that is...

294
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,110
Cheon Gi, there you are.

295
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,190
Gyeonju Daek! I thought you had gone somewhere.

296
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,980
No, that's not it.

297
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,100
Cheon Gi, hold on.

298
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,130
What is wrong with your sleeve?

299
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,610
One moment. I will sew it back together in no time.

300
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,740
Wait here for a moment.

301
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,740
Did you pretend not to see it when you saw the hole?

302
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,200
I always get holes in my clothes, so I thought you were the same.

303
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,900
Do you also not have a mother?

304
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,460
I do.

305
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,480
Why? You don't have a mother?

306
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,880
She died the day I was born.

307
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,280
What are you drawing all of a sudden?

308
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,960
A star.

309
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,070
This looks more like a full moon than a star.

310
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,240
This is a star to me.

311
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,770
What are you doing?

312
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,160
I shall draw with you.

313
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,820
This is a star?

314
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,140
Yes. The Big Dipper.

315
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,150
I see.

316
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,100
The Big Dipper...

317
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,170
Are you hungry?

318
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,690
N... no!

319
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,050
Follow me!

320
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,560
No.

321
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,680
Children.

322
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,700
Come here.

323
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,910
- Us?
 - Yes!

324
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,300
You two, come here.

325
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,420
Hold on, hold on.

326
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,500
Here. You will need this tomorrow.

327
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,910
No, that is all right.

328
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,150
I can't take this from you.

329
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,390
Take what?

330
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,480
Huh?

331
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,290
What's wrong?

332
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,840
What is it?

333
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,430
It is nothing...

334
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,300
I must have imagined it.

335
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,750
Let's go.

336
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,040
Be sure to hold your hands tightly together.

337
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,080
 So they have finally met. 

338
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,500
 (Seongjucheong:  Shamanist Bureau)  

339
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,900
But what brings you to Gwanyang?

340
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,370
What a cruel joke of fate.

341
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,840
My son is to be Seokcheokdongja for the rain ritual this year.

342
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,660
Ha Ram is born with the power of water.

343
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,950
So he is going to the palace?

344
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,980
That cannot be.

345
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,310
What?

346
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,210
You have found a boy suitable for the Seokcheok Rain Ritual?

347
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,190
The Shamanistic Bureau has him under its protection.

349
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,230
Who is it?

350
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,010
He is the son of Ha Seong Jin, who once carried out rituals as head of the Taoist Bureau.

351
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,940
The boy is blessed by the water god.

352
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Is the man who sealed Ma Wang nine years ago still alive?

353
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,660
Yes, Your Majesty.  It seems he escaped and stayed hidden in Yangju.

354
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,560
That is a relief.

355
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,700
But it pains me that we must sacrifice his son.

356
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,280
You must swallow your pain and make a decision for the starving people.

357
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,800
Are you suggesting a human sacrifice?

358
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,140
Your Majesty, a hundred years ago,

359
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,980
a human sacrifice relieved heaven's anger and brought down rain.

360
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,540
How dare you speak such words in front of His Majesty!

361
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,620
We are a country that follows Confucius' and Mencius' teachings.

362
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,690
We cannot carry out something so preposterous!

363
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,920
Your Excellencies, have you forgotten about the incident nine years ago?

364
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,220
The drought and famine have continued for years.

365
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,470
Human sacrifice is the only way to undo Ma Wang's curse.

366
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,980
In whose presence are you, a mere shaman, freely wagging your tongue?

367
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,760
What are your thoughts on this?

368
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,120
The will of the heavens will not change through human deceptions.

369
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,970
How could the gods allow human sacrifice?

370
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,490
I am of the same mind.

371
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,580
The rain ritual will be carried out in a dignified manner this year.

372
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,690
We shall not sacrifice any life.

373
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,940
Is that understood?

374
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,640
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

375
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,840
 Only a human sacrifice will bring rain, Your Majesty. 

376
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,130
 You may all disagree with me, but I must do it. 

377
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,880
 The royal shaman will do it. 

378
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,880
Hey!

379
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,540
What are you doing?  This is theft!

380
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,090
Hey, wait, wait.

381
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,910
There is someone here.

382
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,500
Do you not hear her snoring?

383
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,590
You're a psychic.

384
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,560
See this stick?

385
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
I do.

386
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,150
Use it to steal them.

387
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,100
Why don't we just tell Father we are hungry?

388
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,150
Do you wish to trouble an elder during this time of famine?

389
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,900
All right.

390
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,470
Be quiet!

391
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,920
Everyone in the village knows about Anseong Daek* of the peach tree field. 
 (lit: Woman from Anseong) 

392
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,930
Why?

393
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,890
Because her fiery temper will make even grown men tremble with fear.

394
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,500
Then she's a scary person!

395
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,490
If we get caught, we won't be able to walk out on our own.

396
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,750
What?

397
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,670
I won't do it then! I'm coming down.

398
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,950
I want to eat a peach.

399
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,690
I can't even pick a peach because I can't see.

400
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,730
All right, fine.

401
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,790
Are you all right?

402
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,220
Who's there?

403
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,010
- You scoundrels! 
 - Hey, run!

404
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,600
Oh, all right.

405
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,130
She's coming! Hurry!

406
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,130
Are you all right? Let's go!

407
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,580
You brats! Don't you try that again!

408
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,440
This is all your fault.

409
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,550
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been chased by someone who's scary as a ghost.

410
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,750
Where are you going?

411
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,790
I hate you.

412
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,460
I never said I wanted to steal someone else's peaches.

413
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,670
You are just like everyone else.

414
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,600
Because I can't see...

415
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,740
and because my father isn't mentally well,

416
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,700
and because my mother died when I was born...

417
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,630
I have no friends.

418
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,230
Everyone points fingers at me for no reason.

419
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,050
They say I am a cursed child.

420
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:15,180
I only wanted to eat a peach with you.

421
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,640
I'm sorry.

422
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,460
But...

423
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,810
the fact that your mother died giving birth to you,

424
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,600
that you were born blind,

425
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,990
that your father isn't mentally well...

426
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,630
none of those is your fault.

427
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,960
- So why...
- Why what?

428
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,580
What?

429
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,540
What do you know?

430
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,850
You're right.

431
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,250
I don't know anything, but you can't help it.

432
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,950
Everything that has happened to you is not within the human will.

433
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,040
It isn't your fault!

434
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:15,050
So don't blame yourself for things that you cannot control.

435
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,350
I'm even hungrier now from running so much.

436
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,360
This definitely is your fault.

437
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,640
Here.

438
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,240
It's still not ripe.

439
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,370
It's sweet. Tastes delicious.

440
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,950
What is that?

441
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,570
It should feel better now.

442
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,120
Where did the bundle go?

443
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,500
Oh, right!

444
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,430
Gyeonju Daek's bundle!

445
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,380
I must have lost it while we were running away.

446
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,390
Here it is.

447
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,950
Really?

448
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,960
Thank goodness.

449
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,940
Why would you jest about such a thing?

450
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,550
You really startled me.

451
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,340
You are so mean.

452
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,750
I can't even jest.

453
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,040
There are countless stars in the sky tonight.

454
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,900
Look, there's the Big Dipper.

455
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,580
Is there?

456
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,300
Wow...

457
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,150
- Oh, right.
- Oh, right what?

458
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,530
Do you feel guilty about seeing the stars by yourself?

459
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,560
I'm sorry.

460
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,160
It was insensitive of me.

461
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,450
How many stars are there?

462
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,350
Around a hundred million?

463
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,200
How much is a hundred million?

464
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,440
A lot. Quite a lot.

465
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,700
Get off now. We're here.

466
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,200
Wait.

467
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,590
Here. You should take this.

468
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,740
That's all right.

469
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,810
I'll come to fetch it after the rain ritual.

470
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,450
Isn't this precious to you?

471
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,800
This?

472
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,260
It is nothing.

473
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,660
It is just the one and only handkerchief that my mother gave me.

474
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,230
Are you telling the truth?

475
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,500
All right. Come back tomorrow.

476
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,390
I'll be waiting for you.

477
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,670
All right.

478
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:48,010
Tomorrow, I'll go back to Anseong Daek's peach tree field and steal more peaches for you.

479
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,430
Give me your hand.

480
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,030
My hand?

481
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,690
Here.

482
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,650
Take this.

483
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,530
You will go pick peaches with me tomorrow, won't you?

484
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,070
Sure. Of course!

485
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,250
Fine. That's a promise.

486
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,820
All right.

487
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,040
Let's go.

488
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,250
His Majesty, the King!

489
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,730
You must be Ha Ram.

490
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,410
I lack virtue and must depend on a young boy like you.

491
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,000
I am hugely indebted to your family.

492
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,960
Please do not mention it, Your Majesty.

493
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,980
The eyes are the most important thing in a painting.

494
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,310
The soul must be clear!

495
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,770
Goodness!

496
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,310
Oh, my!

497
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,570
What insolence!

498
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,660
Have mercy!

499
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,230
Have mercy, please!

500
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:14,590
 Father, I hear they got really good medicine this time. 

501
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,480
 Hold on... 

502
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,010
 Hold on just a little bit longer. 

503
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,760
His Highness, the Crown Prince!

504
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,480
 (Crown Prince Yi Kang: Seongjo's eldest son)  
 Hu, it's been too long.

505
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
Why have you not visited me all this time?

506
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,550
 (Grand Prince Juhyang, Yi Hu: Seongjo's second son) 
 Your Highness, you must speak with formality.

507
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,470
- There are people watching.
 - No matter.

508
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,380
We are brothers of the same mother.

509
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,110
It is a delight to see my brothers here.

510
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:06,530
Your Highness, our country is suffering from a lengthy drought and famine.

511
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,510
Before the personal joy of seeing each other,

512
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,690
I pray you do not forget the significance of today's rain ritual.

513
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:19,190
Hu, I will not forget your loyal counsel when I ascend the throne.

514
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,290
Yes, Your Highness.

515
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,700
Come now, Hyeong-nim*. 
  (=elder brother) 

516
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,170
Why are you acting so formally?

517
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,930
Yul, when I said that to His Highness, I knew full well what it meant.

518
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,180
That is enough, Yul.

519
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,770
Hu speaks for my own good.

520
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,120
 (Grand Prince Yangmyeong, Yi Yul: Seongjo's third son) 

521
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,410
I understand, Your Highness.

522
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,550
Hyeong-nim!

523
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,250
Why do you walk so fast?

524
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,330
Move out of my way.

525
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,800
Are you irked by what I said earlier?

526
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,010
Do not be so angry.

527
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,590
Yul, do you not feel anything?

528
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,850
What do you mean?

529
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,860
We are like hydrangea flowers.

530
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,790
They bloom flowers, but they cannot bear berries even though they are alive.

531
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,840
We are lifeless flowers.

532
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,160
Every time I meet His Highness, that is what I feel,

533
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,250
even though nothing can be done about it.

534
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,450
Hyeongnim, hydrangeas are light green when they first blossom,

535
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,740
then turn white in full bloom,

536
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,200
then yellow when they die.

537
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,250
How could you call a flower that lives so vibrantly lifeless?

538
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,660
But listen, Hyeong-nim. Follow me.

539
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,680
I know what will make you feel better today.

540
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,260
What foolery is this?

541
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,730
I will show you something grand.

542
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,960
 (Gyeongwonjeon: A palace hall where former kings' portraits are kept and ceremonies are held) 

543
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,780
Hyeong-nim, you've dropped your protection amulet.

544
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,880
   

545
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,320
Didn't our Royal Father tell you to

546
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,240
keep this amulet close as it repels evil spirits?

547
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,400
Keep it close to you.

548
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,170
How ominous.

549
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,250
Why would this fall down?

550
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,330
But listen, Hyeong-nim.

551
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,690
If not now, when would we have a chance to see these precious portraits of past kings?

552
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,480
This place is truly cloaked in a mysterious aura.

553
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,700
  King Gojo 

554
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,100
 King Hyejo 

555
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,020
 King Gwangjo 

556
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,450
 The one who will become the king. 

557
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,040
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

558
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,430
 The one who will become the king. 

559
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,030
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

560
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,120
 Come to me. 

561
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,190
His Majesty, the King!

562
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,240
 The one who will become the king. 

563
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,630
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

564
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,210
 The one who will become the king. 

565
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,570
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

566
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:36,080
 Come to me. 

567
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,160
Hyeong-nim! What are you doing?

568
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,330
You shouldn't touch—

569
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,970
 The one who will become the king... 

570
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,700
 Come to me. 

571
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,950
Doesn't royal grandfather's portrait seem... truly alive?

572
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:13,190
 The one who will become the king. 

573
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,210
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

574
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,370
The ceremonial incantation!

575
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:29,230
O radiant spirit!

576
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:35,340
This year's drought has been particularly severe.

577
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:42,640
Our people cry out and suffer in agony!

578
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,780
It is all due to my lack of virtue.

579
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,390
Please look over us

580
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:57,550
and graciously grant us a great rainfall!

581
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,810
Begin.

582
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:28,830
♫  Salamander, salamander, bring forth the clouds  ♫

583
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,090
♫  Spew the fog  ♫

584
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:38,420
♫  Salamander, salamander, bring forth the clouds  ♫

585
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,770
♫  Spew the fog  ♫

586
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,640
 Come to me. 

587
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,840
 Come to me... the one who will become the king. 

588
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,010
We must go now. Quickly!

589
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,020
 The one who will become the king. 

590
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,590
 I shall be with you. 

591
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,340
 The one who will become the king. 

592
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,490
 The one who will become the king of this land. 

593
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,860
 I shall be with you. 

594
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:38,180
♫  Salamander, salamander, bring forth the clouds  ♫

595
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,320
♫  Spew the fog  ♫

596
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:47,650
♫  Salamander, salamander, bring forth the clouds  ♫

597
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,030
♫  Spew the fog  ♫

598
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:57,070
♫  If you let the sweet rain drench the earth  ♫

599
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:03,910
♫  We will let you go  ♫

600
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,200
 Are you the one who has awoken me? 

601
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,510
 Is this... 

602
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,510
 a human sacrifice? 

603
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,040
Om mani padme hum!

604
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,050
No!

605
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:49,870
 Where is it? 

606
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,940
 Is it that direction? 

607
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,770
Ha Ram!

608
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,930
Ha Ram!

609
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,310
 Father! 

610
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,870
 Father! 

611
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,850
 Father! 

612
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,200
 Father! 

613
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,000
- Ha— 
  - What's going on? 

614
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,550
 It's raining! 

615
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,660
 Father! 

616
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,110
 Father! 

617
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:33,320
 Father! 

618
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,330
 Your Highness! 

619
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,620
Rush and take His Highness!

620
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,220
Your Highness, we must leave!

621
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,970
It was my place.

622
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,510
Rush and protect His Highness!

623
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,760
It was my place all along!

624
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,720
 Father... 

625
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,480
 Father... 

626
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,030
Hurry!

627
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,130
 - Rush!
 - This way! 

628
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,480
 This way! 

629
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,300
 The fire is spreading! 

630
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,770
 Bring him this way! 

631
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,170
 Father... 

632
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,790
 Fa... 

633
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:43,280
 Father... 

634
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,850
Rain!

635
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,980
It's raining!

636
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,920
Goodness, it's raining!

637
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,510
Ha Ram!

638
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,960
Ha Ram!

639
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,980
It really is raining!

640
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,820
 The throne was rightfully mine 

641
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,140
 as appointed by the heavens. 

642
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,910
 Ha Ram... 

643
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,430
 Ha Ram... 

644
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:39,630
 You have sacrificed yourself for the good of countless people. 

645
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,230
 Have you used the child as bait to lure me 

646
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:48,340
 Ma Wang, remain in this child's body. 

647
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:53,490
 I will take your eyes, the source of your power. 

648
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,680
 You will be powerless 

649
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,660
 until the day you reclaim your eyes. 

650
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,290
 Cheon Gi... 

651
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,730
 Cheon Gi... 

652
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,950
 You are a child destined to save the world. 

653
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:33,820
 I shall temporarily entrust these eyes to you. 

654
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,690
 Create the vessel of destiny. 

655
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,770
Ha Ram!

656
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,280
Move aside!

657
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,630
Ha Ram...

658
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,630
Ha Ram!

659
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,740
Ha Ram!

660
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,070
Ha Ram!

661
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,220
Arrest the royal shaman immediately!

662
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,650
Your Majesty!

663
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:58,280
Your Majesty, I have done nothing wrong!

664
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,150
You cannot do this to me, Your Majesty!

665
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,340
Ha Ram.

666
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,250
- Father.
 - Ha Ram!

667
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:49,930
I cannot see!

668
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,020
Father!

669
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,390
I cannot see anything!

670
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:13,080
I cannot see anything, Father!

671
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,660
 Far in the future, 

672
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:19,610
 when the two destinies intertwine, 

673
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:25,140
 everything will find its rightful place. 

674
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:39,370


675
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,400
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

676
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:51,100
♫  Whichever way the wind blows  ♫

677
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:58,130
♫  Wherever my feet lead me  ♫

678
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:06,350
♫  I can walk without a moment's rest  ♫

679
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:12,410
♫  Wherever you are, I ask you to stay  ♫

680
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:21,380
♫  Am I the one who lives in your heart?  ♫

681
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:28,430
♫  The one you miss endlessly?  ♫

682
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:36,440
♫  I may not be, you may hate me  ♫

683
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,450
 She is the only female painter in this town. 

684
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,740
 The flower of the Baegyu Painting Institute. 

685
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,950
 What use is replicating paintings? 

686
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,980
 We must paint people's wishes. 

687
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,170
 Supervisor Ha, welcome. 

688
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,850
 It is the hour of the tiger. Please observe the stars of the southern sky. 
 

689
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:52,620
 How would you explain a blind man studying astronomy? 

690
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,190
 What can I say, she has no dignity as a painter. 

691
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,760
 What is the virtue of imitation? 

692
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,850
 It means it has to be exactly the same. 

693
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,840
 It is probably that man who only seeks Cheon Gi's paintings. 

694
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,290
 Find the counterfeiting artist and investigate her. 

695
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,700
 I don't know who you are, but please pretend you didn't see me! 

696
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,170
 This woman, could she be? 

697
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,700
♫  Am I the one who lives in your heart?  ♫

698
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:57,140
 Lovers of the Red Sky
