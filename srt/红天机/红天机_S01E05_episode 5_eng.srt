Painter Hong Cheon Gi of Baegyu Painting Institute...

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,580
Well, look who this is.

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,860
Our Painter Hong!
  (Jeong Soen Nae: The deputy manager of Wolsungdang) 

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,950
We should finish our business first.

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,830
How dare you harass a woman in broad daylight?

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,530
What a disgrace!

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,940
Quiet down!

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,760
You don't know anything!

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,550
Hey, hey.

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,500
Are you truly a painter?

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,650
Show me your contestant identification.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,580
Oh, yes.

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,240
I seem to have left it at home.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,960
I am from Baegyu Painting Institute.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,870
I'm a painter. Please let me in.

24

 (Go Pil: Grand Prince Yangmyeong's Chief Steward) 

25
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,180
A woman painter? A dog walking down the street would laugh.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,890
If you don't have a contestant's identification stick, you cannot go inside. So there.

27
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,890
Next, next. Hurry up and wrap it up.

28
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,390
- Wait...
- Hurry, hurry.

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,620
Let's go while I'm being polite. Let's not waste energy.

30
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,020
Wait, hold on!

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,270
What is going on here?

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,220
Let go of that hand immediately.

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,350
Palanquin?

34
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,740
Scholar Sir.

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,210
I see. So, you two are in that kind of relationship, huh?

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,480
Watch your mouth!

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,240
- He is— 
 - Man Su.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,990
- Yes, sir.
 - I will take her with me.

39
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,080
Says who? Come here!

40
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,830
Come now!

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,650
You bastard!

42
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,100
Are you all right?

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,770
You're here, Supervisor Ha. 
 You, how dare you be so impudent?

45
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,210
This is Grand Prince Yangmyeong's Maejukheon!

46
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,540
Get out of here!

47
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,800
- Shoo!
 - Run!

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,130
Let's go! Run!

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,620
Please come inside.

50
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,930
She is also a participant of the contest today.

51
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,220
She will come in with me.

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,710
Oh, yes. Of course.

53
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,660
See? What did I tell you?

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,200
Come now, hurry up!

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,660
Take out your contestant identification.

56

 Episode 5: Maejukheon Painting Contest, Part 1 

57
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,470
It is quite amazing.

58
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,740
It is as busy as a market during Chuseok*.
 (major harvest festival on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar) 

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,030
So, why are you at the painting contest?

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,000
I was invited by Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

61
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,660
Invited?

62
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,720
Grand Prince Yangmyeong invited you

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,330
but forgot to be considerate.

64
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,520
There is no one to guide you.

65
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,750
Never mind! I shall guide you.

66
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,020
- Please, I will be indebted to you.
 - Sure.

67
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,180
Trust me and follow me.

68
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,960
This way, please.

69
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,650
Careful in front of you.

70
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,710
But Sir, how are you so nimble?

71
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,840
It was as if you could see.

72
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,450
Not even those who can see can be that good.

73
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,810
Are you a military officer by any chance?

74
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,530
I have trained since I was young.

75
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,360
Let's say I had a good mentor.

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,470
Anyhow, it was marvelous.

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,280
How could I ever repay you?

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,130
No need. I only did what I had to.

79
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,640
But those men work for Wolseongdang.

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,780
I am worried they will retaliate against you because of me.

81
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,600
It is best to avoid fights and not get involved.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,750
I will avoid them, so do not worry.

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,070
You must be very, very careful.

84
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,740
These seem to be the guest seats.

85
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,010
And on the other side...

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,680
I will paint in the yard here.

87
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,340
Is that so?

88
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,760
I look forward to it.

89
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,120
I have never been to such a grand contest.

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,490
I have dreamed of this moment for a long time.

91
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,580
I believe you could surely win first place.

92
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,810
Pardon?

93
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,290
Don't say such things.

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,320
But I will l do my best.

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,960
Then I pray you to go forth bravely and get a good result.

96
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,950
Come this way, please.

97
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,750
Thank you.

98
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,980
Keep an eye out for me.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,970
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,320
It is all right. I'm used to it now.

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,750
I will be going now.

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,640
Where did that girl go?

103
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,730
There she is!

104
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,890

 (Cha Yeong Uk: Baegyu Painting Institute painter) 

107
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,370
When did you get here, Obnoxious One?

108
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,120
- We were worried about you.
 - Hey, hey!

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,190
You two came in here by yourselves. Worried?

110
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,240
Honestly.

111
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,960
I ran into Jeong Soen Nae on the way here and almost died.

112
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,270
What?

113
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,050
You ran into that thug?

114
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,000
How is he out so quickly?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,220
I don't know.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,030
So? What happened?

117
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,680
What do you mean, what happened?

118
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,750
I just escaped somehow.

119
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,700
Anyhow, we should watch our backs at night.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,610
Then we did all of that for nothing?

121
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,710
- That is truly a shame.
 - I've seen him somewhere before.

122
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,430
Hey, don't mind him.

123
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,360
Let's hurry and find our seats.

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,020
True, we can talk later. We need to find our spots.

125
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,550
You still didn't find a seat?

126
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,260
- We were looking for you!
 - We had no time! We were looking for you!

Have you been well?

149

I didn't think he was interested in paintings.

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,120
Enjoy yourself.

164
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
Yes, Your Highness.

165
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,470
What a mischievous man you are.

166
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,120
 Had you died that day at the cliff, 

167
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,550
 it would not have been so cumbersome. 

168
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,500
 Mother! 

169
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,830
 (Kim Gong Rye: former Inquisitor, now Grand Prince Juhyang's captain of the guard) 

170
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,450
Distinguished guests and painters we have invited here today!

171
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,950
The Maejukheon Painting Contest shall begin soon.

172
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,160
Please take your seats!

173
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,430
Hey, hey.

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Paint boulders with finely separated brush tips, trees with emphatic, bold lines

175
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,970
and for painting bamboo, you must be skilled in calligraphy.

176
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,980
Anyone who knows this must know that painting and calligraphy are the same.

177
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,650
I have opened the doors of Maejukheon again after four years

178
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,160
to find a talented painter such as the one I described.

179
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,960
It is good to see you all.

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,300
I am Yangmyeong, the owner of Maejukheon.

181
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, I shall introduce you to the judges who will judge by my side.

182
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,540
First, Han Geon, Master Painter of the Painting Bureau.

183
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,320
­

184
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,500
And the man who studied with him, the headmaster

185
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,170
of the acclaimed Baegyu Painting Institute, Choi Won Ho.

186
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,260
The headmistress of the Cheongyu Painting Institute, Yu Si Saeng.

187
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,180
My brother's close friend and mine,

188
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,250
as well as Dan Dynasty's best calligrapher, Seo Gi Jeong.
  (Seo Gi Jeong: Advisor at the Office of Special Advisors ) 

189
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,400
And finally, the man who sets an example

190
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,130
for his brother by excelling in martial arts and literature,

191
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,070
Grand Prince Juhyang.

192
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,350
This contest will take place over the next two days.

193
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,290
There will be three rounds total.

194
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,210
The first and second round paintings will be done today

195
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,660
and the third round will be tomorrow.

196
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,650
First, the guest I designate in each round will assign the theme.

197
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,940
Second, the evaluation will take place without revealing the painter's rank and status.

198
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,660
- That's right!
 - Yes!

199
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,590
Third, after the evaluation is finished,

200
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,030
the judges will determine pass or fail by using blue and red tiles.

201
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,470
Red tile means to pass, and blue tile means to fail.

202
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,130
You pass if there are more red tiles than blue.

203
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,110
If not, you fail.

204
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,920
However, even if you fail,

205
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,050
the higher judge's all pass tile can allow you to pass the round once.

206
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,050
I look forward to seeing paintings that will live on for eternity.

207
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,190
And I will personally participate in judging.

208
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,850
For the first round, you may use the painting papers we have prepared for you without limit.

209
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,620
Stay in your seats, and we shall hand out your first paper.

210
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,450
Thank you.

211
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,040
And if you do not finish the painting in time, you fail.

212
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,240
- The time limit and requirements are different for every round.
 - The Maejukheon stamp is so beautiful.

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,990
It smells good. Maybe since it's top-quality paper, it even smells different.

214
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,260
You two really are so tacky.

215
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,530
You look like you're about to kiss the paper.

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,240
Hey, Yeong Uk.

217
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,050
Who is that eerie-looking monk?

218
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,990
Jeolla Province's "ghost painter", monk Man Yu?

219
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,240
 When he painted Yumahil* on the temple wall,
 (one of Buddha's disciples) 

220
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,850
 the painting lit up the whole temple. 

221
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,040
 The people gathered towards the painting and donated more than a million coins. 

222
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,300
 He shocked the world with his ghost-like painting skills. 

223
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,240
So, they call him "ghost painter".

224
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,790
Hey, what about that man in a satgat*? 
 (straw hat) 

225
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,300
I think he is Sim Satgat.

226
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,760
- He is Gyeongsang Province's "magic painter".
 - Magic painter?

227
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,030
Magic painter...

228
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,560
I see. Hey, he must have the power to paint while riding a horse!
  ('Ma' in Korean means horse) 

229
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,720
Whoa. Horse painting skill, like fog enveloping a horse.

230
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,160
He composes the painting while riding on thunderously.

231
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,590
Titled "The Horse Painting"!

232
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,120
Ah, how frustrating.

233
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,430
Let me restrain myself here.

234
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,270
So, no one knows his face or age because he always wears his satgat.

235
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,610
A goblin named Hwacha*, who likes to paint, visited him every night for a painting duel
  (a goblin that feeds on the energy of paintings) 

236
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,010
until he opened his eyes to the unconscious energy within him.

237
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,500
That's why he is called "magic painter".

238
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,560
Do you see now?

239
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,930
All the best painters of the Dan Dynasty are here.

240
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,780
Actually, there is someone else here who has everyone's attention.

241
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,010
Who is it?

242
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh, me?

243
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,740
No. Even I know who it is.

244
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,090
The most probable winner of this painting contest

245
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,340
is Gang Hi Yeon of godly brushstroke.

246
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,980
A prodigy since childhood, the best in scholar-style painting.

247
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,550
He paints trees and rivers with straight and composed lines,

248
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,590
but emphasizes empty spaces by framing the painting's focus with them.

249
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,270
His paintings are uniquely brimming with life.

250
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,820
The judges also prefer paintings by art-loving aristocratic scholars, so he is most likely to win.

251
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,670
Not painters like us, who paint for a living.

252
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,450
So you're saying...

253
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,720
that I should accept that I will not win this painting contest?

254
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,010
Aigoo, look at the people around us.

255
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,170
How could we even compete against them?

256
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,680
Still, we should dream big at Maejukheon, Long Face.

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,510
- Annoying One?
 - Well, well.

258
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,520
So, you're going to try to win? Is that it?

259
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,040
She really had no fear since she was a child.

260
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,520
- Really.
 - Exactly.

261
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,160
Keep grinding your ink stick.

262
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,240
We shall announce the first genre and theme.

263
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,540
The first genre is 'Plum and Bamboo.'*
 (A painting of plum blossoms and bamboo trees.) 

264
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,630
And now, the theme.

265
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,300
I shall hand it to the Painting Bureau's dignified Han Geon.

266
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,090
What?

267
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,680
Hey, doesn't this give Jeong an upper hand?

268
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,510
I know. Isn't that his teacher?

269
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,060
 "Reciting a poem alone under the moonlight..." 

270
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,390
"Reciting a poem alone under the moonlight,

271
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,630
the scent of plum blossoms seeps into my clothes.

272
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:20,350
A kaleidoscope of butterflies takes flight in anticipation of spring."

273
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,540
Well then, you have two hours from now.

274
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,120
Two hours?

275
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,330
That's too tight.

276
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,270
- I'm not even done grinding my ink yet. 
 - Grind your ink first.

277
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,900
How is that?

278
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,210
I changed the genre to adjust to the level of the imitation painter.

279
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,200
An excellent choice, Your Highness.

280
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,450
Magnificent handwriting.

281
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,890
It puts Han Oh to shame.

282
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,550
How marvelous.

283
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,540
I agree.

284
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,450
How can one write with such grace?

285
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,910
- How elegant.
 - My goodness!

286
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,630
A firm but graceful handwriting.
  (Yi Hyeon Mo: Secretary at the Ministry of War)
 (Sim Jeong Wu: Researcher at the Hall of Worthies) 

287
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,520
His Highness's handwriting is as divine as usual.

288
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,550
Even the envoys of the Yeon Empire envy his handwriting.

289
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,660
His handwriting truly is worthy of being labeled a national treasure.

290
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,560
Does it bother you, Your Highness?

291
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,190
Not at all.

292
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,620
I am only proud of my brother's fine skills.

293
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,470
It is only handwriting.

294
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,260
Please focus on Grand Prince Yangmyeong's intentions.

295
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,430
 Reciting a poem alone under the moonlight... 

296
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,990
 the scent of plum blossoms seeps into my clothes. 

297
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,980
 A kaleidoscope of butterflies takes flight in anticipation of spring. 

298
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,300
Hey, Jeong.

299
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,490
Hey.

300
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,770
Can you please... interpret that theme again?

301
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,500
Poem moonlight, plum blossoms, butterflies flying in spring.

302
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,940
What?

303
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,730
What is he saying?

304
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,280
Yeong Uk, you try.

305
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,570
All right, trust me.

306
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,170
Be precise.

307
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,720
Under the moon...

308
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,610
 Reciting a poem alone under the moonlight... 

309
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,700
Poetry something, something...

310
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,930
Hey. Forget it.

311
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,750
- Even I heard that.
 - Hey, hey, hey.

312
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,300
I'll repeat it one last time. Listen carefully.

313
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,020
Reciting a poem alone under the moonlight,

314
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,720
the smell of plum blossoms is so strong that it seeps into your clothes.

315
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,830
A kaleidoscope of butterflies flies because they think spring has come already.

316
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,940
That is what that says.

317
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,270
All right, fine.

318
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,420
So...

319
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,540
Moonlight.

320
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,470
Plum flowers.

321
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,400
Butterfly.

322
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,480
What is it?

323
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,860
What a strange painting.

324
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,420
I haven't even finished.

325
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,750
I guess this won't do.

326
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,530
The aura of his brushstrokes is amazing.

327
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,550
Already?

328
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,000
 Two hours have passed already. 

329
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,360
 Where the brush touches, we call it "sil".
 (sil: expressing the essence of the object by exposing it)  

330
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,000
And the empty space is called "heo".
  (heo: expressing the energy of the object with emptiness) 

331
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,630
Will you let sil win... to minimize the form?

332
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,850
Or let sil lose...to reveal the form?

333
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,970
 Father. 

334
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,230
 How could one include a million strokes in a single stroke? 

335
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,450
 I let go of my greed 

336
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,090
 and I can see the flowers and the moon. 

337
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,070
As this is the first round, there are many paintings that seem too clumsy.

338
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,160
How could painters draw such lamentable first strokes?

339
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,190
 We must observe the merit of their paintings. 

340
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,680
 What the painter focused on. 

341
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,370
 As the first genre is plum and bamboo, 

342
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,320
 we will grade based on their perception of and attitude toward nature. 

343
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,750
 If you close your eyes like this, you can hear sounds. 

344
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,240
 Even if it is her, 

345
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,540
 our tie has already been broken once. 

346
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,280
 I cannot ruin a grand plan because of personal feelings. 

347
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,400
The first round is over!

348
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,050
Be sure to write your name.

349
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,860
- Are you finished?
 - Yes.

350
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,010
- Did you put your names on?
 - Yes.

351
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,270
Prepare for evaluation.

352
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,980
I see how generous and bold the composition is,

353
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,030
but it did not capture the depth of the theme.

354
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,380
- It contradicts the theme.
 - Six blues!

355
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,170
 Twenty six blues... and eight reds. 

356
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,290
Fail!

357
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,360
The intensity of the ink to represent the moonlight is too dark.

358
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,070
Fail.

359
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,420
Grace is the most important element of plum blossoms.

360
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,610
There is nothing more to see.

361
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,310
Hey, Meok Soe!

362
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,180
It is not always best to overfill the painting.

363
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,350
The plum blossom's aura lacks what it needs to fulfill the lone scholar's uneasiness.

364
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,250
Fail!

365
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,160
Pil Dong.

366
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,470
- Good work.
 - Be sure to stay and pass!

367
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,400
There are not enough brushstrokes in the plum blossoms, so it looks too bare.

368
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,750
Fail.

369
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,410
Fail!

370
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,190
The strokes are too rough, and there is no control over the ink flow.

371
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,230
- Fail.
 - Fail!

372
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,230
- Fail.
 - Fail.

373
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,430
Fail.

374
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,640
Hey, look!

375
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,500
Yeong Uk's.

376
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,930
The radiantly blooming blossoms on each branch signify

377
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,750
maintaining fidelity and integrity in the midst of difficult reality.

378
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,950
It is a fine work that well embodies the symbolism of plum blossoms.

379
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,300
Thirty-one reds and three blues.

380
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,850
Number 25, pass!

381
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,230
Pass!

382
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,570
The branches extend gracefully under the moonlight.

383
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,140
The flowers give off cold air.

384
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,760
Pass.

385
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,650
- Hey!
 - Hey! It's a pass!

386
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,330
You passed!

387
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,960
The rough portrayal of the blossoms invokes a sense of Buddhist fidelity.

388
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,720
Pass.

389
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,290
- Number 32 looks quite good.
 - Hey, it's yours.

390
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,880
This painting has different dignity and character.

391
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,290
It is a fresh composition and technique.

392
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,760
Pass.

393
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Even the merchants from Yeon Empire would want to buy it.

394
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,700
There is nothing more to say.

395
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,210
It expresses the flowers and moon in a poetic manner

396
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,260
and is pleasing to the eyes.

397
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,500
It is a pass.

398
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,530
The spirit of the painting flows with the wind, scatters at the flower,

399
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,450
and halts at the moon.

400
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,460
It is remarkable.

401
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,560
Marvelous.

402
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,360
 But what is this? 

403
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,540
There is no question that this work enhanced the flavor empty space can impart

404
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,750
and the brush techniques, as well as the control of light and dark, are magnificent.

405
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,640
As your gaze moves with the flow, you find the full moon

406
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,820
and it looks as if the legends of the heavens

407
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,570
could settle over the blossoms. It exudes marvelous energy.

408
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,370
However!

409
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,760
Plum blossoms do not boast their scent even in the coldest winters.

410
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,450
This painter should ponder over the meaning of my words.

411
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,340
Fail.

412
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,890
Six blues!

413
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,060
Four blues.

414
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,730
Thirty-three blues and one red.

415
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,880
Then, this painting is a fail.

416
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,730
Wait, Your Highness!

417
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,990
I have something to ask Your Highness.

418
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,540
Come forth.

419
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,640
I am Hong Cheon Gi of Baegyu Painting Institute.

420
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,780
Your Highness said that my painting is good, but you cannot give it a pass.

421
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:15,130
I would like to know the reason.

422
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,870
All the participants accepted the evaluation.

423
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,690
Why would you step forward to ask the reason behind it?

424
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,690
I apologize sincerely for interrupting the contest

425
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,060
and abruptly questioning.

426
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,570
But I am not defying the judgment of a highly regarded superior.

427
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,690
I have already failed, as Your Highness has announced.

428
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,640
Then?

429
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,360
My institute's honor and my life's hope have both been broken.

430
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,250
If I return in shame without even knowing why,

431
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,670
I am afraid I may never be able to hold a brush again, out of regret.

432
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,460
Thus I dare to ask you.

433
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,050
What is it that I lack?

434
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,780
Your painting has a unique composition, unlike any other plum blossom painting.

435
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,410
This alone captivates the viewer.

436
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,800
You have enough skills.

437
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,210
However, the sepals of all the plum blossoms in this painting are facing up,

438
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,060
making them appear like apricot blossoms.

439
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,090
And don't you think these butterflies flying this busily at night

440
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:44,570
betray the painter's shallow motive to attract people's interest?

441
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:50,060
It is the same as selling out the fragrance of plum blossoms symbolizing fidelity and integrity.

442
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,070
You can ask ten times, but your painting is nevertheless a 'fail' to me.

443
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,270
As expected, the butterflies were the problem.

444
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,840
What does that mean?

445
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,890
Don't you see?

446
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,500
His Highness is nitpicking.

447
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,390
There is something in that butterfly painting.

448
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,330
There is something there.

449
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,930
As expected, that butterfly.

450
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,950
What? What about the butterfly? It looks fine.  Why?

451
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,550
The wings are fine. It has antennae—

452
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,980
Butterfly?

453
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,380
 - Gosh...
 - You are fearless. 

454
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,550
 This is my secret signature. 

455
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,880
 I saw that painter at the paint-making house. 

456
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,930
The two surely ... must know each other.

457
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,760
She knows Yul?

458
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,760
Your Highness.

459
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,240
To criticize that the technique is too detailed and makes it too lively...

460
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,640
That's what I'm saying as well—

461
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,700
How do you all feel about it?

462
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,250
The brush tip seems to carry more unexpressed meanings and the plum branches are taut to the point of breaking.

463
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,660
It seems that the painter was swayed by her feelings

464
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,470
and forgot the central theme of the painting.

465
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,020
I also think the blossoms in the painting are too simplified.

466
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,540
They feel crude and unsophisticated.

467
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:41,720
Listening to you all has proven furthermore why this painting is a fail.

468
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,920
Your Highness, are you failing me simply because the blossoms

469
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,650
are not upside down and look like apricot blossoms?

470
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,440
You told the painters that this was a free-spirited competition.

471
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,150
So how could you say such things?

472
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,280
Are you talking back to me?

473
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,780
Forgive me.

474
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,970
Whatever the case,

475
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,570
I see that you tried to show off your finesse with the unconventional composition in this painting

476
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,010
and forgot the essence of the theme. What can I say?

477
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,360
Aigoo, that's right. Hong Cheon Gi got caught.

478
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,190
My painting also shows butterflies flying under the moonlight.

479
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,450
- So why...
 - Come now.

480
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,790
All the world and its phenomena are in the human mind.

481
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,260
Who can she blame?

482
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:37,220
In any case, those who are meant to pass will pass and those who are meant to fail will fail.

483
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,100
I see.

484
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,790
I now realize what it means to hold a painting contest at Maejukheon.

485
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,430
- Good, then.
 - Your Highness...

486
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:59,320
You say that Maejukheon Painting Contest puts aside rank and status and participants compete only with skills.

487
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,450
However... I now know full well that those were merely pleasing words

488
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:10,250
and the results are ultimately decided according to Your Highness's taste and opinion.

489
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,880
Unbelievable!

490
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,140
- Listen to her talk.
 - Goodness.

491
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,910
What a bold wench.

492
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,240
I have disrespected you.

493
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,770
I shall be going now.

494
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,470
Wait!

495
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,370
Your Highness, in my opinion,

496
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,350
the reason the blossoms are not upside down in this painting

497
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,980
is because she had in mind the blossoms of plum trees growing by the waterside

498
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,110
whose branches shoot out in the opposite direction, as in Du Hyang's poetry, Dosumae.

499
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:41,050
Furthermore, the reason they appear like apricot blossoms with all their upward sepals

500
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:49,560
is because the painter is faithfully rendering her feelings as she looked upon those plum flowers.

501
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,820
 What are you doing? 

502
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,680
 Your Highness... 

503
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,390
 she is a divine painter. 

504
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,480
What?

505
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,070
Does that painting have divine powers or something?

506
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,370
How bizarre.

507
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,290
 Do you really mean that Hong Eun Oh's daughter might attend the contest? 

508
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,090
 I tried to prevent her from coming, 

509
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,960
 but I'm telling you just in case she does. 

510
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,350
 I did not realize Eun Oh had a daughter. 

511
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,740
 Promise me. 

512
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,530
 We must fail her. 

513
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,710
 I have no doubt she is the daughter of Hong Eun Oh, 

514
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,120
 the descendant of the divine painter. 

515
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,690
I shall...

516
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,710
use my all-pass tile.

517
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,530
Whoa!

518
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,380
An all-pass tile.

519
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,180
No questions asked.

520
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,030
It is a pass.

521
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,190
The all-pass tile.

522
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,720
 "Mere painter list?" 

523
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,300
 But at the very least, this list has my friends' lives 

524
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,450
 and the honor of Baegyu Painting Institute, 

525
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,580
 and my life's hope written in it. 

526
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,130
Pass!

527
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,150
You did it!

528
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,760
Next.

529
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,500
Obnoxious One, I truly thought there was going to be trouble earlier.

530
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,240
What were you thinking?

531
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,180
I don't know, either.

532
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,290
It is too early to be relieved. I have bad news.

533
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,940
What news?

534
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,070
I think Grand Prince Yangmyeong is the one who bought Wolseongdang's fake Sochundo.

535
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,490
What?

536
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,600
I mean, was it not suspicious that he kept bringing up

537
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,650
- the butterflies in your painting?
 - No way.

538
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,690
If not that, what else would he have against you?

539
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,240
- Gosh, but still.
 - What will you do now?

540
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,350
No one knows whom Jeong Soen Nae sold it to.

541
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,720
Hey, let's say that His Highness did buy my painting.

542
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,000
So why would he not do anything about it all this time?

543
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,560
Aaah, my back!

544
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,960
You keep saying "no way." That's how they break your wrist and your painter life could be over.

545
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,260
Come on, seriously!

546
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,730
Painter Choi.

547
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,780
Good to see you, Painter Choi.

548
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,290
Painter Seong and Painter Jang.

549
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,420
I have to go to the bathroom. I'm off.

550
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,290
- You have to come back on time.
 - You are all here.

551
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,530
- All right, all right.
 - Of course.

552
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,000
It is the first such contest in several years. We could not miss it.

553
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,550
I see I should work harder now that I see you both.

554
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,630
I shall be going now.

555
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,430
Go easy on us, Painter Choi.

556
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,160
See you soon.

557
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,820
Let's go.

558
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,390
Is that not the rude woman painter who talked back to His Highness?

559
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,160
Oh, it is.

560
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,680
The wench who came in with Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy Bureau.

561
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,220
 Supervisor Ha of Astronomy Bureau? 

562
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,810
 Do they mean the scholar? 

563
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,510
He must be here to back his woman since he is close to His Highness.

564
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,910
Even Master Painter Han Geon gave her the all-pass.

565
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,590
I guess it is not just a rumor that he was cursed and became the red-eyed monster.

566
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,580
He must have enchanted the painting to make the butterflies fly to it.

567
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,710
Or maybe she painted honey onto it.

568
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,170
Unbelievable.

569
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,490
What?

570
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,800
Do you know Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy Bureau?

571
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,730
I do. He is the protector god of the king's palace.

572
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,010
That's it?

573
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,370
I hear he is also called the red-eyed monster.

574
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,920
Why?

575
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,270
- Because he has red eyes?
 - Yes.

576
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,790
 No one has ever said that to me before. 

577
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,450
 People call me a monster when they see my eyes. 

578
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,480
If he is a supervisor at the Astronomy Bureau, is he of high rank?

579
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,320
I suppose so.

580
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,520
Why?

581
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,370
Are you interested in him?

582
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,550
Hey! Does asking a question mean having interest?

583
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,550
I'm only curious since they say he has red eyes.

584
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,020
But that curse or something. What is that supposed to mean?

585
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,420
You really are strange today.

586
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,510
I can't believe you show interest in a man.

587
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,260
You know something, don't you?

588
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,230
Come, tell me. Hurry.

589
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,870
Well ...

590
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:16,070
I heard his eyes turned red after he was sacrificed for the Seokcheok Rain Ritual.

591
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,520
What?

592
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,360
- Seokcheok Rain Ritual?
 - That's right.

593
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,000
It was almost 20 years ago.

594
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,890
Hey.

595
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,620
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

596
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,800
No, never mind me.

597
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,600
Twenty years ago was...

598
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,750
 Could he be... 

599
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,100
The second round will start soon.

600
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:53,080
Once each painter is called, tell us your resolution for the second round.

601
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,310
Monk Man Yu.

602
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:01,910
Above all, painting uses brush and ink to draw the whole world and its creatures as a way to enlighten the self

603
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:06,340
and to embrace the masses within it.
  ("Precious Brushstroke" Monk Man Yu) 

604
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,110
Namu Amitabul Avalokitesvara Guan Yin*. 
  (Goddess of mercy in Buddhism) 

605
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,410
Painter Choi Jeong.
  (painter at the Painting Bureau) 

606
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:13,380
A painting is not meant to contain something

607
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,710
but it is a fight between line and line.

608
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,330
I am not one to lose a battle of lines.

609
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,230
I shall win.

610
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,840
How can one win or lose in painting?
  ("Divine Brushstroke" Gang Hui Yeon) 

611
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,780
We can only paint, stroll, and have a good time while we are here.

612
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,740
Most of the people here are daubers from birth.
  ("Magical Brushstroke" Sim Dae Yu (Sim Sat Gat)) 

613
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,280
We paint for a living and grew up practically brawling with our paintings on the streets.

614
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,060
I shall not back down easily.

615
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,460
What a bunch of lousy fancy words.
 (Cha Yeong Uk, Baegyu Institute Painter) 

616
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,850
Fighting?

617
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,670
Aigoo! I should win that fight.

618
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,210
I shall try to bring honor to my family.

619
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,760
Painter Hong Cheon Gi.

620
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,640
It seems this contest could be a playground for high-born noblemen

621
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,260
or a fight for money and honor for other painters.

622
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,760
But for me, it's something my lifelong wish depends on.

623
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,380
And my whole life depends on it.

624
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,000
I must win first place, no matter what.

625
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:34,640
Now, then. I congratulate the twenty of you on making it to the second round.

626
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,530
Are you all prepared for the second round?

627
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,980
Good.

628
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,630
I look forward to seeing your works in the second round.

629
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,710
I shall explain the new rules for the second round.

630
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:55,680
For the second round, you shall use the paper, brush and ink prepared for you by Maejukheon.

631
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,800
The paper is oiled Yujukcheongji 
 (hanji paper that is thin, tough and white, used for drawing portraits) .

632
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,430
If you make a mistake, you cannot start again.

633
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,350
It will be an immediate fail.

634
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,380
One wrong brushstroke, and it's over.

635
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,070
Yujukcheongji...

636
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,550
Is this not the precious paper they use to draw portraits at the Painting Bureau?

637
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,150
Do they expect us to draw a portrait?

638
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,310
What?

639
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,820
Then Annoying One has the upper hand.

640
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,340
You obnoxious bunch.

641
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,090
They wouldn't ask us to draw a portrait.

642
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:30,830
Well, since it's oiled paper, how we use the ink will decide the outcome.

643
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,110
As for the brush, it is made of soft hair.

644
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:36,820
You get to use just one long, thick brush.

645
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,290
If those who cannot use this brush

646
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,110
and those who used a unique brush in the first round

647
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,480
- cannot deliver...
 - One brush? I'm stunned.

648
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,160
- the same results,
 - What do they expect us to do?

649
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,740
- that is also...
 - Just one long-haired, large-sized brush?

650
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,710
- a fail.
 - I want to cry.

651
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,530
It is a long, thick brush without even the stiff core.

652
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:55,010
With just an average painting skill, it would be difficult even to hold the brush right.

653
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,710
If we don't adjust the water well, we can't make delicate strokes.
  (pil chi: individuality of the painting) 

654
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,820
For delicate brushstrokes, you can make the tip of the brush jagged.

655
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,270
We knew that.

656
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,430
Right.

657
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,390
We will soon see who has more skill competing with the same paper, brush and ink.

658
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,150
An experienced painter will adapt to the brush quickly.

659
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,960
Ultimately it will be a battle of the artistry of brushstrokes.

660
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,150
The second round's style is "mountains and rivers". 
 (landscape painting) 

661
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,250
And now the theme.

662
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,140
I leave this one to Supervisor Ha of the Astronomy Bureau.

663
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,330
Your Highness, how could I...

664
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,890
Supervisor Ha is a close friend of mine

665
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,370
and a great astrologist acknowledged by His Majesty.

666
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:49,230
What I mean is that his poetry and prose do not lack anything to serve as an opening statement.

667
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,780
Come forth.

668
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,750
I shall return in a moment.

669
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,740
I will leave it in your care.

670
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,240
The spring air fills the mountains

671
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,780
as we walk among the peach blossoms.

672
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,410
Suddenly the wish for peaches

673
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,780
makes me wander there morning and night.

674
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,980
For the second round, we will give additional points to paintings that touch us with special poignancy.

675
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:52,740
We shall also give additional points to paintings that show bold style and spirit.

676
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:59,150
 Is he truly Ha Ram? 

677
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,420
Now, you have two hours.

678
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,770
 The spring air fills the mountains... 

679
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,980
They all paint without hesitation as if they knew the theme already.

680
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,940
I'm in trouble now.

681
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,620
I should paint horizontally.

682
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,260
Hey. I don't know what's going on, but focus.

683
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,850
 Right. I should ask him after the contest. 

684
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:24,690
 I still cannot believe that you are the Sochundo counterfeit painter. 

685
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,340
 Is it really you? 

686
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,100
 Is it you? 

687
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,580
 I have so much to ask, but I'll save my questions for now. 

688
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,550
♫  Can you see my feelings for you?  ♫

689
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,350
 The peach tree field nineteen years ago. 

690
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:07,300
 I wonder if you still remember that place. 

691
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,760
 I may have cared for you once, 

692
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,010
 but I am already a dead man. 

693
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:23,310
 I cannot forget how warmly you listened to me and held my hand. 

694
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,890
 By chance, did you wait for me? 

695
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,310
 Did you wait for the tomorrow that I had promised you? 

696
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:34,960
 I want to know why you could not come back. 

697
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,350
♫  My one and only  ♫

698
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:46,000
♫  So we don't pass each other like the passing breeze  ♫

699
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,230
♫  I will be here  ♫

700
00:57:53,250 --> 00:58:00,180


701
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:12,660
♫  Do you know that your eyes sparkle  ♫

702
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,270
♫  Like the unreachable stars up above?  ♫

703
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,320
 Lovers of the Red Sky 
 Preview 

704
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,300
 How can you tell me to forget so easily? 

705
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,820
 The reason that boy did not come back for you is because he forgot about you. 

706
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,320
 How long will you keep your mouth shut? 

707
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,510
 Is it so wrong for a painter to attend a painting contest? 

708
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,650
 Do your paintings contain the spirit of your brush and ink at all? 

709
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,800
 People are not touched by a painter's skills. 

710
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,920
 Are you giving up like this? 

711
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,450
 What do you know about me that you are saying this to me? 

712
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,430
 Don't blame only yourself 

713
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,210
 "Don't blame yourself." 

714
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,460
 for things you cannot control. 

715
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,400
 Ha Ram. 

716
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,800
 It is you, isn't it? 

717
00:58:52,500 --> 00:59:00,400
♫  So we don't pass each other like the passing breeze  ♫

718
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,700
