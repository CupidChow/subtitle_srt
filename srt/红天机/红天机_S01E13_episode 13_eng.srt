00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,960


2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,030
 Lovers of the Red Sky

00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,350
 Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob

 Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,250
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,600
 The characters and settings of this drama are fiction and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,130
Go.

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,340
Open the palanquin door.

9
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,980
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,690
Supervisor Ha.

11
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,840
What are you all doing?

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,510
- Hurry and bring a cloth. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,500
Are you all right?

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,790
I am all right.

15
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,670
Give that to me.

16
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,160
That will do.

17
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,810
Back away now.

18
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,070
The bleeding has stopped.

19
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,550
Why did you do this?

20
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,440
I was trying to catch the rat who had snuck onto the palanquin.

21
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,790
You swing an ax to catch a rat?

22
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,330
Are you expecting an apology?

23
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,800
I am Il Wol Seong.

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,100
- So? 
  - I ask that you trust me now.

25
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,010
I heard that a true king treats people with sincerity.

26
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,010
Listen well.

27
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,930
You have lived as Supervisor Ha of the Bureau of Astronomy as well as Il Wol Seong.

28
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,400
If I say that I trust you now, would you believe it?

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,010
It would be difficult for you to trust me right now.

30
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,120
But I have already sworn my loyalty to you as Il Wol Seong as well.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,430
What are you afraid of?

32
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,000
I am not afraid of anything.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,590
That's right.

34
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,920
Now, Your Highness has nothing to be afraid of.

35
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,980
So, do not be hasty and keep calm.

36
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,270
 I shall trust you, Il Wol Seong. 

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,300
 In any case, you will die after the sealing ritual. 

38
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,180
All right, Supervisor Ha.

39
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,490
No. Il Wol Seong.

40
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,360
You have sworn to give Ma Wang to me,

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,670
so I shall trust you from now.

42
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,170
Let us go now.

43
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,140
Yes, Your Highness.

44
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,760
 Your Highness also will find out soon. 

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,720
 What true fear is. 

46
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,780
 How weak and sick it makes a man. 

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,120
Let us go.

48
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,310
Get moving.

49
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,040
 Episode 13: Sealing Ritual 

50
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,910
- Hey.
- Stop that.

51
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,580
Over there. Look.

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
I wonder if his hand is all right.

53
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,750
Uselessly because of me again…

54
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,030
 The sealing ritual will happen. 

55
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,490
 How do you know that? 

56
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,760
 Because Grand Prince Juhyang is overseeing the sealing ritual. 

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,870
 Pardon? 

58
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,680
 Not Grand Prince Yangmyeong, but Grand Prince Juhyang? 

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,430
 Yes. 

60
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,890
 And I will not seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait. 

61
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,400
 What do you mean? 

62
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,600
 Ma Wang will be transferred to Grand Prince Juhyang. 

63
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,140
 He has been preparing for a long time to accept Ma Wang. 

64
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,310
 To accept Ma Wang … 

65
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,010
 I cannot believe it. 

66
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,620
 If there was such a method, 

67
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,000
 we would not have prepared the sealing ritual so tediously, with such difficulty. 

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,350
 If I were you, I would trust His Majesty and Grand Prince Yangmyeong. 

69
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,600
 Then you think I should do as they say, 

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,630
 when they are obsessed with sealing the Ma Wang, whether you become mad or not? 

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,530
 Scholar Sir. 

72
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,840
 If it is for my sake, please reconsider it. 

73
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,400
 Have you forgotten how Grand Prince Juhyang tried to kill my father at Maejukheon? 

74
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,190
 He is a terrifying man. 

75
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,730
 I have already thought enough while I was in prison. 

76
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,350
 Don't think that this decision is only for your sake. 

77
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,530
If he truly does that, I think it will be more dangerous...

78
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,180
What should I do…

79
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,550
You will stay here for the time being.

80
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,480
Tell me if there is anything you need.

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,410
- Yes, Your Highness.
 - And...

82
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,130
I must ask you a favor as Il Wol Seong.

83
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,840
Please ask anything.

84
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,700
I must find a divine item.

85
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,010
 A divine item? 

86
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:43,120
A person intending to accept Ma Wang must possess that divine item.

87
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,850
It is a ring that the abdicated King Yeongjong always wore.

88
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,800
A ring?

89
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,680
It is a divine item to help maintain consciousness even when Ma Wang manifests.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,800
It means I can control...

91
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,090
Ma Wang's power with my will.

92
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,910
But why would you ask me to seek it?

93
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,640
When the abdicated King sealed Ma Wang, he left it at the Taoist Bureau

94
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,250
and the last person who had it

95
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,400
was the head of the Taoist Bureau, Lord Ha Seong Jin.

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,970
Your father.

97
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,570
 Could that divine item be, by chance… 

98
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,530
 It is the one and only jade ring that my father gave to my mother when they were alive. 

99
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,140
 Let us check.  

100
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,140
 What that fate of ours is. 

101
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,420
 Can you see me? 

102
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,470
 I do see you. 

103
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,500
 The ring that allowed me to see the maiden in front of Ma Wang. 

104
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,600
Can you find it for me?

105
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,480
Il Wol Seong is known as Wolseongdang's master.

106
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,230
There is nothing he does not know in all the land,

107
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,180
and he is an infinite source of information on everything.

108
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,950
If you submit a question putting it in the Wolseongdang question box—

109
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,810
- Enough.
 - What comes after is more interesting.

110
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,980
If you submit the question, he gives an answer, right?

111
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,210
How did you know that?

112
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,050
 Supervisor Ha has worked at the palace as an astronomer all his life. 

113
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,940
 How could he have two identities? 

114
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,770
 How? 

115
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,500
 Ma Wang, Supervisor Ha, and Il Wol Seong. 

116
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,230
 There is something suspicious going on among those three. 

117
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,870
 Is there a way to change the scholar's mind? 

118
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,940
 Is there something that I don't know? 

119
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,900
 Just what is he thinking? 

120
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,150
So you mean that the royal portrait is the only way to summon Ma Wang?

121
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,300
Yes, Your Highness. That is so.

122
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,290
The conjuration of the Four-tiger Sword* ( made during the hours, days, months and year of the tiger.  Used for shamanistic rituals to slay demons. )

123
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,520
will only be effective with a royal portrait made by the divine painter.

124
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,240
That is the only way to summon Ma Wang.

125
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,050
Then...

126
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,080
it seems difficult to take Ma Wang before the sealing ritual, Your Highness.

127
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,380
Even when Supervisor Ha is right in front of our eyes…

128
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,200
We have waited 19 years.

129
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,180
Now we must only wait a few more days.

130
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,990
Have you asked Supervisor Ha the whereabouts of the divine item?

131
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,440
I did.

132
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,290
But he seemed not to know.

133
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,090
What happens if we postpone the sealing ritual until we find the divine item?

134
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,200
That will not do.

135
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,550
The divine item has been missing for 19 years

136
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,110
since Lord Ha Seong Jin's death.

137
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,730
Do you know that it cannot be found in one or two days?

138
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,380
Even if Ma Wang is not sealed, he will gradually take over more of the host's body.

139
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,830
Now Supervisor Ha and Ma Wang will become one soon.

140
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,600
When that happens, the sealing ritual and the evocation rite will be of no use.

141
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,520
Thus, once the date for the sealing ritual is set, you must hurry.

142
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,040
 Scholar Sir! 

143
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
 Ma Wang? 

144
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,600
 Is this the power of a divine item? 

145
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,360
 I found my eyes. 

146
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,820
 Don't come closer. 

147
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,730
 Ha Ram! 

148
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,530
 Get away from my son. 

149
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,250
 What are these memories? 

150
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,670
 Are they the spirit of Ma Wang? 

151
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,920
Royal Father.

152
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,450
It may be difficult now to seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait...

153
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,190
as you wish.

154
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,540
Hyeong-nim is…

155
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,030
Juhyang hyeong-nim is...

156
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,950
trying to incorporate Ma Wang in his body.

157
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,400
What should I do, Royal Father?

158
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,460
If the sealing ritual occurs as it is now,

159
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,890
the thing that you wanted to avoid the most…

160
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,790
in this nation

161
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,700
a tornado of blood will occur.

162
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,750
 Truly an extraordinary work. 

163
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,040
 I can feel Royal Grandfather's spirit. 

164
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,900
I did not like the color of the red sulfide,

165
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,120
so I was on my way back from the paint storage.

166
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,950
Are you not tired?

167
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,950
I am all right.

168
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,130
More important ...

169
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,610
I heard His Majesty has collapsed.

170
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,710
Is Your Highness all right?

171
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,920
I am fine.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,790
Do not worry. The sealing ritual will take place as planned.

173
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,300
But now that Royal Father fell ill,

174
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,660
my brother, Grand Prince Juhyang, is to take over the sealing ritual.

175
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Is Grand Prince Juhyang truly trying to incorporate Ma Wang?

176
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,920
How did you…

177
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,460
Then would it not harm the scholar?

178
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,380
Where did you hear such a thing?

179
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,790
I heard it from the scholar on his way to Grand Prince Juhyang's place.

180
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,280
I told you not to meet him until the royal portrait is finished.

181
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,750
Forgive me.

182
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,970
Then...

183
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,740
is the royal portrait not needed for the sealing ritual anymore?

184
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,800
No.

185
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:05,060
Ma Wang can only be summoned out of Supervisor Ha with the royal portrait.

186
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,780
I suspect Hyeong-nim is preparing to accept Ma Wang

187
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,490
into his body in time for then.

188
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,160
If that happens, what happens to the scholar?

189
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,820
I do not know.

190
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,040
But no matter what Hyeong-nim plans to do,

191
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,100
I will certainly seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait.

192
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:46,540
The only thing we can do now is to do our best in our given tasks.

193
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,010
Then I shall complete the royal portrait without fail.

194
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,300
Your Highness must by all means ...

195
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,860
succeed in the sealing ritual.

196
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes. I swear it.

197
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,780
Let's not lose our resolve and let's push through.

198
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,100
His Highness is here.

199
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,160
Welcome, Your Highness.

200
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,630
So, are the preparations going well?

201
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,630
Yes.

202
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,290
I thought the royal portrait would be completed before Buddha's Birthday in April

203
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,300
so we have begun to set free the koi* in the King's palace.
 (carp of a large ornamental variety) 

204
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,890
Your Highness must also be careful not to do anything

205
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,490
that would bring bad luck before the sealing ritual.

206
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,170
I shall watch myself.

207
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,510
But I hear Grand Prince Juhyang will be overseeing the sealing ritual.

208
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,250
It seems so.

209
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,790
Is it truly all right in these circumstances?

210
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,610
Listen, Royal Shaman.

211
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,900
The biggest enemy in this sealing ritual is Hyeong-nim.

212
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,200
His goal is not the sealing ritual.

213
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,030
What do you mean?

214
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,590
He is preparing to incorporate Ma Wang into his body.

215
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,910
To be possessed?

216
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,540
Yes.

217
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,750
It seems Hyeong-nim has waited a long time for the day to incoporate Ma Wang.

218
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,000
So you and I must prepare and make sure to succeed in sealing Ma Wang into the royal portrait.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,910
That is what Royal Father wished for until the end.

220
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:49,390
So, if the sealing fails and Ma Wang goes into Hyeong-nim's body...

221
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:56,400
Once Grand Prince Juhyang is possessed by Ma Wang, he will cease to be a normal being.

222
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
What must we do then?

223
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,550
Forgive me for saying this,

224
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,740
but there is only one method.

225
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,760
What is it?

226
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,280
There is no alternative but to slay him on the spot.

227
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,070
You mean I should point a sword at Hyeong-nim?

228
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,320
You have already witnessed it.

229
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,630
After that happens, we cannot call him a human being.

230
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,630
He will harm everyone around him and become a big burden for the royal family.

231
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,220
What His Majesty tried so hard to prevent will happen.

232
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,110
Then maybe they don't need the royal portrait.

233
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,810
That's what I'm saying.

234
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,870
How many times do I have to tell you?

235
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,510
- So—
 - Yes, yes.

236
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,140
Even if the sealing ritual happens, Supervisor Ha is against sealing Ma Wang,

237
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,760
that seed of evil, in the royal portrait,

238
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,930
so it may be of no use to finish the royal portrait,

239
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,270
but to summon Ma Wang, we still need the royal portrait,

240
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,790
because the sealing ritual will happen one way or another.

241
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,900
- Huh? Am I right?
 - Yes. That's it.

242
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,010
So what I'm saying is, why finish a royal painting that will be used for a bad deed?

243
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Hey. Grand Prince Yangmyeong swore that we would seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait.

244
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,150
Is he the Grand Prince for nothing?

245
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,980
Don't think about anything else.

246
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,420
I am a painter, so I just need to meet the deadline.

247
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,100
Got it?

248
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,180
You are right.

249
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,340
You shouldn't consider the situation. Just do your duty as a painter.

250
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,120
Fine. You two are truly remarkable.

251
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,600
I am a man without a sense of obligation or duty, happy?

252
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,490
Seriously.

253
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,320
That is not what I mean. Why are you being so...

254
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,770
Enough of this.

255
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,260
Just hurry and help me.

256
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,670
I'll melt the glue.

257
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,500
All right.

258
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,380
At least, thank a person for helping you…

259
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 Ha Ram, you said once that each painting has its own will. 

260
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,140
 The will to find its owner. 

261
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,470
 I will prove it for your sake. 

262
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:20,410
♫  On a day still like this, can you hug me?  ♫

263
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,360
♫  I am waiting again just for you  ♫

264
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,460
 Maiden. 

265
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,070
 Do not come to the sealing ritual. 

266
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,570
 Please, I beg you. 

267
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,680
You are here.

268
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,510
The date has been set.

269
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,300
We shall repay all our grudges at this sealing ritual.

270
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,710
Mi Su.

271
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,130
Juhyang.

272
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,130
Yangmyeong.

273
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,300
- And even the King.
 -Yes, sir.

274
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,200
We shall have to use all the cards that we have prepared so far.

275
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,960
Clean Wolseongdang and Simcheonggak of all traces of our activity.

276
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,500
Yes, sir. I will do as you command.

277
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,280
Hey, grab that glue.

278
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,700
Just a little bit.

279
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,950
Too much, too much.

280
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,740
Hey, you need this much, at least.

281
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,540
You two. What are you doing here again?

282
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,310
Forgive me, Your Highness, Master Han.

283
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,940
There was not enough time for me to do it alone, so…

284
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,490
We shall commence today's council.

285
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,960
I hear Gyeongsang-do was affected by the flood.

286
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,420
Did a report arrive?

287
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,780
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,660
Begin baechae*. 
  (Filling in the colors from the back of the silk)  

289
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,760
Five days left.

290
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,210
Are all the preparations in place?

291
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,590
Your Majesty, it is time for them to pay for their sins.

292
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,310
God of the skies, aid us!

293
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,470
 Aid us. 

294
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,360
Aid us, god of the skies.

295
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
 Aid us. 

296
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,600
 Royal Father, I shall accomplish the royal portrait sealing ritual. 

297
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,870
Until His Majesty wakes up,

298
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,280
make certain no people who could be rebels can enter the palace.

299
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,360
 Yes, Your Highness! 

300
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:53,100
Your Highness, you must fast for the next three days and keep yourself pure.

301
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,700
Slowly, slowly.

302
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,990
I think it's finished.

303
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,230
 The royal portrait is completed. 

304
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,730
It is a small Tiger Sword.

305
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,290
It is a precious sword that can slay any spirit or ghost.

306
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:54,100
It is impossible to eliminate Ma Wang with this, but it will allow you to slay any human.

307
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,360
But because this sword gains its powers from the spirit of the one who wields it,

308
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,900
I cannot guarantee Your Highness' life.

309
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,440
If that happens,

310
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,600
I shall slay Hyeong-nim and die with him.

311
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,650
Are all the preparations ready?

312
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,720
Please wait 15 minutes.

313
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,560
Why would they suddenly move up the sealing ritual?

314
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,450
Tonight at the hour of swine*?
 (Between 9 p.m. - 11 p.m.) 

315
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,280
Yes.

316
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,020
Grand Prince Yangmyeong and the Shamanist Bureau

317
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,830
are both bewildered that we suddenly changed the date.

318
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,260
They probably did not suspect that it was the Royal Shaman who set tonight as the date.

319
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,390
Il Wol Seong also seemed disconcerted.

320
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,960
Once the sealing ritual begins, and Ma Wang manifests,

321
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,230
burn the royal portrait.

322
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,570
Would it not be dangerous to burn it?

323
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:21,200
Should we not leave it in case Ma Wang does not enter Your Highness' body and goes on a rampage?

324
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,450
The military strategy book says to take a battle position with water behind you.

325
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,300
It means you must push yourself to the verge of death to find a way to live.

326
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,020
There is no reason to prepare somewhere to escape to.

327
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,940
Yes. Understood, Your Highness.

328
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,780
Yul will not stay put.

329
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,330
He will want to finish the sealing ritual safely however he can.

330
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,460
But today will be the last day he can think so idly.

331
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,070
Should you not exterminate everyone who will have witnessed the evocation rite

332
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,000
after the sealing ritual, as the abdicated king did?

333
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,550
Yes, I should.

334
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:02,200
Once the sealing ritual ends, everything will be buried.

335
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,050
 Tonight at the hour of the swine. 

336
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,750
 Suddenly changing the date… 

337
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,690
 Is it Mi Su's doing? 

338
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,670
His Highness is here.

339
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,080
It is all right.

340
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,420
Finish dressing.

341
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,750
Yes, Your Highness.

342
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,760
You must have heard that the sealing ritual will happen tonight.

343
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,020
The date that you set was too late.

344
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,130
I asked the Royal Shaman to set the earliest date.

345
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,250
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,050
We shall depart at the hour of the dog*,
 (7 p.m. - 9 p.m.) 

347
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,200
so wait in your room and rest until then.

348
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,930
I must ... stop by Wolseongdang for a moment.

349
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,990
What do you mean?

350
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,150
There is information about the divine item that Your Highness has asked for.

351
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,810
- What?
 - But that is ...

352
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,450
Fine.

353
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,490
But you must return by the hour of dog.

354
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,500
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,040
I have to drop by Baegyu Painting Institute for a little while.

356
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,360
What?

357
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,940
Why suddenly?

358
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,080
 I have to see Father. 

359
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,120
Sir, sir!

360
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,720
It has been too long since I saw you last.

361
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,850
Have you been well?

362
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,490
How could I have been well without you?

363
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,660
Still, it is a relief that you look well.

364
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,350
Yes. Let's go inside.

365
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,320
Yes, sir.

366
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,490
You are here.

367
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,230
Yes.

368
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,800
It sure has been many years.

369
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,060
I hear it is tonight, at the hour of the swine  (9 p.m. - 11 p.m.) .

370
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,510
Hide Wolseongdang's assassins at the sealing ritual as planned.

371
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,270
Will you give us a signal?

372
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,920
No.

373
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,190
Once Ma Wang is sealed in Grand Prince Juhayng's body,

374
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,850
you must act, even if I am unconscious.

375
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,630
Yes, sir.

376
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,500
Wouldn't ghosts rush out at the sealing ritual and somehow possess us?

377
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,580
The things you imagine…

378
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,630
Just be diligent making paint.

379
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,260
Legendary aiding painters would have been there too when Father painted the royal portrait.

380
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,640
Legendary aiding painters?

381
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,450
Scholar Sir.

382
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,270
Maiden.

383
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,390
There is no time.

384
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,680
I am here to discuss what we couldn't finish last time.

385
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,440
Right, right. There's not much time.

386
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,570
Now, now, please come inside.

387
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,860
We'll be inside.

388
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,840
Why?

389
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,800
That man…

390
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,210
Will you walk with me for a while?

391
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,840
You still haven't changed your mind?

392
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,340
Yes.

393
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,180
I am protecting you and doing what I must.

394
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,260
So please trust me.

395
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,640
Then, this sealing ritual will only be a show

396
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,600
and the ritual to transfer Ma Wang to Grand Prince Juhyang will take place.

397
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,430
Yes.

398
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,970
Scholar Sir.

399
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,270
Please reconsider it.

400
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,100
I will not go mad because I did not make a bargain with Hwacha.

401
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,930
Hwacha?

402
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,790
I heard that painters go mad

403
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,540
if they make a bargain with Hwacha while painting the royal portrait.

404
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,400
But I finished it without making a deal.

405
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,030
So please, don't worry about it further.

406
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,740
Giving Ma Wang to Grand Prince Juhyang

407
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:03,500
is not right, neither for you nor for Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

408
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,590
Scholar Sir…

409
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,670
Is there an alleyway nearby?

410
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,410
Yes, just ahead to the right.

411
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,930
Give me a signal.

412
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,120
We must lose the palanquin man.

413
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,770
All right.

414
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,980
 - Oh, apologies. Are you all right? 
 - Now.

415
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:55,440
Do you have the ring that I gave to you as a token of my love?

416
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,520
Yes, I always have it on.

417
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,590
I am afraid it is a divine item connected to Ma Wang.

418
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,560
Pardon?

419
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,780
You could be in danger if you have it.

420
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,880
It is dangerous for you to have it.

421
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,950
Give it to me now.

422
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,750
But how could that be…

423
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,260
Are you sure it is this ring?

424
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,750
I came here to make certain of it.

425
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,900
Give it to me, quickly.

426
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,020
It is time.

427
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,290
- We must go now.
 - All right.

428
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,920
Scholar Sir.

429
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,320
It is not that I wasn't afraid of madness.

430
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,640
I thought perhaps...

431
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,280
this could be the last moment when I clearly remember you.

432
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,120
Still, I thought that if I could use my abilities to rescue you,

433
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,560
to save you...

434
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,390
then that was enough.

435
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,990
That is how I finished the royal portrait.

436
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,510
From beginning to end, I painted it for you.

437
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,250
So, I wish for Ma Wang to be sealed in the royal portrait.

438
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,200
Maiden.

439
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,130
Never ever come to the sealing ritual.

440
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,100
- Have you found out about the ring?
 - Yes.

441
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,200
This is the divine item?

442
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,980
I do sense a divine aura, but...

443
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,860
Examine it closely.

444
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,610
I shall examine it at the temple.

445
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,630
Do so.

446
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:43,170
But why did you meet with the divine painter?

447
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,890
She is my lover.

448
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,070
The divine painter is your lover?

449
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,250
Yes.

450
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,610
I had something to tell her before the ritual took place.

451
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,720
She will not negatively affect the sealing ritual.

452
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,900
An odd match.

453
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,690
I understand. Make haste.

454
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,950
We must leave before sundown.

455
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,710
Yes, Your Highness.

456
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,410
The relationship between those two is quite unusual.

457
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,730
 Strange. 

458
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,600
I feel the aura of a divine item, but it does not glow.

459
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,720
- Good work.
 - Yes.

460
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,810
 How is it used? 

461
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,640
Today is not a good day for holding the sealing ritual.

462
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,710
The humans seem ignorant of the fact.

463
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,410
I see that a sacrifice by someone cannot be avoided.

464
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:01,310
You must not intervene tonight.

465
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,460
Supervisor Ha.

466
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,070
Have you prepared yourself?

467
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,970
Yes, Your Highness.

468
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:46,270
I cannot undo everything with a single word.

469
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,970
But I really wanted to tell you this before the sealing ritual.

470
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,940
I do not know why you became Il Wol Seong,

471
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,290
but I tried to understand you.

472
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,770
What do you mean?

473
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,390
The reason you have come to this...

474
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,500
Isn't it all because of the Seokcheok Rain Ritual 19 years ago?

475
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,900
You lost your sight since that day,

476
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,890
and you came to be possessed by Ma Wang that day.

477
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:21,180
On behalf of this nation's royal family, my Royal Father,

478
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,530
and the predecessor king, my Royal Grandfather,

479
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,610
I would like to apologize.

480
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,430
Forgive us.

481
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,390
An apology?

482
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,950
I am undeserving.

483
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,010
No.

484
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,260
 You cannot apologize so easily 

485
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,700
 when you don't know what I have endured all these years, Your Highness. 

486
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,320
- Royal Shaman, how …
 - It has been too long, Wol Seon.

487
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,570
Now, stand aside.

488
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,210
This is a royal command.

489
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,360
His Majesty commanded me to lead the ritual.

490
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,110
Grand Prince Juhyang will preside over the ritual, not you.

491
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,370
 How did Shaman Mi Su ... 

492
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,400
 What is going on? 

493
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,200
There is no need for agitation.

494
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,980
Wol Seon, you follow my instructions from now on.

495
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,090
The other shamans, stay in your places.

496
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,580
Sa sara baya ha gara ho ha ta um…

497
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,860
Is the royal portrait ready?

498
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,940
It is already here and is being completed.

499
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,010
Then, let's prepare the ritual.

500
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,040
- Bring the talisman.
 - Yes.

501
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,060
 Heavens, I pray. 

502
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:59,300
 Heavens that oversee this land, the wind, and the sun. 

503
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,310
 Heavens that look over and know of all my pain. 

504
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:08,300
 I pray, remember their sins. 

505
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,270
 Let me have my revenge on those who say and do evil things. 

506
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,880
 Let their line of descendants end 

507
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,390
 and let their names be erased from history. 

508
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:25,780
 Let everything they desire turn to a pile of ashes. 

509
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,800
 And please protect her. 

510
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:44,540
You must not leave this place until the sealing ritual is over.

511
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,550
Promise me.

512
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,360
Yes, Your Highness.

513
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,650
Good work, everyone.

514
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,000
Then, I shall see you when it is over.

515
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,580
Please be careful.

516
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,850
Look how kind-hearted Grand Prince Yangmyeong is.

517
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,300
He is a good man.

518
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,770
Now that we're about to begin, I'm getting chills.

519
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,010
It really is an extraordinary event.

520
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,730
Stop rambling on.

521
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,130
What will you do now?

522
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,930
We must leave it up to the heavens.

523
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,060
You seem busier than usual today.

524
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,250
Forgive me, Hyeong-nim.

525
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,250
Yul.

526
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,570
One cannot dip their feet twice in the same stream of water

527
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,260
and the flow of time only moves forward.

528
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,740
It cannot come back.

529
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,200
Remember what I say.

530
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,070
Hyeong-nim.

531
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,920
Once, when we were still children,

532
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,910
you shed tears in front of Royal Grandfather

533
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,410
because you had a nightmare.

534
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:40,610
Do you remember what he said after he set you on his lap?

535
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,200
"Hu, how do you know if it's a dream if you are in it?

536
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,060
To realize that it's a dream, you must wake up."

537
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,580
What are you trying to say?

538
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,810
I cannot aver that everything you want

539
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,880
is fleeting, empty, and in vain.

540
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,620
But do not forget the pain and suffering Royal Grandfather endured all his life

541
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,740
after gaining Ma Wang, and how he returned to a mere handful of dust.

542
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,490
I am also no different than he.

543
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,370
Is that what you think?

544
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,890
Begin!

545
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,570
Yes, Your Highness.

546
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,700
Sa sara baya ha gara ho ha ta um…

547
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,720
 Is this Ma Wang? 

548
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,200
 I cannot control this power... 

549
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,350
 Is that the Predecessor King's ring? 

550
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,900
 Then is this ring fake? 

551
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,810
Prepare yourselves!

552
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,370
Royal Shaman, hurry and start the Ma Wang possession ritual.

553
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:36,520
Sa sara baya ha gara ho ha ta um.

554
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,980
Sa sara baya ha.

555
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,240
ho ha ya.

556
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:18,330
Supervisor Ha, Ma Wang is mine now.

557
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,790
You wretch!

558
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,330
Sa sara baya ha gara ho ha.

559
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:56,720
Sa sara baya ha gara ho ha.

560
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
Your Highness!

561
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,680
Protect His Highness!

562
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,600
- Hey, Cheon Gi.
 - Are you crazy...

563
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,040
Your Highness.

564
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,710
 Now! 

565
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,990
 I must seal it in the royal portrait before it is too late… 

566
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:50,770
Everybody, guard the ritual dais tightly!

567
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,540
- Guard the place!
 - Yes, sir!

568
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,330
 Guard it! 

569
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,560
No. No.

570
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,790
No. No!

571
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,290
 How could this be… 

572
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,040
How did this happen?

573
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,850
How could the divine painting…

574
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,970
Stop ... Stop him!

575
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,880
Cheon Gi.

576
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,560
Scholar Sir!

577
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,750
Painter Hong.

578
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:29,080
Scholar Sir, wake up.

579
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,470
 Cheon Gi. 

580
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,990
We must expel Ma Wang.

581
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,610
 I cannot control my body. 

582
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,350
Stand back.

583
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,910
Scholar Sir, wake up!

584
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,540
My eyes.

585
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,160
My eyes.

586
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,110
Your Highness!

587
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,330
Scholar Sir.

588
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,030
It's me.

589
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,110
- Hong Cheon Gi.
 -  It's dangerous. 

590
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,730
 Move back, Cheon Gi! 

591
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,710
 - Supervisor Ha …
 - Run away, please! 

592
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,730
- Scholar Sir.
 -  No, no. 

593
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,840
 No! 

594
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,070
 Cheon Gi! 

595
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,620
 Those are my eyes! 

596
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Take your hands off her this instant, Ma Wang!

597
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:39,180


598
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,850
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

599
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,660
 Scholar Sir, Scholar Sir! 

600
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,430
 You mean you lost Supervisor Ha? 

601
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,800
 Royal Father, just how much did you know? 

602
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,930
 You are responsible for the failure of this sealing ritual. 

603
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,550
 Do you mean to send me into exile? 

604
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,920
 Don't worry, Father. I'll save you soon. 

605
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,210
 Don't touch my daughter! 

606
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,350
 Father! Please spare him. 

607
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,880
 Please spare my father. 

608
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,710
 Supervisor Ha will appear soon enough. 

609
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,190
 No one will ever be able to hurt you again. 

610
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,200
♫  I will still be here.  ♫

611
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,830
 Scholar Sir? 

612
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,390
♫  All you have to do is come to me  ♫

613
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,700
 Lovers of the Red Sky
