 The characters and settings of this drama are fiction and have no connection to historical facts. 

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,240
Scholar Sir.

7
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,360
It's me. Hong Cheon Gi.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
 It's dangerous, Cheon Gi. 

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,020
  - Supervisor Ha.
 - Run away, please! 

10
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,070
Scholar Sir.

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,640
 No, no! 

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,240
 No! 

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,130
 Cheon Gi! 

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,650
Those are my eyes!

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,740
Take your hands off her this instant, Ma Wang!

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,880
 It is a small Tiger Sword. 

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,440
 But because this sword gains its powers from the spirit of the one who wields it 

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,030
 I cannot guarantee You Highness' life. 

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,400
 Now, is it finally over? 

20
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,920
Ma Wang's aura is disappearing.

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,240
It is because of the Tiger Sword.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,990
The divine Tiger Sword is obstructing Ma Wang's powers.

23
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,960
Then, is everything over?

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,160
No.

25
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,080
Due to that human's sacrifice,

26
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,650
Ma Wang has only been resealed in Ha's body.

27
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,200
Scholar Sir.

28
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,530
Scholar Sir, Scholar Sir.

29
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,020
Scholar Sir.

30
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,990
Scholar Sir.

31
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,440
Scholar Sir.

32
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,940
- Are you all right? 
 - Maiden!

33
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,360
Maiden, are you all right?

34
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Forgive me. Please forgive me.

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
Do not apologize.

36
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,950
Arrest them right now!

37
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,650
Yes, Your Highness.

38
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,350
You must hurry and escape, Scholar Sir.

39
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,800
The royal portrait has already been torn. Hurry.

40
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,160
Scholar Sir.

41
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,760
Sir, you must leave this place immediately.

42
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,450
You must not lose him!

43
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,630
Obtain his ring!

44
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,650
Hurry!

45
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,430
Arrest Supervisor Ha!

46
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,820
I will kill you right here ...

47
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,270
Il Wol Seong.

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,030
You...

49
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,380
 Episode 14: A Narrow Escape 

50
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,400
You are here.

51
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,210
Is it Mae Hyang?

52
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,030
Yes, Master Il Wol Seong.

53
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,050
 Il Wol Seong? 

54
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,280
Are you certain Sunguijeon is safe?

55
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,270
Yes.

56
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,670
This is where the memorial tablets of the past kings are kept,

57
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,410
so they will not be able to get here.

58
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,570
I see.

59
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,630
Please, come inside.

60
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,420
Let us go inside.

61
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,940
You may go now.

62
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,650
Give me your arm.

64
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,880
Are you severely hurt?

65
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,990
No, I'm all right.

66
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,480
But what does it mean ...

67
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,220
that you are Il Wol Seong?

68
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,010
Please pretend you did not hear it.

69
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,940
All right.

70
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,210
Thank you.

71
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:29,630
♫  The seasons change and the flowers may wilt  ♫

72
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,490
 In a world where I could not see, 

73
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,260
 you were my only shining star. 

74
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,510
 In the world where I could see, you were my  

75
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,180
 only precious memory. 

76
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,300
 Ha Ram. 

77
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,520
 I swear on my fate to protect yours. 

78
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,800
♫  when despair comes.  ♫

79
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,990
 No one will ever hurt you again. 

80
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,900
♫  I wait for your love again  ♫

81
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,100
 Thank you for coming back, Ha Ram. 

82
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,300
 I love you truly, Maiden. 

83
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,300
You mean you lost Supervisor Ha?

84
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,130
Forgive us, Your Highness.

85
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,450
No.

86
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,260
I had let my guard down.

87
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,400
Who would have known Supervisor Ha was hiding the real ring?

88
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,920
Will Supervisor Ha gain Ma Wang's powers now?

89
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,630
He may have the ring,

90
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,020
but he will not possess Ma Wang's powers completely.

91
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,520
Why is that?

92
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,150
Such enormous power by its very nature intoxicates a person and makes him greedy.

93
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,190
If someone with divine powers like me does not control the ring's power,

94
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,280
he will soon be taken over by that power.

95
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,500
If he is taken over by Ma Wang,

96
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,100
will he become a monster as he did at the sealing ritual?

97
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,760
Is that not also dangerous?

98
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,770
Thus, before Supervisor Ha is completely taken over by Ma Wang,

99
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,770
we must perform the sealing ritual again.

100
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't we need the royal portrait to summon Ma Wang again?

101
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,680
We must arrest Painter Hong Cheon Gi first.

102
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,580
I have an excellent plan.

103
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,630
 Jeongan Hall 

104
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,720
Today's sealing ritual...

105
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,690
was a failure, Royal Father.

106
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,770
Forgive me.

107
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,080
As expected, Hyeong-nim

108
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,950
is trying to transfer Ma Wang to his body.

109
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:12,050
And  on top of that Supervisor Ha is also this nation's most substantial source of information, Il Wol Seong.

110
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,970
Royal Father.

111
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,930
Just how much did you know?

112
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,200
You must wake up soon and tell me ...

113
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,300
Please tell me, Royal Father.

114
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,950
Your Highness.

115
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,330
Hyeong-nim will never give up.

116
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,970
He will certainly attempt to have the sealing ritual again.

117
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,050
But a sealing ritual without a royal portrait is of no use.

118
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,130
There would be no way to summon Ma Wang.

119
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,770
Right.

120
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,850
But Your Highness, did you not sense something strange at this sealing ritual?

121
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,240
Do you remember how the royal portrait was torn during the sealing ritual?

122
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,640
It was certainly a divine painting, but if Ma Wang was able to rip it,

123
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,980
it means there is something missing to seal Ma Wang.

124
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,400
You mean we need something else other than the divine painting?

125
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,540
Perhaps we need to use something other than the royal portrait's divine quality.

126
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,060
Something else...

127
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,550
Look into it as soon as you can.

128
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,910
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,600
But...

130
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,190
What more is there now?

131
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,240
Forgive me, but...

132
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,240
I was attacked by Ma Wang at the sealing ritual

133
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,390
and have lost all my divine powers.

134
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,610
What is it?

135
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,550
You are responsible for the failure of this sealing ritual.

136
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,410
- Hyeong-nim.
 - Or ...

137
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,020
do you have a way to undo all of this?

138
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,500
What do you mean? You are being unreasonable.

139
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,400
You know better than me that the sealing ritual's failure

140
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,140
- wasn't because of me— 
 - Shut ...

141
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,960
your mouth.

142
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,820
I shall spare your life, as we are brothers.

143
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,590
Go far away and spend the rest of your life there.

144
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Hyeong-nim. Do you intend to send me to exile?

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,810
Good, you understand.

146
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,800
Hyeong-nim. Why are you doing this?

147
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
No, Headmaster!

148
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,370
Why are you doing this?

149
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,250
Aigoo. Sir!

150
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,110
These criminals were aware that Painter Hong Cheon Gi was an  painter of counterfeit paintings

151
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,770
but allowed her to enter the Painting Bureau under Grand Prince Yangmyeong's protection

152
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,960
and schemed with Wolseongdang to sell counterfeits.

153
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,770
This man, Jeong Soen Nae, has all the evidence.

154
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,550
For that crime, Baegyu Painting Institute will be closed as of today

155
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,270
and the criminals will all be put to jail.

156
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,820
Cheon Gi is my daughter.

157
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,430
Where is my daughter—

158
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,800
Spare me!

159
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,810
Goodness, we have never done such a thing.

160
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,140
This is unjust, Sir.

161
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,910
Take them.

162
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,430
What are you doing? Let me go.

163
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,340
If we get arrested too, who is going to help Cheon Gi?

164
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,290
And we don't even know if Obnoxious One is alive.

165
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,000
- Spare us.
 - Aigoo.

166
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
This is unjust.

167
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,870
Little rats.

168
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,750
I said I would make you sorry one day.

169
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,450
It feels so good, Hyeong-nim.

170
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,550
Hyeong-nim, now all we have to do is catch that wench, Hong Cheon Gi.

171
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,900
 Wanted 

172
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,040
 Wanted Rebels: Hong Chun Gi, painter at the Painting Bureau and Ha Ram, master of Wolseongdang 

173
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,060
 Ten silver nyang as reward. 

174
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,420
 Wanted 

175
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,330
 So Hyeong-nim finally has gotten to the point of no return. 

176
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,930
Your Highness?

177
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,610
How...

178
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,180
Your Highness?

179
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,870
You are here.

180
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,700
- How did you ...
 - Let's go.

181
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,750
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,760
How could someone in exile be in the capital? 
  (Yi Hyeon Mo - Military Affairs Administrator) 

183
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,690
What happened?

184
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,450
 Let him go. 

185
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,320
 Your Highness, I am relieved I was not late. 

186
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,780
 You are just on time. 

187
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,990
 If we had not switched them with our men, it would have been terrible. 

188
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,010
 It was a truly wise foresight, Your Highness. 

189
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,670
 It was obvious that the next step for Hyeong-nim was to get rid of me. 

190
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,300
 Yes. 

191
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,880
 Let us return to the capital. 

192
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,420
So that is what happened.

193
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,270
I have a favor to ask you.

194
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,410
Ask anything.

195
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,340
I cannot show myself,

196
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,100
so please keep an eye on Hyeong-nim, though it may be difficult.

197
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,310
Yes, I will.

198
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,310
Thank you.

199
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,150
I need to speak with Wol Seon for a moment.

200
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,810
Then, I shall be going first.

201
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,920
Is there truly no way for you to regain your divine powers?

202
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,100
No. Forgive me.

203
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,800
This is terrible.

204
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Painter Hong and Supervisor Ha have disappeared and you have lost your divine powers.

205
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,160
In any case now Grand Prince Juhyang is desperate to find Painter Hong and Supervisor Ha.

206
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,620
If he catches the two,

207
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,400
no one will be able to stop the Ma Wang evocation rite.

208
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,090
I wish Royal Father would regain consciousness at a time like this.

209
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,260
I agree.

210
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,360
If we cannot stop him, then...

211
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,660
What is it?

212
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,130
Nothing.

213
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,240
Are you all right?

214
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
Yes.

215
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,630
When I think of the sealing ritual,

216
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,750
I almost can't believe ... that I'm here with you.

217
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,830
I'm glad you are safe.

218
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,230
But...

219
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,600
What is it? Is there something troubling you?

220
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,680
Why do you think the royal painting ripped?

221
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,220
Even the chief royal shaman at the Shamanist Bureau said it had divine powers.

222
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,860
That was why the sealing ritual went ahead.

223
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,480
What could have been the problem?

224
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,830
It is for the better.

225
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,180
What do you mean?

226
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,950
Maiden.

227
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,230
Are you considering another sealing ritual, after all you went through?

228
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,630
My heart ...

229
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,850
is in agony.

230
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,100
We must seal Ma Wang in a divine royal portrait somehow.

231
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,340
No. You should never paint the royal portrait again.

232
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,720
Then, is there another way?

233
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,980
If we do not seal Ma Wang, what will happen to you then?

234
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,200
The heavens will not betray us so easily.

235
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,820
How could you say that, when you don't know what adversity could befall you?

236
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,880
Countless people died because of Ma Wang already.

237
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,090
This existence called Ma Wang must be sealed.

238
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,330
I will complete the royal portrait again, no matter what.

239
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,750
When the sealing ritual takes place again,

240
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,310
please help me seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait.

241
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,000
I beg you.

242
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,200
No one can change my mind right now.

243
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,970
Scholar Sir.

244
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,250
Why...

245
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,060
 Sunguijeon 

246
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,420
 No. You should never paint the royal portrait again. 

247
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,050
 You must never paint the royal portrait! 

248
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,720
 You know she will go mad after she is finished. 

249
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,020
♫  As if nothing had happened  ♫

250
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,210
♫  Our memories will be erased, too.  ♫

251
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,570
 Ha Ram. 

252
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:35,700
 If I can, as long as I am alive, I will fight Ma Wang. 

253
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,540
 I will... 

254
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,300
 I will seal that terrible Ma Wang in the royal portrait that I paint. 

255
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,980
♫  your heart won't do what I want.  ♫

256
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,500
♫  Even when the seasons change and the flowers wilt too  ♫

257
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,600
 I never said it in words, 

258
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,400
 but I love you, Ha Ram. 

259
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,300
 If I can protect you by keeping you far from me, 

260
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,580
 I will push you away a thousand, even a million times. 

261
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,410
 I am sorry, Maiden. 

262
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,030
 Royal Investigations Bureau 

263
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,540
Are you Painter Hong's father?

264
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,360
Painter Hong?

265
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,900
Shall I paint you something?

266
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,000
Paintings to repel evil spirits, portraits, or sehwas.

267
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,440
I can paint anything.

268
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,420
 Madness, for certain. 

269
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,210
- Take him.
 - Yes, sir.

270
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,030
Take him out.

271
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Why are you doing this?

272
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,130
Let me go.

273
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,170
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

274
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,480
Your Majesty, please reconsider!

275
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,430
Move out of the way!

276
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,580
Clear the path!

277
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,390
Criminal coming through.

278
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,230
Watch with your two eyes.

279
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,630
- He is Hong Eun Oh of Baegyu Painting Institute.
 - Clear the path.

280
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,640
He is the father of Hong Cheon Gi at Baegyu Painting Institute.

281
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,870
Move aside.

282
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,370
Shall I paint you something?

283
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,860
I said, move!

284
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,920
Come now.

285
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,070
Move aside.

286
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,130
Move aside.

287
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,730
How terrible!

288
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,910
 Wanted 

289
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,210
 Sungeuijeon 

290
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,360
What happened to Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

291
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,470
After the sealing ritual failed, Grand Prince Juhyang blamed him for its failure

292
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,340
and exiled him to Ganghwa-do.

293
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,520
- Exile?
 - Yes.

294
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,980
That is not all.

295
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,300
They framed Painter Hong for running away after painting counterfeits at the Painting Bureau

296
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,160
and her father and the people at Baegyu Painting Institute are in jail for her crime.

297
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,330
Her father ...

298
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,320
Painter Hong Eun Oh?

299
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,850
Yes.

300
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,800
They put someone who is mentally unwell in jail?

301
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,870
But for some reason,

302
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,690
the jailers walked Painter Hong's father around the market street during the day.

303
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,480
Walked him on the market street where people gather ...

304
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,250
Do you suspect something?

305
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,960
 Clear the path, criminal coming through! 

306
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,400
 Clear the path. 

307
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
 He is the father of Hong Cheon Gi at Baegyu Painting Institute. 

308
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,700
 Did she run away? 

309
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,360
 They say she sold counterfeit paintings. 

310
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,420
 Goodness, she left her father like that and ran away? 

311
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,740
It is a trap.

312
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,880
They are trying to make Maiden Hong appear by spreading the news about her father.

313
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,040
We must rescue her father. Hurry.

314
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Maiden Hong must not know about this until then.

315
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,820
Yes, sir.

316
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,660
 You thought this would make me feel better? 

317
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,690
Painter Hong?

318
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,140
Do you know me?

319
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,570
Are you not Painter Hong Cheon Gi, who won first place at the Maejukheon Painting Contest?

320
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,720
I am Mae Hyang of Simcheonggak.

321
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,630
I must tell you something.

322
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,210
 Father. 

323
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,460
Maiden.

324
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,030
Maiden, are you inside?

325
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,480
Painter Hong will be on the market street by now.

326
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,440
What do you mean?

327
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,770
Painter Hong went to find her father.

328
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,350
If she does not show up now, Grand Prince Juhyang will not leave her father in peace.

329
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,230
I must go to the market street.

330
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,130
Sir!

331
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,070
It is dangerous.

332
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,650
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Since when...

333
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,650
were you so frivolous with your words?

334
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,650
And since when did you lose your sense of judgment?

335
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:05,300
How could you cast aside our long-awaited revenge and ruin it all for mere love?

336
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,110
Listen, Mae Hyang.

337
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,340
Our grudges will not be resolved overnight.

338
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,900
I do not wish to resolve our grudge at the cost of innocent lives.

339
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:35,060
 So why would you ruin it like this, sir? 

340
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,910
Father, Father.

341
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,620
Father.

342
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,250
Father, Father!

343
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,370
Father!

344
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,140
Father, are you all right?

345
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,780
What?

346
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,710
Shall I paint you something?

347
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,010
Father, what are you doing here?

348
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,230
Are you all right?

349
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,500
Let us go home, all right?

350
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,080
Let us go, hurry. Get up.

351
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,720
You better follow without resisting.

352
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,250
Eat up.

353
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,160
I saw your work at the sealing ritual.

354
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,430
Where is Supervisor Ha now?

355
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,180
I do not know.

356
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,880
I suppose if you would tell me so easily,

357
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,930
he would not have run off with you in the first place.

358
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,270
I truly do not know.

359
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,620
When I woke up, I was on a mountain roadside.

360
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,510
Are you... telling the truth?

361
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,020
I am.

362
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,240
Supervisor Ha will appear soon enough.

363
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,980
That's that.

364
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,640
I must give you a command.

365
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,460
Paint the royal portrait again.

366
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:33,050
Do you still intend to incorporate Ma Wang into your body?

367
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,290
That was not a question.

368
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,940
Do not hasten your death.

369
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,860
Then ... let Father go first.

370
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,840
You dare bargain with me?

371
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,370
I shall paint if you let him go.

372
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,600
A bold girl. You are fearless.

373
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,690
Your painting is only a bait to lure Ma Wang.

374
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,370
So ...

375
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,860
I shall let your father go once you finish the royal portrait.

376
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,950
Take him.

377
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,010
Father.

378
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,370
Father, don't worry. I'll save you soon.

379
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,390
- You must never paint the royal portrait.
 - No, Father!

380
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,270
- Don't move.
 - Don't touch my daughter.

381
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,490
Father!

382
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,840
Please spare him!

383
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,020
Please spare my father!

384
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,800
Please spare him.

385
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,990
I will paint it.

386
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,060
I will paint it.

387
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,800
I will paint it.

388
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,690
Good.

389
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:08,440
I shall look forward ... to your second royal portrait infused with divine powers.

390
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,440
Father, Father.

391
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Father.

392
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,810
Father, Father.

393
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,910
The royal shaman from the sealing ritual?

394
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,620
So you recognize me.

395
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,420
What brings you here?

396
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,910
That is not for you to know.

397
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,830
 I am here to find out why Ma Wang is after your eyes. 

398
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,100
 These eyes are Ma Wang's eyes. 

399
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,530
 Demon eyes. 

400
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,610
 My eyes. 

401
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,010
 Why does this painter have demon eyes? 

402
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,770
What is it?

403
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,490
It is nothing.

404
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,300
Do you realize you must make haste with painting the royal portrait?

405
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,730
If you delay, when the red moon rises in a few days,

406
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,180
Supervisor Ha will be completely dominated by Ma Wang.

407
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,150
Do not try to scare me.

408
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,090
He has the ring.

409
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,590
If that ring had such absolute power,

410
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:06,870
why do you think the predecessor king tried so hard to seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait?

411
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,940
Sir.

412
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,170
It seems they were already taken by Grand Prince Juhyang.

413
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,290
Let us rush.

414
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,020
Now we must save both Maiden Hong and her father.

415
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,050
Yes, Sir.

416
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,500
Your Highness, there is big trouble.

417
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,370
Painter Hong was taken by Grand Prince Juhyang.

418
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,260
- What? 
- It seems they used her father as bait to lure her out.

419
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,010
Then it is only a matter of time before Supervisor Ha appears himself.

420
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,100
If the two are caught, the sealing ritual will take place again.

421
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,600
We must stop them before then.

422
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,000
- No. I will not stop them. 
 - Pardon?

423
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,220
Hyeong-nim will never give up on Ma Wang.

424
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,680
Then... there is only one way.

425
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,290
 I shall also have to pay the price. 

426
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,950
You were safe last time

427
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:35,210
because Supervisor Ha was able to hold onto his life.

428
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,770
If someone dies by the Tiger Sword,

429
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,900
this time, you would truly have to risk your own life.

430
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,780
What else is there to do...

431
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,700
if that is my fate?

432
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,230
Supervisor Sir!

433
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,510
Did no one trail you?

434
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,940
- It has been long. 
 - Yes.

435
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,210
- Hurry and come inside. 
 - No.

436
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,050
Did anyone come by?

437
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,960
The royal guards thoroughly searched the whole house on the first day.

438
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,100
It has been quiet since then.

439
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,750
But my heart is always anxious

440
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,450
since I do not know when the guards will barge in again.

441
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,360
Here is the thing you asked me to prepare.

442
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,780
Yes, good work.

443
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,620
 The grand prince is at the palace and there are only guards at the house. 

444
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,070
 We will go in through the front door. 

445
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,300
 Yes, sir. 

446
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,140
Who goes there?

447
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,070
Maiden, do you hear me?

448
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,170
Scholar Sir?

449
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,890
Yes, it is I.

450
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,700
Are you hurt anywhere?

451
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,250
No, I am all right.

452
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,000
Why did you come here?

453
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,100
I am here to rescue you.

454
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,880
Scholar Sir.

455
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,660
My father is locked up.

456
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,850
Please save my father, at least.

457
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,220
Wait here a moment.

458
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,030
Please be careful.

459
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,630
Who are you? Please spare me.

460
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,800
Father!

461
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,610
- Father! 
 - Spare me.

462
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,030
The maiden is inside the shed.

463
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,570
Father, Father!

464
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,600
Father, are you all right?

465
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,550
Cheon Gi.

466
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,900
Maiden, there is no time. We must leave now.

467
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,370
All right.

468
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,200
- You're not hurt?
- No.

469
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,550
- You must leave this place now. 
 - Follow me.

470
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,200
Let's go.

471
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,340
Wait, stop.

472
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,440
You finally showed up, Il Wol Seong.

473
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,910
We meet again like this... Grand Prince Juhyang.

474
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,360
Did I look that gullible to you?

475
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,470
Not at all.

476
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,860
Must we fight like this?

477
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,300
I thought we would understand each other well, since you are rather wise.

478
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,280
Sir, I shall take care of everything here.

479
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,700
Take Painter Hong and her father, and leave this place. Hurry.

480
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,700
I leave it to you, Mu Yeong.

481
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,480
Yes, sir.

482
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,400
- Protect the master.
 -  Yes, sir!

483
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,690
Capture them!

484
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,550
Protect the master!

485
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,920
Father!

486
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,950
Father! Father!

487
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,270
Maiden Hong, we must go.

488
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,300
Chase them!

489
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,480
Yes, Your Highness!

490
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,050
Father, Father!

491
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,940
Sir.

492
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,100
I shall follow soon.

493
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,610
You must return safely.

494
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,630
Sir...

495
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,610
Please be safe.

496
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,300
 I probably won't be able to keep ... 

497
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,200
 my promise to return. 

498
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,470
 Forgive me for not serving you until the end. 

499
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,550
 I shall pay you... 

500
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,300
 with my life for taking me in. 

501
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,590
 I hope the rest of your life... 

502
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,200
 is filled with happiness, sir. 

503
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,540
Father. Father.

504
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,280
Father, Father.

505
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,050
Father.

506
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,000
Father.

507
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,580
Is anyone chasing us?

508
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,290
I shall survey the area.

509
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,850
Cheon Gi.

510
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,480
Yes, it's me, Cheon Gi.

511
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,620
Father, do you recognize me?

512
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,710
Of course.

513
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,210
His pulse is too weak.

514
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,140
It seems Grand Prince Juhyang used a poisoned arrow.

515
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,410
What?

516
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,370
What do we do then, Scholar Sir?

517
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,440
Father, are you all right?

518
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,540
Father, please hold on.

519
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,700
Cheon Gi.

520
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,120
You must never paint the royal portrait.

521
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,940
Father, don't worry about that.

522
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,340
Don't speak right now. I'm all right.

523
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,040
What do we do?

524
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,890
My poor Cheon Gi.

525
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,260
You have suffered too much hardship...

526
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,680
taking care of a lacking father like me.

527
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,140
No.

528
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,630
You must survive ...

529
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,130
even if I am not at your side.

530
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,310
Don't be like that.

531
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,630
Father, please.

532
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,400
Forgive me, Father.

533
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,000
Father, Father ...

534
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,480
Cheon Gi ...

535
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,050
Father.

536
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,640
Father. Father!

537
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,760
Father! Father.

538
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,240
Scholar Sir ...

539
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,980
Please save my father.

540
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,680
This can't happen. Father ...

541
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,910
No, Father.

542
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,380
Father!

543
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,150
Father, get up!

544
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,360
Father, don't do this! Father...

545
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,660
Father ...

546
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:02,920
 Maiden, I shall engrave in my memory what happened today. 

547
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,770
 For everything that you suffered through, 

548
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,120
 I shall avenge you. 

549
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,740
 Jeongan Hall 

550
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,040
 Your Majesty. 

551
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,610
 Your Majesty. 

552
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,430
 You must wake up, Your Majesty. 

553
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,680
Painter Hong Cheon Gi ran away

554
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,400
and not a day goes by without Yangmyeong's followers defying me.

555
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:27,090
I feel that slaying them all would not be enough to satisfy me.

556
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:32,600
Why don't you kill those two birds with one stone?

557
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,470
Is that possible?

558
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,290
- Headmaster.
 - Jeong.

559
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,970
Yeong Uk.

560
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,770
You as well?

561
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,170
- Let's go.
  - Yes, sir. 

562
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,380
No.

563
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,720
The powerless tend to be soft-hearted.

564
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,790
If the people she considers family are in danger,

565
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,660
that woman painter will certainly appear.

566
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,900
And at the same time,

567
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,200
 we can show the followers of Grand Prince Yangmyeong 

568
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,100
who has the power.

569
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,100
Are you hurt?

570
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,980
Are you all right?

571
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
Welcome.

572
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,070
What is the meaning of this?

573
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,980
As you can see, we are about to execute the criminals.

574
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:50,630
Your Highness, what on earth is our crime?

575
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,640
We are merely painters!

576
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,220
We only run a painting institute.

577
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,410
This is a misunderstanding.

578
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,450
This is unjust, Your Highness!

579
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,830
- We have been framed.
- This is unjust.

580
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:07,100
Hong Cheon Gi has never painted a counterfeit after she entered the Painting Bureau.

581
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,010
That is exactly it.

582
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,270
She was a painter of counterfeits to begin with.

583
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,600
After she entered the Painting Bureau, she imitated even grander paintings.

584
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,870
That is not true.

585
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,360
- That is not true.
- This is unjust, Your Highness.

586
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,130
This is unjust.

587
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,110
Under the aegis of Yangmeong, you trained a counterfeit  painter,

588
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:33,210
and let that counterfeit painter dare work on the royal portrait.

589
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,970
Your sins reach the heavens and beyond.

590
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,200
This is unjust, Your Highness! Aegis?

591
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,110
We have not entered the Painting Bureau under the aegis of Grand Prince Yangmyeong!

592
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,640
He is right, Your Highness.

593
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,370
This is unjust.

594
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:52,630
Then, are you suggesting that Grand Prince Yangmyeong fostered a counterfeit painter?

595
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,180
You sure are keen.

596
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,470
This is a coerced claim.

597
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,120
Grand Prince Yangmyeong only loves art, he would not use it for politics.

598
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,470
Have you forgotten the painting contest?

599
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,190
The reason criminal Hong Cheon Gi was able to become the royal portrait painter

600
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,510
was because of the contest hosted by Yangmyeong.

601
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,740
What is more, those men also got high scores at the time.

602
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,940
That is not true.

603
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,470
That is not true, Your Highness.

604
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,600
Will you still not call it "aegis"?

605
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,130
Yangmyeong did it out of his greed to become the crown prince.

606
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,660
So you all cannot deny his part in this, either.

607
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,670
Watch carefully how I deal with these criminals

608
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,740
and watch your mouths from now on.

609
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,810
Execute them all today at the hour of the rooster*.
 (5 p.m. - 7 p.m.) 

610
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,970
Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,760
- Spare us.
- This is unjust.

612
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,070
Your Highness, spare us.

613
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,580
This is unjust.

614
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,380
Your Highness.

615
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,570
- Your Highness. 
- Your Highness.

616
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,440
This is unjust.

617
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,030
Your Highness, this is unjust.

618
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,470
Please reconsider.

619
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,770
 It's good to see you. 

620
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,210
 Wolseongdang 

621
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,000
Maiden, have some porridge.

622
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,440
Come now. You must have some.

623
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,000
I am all right.

624
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,880
You must regain your strength.

625
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,220
I said I am all right.

626
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,700
Just...

627
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,500
Please just leave me alone.

628
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,420
Sir, something terrible has happened.

629
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,640
What is it?

630
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,880
All the people from Baegyu Painting Institute are brought out to the entrance of the capital

631
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,690
and Grand Prince Juhyang has ordered to execute them at the hour of the rooster.

632
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,460
What?

633
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,820
No.

634
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,620
- Move aside.
- Don't do this!

635
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,940
This is a trap.

636
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,470
What will you do if you go like this?

637
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:27,520
Then should I just watch my family at Baegyu Painting Institute die?

638
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,560
I will find a way.

639
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,320
Until when will you continue to search for a way?

640
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,350
Even when I risked my life to paint the royal portrait,

641
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,470
you tried to stop me, saying that you would find a way.

642
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,400
But I still completed the royal portrait.

643
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,770
His Majesty must have followed that course because the only way to stop Ma Wang

644
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,750
is to trap it in the royal portrait.

645
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:59,810
But I thought all I had to do was risk my life alone.

646
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,820
I lost my father and now my family at Baegyu Painting Institute...

647
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,420
I did not know things would turn out like this.

648
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,870
But, even when things are like this,

649
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,000
until when will you continue to search for a way?

650
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,220
Blame me.

651
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,990
Blame me. Blame me as much as you want, but...

652
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,380
I cannot let you go.

653
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,320
I wish I could...

654
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,910
I wish I could blame you.

655
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,110
I wish they could live if I blame you.

656
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:34,920
If something happens to my family at Baegyu Painting Institute,

657
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,760
I will...

658
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,820
I will, I will blame myself...

659
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,460
and not forgive myself for the rest of my life.

660
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,530
So I must go.

661
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,750
Please move aside.

662
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,590
I am sorry.

663
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,510
I know... how you feel.

664
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,980
I also lost...

665
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,140
my mother and father,

666
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,190
the people most dear to me.

667
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:29,330
I do not ... ever want to lose anyone else.

668
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,530
I shall ... save them, no matter what.

669
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,430
I promise you.

670
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,840
So you must stay here.

671
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,000
If you go now, there is no telling what will happen.

672
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,930
Then...

673
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,710
Then... then what should I do?

674
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,840
Then, what am I supposed to do?

675
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,040
This is exactly what Grand Prince Juhyang wants.

676
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,950
He wants to provoke you and then me.

677
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:03,640
If we move as they planned, there will be bloodshed again.

678
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,960
Do you understand?

679
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,750
I shall go.

680
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,260
I know it is difficult,

681
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,860
but please wait a little longer.

682
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,180
Sir.

683
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,320
What is it?

684
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,840
A question was submitted to the Wolseongdang request box.

685
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,690
In the request box?

686
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:29,660
 Ha Ram, I cannot stay here like this. 

687
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,600
 Even if something happens to me, 

688
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,330
 I must go. 

689
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,710
This is the last step.

690
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,100
You are here.

691
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,620
Your Majesty.

692
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,440
Is it ... indeed you, Your Majesty?

693
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,260
Yes.

694
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:19,030


695
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:38,100
♫  Even when the seasons change and the flowers wilt  ♫

696
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:46,100
♫  The memory that we loved will remain beautiful  ♫

697
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:53,300
♫  Even if every day is long and cold  ♫

698
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,510
♫  I will still be here  ♫

699
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,300
♫  Even if it is said the long wait is like a long slumber  ♫

700
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,430
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

701
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,260
 Let the execution begin. 

702
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,490
 - Headmaster...
- Headmaster! 

703
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,270
 You can cry when you are sad. 

704
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,330
 It is all my fault. 

705
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:15,070
 You must have been prepared to die to do all this! 

706
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,090
 I shall punish you accordingly. 

707
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:20,220
 If I cannot have Ma Wang, I am as good as dead. 

708
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,190
 Every time I am in danger, hold my hand like this. 

709
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,630
 I will stay by your side. 

710
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,590
 When the night of the red moon comes soon, the sealing ritual will take place again. 

711
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,070
 I will not fail to repaint the portrait to seal Ma Wang. 

712
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,000
 Divine painter, I am here to make a bargain. 

713
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,390
 Father, I am finally trying to let the past go and live freely. 

714
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,050
 What am I supposed to do? 

715
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:45,230
♫  I will still be here  ♫

716
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:50,100
 Lovers of the Red Sky
