 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,670
Your time is up!

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,030
The second round is over!

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,140
Now we shall begin the evaluation.
 (Yi Yul, Grand Prince Yangmyeong. Third son of Seongjo) 

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,700
Hey, wipe your sweat.

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,600
You look like you got rained on by yourself.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Aish. Aren't you two nervous?

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,750
Aren't you worried about who will pass and fail?

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,950
That is why people call you a rookie. You rookie.

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,830
Oh, my. You two are heartless.

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,940
Number 52 painting.

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,200
Two blues and two reds.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,930
Five reds and one blue.

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,460
Number 52, 25 reds.

20
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,380
It is a pass.

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,340
Number 52, pass.

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,720
Pass!

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,800
 "Godly brushstroke", Gang Hui Yeon 

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,900
Number 39's painting.

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,980
Two blues and four reds.

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,430
Ten reds and two blues.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,900
Twenty-four reds. It is a pass.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,590
Number 39, pass.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
Pass!

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,070
Number 16's painting.

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,500
Number 16.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,320
Twenty-two blues. It is a fail.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,410
Number 16, fail.

34
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,710
Fail!

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,520
Number 15's painting.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,470
Twenty-four blues. It is a fail.

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,530
Fail.

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,470
Number 50, fail.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,410
Number 43, fail.

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,860
Number 36, fail.

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,730
Fail. Fail. Fail.

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,490
Fail. Fail.

43
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,670
Number 54's painting.

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,730
Twenty-seven reds.

45
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,670
It is a pass.

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,800
Number 54, pass. 
   "Ghost painter" Monk  Man Yu 

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,270
Number 25's painting.

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,880
One red and five blues.

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,170
Three blues and one red.

50
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,580
Ten reds and two blues.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,960
Twenty-two reds. It is a pass.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,890
Yes! I did it!

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,200
Thank goodness. I did it.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,690
The last two paintings are a tie with 27 reds.

55
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,670
To determine the first and second place,
 ("Magical brushstroke" Sim Dae Yu, a.k.a. Sim Sat Gat) 

56
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,240
the head judges shall reevaluate  the two paintings.

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,830
Number 24 and 32, come forth.

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,740
 Episode 6: Maejukheon Painting Contest, Part 2 

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,810
The results will depend on your answers.

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,550
Be careful with your answers.

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,910
First, I shall ask painter 24.

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,190
Why are there only mountains and no rivers?

63
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,610
The empty spaces are all water, thus there was no reason to paint them.

64
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,710
 What an incredible perception. 

65
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,070
I apologize, Your Highness.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,960
Now, I will ask painter 32.

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,880
It is without a doubt a Sansuhwa*, but the subject matter is not.
 (Landscape painting) 

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,740
Boulders are usually represented using the white empty space,

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,610
but you have painted them black.

70
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,410
What is the reason for this?

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,250
Are you showing off your brush skills with the painted boulders?

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,640
How long will you keep your mouth shut?

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,100
You must have had a reason for drawing it like this.

74
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,510
Speak up.

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,390
Why did you paint the boulders black?
 (Choi Won Ho, Headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute) 

76
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,520
The boulder...

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,000
I have drawn the black boulder as I saw it for the first time with my eyes.

78
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,090
What do you mean by that?

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,340
When I was young, I was blind

80
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,050
and depended on sounds to see color and form.

81
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,090
- Impossible!
 - What is she saying?

82
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,360
The sound of the flowing river was white,

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,450
the sound of feet on pebbled streets was yellow,

84
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,080
and the sound of the breeze brushing the leaves was blue.

85
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,680
One year, when I opened my eyes,

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,890
it was the day it rained for the first time in a long time in this land.

87
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,110
The Inwang Mountain that I saw that day was as black as ink.

88
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,880
The majority of Inwang Mountain is boulders, and they were wet from the rain.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Thus, the boulders in my painting are the wet boulders that I saw and felt for the first time.

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,550
They are boulders as black as ink.

91
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,080
You could not see?

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,730
No, Your Highness.

93
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,530
How could that be...

94
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,970
Pardon?

95
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,460
It is nothing.

96
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,940
What did you mean by this painting?

97
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,880
The painting is about...

98
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:47,090
a boy whose face I do not know, who picked peaches with me

99
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,750
when I could not see, someone I miss very much.

100
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,620
That is why the painting is so mournful.

101
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,120
I understand your story, but it is difficult to call it Sansuhwa

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,770
and we cannot discuss its artistic merit.

103
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,560
However, this painter's ability to wield the brush and ink is astounding.
 (Pil Muk: brush and ink stick) 

104
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,830
Then, we shall leave the decision to the head judges.

105
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,590
First, I have studied this Sansuhwa again after hearing that

106
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,140
the painter considered the blank spaces as water,

107
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,210
thus no need to draw water.

108
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,830
It seems somewhat fanciful, but the atmosphere is poetic

109
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,910
and  it has refinement and determination.

110
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,750
It is fine work.

111
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,760
Raise your tiles.

112
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,570
All red.

113
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,150
Painter 32's work captured nature's beauty in a single frame

114
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,050
and presented the mountain's dimensions with astonishing brush technique.
 (Jun: a technique used to represent the three-dimensional effect of mountain and rocks) 

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,130
Furthermore, I was touched by the painter's courage and decisiveness

116
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,600
to paint the traditionally empty boulders as black.

117
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Raise your tiles.

118
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,040
A tie again.

119
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,200
What should we do?

120
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,530
Painter Sim Dae Yu and Painter Hong Cheon Gi,

121
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,750
the two of you will move onto the third round as joint first place.

122
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,160
Yeong Uk!

123
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,370
I did it!

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,200
Hey, Hong Cheon Gi, you just might win!

125
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,420
I congratulate you all on making it to the third round.

126
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,910
My eyes and ears are overjoyed upon seeing your paintings

127
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,880
filled with your soul and skill.

128
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,610
The third round will take place tomorrow afternoon.

129
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,870
So rest easy for today.

130
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,510
 Maejukheon 

131
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,690
Over 300 sheets of painting paper were used today.

132
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,420
We have many sheets of paper.

133
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,930
Grand Prince Yangmyeong, it is Han Geon.

134
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,220
What is it?

135
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,510
Have you noticed that Hong Cheon Gi is the imitation painter of Sochundo?
 (Han Geon: Master Painter at the Painting Bureau) 

136
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,970
I did.

137
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,330
That is why I tried to fail her in the first round.

138
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,180
Truthfully, her father was my friend once

139
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,440
and the best painter who competed with me for the first place at the Painting Bureau.

140
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,970
What?

141
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,400
Painter Hong's father was a painter at the Painting Bureau?

142
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,550
Yes, Your Highness.

143
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,870
He is Hong Eun Oh, the man who drew the previous King's royal portrait that was burned 19 years ago.

144
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,140
 Doesn't royal grandfather's portrait seem truly alive? 

145
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,180
Earlier you saw the butterfly alighting in the painting.

146
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,230
She is the divine painter that His Majesty seeks.

147
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,800
She can fulfill His Majesty's longtime wish of restoring the royal portrait.

148
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,350
We have finally found her.

149
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,330
I see.

150
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,620
We have finally found her.

151
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,800
Is something the matter?

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,740
No.

153
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,470
 Hong Cheon Gi. 

154
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,700
 Who is this woman... 

155
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,100
It was a close call, but you made it this far.

156
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,540
Thanks to you.

157
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,710
I look forward to your painting tomorrow.

158
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,970
I as well.

159
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,640
Don't cry when you lose.

160
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,410
You're one to talk.

161
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,060
They say unlucky ones always fall into a melon field.

162
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,910
I thought I might meet the grand prince if I came here.

163
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,140
You think it is easy to make acquaintances with the grand prince?

164
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,120
Why are you so down? It is only natural.

165
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,800
He has so many titles that even I struggle to follow.

166
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,830
Did you not know it is more difficult to meet Grand Prince Yangmyeong than His Majesty?

167
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,660
But the king is still my father.

168
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,410
Are you not going overboard with your joke?

169
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,170
The contest was meaningful due to all of you,

170
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,000
as you all showed excellent skills in a short time.

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,740
Let us forget today's fatigue with a drink.

172
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,350
Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,640
So, what do we receive if we win first place?

174
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,200
I forgot to mention the most important part.

175
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,350
Let's see.

176
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,850
Your Highness.

177
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,630
Do you also grant wishes?

178
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:13,230
I heard you would grant any wish to the first place winner at Maejukheon Painting Contest.

179
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,620
What is your wish?

180
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,720
I hear at the palace...

181
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,050
It is nothing.

182
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,810
Oh, right...

183
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,310
About your butterfly painting...

184
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,930
Is that your mark?

185
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,700
Pardon?

186
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,970
The beautiful butterfly with its wings stretched, marked with black dots.

187
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:07,260
I remember the butterfly that I saw for the first time when I opened my eyes.

188
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,770
That is why I draw it so.

189
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,940
I see. That is how it is.

190
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,030
I wondered why you always drew the butterflies in the same way.

191
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,570
I do not know what you mean.

192
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,520
Never mind.

193
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,380
You should all eat up, drink up, enjoy and rest well tonight.

194
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,150
Well then.

195
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,960
Have a word with me.

196
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,480
Pardon?

197
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,680
Is it you who made a counterfeit of Park Yi's Sochundo?

198
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,420
Pardon?

199
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,410
What do you mean?

200
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,880
That butterfly in Sochundo...

201
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,090
and the butterfly in your painting today.

202
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,280
They were the works of the same painter.

203
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,060
No one paints the same butterfly simply because they are skilled.

204
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,370
You copied the old paintings of Yeon Empire,

205
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,960
thus your style is impressive, and your painting skill is exquisite.
 (Muk Beop: calligraphy technique)
 (Pil Chi: painting style) 

206
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,750
But do your paintings contain the spirit of your brush and ink at all?

207
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,000
Judging by the principles and the way of painting,
 (Jun Beop: brush technique used to represent the three-dimensional effect of mountain and rocks) 

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,340
how is one to know the difference between Park Yi's Sochundo and your painting?

209
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,110
Never mind the principles. You must rid yourself of the mundane to capture the painting's divine spirit.
 (Shin Gi: divine spirit; Sok Gi: this worldly spirit) 

210
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,650
People are not touched by a painter's skills.

211
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,520
They are moved by the painter's sincerity blooming on the paper.

212
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,270
You say you captured your memories,

213
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,560
but if you cannot find your own color,

214
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,340
the paintings that made you pass, thanks to your impressive technique and brilliant wit

215
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,780
end with the second round.

216
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,600
You may win first place,

217
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,430
but should your identity as painter  of counterfeits be revealed,

218
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,440
it will sully the name of Maejukheon Painting Contest.

219
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,060
I pray that in the third round, you paint... with faith in yourself.

220
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,840
Your Highness, I only used my skills to make a living.

221
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,770
Is that so wrong to do?

222
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,240
It truly is... a waste of your talents.

223
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,280
 You've arrived Lord Grand Prince. 

224
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,300
You are here.

225
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,110
I apologize for being late, Hyeong-nim.

226
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,400
I did not realize you worked so hard to prepare the contest and even the banquet.
 (Yi Hu, Grand Prince Juhyang,  Second son of Seongjo) 

227
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,040
How could I slack, knowing you would attend the contest?

228
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,860
Is that so?

229
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,110
 (Ahn Yeong Hoe: Grand Prince Juhyang's strategist) 

230
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,360
Seeing Your Highnesses so close

231
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,750
makes me wish the crown prince could be here enjoying this time with us.

232
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,560
 (Yi Hyeon Mo:  Military Affairs Administrator) 

233
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,230
You should watch your mouth.

234
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,470
Have you forgotten about the disgraceful incident that befell the crown prince?

235
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,910
How could I not know?

236
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,920
It is precisely what concerns me.

237
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,680
He is so ill and without a crown princess consort.

238
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,230
Perhaps we should suggest to His Majesty to proclaim a crown princess consort.

239
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,710
Is that not so, Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

240
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,320
His Highness the crown prince already has dismissed the matter.

241
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,420
His Highness already has a son.

242
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,830
There is no need for us to discuss it further.
 (Sim Jeong Wu: Researcher at the Hall of Worthies) 

243
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,630
Come now.

244
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,790
That is enough.

245
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,900
I apologize. I made you uncomfortable.

246
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,570
Shall we end the banquet for the night

247
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,770
and converse between brothers, for the first time in a while?

248
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,750
A grand idea, Hyeong-nim.

249
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,500
Shall we wrap up the day with a pleasant stroll?

250
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,350
All right.

251
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,040
Hong Cheon Gi!

252
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,280
How long did you think I would put up with your antics?

253
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,860
- Do you know what kind of place this— 
 - Yes, Maejukheon.

254
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,470
Maejukheon Painting Contest, where all the great painters gather.

255
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,190
I am a painter, too, Headmaster.

256
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,710
Is it so wrong for a painter to attend a painting contest?

257
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,570
Eun Oh was the same way.

258
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,930
He thought everything would change if he became the best painter.

259
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,420
But look what happened. Don't you understand, even after witnessing everything?

260
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,290
I do not understand.

261
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,310
What happened to Father?

262
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,520
I would know if you told me.

263
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,040
Stop asking questions and give up the third round.

264
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,510
- No.
 - Cheon Gi.

265
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,050
Cheon Gi, Cheon Gi, Cheon Gi!

266
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,430
 You may win first place, 

267
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,740
 but should your identity as a painter of counterfeits be revealed, 

268
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,550
 it will sully the name of Maejukheon Painting Contest. 

269
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,420
 Stop asking questions and give up the third round. 

270
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Headmaster, you don't know anything.

271
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,120
 He will continue to live semiconsciously and eventually die. 

272
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,890
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,260
Do you have something to discuss?

274
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,010
They say an old horse still longs to roam freely

275
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,190
and an old soldier still longs to fight.

276
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,430
An old horse in the stables can still run a thousand miles

277
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,390
and a man's aspirations do not grow old as he ages.

278
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,020
Hyeong-nim.

279
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,130
For a country not yet a hundred years old to live on for thousands more,

280
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,690
the weak hyeong-nim will not do.

281
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,000
What is it you are trying to say?

282
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:21,270
You mean that we should support the crown prince and strengthen the throne.

283
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,230
That is what you mean, right?

284
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,630
Do you know when I got this scar?

285
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,340
No, I do not know.

286
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,520
It is from the Northern War.

287
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,350
I may live and die like this,

288
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,940
but I always did my best to protect the royal duty and dignity.

289
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,490
However?

290
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,600
But look at how you live.

291
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,110
And how I live...

292
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,350
What is the point of contests and paintings to us?

293
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,190
It is not time yet, and the horse may wait in the stables,

294
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,190
but once the horse's time comes,

295
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,720
it saves its breath for the moment to rule over the land.

296
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,950
Still with the hope...

297
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,450
that it has one more chance.

298
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,490
Yul.

299
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,920
Support me.

300
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,270
I will not say anything more.

301
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,890
Hyeong-nim did not grow ill overnight.

302
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,480
He will not recover in one or two days, either.

303
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,300
How can a sick man become the foundation of a nation?

304
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,980
Hyeong-nim!

305
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,580
You have gone too far.

306
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,850
Anyone who heard you would think he has the plague.

307
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,750
Let me ask you one thing.

308
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,930
Was the previous king, our grandfather,

309
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,900
a traitor?

310
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,520
   

311
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,070
Hyeong-nim, why are you doing this?

312
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,760
- Grandfather is— 
 - Was he a traitor or not?

313
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,900
Answer me.

314
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,900
He was not.

315
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,650
Before he succeeded in overthrowing his brother and ascended to the throne,

316
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,990
was he a traitor?

317
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
- He was not. 
 - Then...

318
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,750
do you think...

319
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,690
- I am a traitor? 
 - Hyeong-nim!

320
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,490
Even the earliest regret comes too late.

321
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,880
The bow has been drawn, and the arrow has flown.

322
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,450
Whom do you think...

323
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,240
the first arrow is directed at?

324
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,580
Even if I become the first target of that arrow,

325
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,700
I will not back down.

326
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,890
Pathetic.

327
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,040
Grand Prince Juhyang met privately with Grand Prince Yangmyeong

328
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,550
and he tried to convince him?

329
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,800
Yes, sir.

330
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,470
This was the invisible letter that the head guard tried to deliver to His Majesty.

331
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,200
 It is only a matter of time for the death 

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,760
of the man responsible for my father's death.

333
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,410
Send it to Grand Prince Juhyang.

334
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,950
Did this girl disappear into the ground or up to the sky?

335
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,560
Where did she go?

336
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,720
Headmaster and Cheon Gi must work it out

337
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,990
or else tomorrow's competition is ruined.

338
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,120
 Aigoo, that tiny little girl. She must be so frustrated. 

339
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,250
 I am her friend, but 

340
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,010
 I feel so bad just having to watch her by her side. 

341
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,790
 Be quiet and follow me. 

342
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,570
 Ah, whatever! I'm just going to eat everything and pass out. 

343
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,750
His Highness is angry that I am an artist who creates counterfeits.

344
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,480
and Headmaster is worried

345
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,610
that if I make a name as a painter,

346
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,430
I will become mad like Father.

347
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,330
He keeps getting angry with me.

348
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,980
If I give up on the contest,

349
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,650
what about my father's medicine?

350
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,240
No matter how many times I think it over,

351
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,970
I must win the contest.

352
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,020
If that is what you are determined to do,

353
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,880
you should do as you wish.

354
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,820
Just do as you wish.

355
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,200
What are you doing here? It is unlike you.

356
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,480
My goodness. It is easy to say.

357
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,510
But it's not something I have control over.

358
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,570
So will you continue to live like this?

359
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,310
Wavering at someone else's words and pitying yourself?

360
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,400
Scholar Sir.

361
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,880
Never mind.

362
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,440
I will get going.

363
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,500
I am disappointed.

364
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,760
You swore to wager all your wishes and the rest of your life on it.

365
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,070
Are you giving up like this?

366
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,000
What do you know about me that you are saying this to me?

367
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,110
I only...

368
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,450
participated in the contest to obtain medicine for my father, who is gravely ill.

369
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,190
Just this once I could not trouble Headmaster, to whom I owe a lifelong debt for his generosity to me

370
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,080
and the family at Baegyu Painting Institute

371
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,650
and friends, by asking for help and put them on the spot again.

372
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,780
So, I participated in this contest to solve the matter on my own.

373
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,260
But Headmaster tells me to give it up.

374
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,680
His Highness said he was ashamed of me.

375
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,340
What am I supposed to do?

376
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,710
What would you do...

377
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,890
if you were in my place?

378
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,240
I don't know...

379
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,100
But everything that happened to you

380
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,070
are things you cannot control.

381
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,860
 You can't help it. 

382
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,340
 It isn't your fault! 

383
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,830
It is not your fault.

384
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
So...

385
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,830
-  don't blame yourself 
 - don't blame yourself

386
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
 for things you cannot control. 

387
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,160
for things you have no control over.

388
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,680
Would you like to try riding?

389
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,290
Pardon?

390
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,380
Oh, no.

391
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,080
I don't know whose horse it is.

392
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,560
 But why did you come to the stables at night? 

393
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,100
 I wanted to see Soma. 

394
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,300
 Is that the truth? 

395
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,500
 Why do you ask? 

396
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,870
 Because I am glad. 

397
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,050
 I'm glad I got to meet you again. 

398
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,870
♫  Tears will fall  ♫

399
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,700
♫  But it will be beautiful  ♫

400
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,680
♫  I hope even it is just you that you are happy.  ♫

401
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,030
♫  I will be fine  ♫

402
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,480
♫  The night sky will watch over me  ♫

403
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,020
♫  On an unknown day if you aren't even at my side  ♫

404
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,480
♫  I will live with tears all day long.  ♫

405
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,020
♫  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  ♫

406
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,310
♫  We drift and drift like this  ♫

407
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,310
♫  Even if I am confused in some other time  ♫

408
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:38,240
♫  I'm sure you will remember what you thought each moment every scene  ♫

409
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,320
♫  Even if time passes, you and I will shine  ♫

410
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 Ram. 

411
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
 I missed you. 

412
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,590
 And so, 

413
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,870
 I have not forgotten you. 

414
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,730
By chance, do you...

415
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,500
come here often?

416
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,090
It is where Soma comes to rest occasionally.

417
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,500
I am not sure where it is.

418
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,920
Why do you ask?

419
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,850
There was a boy I met 20 years ago.

420
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,750
This is a place filled with our memories.

421
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,120
Is there a reason you cannot forget that boy?

422
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Perhaps...

423
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,060
it is because of those stars.

424
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,050
The stars in the sky?

425
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,770
Yes.

426
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,060
The stars in the sky.

427
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,880
There are particularly many stars out today.

428
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,700
I see the Big Dipper.

429
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,410
How many...

430
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,070
 How many stars are there? 

431
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,240
stars are there?

432
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,730
Around...

433
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,190
 Around... 

434
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,350
 a hundred million? 

435
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,820
a hundred million?

436
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,810
 How much is a hundred million? 

437
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,080
How much is...

438
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,720
a hundred million?

439
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,430
 A lot. 

440
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,560
 Countless. 

441
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,960
A lot.

442
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,970
Countless.

443
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,620
Ha Ram.

444
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,190
It is you. Isn't it?

445
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,120
♫  Whichever way the wind blows  ♫

446
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,880
♫  Wherever my footsteps lead me  ♫

447
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:22,390
♫  I can walk without a moment's rest  ♫

448
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:28,090
♫  Just stay wherever you are  ♫

449
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:35,570
♫  Am I it? The person who lives in your heart.  ♫

450
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:42,650
♫  The one person you long for  endlessly?  ♫

451
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,070
♫  Even if you say it's not or that you hate me   ♫

452
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:54,830
♫  I'll stay by your side like destiny  ♫

453
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,310
Are you all right?

454
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,680
Ha Ram!

455
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,140
 Ha Ram. 

456
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,540
 Ha Ram. 

457
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,280
 One with the power of water. 

458
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,600
 Come to me. 

459
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,440
Ha Ram!

460
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,780
- Are you all right, Ram?
 - I am...

461
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,010
I am not the boy... that you seek.

462
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,880
What?

463
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,390
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,670
You should...

465
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,530
forget about that boy now.

466
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,350
We should head back.

467
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,560
Wait!

468
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,640
That boy is a dear friend

469
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,320
who picked peaches for me when I couldn't see.

470
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,850
If you are not that boy,

471
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,700
how can you tell me to forget him so easily?

472
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,750
So that...

473
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,410
- you will find peace.
 - Then...

474
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,000
why did you... kiss me?

475
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,100
What more can I say?  I am ashamed.

476
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,740
You must forget the past ties.

477
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,910
Did you not say that the boy promised to return the next day?

478
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,640
But that boy who did not return...

479
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,180
Would he be happy that you are seeking him?

480
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,890
If nothing had happened to him,

481
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,300
if he forgot the promise for a moment and that's why he didn't come back,

482
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:53,270
would it have been any trouble for him to return the following day or the day after that?

483
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,350
The reason that boy did not come back for you

484
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,390
is because he...

485
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
forgot about you.

486
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,530
So you must forget him.

487
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,130
So you must not do anything more.

488
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,090
That way

489
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,460
you will not get hurt.

490
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,010
 I have lived in hell. 

491
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,290
 I will lock away the memories of that day 

492
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,520
 so that I don't have to drag you into that hell. 

493
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:57,900
♫  Your eyes will reflect in mine and live on in crimson light  ♫

494
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,950
We are here.

495
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,520
♫  Just with a smile  ♫

496
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,750
Go inside.

497
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,020
Wait, Scholar Sir.

498
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,960
♫   And I think of our difficult relationship  ♫

499
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Will you be at Maejukheon tomorrow, too?

500
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,040
♫  All the flowers in the world die again  ♫

501
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,630
I am glad I'll be able to see you again tomorrow.

502
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,780
♫  And can lose their light  ♫

503
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,170
♫  When despair fills me  ♫

504
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:38,390
♫  I wait for my love again like a lie  ♫

505
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,890
Scholar Sir!

506
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,770
Fine, go.

507
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,750
Who is stopping you?

508
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,140
Who is going to believe you when you speak such things,

509
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,030
looking as if you have a stone slab placed on your heart?

510
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,190
Crazy, crazy!

511
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,850
Why on earth did I kiss him back? Why!

512
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,210
What happened to you yesterday?

513
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,870
Headmaster and we looked for you everywhere.

514
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,240
Don't ask.

515
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,210
My mind is void of all thoughts.

516
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,000
What beautiful weather, Hyeong-nim.

517
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,330
How was your night?

518
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:14,430
I was able to have a long dream due to a comfortable bed.

519
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,910
Perhaps... you did not feel some half-baked guilt about last night's events

520
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,930
and lost sleep over it, did you?

521
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,650
I know you did not speak without thinking.

522
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,800
I also... did not answer you without any resolve.

523
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,310
Here are the rules for the third round.

524
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,280
You will be paired in twos and have a painting match.

525
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,740
Painter Sim Dae Yu, who won first place in the first and second rounds

526
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,720
will choose his opponent.

527
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,330
Painter Hong Cheon Gi.

528
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,320
Painter Hong Cheon Gi and Painter Sim Dae Yu will compete.

529
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,380
And now Painter Gang Hi Yeon, in the third place, will pick his competitor.

530
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,000
I shall choose Monk Man Yu.

531
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,140
The two painters, please sit in the second row.

532
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,910
Then, the remaining two painters,

533
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,730
Painter Choi Jeong and Painter Cha Yeong Uk will compete.

534
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,600
The third round's genre is birds and animals 
 (Yeong Mo: wildlife drawing) .

535
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,670
"As the spring air grows warmer, the verdure deepens.

536
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,870
Galloping down the road where flowers bloom, their scent lingers on the horse's hooves."

537
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:42,920
The theme being what it is, a painting that interprets it in a unique way shall receive more points.

538
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,340
You have an hour from now.

539
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,640
 Ha Ram. 

540
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,090
 You asked me to forget you. 

541
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,230
 But... 

542
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,290
 I cannot... forget you. 

543
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:31,510
 Just as a brushstroke already drawn cannot be undone. 

544
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,480
 Galloping down the road where flowers bloom, the scent ... on the horse's hooves... 

545
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,830
Is the woman painter painting well?

546
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,640
Yes, Supervisor Sir.

547
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,280
She is painting something again today that many people look forward to.

548
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,700
I see.

549
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,750
That is good.

550
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,750
 I must not waver. 

551
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,600
 I have already let her go. 

552
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,760
Man Su.

553
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,600
I must go get something from my room.

554
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,330
Yes, Sir.

555
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,970
Supervisor Sir!

556
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,130
Are you all right?

557
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,410
Are you hurt?

558
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,760
- I'm all right.
 - What is going on?

559
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,150
Forgive me.

560
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,820
Because I cannot see...

561
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,490
It was my fault.

562
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,540
Forgive me, Grand Prince Juhyang.

563
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,800
Sir, this fell from your clothes.

564
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,300
This is yours, correct?

565
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,030
 That is the invisible secret letter from last night. 

566
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,950
 Grand Prince Juhyang, it is time to make your move. 

567
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,970
Time is up!

568
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,420
 - Already?
 - Is it already time? 

569
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,600
After final evaluations from the judges, we shall select three paintings for auction.

570
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,070
First, the paintings of Painter Choi Jeong and Painter Cha Yeong Uk.

571
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,520
It is Yurincheong.*
  (A mystical blue-maned horse; also the name of King Taejo's favorite horse) 

572
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,900
He is resting in a flower field after a long battle.

573
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,900
See the majestic muscles and mane drawn hair by hair. It is excellent.

574
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,620
A fine horse. I wish I could show it to His Majesty now.

575
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,920
Painter Choi Jeong, 25 reds!

576
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,720
It is pleasant to see the family of horses cavorting in the flower field in the Gonmado style* 
  (painting of horses near water) 

577
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:34,110
But it is a shame that he could not depict the horse muscles properly, using the Molgol technique*
  (drawing the form without contour, through use of color and ink gradation) .

578
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,120
Painter Cha Yeong Uk, 22 reds.

579
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,090
Congratulations, Painter Choi Jeong.

580
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,080
Next are the paintings of Monk Man Yu and Gang Hi Yeon.

581
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,410
The two paintings both show horses tied up,

582
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,960
but they are black and white, and their expressions are complete opposites of each other, too, aren't they?

583
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,260
Both the black and white horses captured the form and muscle tone

584
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,610
of exemplary horses through delicate line drawing.

585
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,590
They are both tethered,

586
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,490
yet the white horse is defiant while the black one is at peace.

587
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,970
How different they are.

588
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,780
Twenty-four reds.

589
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,540
Congratulations, Painter Gang Hi Yeon.

590
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,670
Lastly, Painter Hong Cheon Gi and Painter Sim Dae Yu's paintings.

591
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,660
They portrayed the racing horses under a tree.

592
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,480
We can feel the breeze through the sweepingly bent blooming branches

593
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,110
and this expands the space where the horses run.

594
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,520
The unfaltering brushstrokes add to the painting's dynamism.

595
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,510
We can imagine the spring air at its sweetest at the end of the captivated gazes of the horses.

596
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,450
Truly incredible.

597
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,060
Raise your tiles.

598
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:58,380
Painter Sim Dae Yu received 29 reds.

599
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,290
How on earth did she interpret the given theme?

600
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,110
 What is going on? 

601
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,900
The butterflies are well-drawn, but...

602
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,780
Where in the world is the horse?

603
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,990
What an incredible interpretation!

604
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,000
This painting shows the butterflies fluttering

605
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,410
in the flower scent after the horses have passed.

606
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,480
She has drawn the butterflies chasing the flower scent

607
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,040
stirred by the horses trampling on the petals.

608
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,120
A truly innovative interpretation.

609
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,220
I'm here as a judge, yet I am learning new things.

610
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,850
Yet, the genre was "birds and animals".

611
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,900
The genre was not "insects and plants". Shouldn't she have drawn a horse?

612
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,500
All in all, the spirit of a subject matter must be captured both through what is seen and what is not seen.

613
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,700
She has clearly mastered the abstruse Six Principles of Painting.

614
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,540
And the spirit of her painting even captured the awe-inspiring nature's ways

615
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,210
as when matter scatters before a wind and it pauses upon meeting water.

616
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,240
This is a truly divine work.

617
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:43,750
Now lastly, raise your tiles for Painter Hong Cheon Gi.

618
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,360
Open your eyes, Painter Hong Cheon Gi.

619
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,320
Painter Hong Cheon Gi received 31 red tiles.

620
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,670
The highest score thus far.

621
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,530
Congratulations, Painter Hong Cheon Gi.

622
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,000
That Obnoxious One probably drew only butterflies because her wrist hurt.

623
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Interpretation sounds fancier than the dream itself.

624
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,690
That Hong Cheon Gi is lucky.

625
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,800
 I am so proud of you, Cheon Gi. 

626
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,930
Now we shall have an auction of the three paintings to decide the winner.

627
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,390
Number one, Choi Jeong's painting.

628
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,880
We shall begin at ten seoks* of rice. 
  (seok=180 liters) 

629
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,140
Twelve seoks.

630
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,500
We have 12 seoks.

631
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,910
- Are there 13 seoks?
 - Twenty seoks!

632
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,790
We have 20 seoks!

633
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,360
- Do we have 21?
 - 80 seoks.

634
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,730
 80 seoks? 

635
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,000
We have 80 seoks!

636
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,280
That's worth 30 years of salary from Baegyu Painting Institute.

637
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,130
One hundred seoks.

638
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,550
 - One hundred seoks?
 - What? 

639
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:39,330
Now then, Choi Jeong's painting has been auctioned at 100 seoks.

640
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,920
Magnificent work.

641
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,750
Number two, Gang Hi Yeon's painting.

642
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,280
Forty seoks.

643
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,000
We have 40 seoks, 40.

644
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,200
Forty-five seoks.

645
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,960
- Forty-five seoks!
 - Sixty seoks.

646
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,560
Eighty seoks.

647
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,620
We have eighty seoks!

648
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,390
One hundred seoks.

649
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,890
We have 100 seoks.

650
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,120
One hundred ten seoks.

651
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,070
One hundred twenty seoks.

652
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,470
One hundred forty seoks.

653
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,930
We have 140 seoks!

654
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,340
One hundred forty-one seoks?

655
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,480
Number two, Painter Gang Hi Yeon's painting has been auctioned at 140 seoks.

656
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,990
Lastly, number three, Painter Hong Cheon Gi's painting.

657
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,210
We shall start at ten seoks of rice.

658
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,270
I knew this would happen.

659
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,580
No one will bid high.

660
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,750
Fifty seoks.

661
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,660
We have 50 seoks.

662
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,970
- Do we have 51 seoks?
 - Sixty seoks.

663
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,490
We have sixty seoks.

664
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,600
Do we have 61?

665
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,620
Seventy seoks.

666
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,470
Eighty seoks.

667
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,440
- We have 80 seoks.
 - One hundred seoks!

668
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,430
Yes, we have 100.

669
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,600
- One hundred ten seoks.
 - One hundred thirty seoks.

670
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,440
We have 130 seoks.

671
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,700
What has bewitched these people?

672
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,550
What is happening?

673
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,130
- One hundred fifty seoks.
 - One hundred fifty seoks!

674
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,260
We have this auction's highest bid!

675
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,500
Do we have 151 seoks?

676
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,980
One hundred eighty seoks.

677
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,620
We have 200 seoks here.

678
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,980
We have 200 seoks! 200!

679
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,120
Yes. Do we have 201?

680
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,260
Two hundred ten seoks.

681
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,120
Two hundred fifty seoks.

682
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,580
We have 250 seoks!

683
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,250
- We have 250 seoks!
 - Two hundred seventy seoks.

684
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,730
Three hundred seoks.

685
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:08,250
We have 300! 300 seoks!

686
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:12,180
Come now, do we have 301?

687
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,280
Three hundred seoks is...

688
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,190
the price of a tiled roof house in Bukchon...
   (rich neighborhood of hanok-style houses in Seoul) 

689
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,190
 It looks like Supervisor Ha will not back down. 

690
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:30,670
Then, number three, Painter Hong Cheon Gi's painting has been auctioned at 300 seoks!

691
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,980
 I have achieved... 

692
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,300
 my most earnest wish. 

693
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,500
 Thank you, Ha Ram. 

694
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,650
Congratulations.

695
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,850
 The one memory... that I wished to keep. 

696
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:05,930
 Thus I bid farewell to the promise that I wanted to keep. 

697
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:09,820
This ends Maejukheon Painting Contest's winner auction.

698
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:15,790
The highest bid goes to number three, Painter Hong Cheon Gi's painting!

699
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,800
This Maejukheon Painting Contest was special not only for me but for everyone.

700
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,560
This is the first time the winner is of the middle class and not a noble.

701
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:47,370
You have proven yourself an outstanding painter

702
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:52,120
worthy of the first place of this contest, regardless of rank and status.

703
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,760
The 300 seoks of rice from the bid are your award as well.

704
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,890
I congratulate you sincerely.

705
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,900
Well...

706
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:09,170
I heard that you would grant the wish of the winner of the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

707
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,880
Yes. Then, what is your wish?

708
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:22,540
Would it be possible for you to obtain a medicine called cheongsimwon for me?

709
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,800
Cheongsimwon?

710
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,080
Tell me why you need cheongsimwon.

711
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,200
I sought a physician as my father is gravely ill

712
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,820
and he told me that cheongsimwon was the last hope.

713
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,570
So...

714
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,570
 That is why... 

715
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:57,340
 Then the counterfeit paintings, 

716
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,530
 participating in the Maejukheon contest ... 

717
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,340
 was it all for your father? 

718
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,210
Very well.

719
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,490
I shall grant your wish.

720
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,120
Thank you! Thank you so much, Your Highness!

721
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,130
Thank you!

722
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,080
Well then.

723
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,890
The painters who narrowly did not win, come forth.

724
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:41,980
I have seen this nation's future in the painters gathered here today.

725
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,700
Regardless of status and rank, you competed fairly only with skill.

726
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,990
It was a fair and square competition.

727
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,740
You have shown us a fine competition with your incredible skills.

728
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:58,120
I shall not forget the moment you rose to the third round through hard work.

729
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:04,620
This painting contest was more challenging and tiring than any other.

730
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,600
You have all done well.

731
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,520
Now...

732
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,550
this ends Maejukheon Painting Contest.

733

Lord Ha Seong Jin!

734
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,890
You must run, my lord!

735
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,530
Father!

736
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,140
I shall stop Ma Wang!

737
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,220
Do not look him in the eyes!

738
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,940
Grand Prince Juhyang, please have mercy.

739
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,270
He is my father.

740
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,860
He has done this because he is not mentally well. Please forgive him this once.

741
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,370
Forgive us, Your Highness.

 Preview  

750
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,990
 Would you sacrifice anything for this woman painter? 

751
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,940
 That painter's father spoke of Ma Wang. 

752
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,950
 What will you do if you become like Eun Oh? 

753
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:39,270
 Will you go to the Painting Bureau with me and investigate the truth? 

754
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,100
 There was a painting that remained in my memory. 

755
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,940
 If I can see someday, I would like to see that painting. 

756
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:51,520
 If the boy I knew grew up, I imagine he would be just like you. 

757
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,010
 That boy does not want me to recognize him. 

758
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,360
 So I will protect him.
