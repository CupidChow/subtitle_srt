 The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts. 

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,060
This is the last step.

7
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,580
You are here.

8
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,480
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,280
Is it indeed you, Your Majesty?

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,550
Yes.

11
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,400
Your Majesty, I am relieved that you seem well.

12
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,170
You look unwell.

13
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,300
I think I can understand your suffering thus far.

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,340
But, Your Majesty,

15
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,220
why did you submit a question in the Wolseongdang request box?

16
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,690
Did you know that I was Il Wol Seong?

17
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
The person who put the question slip in the request box was me.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,260
Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

19
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,540
Yes. I already knew that you were acting as Il Wol Seong.

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,490
I also knew from the dead royal inquisitor

21
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,870
that since twenty years ago, after the sealing ritual

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,350
and the Seokcheok Rain Ritual,

23
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,110
you have been planning revenge.

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,170
If you knew everything, why did you let me be?

25
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,000
I must tell you everything now.

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,490
After the abdicated King passed away,

27
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,760
I was distressed because of the long drought in this country.

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,990
I did not even realize

29
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,640
that the abdicated king had ordered the death of your father, Ha Seong Jin.

30
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,960
How can I trust your words?

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,240
I heard from the royal inquisitor,

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,110
who was there on the day your father passed away,

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,390
that Ha Seong Jin had been killed.

34
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,760
And that it was the doing of Ma Wang.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,600
It was Ma Wang inside your body.

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,390
 I risked my life to seal Ma Wang! 

37
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,340
 And my son lost his sight to bring the rain! 

38
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,200
 Is this how we are to be repaid? 

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,090
 Father! 

40
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,990
Your father was trying to expel Ma Wang from your body.

41
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,130
 Be gone this instant! 

42
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,930
But due to Ma Wang manifesting,

43
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,690
 - Om mani padme— 
- he was killed.

44
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,770
 That cannot be. 

45
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,290
 That cannot... 

46
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,050
 Ha Ram. 

47
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,400
 My son. 

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,940
 Come out from my son. 

49
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,770
 No! 

50
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,920
After that night, I retracted the abdicated king's command

51
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,400
and took you into the palace.

52
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,410
It was to protect you and the people around you,

53
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,770
and to find a way to seal Ma Wang.

54
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,540
I ...

55
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,310
I acted like a beast ...

56
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,970
and killed my own father?

57
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,990
That's not your fault.

58
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,940
It was the doing of the evil spirit inside of you.

59
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,550
N-no. No.

60
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,450
That cannot be.

61
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,060
Your Majesty is lying.

62
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,380
- Calm down, Supervisor Ha.
 - That cannot be!

63
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,900
The blood-stain on my clothes was the blood of my father slain by the royal inquisitor!

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,930
Yes.

65
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,160
That's what you thought

66
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,550
all your life.

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,580
I could not bring myself to tell you when you were a child.

68
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,030
Even though it was the truth.

69
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,070
 Ha Ram. 

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,100
 Samshin, please ... 

71
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,190
 help him ... 

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,740
Although this is how things turned out due to an irreversible ill fate,

73
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,040
I shall repent for the wrongs done to your family

74
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,470
for the rest of my life.

75
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,100
And as long as I live,

76
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,330
I shall fight with Ma Wang and make sure such a horrible happening does not occur again.

77
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,750
I swear to you.

78
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,570
I also apologize with all my heart.

79
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,160
Your father's horrible fate

80
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,180
was not your fault.

81
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,830
 Episode 15: Reading the Stars 

82
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,420
 Please. 

83
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,340
 No, they should be all right. 

84
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,330
 It's me that Grand Prince Juhyang wants. 

85
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,010
 - Oh no...
 - Poor things. 

86
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,260
 What's going on? 

87
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,080
 My goodness! 

88
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,150
It seems Painter Hong Cheon Gi will not show up.

89
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,490
Proceed with the execution.

90
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,170
Headmaster ... Headmaster!

91
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,200
Headmaster!

92
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,230
Headmaster...

93
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,010
Stop! Stop!

94
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,140
Stop!

95
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,990
Cheon Gi!

96
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,520
Your Highness, please stop.

97
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,700
Cheon Gi, you must run away!

98
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,790
Cheon Gi ...

99
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,200
You have come.

100
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I knew you would come if you were desperate.

101
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
Why are you doing this?

102
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,390
Let my family go.

103
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,420
Why do you keep enraging me?

104
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,530
Your Highness killed my father.

105
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,600
How many more lives are you planning to take?

106
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Your father died because you ran away.

107
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,390
If all these people die, it will also be your fault.

108
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,150
Watch what happens if you defy my command.

109
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,910
I'll kill you!

110
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,930
You are worse than a beast!

111
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,940
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

112
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,110
I am the heavens.

113
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,860
No!

114
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,550
This is the royal command! Stop this instant!

115
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,720
 An Yeong Hui, Prince Juhyang's henchman 

116
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,470
Your Majesty!

117
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,550
Royal Father.

118
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,730
What a mess you have created.

119
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,280
How dare you!

120
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,540
You understand very well the gravity of your sins.

121
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,100
Clear up this execution site and let these people go.

122
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

123
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,020
Juhyang, you shall come to the palace this instant.

124
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,730
What are you all doing? Follow the royal command.

125
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,320
Yes, sir!

126
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,650
- Untie them. 
 - Yes, sir.

127
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,650
- Headmaster.
 - Cheon Gi.

128
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,790
Cheon Gi ...

129
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,700
Obnoxious One ...

130
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,470
Cheon Gi,  you're not hurt, are you?

131
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,110
Did you eat?

132
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,380
I'm all right. You were about to die, and you are worried if I've eaten?

133
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm supposed to live long. Aigoo ...

134
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,200
What else can we say?

135
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,890
We are all together and alive.

136
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,820
Why did you show up when anything could have happened?

137
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,260
Anyway, he wasn't going to execute us until you showed up.

138
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,240
No. I am truly grateful, Obnoxious One.

139
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,200
Don't pay attention to him because I'm truly, truly grateful.

140
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,010
I am so sorry.

141
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,050
Thank you for holding on.

142
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,490
Cheon Gi ...

143
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,300
I am so glad you all seem all right.

144
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
- Thank you so much.
- We owe it to you.

145
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,410
Thank you.

146
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,740
Thank you, Scholar Sir.

147
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,440
No. You are the one who saved everyone by coming here, putting your life at risk.

148
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,310
But ... Eun Oh ...

149
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,630
What happened to Eun Oh?

150
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,990
He was injured while fleeing from Grand Prince Juhyang

151
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,240
and passed away.

152
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,060
Cheon Gi.

153
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,320
 The master worked with His Majesty to help Painter Hong. 

154
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,420
 Has he joined forces with the enemy? 

155
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,330
 Have you truly changed your mind? 

156
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,090
 Father! 

157
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,580
 Your father died because you ran away. 

158
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,920
 If all these people die, it will also be your fault. 

159
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,300
 My poor Cheon Gi. 

160
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,430
 You have suffered too much, taking care of a bad father like me. 

161
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,150
 Father, wake up. 

162
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,430
 Father! 

163
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,590
 Father, don't do this ... 

164
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,090
Scholar Sir.

165
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,500
Maiden. You could not sleep?

166
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,630
No.

167
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,210
Father ...

168
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,780
died because of me.

169
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,660
My father ...

170
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,970
died when I was ten.

171
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:15,130
I thought he died by the royal inquisitor's sword at the king's command.

172
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,210
So, I swore to myself that I would make those who killed my father

173
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,550
suffer equally for everything they had done.

174
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,570
And, for a long time, I prepared for revenge.

175
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,900
As Il Wol Seong.

176
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,740
That was why ...

177
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,080
But all of that ...

178
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,410
was caused by me.

179
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,940
Ma Wang may be inside me, but ultimately

180
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,870
it was done by these hands.

181
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,970
I killed my father ...

182
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,450
and lived my entire life not knowing.

183
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,170
I couldn't even remember it.

184
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,720
That is not your fault.

185
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,210
Maiden.

186
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,720
You can cry when you are sad.

187
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,810
My poor father.

188
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,110
He didn't even get to live in his right mind his whole life.

189
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,660
It is all my fault.

190
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,030
Do not blame yourself

191
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,750
over things you have no control over.

192
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,750
What am I supposed to do now?

193
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,800
We should

194
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,260
hold a funeral for your father.

195
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,790
To allow him to pass in peace.

196
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,900
There is a place where I enshrined my father.

197
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,120
What has turned you this way?

198
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,020
Is it the Crown Prince?

199
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,820
Have you turned this way in the hope of becoming the king?

200
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,890
Answer me!

201
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,860
Doing all of this, you must have been prepared to die!

202
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,830
While I was facing death, you defied the royal command.

203
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,810
I cannot forgive you as your father nor your king.

204
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,370
I shall ... punish you accordingly.

205
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,950
What on earth are you doing?

206
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,680
Do you see?

207
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,040
Years ago, the night of the fire at Gyeongwonjeon,

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,080
 I got this scar. 

209
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,480
It is the trace of Ma Wang coming in contact with me.

210
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,250
The scar is spreading further from my stomach.

211
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,690
If Ma Wang is not transferred to my body,

212
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,060
my body will probably decay and die slowly.

213
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,870
Why did you not tell me sooner?

214
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,970
What would have changed if I had told you?

215
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:29,260
Royal Father was only focused on sealing Ma Wang.

216
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,980
Ma Wang ... cannot be contained in my body,

217
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,300
a body of a mere grand prince.

218
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,880
Can it not be cured?

219
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,230
If I cannot have Ma Wang, I am as good as dead.

220
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,420
Although you found out, nothing will change.

221
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,490
Because you are a king who cares more about the predecessor king's will

222
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:09,280
and the people of this nation than he cares about me.

223
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,980
You asked what has turned me this way?

224
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,010
That is you, Royal Father.

225
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,300
You are right.

226
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,200
Why do you acknowledge it?

227
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,980
Why?

228
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,100
Why will you not take my side?

229
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,110
Why not me but Yul?

230
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,120
Why did you choose Yul?

231
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,590
It is all ...

232
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,350
because I lack virtue.

233
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,100
What are you all doing?

234
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,540
Take him away this instant!

235
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,930
Take away His Highness.

236
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,730
Royal Father.

237
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,180
Royal Father!

238
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,440
This ...

239
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,800
This is who you are.

240
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,940
I shall never forget this.

241
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,470
Never!

242
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,700
Foolish child.

243
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,110
Let go of me, all of you!

244
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,860
Let go of me!

245
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
Stop.

246
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,670
You must have planned all of this.

247
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,540
- Hyeong-nim. 
 - Why?

248
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,230
Did you become greedy at the sight of the throne?

249
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,600
You pretended to be a good person with that smiling face of yours and dazzled people.

250
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,560
But you are also merely human.

251
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,470
Hyeong-nim.

252
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,680
Years ago, at the Seokcheok Rain Ritual,

253
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,670
if I had not taken you to Gyeongwonjeon,

254
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,480
you could have lived more peacefully.

255
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,180
I shall take responsibility for that sin.

256
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,710
Ask Royal Father for forgiveness.

257
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,450
It is not too late.

258
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,180
Forgiveness for what?

259
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,230
For pursuing Ma Wang, for ruining the sealing ritual in your greed for the throne,

260
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,440
for trying to hurt multiple people.

261
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,900
Seeing you spewing this nonsense, you must be feeling relieved.

262
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,710
Don't be such a hypocrite.

263
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,470
Reveal your true ambition now.

264
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,950
- Take him.
- Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,140
I will, I will certainly ...

266
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,950
certainly be back.

267
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,490
Is this what you wanted?

268
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,000
How will you cope with all the evil deeds you have done under Grand Prince Juhyang?

269
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,850
Everything is the will of the heavens.

270
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,830
Did you truly mean to transfer Ma Wang to Grand Prince Juhyang's body

271
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,620
and bring bloodshed to this nation?

272
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,140
How would you have dealt with Ma Wang's curse and the pain of countless people?

273
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,340
You must repay your debt to the heavens and this nation.

274
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,170
When the night of the red moon comes, the sealing ritual will take place again.

275
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,690
I ask you to lead the sealing of Ma Wang then.

276
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,700
What are you saying?

277
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,920
I have lost my divine powers at the last sealing ritual

278
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,240
and cannot lead the sealing ritual anymore.

279
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,850
There is no more time, Royal Shaman.

280
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,090
I shall return when the preparations are ready.

281
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,280
Is this where your father is enshrined?

282
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,750
Yes.

283
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,800
This is where the funerals of the generations of the Ha family take place.

284
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,530
I sent Father to his next life here.

285
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,600
Why is it far offshore?

286
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,450
It must be because the Ha family is born with the divine power of water.

287
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,780
Power of water?

288
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,720
Yes.

289
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,470
That was why I became the seokcheokdongja.

290
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,330
I shouldn't have said such a thing.

291
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,370
Now then, look around.

292
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,300
Do you see a boulder shaped like a candlestick?

293
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,180
Candlestick...

294
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,740
Yes, over there.

295
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,760
It really does look like a candlestick.

296
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,180
Let us carry out the ritual here.

297
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,590
Yes.

298
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,010
 Cheon Gi. 

299
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,280
 My Cheon Gi. 

300
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,110
 Do you know how long I have been looking for you? 

301
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,790
 Whoa, what a beautiful painting. 

302
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,650
 Say "ah".  
  Ah. 

303
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,610
 Oh, no! My daughter! 

304
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,680
 Father! No, it's a shower. 

305
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,160
 She's probably caught in the cold rain. 

306
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,600
 Father, it's me, Cheon Gi. Your daughter. 

307
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,860
Father ...

308
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,250
Farewell, Father.

309
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,400
I will pay for everything that I couldn't do in this life

310
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,630
when we meet again.

311
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,480
 Painter Hong, I wish you safe passage into eternity. 

312
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,090
Are you feeling better now?

313
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,790
Yes.

314
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,880
I felt like I could not do anything yesterday.

315
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,790
But I feel that I should move on with life now.

316
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,590
Please accept this.

317
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,110
Is this not the divine ring?

318
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,610
Mother had this until the day she passed away.

319
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,320
She did not even realize it was a divine item.

320
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,470
♫  Do you see ? My feeling for you  ♫

321
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,320
Will you accept it?

322
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,040
♫  Like destiny always cannot leave your side  ♫

323
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,730
I will.

324
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,890
♫  On a day still like this, can you hug me?  ♫

325
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,200
♫  I am waiting again just for you  ♫

326
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,580
Every time I am in danger, hold my hand like this.

327
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,990
I shall be by your side through rain or snow.

328
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,930
Do you mean it?

329
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:44,100
♫  I love you. I love you. Only one person.  ♫

330
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,980
♫  I hope we don't pass each other like the passing wind.  ♫

331
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:58,340
♫  I am here.  ♫

332
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,050
So this is your family house.

333
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,570
Yes.

334
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,880
This is where I grew up.

335
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,310
Goodness, Young Master!

336
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,030
You are here.

337
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,050
It has been too long, old man.

338
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,580
Young Master.

339
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,090
It isn't much but eat as much as you like, Young Master.

340
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,860
Thank you.

341
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,890
Please eat.

342
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,130
All right.

343
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,530
Let us stay here for the night and return to the capital tomorrow.

344
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,350
All right.

345
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,010
 Maiden. 

346
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,280
 My life so far was truly in vain. 

347
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,980
 I kept chasing after revenge, 

348
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:13,040
 but it turns out I killed my own father without remembering it. 

349
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,980
 Even if it was Ma Wang inside me and not myself, 

350
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,010
 I do not think I can forgive myself. 

351
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,160
 They're mine! 

352
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,100
 My eyes. 

353
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,310
 My eyes! 

354
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,000
 I will have them back, no matter what. 

355
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,120
 Father. What am I supposed to do? 

356
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,090
 Now I am finally trying to let go of my vengeful heart and truly live. 

357
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,440
 What am I supposed to do 

358
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,040
 with this thing inside me? 

359
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,940
Could it be...

360
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,950
Did Ma Wang manifest again ...

361
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,710
Scholar Sir!  Scholar...

362
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,500
Have you woken up already?

363
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Where did the scholar go?

364
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,120
He asked me to relay to you that he had to return

365
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,700
to the capital first because of an urgent matter.

366
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
 Maiden. Forgive me for leaving by myself. 

367
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,890
 Ma Wang is still after you. 

368
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,760
 I will find a way for us to be together without you getting hurt. 

369
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,750
 Ha Ram. 

370
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,560
 Do not carry all the pain by yourself. 

371
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,600
 I will also seek a way in my own way. 

372
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,200
 I shall not fail to complete the painting to seal Ma Wang again. 

373
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,340
- Hey, Obnoxious One.
- Hey, you—

374
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,000
Hey, Long Face, Annoying One.

375
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,050
You ... Are you all right?

376
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,030
Judging by her face, she didn't even get anything to eat.

377
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,490
What do you mean "not eat"? I was well taken care of.

378
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,240
You're on your way to the Painting Bureau?

379
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,340
- Yes.
- Wait a moment.

380
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,260
Hey. Hey!

381
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,120
Is she all right?

382
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,820
I think she is, but...

383
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,690
This is all the information on Ma Wang that Wolseongdang informants have managed to find so far.

384
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,100
Madam Mae Hyang dismantled Wolseongdang.

385
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,510
Search for more information.

386
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,940
Yes, sir.

387
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,830
Being here like this,

388
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:58,020
I feel like Hyeong-nim Mu Yeong will appear from somewhere.

389
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,890
I will not let Mu Yeong's death be in vain.

390
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,440
The royal portrait ripped?

391
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,460
How are we to prepare for the sealing ritual now?

392
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,100
It is all my fault, Royal Father.

393
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,940
No.

394
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,410
Wouldn't I know that you tried your best?

395
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,250
It is just that...

396
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,270
I do not have much time left in me.

397
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:38,460
If I could only die after seeing Ma Wang being sealed in that painting ...

398
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,130
Could you do that for me?

399
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,920
Royal Father.

400
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,920
I will make it happen, without a doubt.

401
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:54,820
Once we succeed in sealing Ma Wang, Hyeong-nim will finally give up as well.

402
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:02,780
Already ... the forces trying to save Juhyang are gradually getting stronger.

403
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,620
This sealing ritual must be carried out as secretly as possible.

404
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,360
Yes, Royal Father.

405
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,940
I understand.

406
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,430
 What could be the reason that the royal portrait that I painted ripped? 

407
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,120
 The sealing ritual proceeded because the royal shaman said everything was ready. 

408
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,920
 Just what was missing? 

409
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,730
Divine painter.

410
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,000
Hwacha.

411
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,170
I am here to make a deal.

412
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,740
Could I ask you one thing?

413
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,850
Are you not prepared yet?

414
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,810
What is the reason the royal portrait I drew got torn to pieces?

415
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,080
That is because you did not bargain with me.

416
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:20,800
A divine painting drawn without a deal with Hwacha cannot be deemed complete.

417
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,020
What does that mean?

418
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,120
If you bargain with me, my powers will envelop you

419
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,140
and you will be able to complete a divine royal portrait.

420
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,540
Then, if I do not bargain with you,

421
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,230
will I not be able to complete a divine royal portrait?

422
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,900
That is right.

423
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,100
The painter who painted King Yeongjong's royal portrait that was burned,

424
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,030
also made a deal with me to complete the royal portrait to seal Ma Wang.

425
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,080
 Look. 

426
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,670
Father?

427
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,220
Father. Father!

428
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,140
Father.

429
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,840
How admirable my father is...

430
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,500
Father.

431
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:42,880
I will do well, just as you did.

432
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,310
Ma Wang's handprint.

433
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,370
- Can you paint? 
 - I can.

434
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,190
You cannot paint with that hand.

435
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,060
Do you want to treat your hand and paint?

436
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,700
Yes.

437
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,280
Then first, bargain with me.

438
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,220
These are all rumors and fearmongering about Ma Wang.

439
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,280
But here is something to this effect.

440
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,400
"The one who possesses the ring of moderation is able to harness Ma Wang's power."

441
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,580
"The one who gains Ma Wang's powers begins to thirst for bloodshed more and more."

442
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,060
Sir, are you all right?

443
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,050
I shall call a physician.

444
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,660
 You are mine. 

445
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,400
 You are mine.  

446
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,450
 You are mine. 

447
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,080
 You are mine... 

448
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,530
- You are here. 
 - I am.

449
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,020
 Your Highness, it is Wol Seon. 

450
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,650
What is it?

451
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,370
This man is the son of Gan Yun Guk, the erstwhile divine painter.

452
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,920
What?

453
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,390
A few days ago, Hwacha visited the shamanistic shrine

454
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,350
to inform us about how this sealing ritual is the last remaining chance.

455
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,490
Is that true?

456
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,960
Yes.

457
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,620
And he said that for the divine painting to be created for this sealing ritual,

458
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,250
the two painters must work together,

459
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,000
and revealed Painter Sim Dae Yu's identity.

460
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,730
- Is that true? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

461
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,330
I think my father was Master Painter Gan Yun Guk.

462
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,360
As a child, I was left at a Buddhist temple and grew up there,

463
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,740
but I had an item left behind by my father.

464
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,780
 Gan Yun Guk of Painting Bureau 

465
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,360
Extraordinary!

466
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,710
Listen well, painters.

467
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,900
Just like at the sealing ritual twenty years ago,

468
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,210
two painters must complete the royal portrait together.

469
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,810
And because Ma Wang's energy still lingers in Painter Hong's wrist,

470
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,190
painting of the royal portrait cannot start until the day of the sealing ritual.

471
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,340
The royal portrait must be finished at one sitting?  How ludicrous is that?

472
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,330
According to Hwacha's oracle,

473
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:10,320
the first and last brush strokes of the painting must be made on the day of the sealing ritual.

474
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,390
What are we to do?

475
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:26,000
Even if there are two divine painters, is this possible?

476
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,250
Your Highness. I shall try to get it done.

477
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,750
I think I can do it.

478
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,960
How do you know that?

479
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,820
Well, actually, I made a deal with Hwacha.

480
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,340
What? What have you done?

481
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,650
 Bargain with me. 

482
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,730
 But is it truly all right? 

483
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,540
 Will I not become mad or die? 

484
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,470
 I do not take lives. 

485
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,850
 I only take paintings.   

486
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,570
 All right. I shall bargain with you. 

487
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,210
 The deal has been made. 

488
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,690
 Do not hold a paintbrush until you get to the place of the sealing ritual. 

489
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,020
 What do you mean? 

490
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,200
 I do not have enough time even if I start now and paint all night. 

491
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,470
 If you do not do as I say, you shall never be able to hold a paintbrush. 

492
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,810
I also think this sealing ritual is our last chance.

493
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,730
If we fail again this time,

494
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,110
everything will come to naught and ... even if my life is spared, it will have no meaning.

495
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,860
Still, making a deal with Hwacha—

496
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,480
Without a deal with Hwacha, the royal portrait cannot become infused with divine powers in the end.

497
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,290
But the madness. What about the madness?

498
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,670
I heard Hwacha is not a being who takes away

499
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,240
human lives or brings madness.

500
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,970
For now, I would like to believe those words.

501
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,850
 How is this ring on my finger? 

502
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,520
 Are you curious? 

503
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,160
The old man from the stone cell?

504
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,870
How can I see you?

505
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,550
You brat!

506
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,830
The old man from the stone cell?

507
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,670
I am your grandfather.

508
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,330
- Grandfather? 
 - That's right.

509
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:38,180
I finally get to hear you address me that way now.

510
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,670
I am here to deliver information about Ma Wang and the sealing.
   

511
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,250
What is it?

512
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:52,130
Generation after generation, we, the Ha's, are born possessing the power of water.

513
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,390
You were also born with the noble destiny

514
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,370
to benefit humankind.

515
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,360
That is also why your body was able to serve to lock in Ma Wang.

516
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,850
But ... I even killed my father.

517
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,560
If I stay near the people I care about,

518
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,390
I will put them in danger.

519
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,560
You fool. Ma Wang was the one who killed them, not you.

520
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,010
You still can't understand that?

521
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,170
But you, too, are a mere human and there is a limit to sealing him inside you.

522
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:33,050
Even now, Ma Wang is inhabiting you more and more.

523
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,520
Then, wouldn't everything be solved if only I disappear?

524
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,680
No.

525
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:45,390
To seal Ma Wang forever, it must be contained in a divine vessel.

526
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,320
I am talking about the royal portrait.

527
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,510
Divine royal portrait.

528
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,630
That is the only way to be true to your destiny.

529
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:02,310
But then, the painters become mad or die.

530
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:08,730
However, if Ma Wang is not sealed, you will be consumed by Ma Wang

531
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,860
and that will bring wide bloodshed to this land.

532
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,740
You will, in the end, kill the woman whom you cherish.

533
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,590
Then what am I to do?

534
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,680
Break the ring and head to the sealing ritual.

535
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:31,590
As long as you have the ring, you have no choice but to coexist with Ma Wang.

536
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,430
Grandfather.

537
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,670
 Break the ring ... 

538
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,530
Your Majesty.

539
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,900
I told you not to return even in death.

540
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,570
Yet you have returned like this.

541
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:14,090
Your Majesty, have you been in good health?

542
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:20,430
The sealing that you and Head Taoist Ha Seong Jin accomplished at the past sealing ritual

543
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,080
was for the good of all people.

544
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,300
The heavens gifted your divine power for you to use for the good of the people.

545
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,410
But why did you use your powers for Juhyang

546
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,560
who was seized by traitorous ambition?

547
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,110
It was the last choice left to me, a royal shaman

548
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,210
thrown out before I could complete my duties.

549
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,180
I  deserve death, Your Majesty.

550
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,450
Very well.

551
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:56,490
Now, the only way for you to wash yourself of your sins

552
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:00,800
is to seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait.

553
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,230
Accomplish the sealing.

554
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:09,200
This is the last command to you, as the past royal shaman.

555
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

556
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,060
I shall use all of my remaining divine powers.

557
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,760
Have you made up your mind?

558
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,460
Yes.

559
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,570
I shall help seal Ma Wang in the royal portrait.

560
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,310
A good decision.

561
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,320
Very good.

562
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:46,880
Is that the divine ring?

563
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,140
Yes.

564
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,150
But this ring appears to be dangerous.

565
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,590
What do you mean?

566
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:58,240
My ancestor appeared in a forewarning dream and told me

567
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,170
that keeping this ring will mean coexisting with Ma Wang.

568
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:07,180
It seems that this ring must be broken before the sealing ritual.

569
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,420
If that ring brings such bad fortune,

570
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,850
breaking it could provide a solution.

571
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,500
Yes, Your Highness.

572
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:21,130
This sealing ritual will be carried out tonight at the hour of the rat* when the red moon rises.
  (*between 11pm - 1am) 

573
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:26,020
So you must be at the sealing ritual before then.

574
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,620
I understand, Your Highness.

575
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:37,350
But ... one in a million, if I do not show up

576
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,880
or if the sealing ritual fails again,

577
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,010
I ask you to look after Maiden Hong.

578
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,420
- What do you mean? 
 - Your Highness.

579
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,870
Please promise me ... that you will.

580
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,610
I will.

581
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,640
I promise you.

582
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,320
Grand Prince Juhyang.

583
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,330
It is Mae Hyang.

584
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,100
What brings you to a place like this?

585
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
I am here to support Your Highness.

586
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,230
Whose orders are you acting on?

587
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,080
- Is it Il Wol Seong? 
 - No.

588
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:41,800
- How could I trust you? 
 - Then let me tell you this.

589
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,890
Il Wol Seong backstabbed me.

590
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,940
If you would only let me, I shall support you until the end.

591
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,930
I could also stab you in the back.

592
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,870
Are you all right with that?

593
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,910
You shall find out little by little,

594
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,990
but the power behind me has a longer history than you realize.

595
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,870
Please do not brush me off like this.

596
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,600
What is it that you want from me?

597
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,600
Rise to the throne.

598
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,480
That is what I wish.

599
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,350
Give me a token.

600
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:30,300
I can only decide if I see your determination.

601
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:53,470
 A wench with hidden motives, no doubt. 

602
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,910
 Break the ring and head to the sealing ritual. 

603
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,480
 As long as you have the ring, 

604
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,790
 you have no choice but to coexist with Ma Wang. 

605
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,640
 Well done, Ha Ram. 

606
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,430
 Be well. 

607
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,950
Grandfather?

608
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:45,560
 Take good care of the Ha family. 

609
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,870
Your Highness.

610
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:09,640
Suddenly I do not sense the power of water.

611
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,070
You mean something has happened to Supervisor Ha?

612
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,600
What are we to do?

613
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,520
No.

614
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,790
Supervisor Ha will not fail to come to the sealing ritual.

615
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,350
So, make sure the sealing ritual is prepared as planned.

616
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,980
 Yes, Your Highness. 

617
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,480
Your Majesty, the full red moon has risen.

618
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,000
Yes.

619
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:47,580
But they say Supervisor Ha is not here yet.

620
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,660
What? Supervisor Ha?

621
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

622
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,260
Your Majesty.

623
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,210
Your Majesty. Are you all right?

624
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,060
 Where is the ring? 

625
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,400
 Scholar Sir, you must get here safely. 

626
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:45,570
 Timing and Subtitles by For Your Eyes Only 👁👁Team @ Viki  

627
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,490
 Lovers of the Red Sky 

628
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:52,200
 You must complete the painting within the next four hours, when the full red moon will reach its zenith. 

629
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,890
 If we cannot seal Ma Wang tonight, the scholar becomes a part of Ma Wang. 

630
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,960
 Are you afraid that you will be sealed again? 

631
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,890
 Your body is almost taken over by me. 

632
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,370
 Supervisor Ha. 

633
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,080
 That man is not Supervisor Ha. 

634
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,800
 It is Ma Wang! 

635
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,450
 Ha Ram. 

636
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,260
 Found you. 

637
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:24,450
 Lovers of the Red Sky
