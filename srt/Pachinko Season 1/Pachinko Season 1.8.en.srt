1
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,021
(in Japanese) Whatever I do,
it's always the same.

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,565
They always gang up on me.

3
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,567
Hey, don't be a crybaby!

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,818
It's embarrassing.

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,948
But the tears just come out.

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,824
Next time, they'll be the ones crying.

7
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,537
You always say that, but we never win.

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,250
Because you always give up!

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,585
I told you, like this…

10
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,004
(in Korean) Noa!

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,133
See ya! I have the party today.

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,387
Don't forget to bring me
some of your aunt's rice cakes!

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,721
Papa!

14
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,725
Move over! You reek of garlic.

15
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,024
Noa, don't be like this.

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,112
Today's celebration
is not just about your little brother.

17
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,074
You must understand,

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,494
not too long ago, many of our babies died
before their first birthdays.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,247
This celebration, it's for all of us.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,874
I don't know.

21
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,835
It feels like it's always about him.

22
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,422
Noa,

23
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,799
you're the older brother now.

24
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,385
Your brother will count on you
for many things.

25
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,305
But you swear
I had a first birthday party too?

26
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,853
How could I lie about such a thing?

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,148
Times were harder for us then,

28
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,941
but you never went without.

29
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,902
You should thank your mother for that.

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,905
And you're absolutely sure
I picked the red yarn?

31
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,490
You don't know how happy it made us.

32
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,035
But it's not really an exciting future
for me, is it?

33
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,080
Why couldn't I have picked
the bow and arrow?
Why couldn't I have picked
the bow and arrow?

34
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,165
Noa,

35
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,294
trust me,
a long life is nothing to scoff at.

36
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,173
Well, Mozasu better pick the coins.

37
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,927
He has a beggar in his belly,
so he needs to be rich.

38
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,555
Papa, why do you keep laughing?
I'm serious.

39
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,349
You really should pray for it.

40
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,121
Thank you all for coming
to celebrate our son's first year.

41
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,583
As you can see, he is clearly flourishing.

42
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,419
The Lord has truly blessed us.

43
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,383
This tradition of the doljabi

44
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,721
binds us not only to you all
but also to those who came before--

45
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,974
Enough words.
Enough words.

46
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,477
Save them for your sermons.

47
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,190
My brother is eager
to meet my son's fortune.

48
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,608
How could I deny him that?

49
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,614
It's time for Mozasu to choose his fate.

50
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,700
Can't I just pick for him?

51
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,790
Mozasu, let's pick!

52
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,612
So,

53
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,156
it's coming.

54
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,076
The end.

55
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,414
I would prepare yourself.

56
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,967
Is she… in much pain?

57
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,386
She won't tell us.

58
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,806
Yes.

59
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,808
Tremendous pain.

60
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,187
We can give her morphine.

61
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,522
But I must inform you,

62
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,401
at the dosage required to stem her pain,

63
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,695
she will be with us in body,

64
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,948
but her spirit might as well be gone.

65
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,662
No. I don't want her like that.

66
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,290
But Etsuko, what's best for Hana--

67
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,960
Stay out of this!

68
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,805
Slow down now!

69
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,265
You'll trample over one another,

70
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,643
and we'll have a body
to pick off the ground.

71
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,812
Too many people here now.

72
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,939
Mama!

73
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,191
Mama!

74
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,986
What is it? Are you hurt?

75
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,613
I waited almost an hour.

76
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,199
Why didn't he come?

77
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,409
What do you mean?

78
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,537
Your father didn't pick you up
from school?

79
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,998
Mama, look.

80
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,416
Something's happening.

81
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,257
Excuse me. Please excuse me.
Excuse me. Please excuse me.

82
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,801
Did you check in there?

83
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,345
They're saying he's a traitor.

84
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,892
Mrs. Baek!

85
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,605
Where's my husband?

86
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,068
He's been arrested.

87
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,028
Arrested?

88
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,822
Why?

89
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,366
They won't say.

90
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,911
Just that the crime
is of the most serious nature.

91
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,371
Where is he now?

92
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,874
They're questioning him
at the local station.

93
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,751
They must've mistaken him
for someone else.

94
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,963
I must go to him right away.

95
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,131
Child, listen.

96
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,302
Those men came here
specifically looking for Isak.

97
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,679
Do you know what that means?

98
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,850
It means someone named him.

99
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,353
You must be careful,

100
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,606
and you must pray.
and you must pray.

101
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,361
Noa,

102
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,447
go find your uncle.
Bring him to the station.

103
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,032
Can you do that?

104
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,867
Go now.

105
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,855
Noa, what are you doing here?

106
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,775
-You must come! Papa has been arrested.
-Arrested?

107
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,194
-He was arrested?
-They took him to the station.

108
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,737
Mama is there now.

109
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,739
I need to tell my boss.

110
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,076
Wait here.

111
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,506
We have an hour.

112
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,467
Let's get your father out.

113
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,388
This makes no sense to me.

114
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,474
How is this possible?

115
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,311
You closed the deal.

116
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,188
Why would they fire you?

117
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,691
She changed her mind at the last minute.

118
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,901
But why?

119
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,571
Because I told her to.

120
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,407
Why would you do that?

121
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,534
I wanted to.

122
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,292
I can't understand this, but enough.

123
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,253
Go back to America, understand?

124
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,588
I can't go back.

125
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,756
I lost my visa.

126
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,012
What do we do then?

127
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,056
America's not the answer.
That's a fantasy.

128
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,516
What are you talking about?

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,896
Papa, no one's going to hire me now.
Papa, no one's going to hire me now.

130
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,858
The only one who'll work with me

131
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,443
is Yoshii-san.

132
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,323
He came to see me the other day.

133
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,284
He heard what happened.

134
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,244
I don't care what he's offering.

135
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,330
You will have nothing to do with him!

136
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,332
He wants to open pachinko parlors--

137
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,666
Pachinko? You?

138
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,669
You and Grandmother always say
there's no shame in it--

139
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,047
For me, yes, but for my son?

140
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,302
I know that bullshit Yoshii fed you.

141
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,597
He said it was all legitimate,

142
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,890
didn't he?

143
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,100
You know how I know?

144
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,687
Because his grandfather
once said the same thing to me.

145
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,405
Like you, I wanted too much, too fast.

146
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:02,371
But thanks to your mother and
grandmother, I was spared that fate.
But thanks to your mother and
grandmother, I was spared that fate.

147
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,541
If it weren't for them,
who knows what would've happened.

148
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,585
That happened a long time ago.

149
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,420
Mamoru Yoshii had nothing to do--

150
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,130
It's the same blood!

151
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,508
The grandfather's blood
runs through his grandson.

152
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,260
That's ridiculous.

153
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,804
I won't allow it!

154
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,639
Even for all the riches in the world--

155
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,809
You sound like it doesn't matter.
The money, the success.

156
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,146
That's not what I'm saying.

157
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,481
I get it,

158
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,233
but your dreams,

159
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,320
they're just not enough for me.

160
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,419
Noa, what are they saying?

161
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,132
Papa is being questioned
by the "higher police" or something.

162
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:01,096
He says Papa is weak,
so he would die in prison.
He says Papa is weak,
so he would die in prison.

163
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,275
What's happening?

164
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,527
Uncle got in trouble.

165
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:24,453
He's saying Papa can return home
if he is innocent,

166
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:28,165
but if he is guilty…

167
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,003
Now he said that's enough.

168
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,798
Other people are waiting.

169
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,950
I will go to my boss and explain to him.

170
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,705
He'll be furious
when he hears how I've been treated.

171
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,333
And he'll help us then?

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,045
Isak will be able to come home tonight?

173
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,049
My brother will not sleep a single night
in a jail cell.

174
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,637
Not Isak.

175
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,847
Never.

176
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,186
What's this face now?

177
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,982
What did I just say?

178
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,234
You're going to bring Papa home.

179
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,320
Of course. I'll bring him back right away.

180
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,123
Excuse me, ma'am.

181
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,916
A moment.

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,543
What do you want?

183
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,837
Have they taken your husband as well?

184
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,464
My brother-in-law.

185
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,799
Three months ago.
Three months ago.

186
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,509
Three months?

187
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,137
And you haven't seen him since?

188
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,680
No.

189
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,016
When was your husband arrested?

190
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,852
This morning.

191
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,105
But there's been a terrible mistake.

192
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,525
He's just a pastor.
He's not involved in politics.

193
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,778
You are Pastor Baek's wife.

194
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,197
How…

195
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,699
how do you know my husband?

196
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,163
Not here.

197
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,042
Noa, let's go.

198
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,809
Are there really spies everywhere?

199
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,562
Especially now
that they're gearing for more war.

200
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:58,649
But isn't there always some war somewhere?

201
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,442
What does it have to do with us here?
What does it have to do with us here?

202
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:04,321
Aren't we the ones
who always bear the brunt?

203
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,075
Your husband taught us that.

204
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,163
So, you knew my husband well?

205
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,207
My brother-in-law knew him well.

206
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,210
At first,
he was suspicious of your husband,

207
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,172
as were the other men
at the factories around here.

208
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:28,053
But the Pastor earned their trust,
their love even.

209
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:33,851
He taught the men
that there is power in numbers.

210
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,980
We weren't used to
hearing such power in words.

211
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,859
He made us feel proud.

212
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,862
My husband did all that?

213
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,406
He did.

214
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,450
And even as our bellies cried in hunger,

215
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,495
we fed off his hope.

216
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,331
But now what will we do?

217
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,757
How old are you?

218
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,510
Seven.

219
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,265
A boy should have a father.

220
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:16,935
Now come.

221
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,021
We must tell Hasegawa-san what's happened.

222
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:23,108
-Who is that?
-You don't even know Hasegawa?

223
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,323
Apparently, I know nothing.

224
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,368
Then it's time for you to meet.

225
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,376
Mama!

226
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,505
What did they arrest him for?

227
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,673
I wish I knew.

228
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,760
The police wouldn't say why.

229
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,179
Normally they tell someone
why they're being arrested.

230
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,390
I knew you'd understand, Shimamura-san.

231
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,935
The whole thing is ridiculous.

232
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,479
To lump my brother in
with those unpatriotic persons--
To lump my brother in
with those unpatriotic persons--

233
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,648
What is it that you say? Unpatriotic?

234
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,943
Yes, it makes no sense, right?

235
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,363
My brother would never get involved
in anything like that.

236
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,157
You never mentioned
it was a political crime.

237
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,662
But my brother's innocent--

238
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,789
-That's not what the police believe.
-I swear to you--

239
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,708
You're his family.
Of course that's what you say.

240
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,753
You're putting me in a difficult position.

241
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,383
The other workers respect you.

242
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,011
But they say you can't fight blood.

243
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:39,017
The blood that runs in your brother
courses through you as well.

244
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,272
Please, I need this job.
My family depends on me.

245
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,609
I'm sorry, but I have to let you go.

246
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,065
Say…

247
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,821
I need you to do something for me.

248
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,115
Anything.

249
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,623
After I'm gone,

250
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:49,922
take care of her for me. My mother.

251
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,560
Hana.

252
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,484
Are you scared?

253
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,196
I'm scared.

254
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:22,579
I never dreamed it would end like this.

255
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,874
Here,

256
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,878
in this shitty room.

257
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,467
But Hawaii.

258
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,929
That would've been a glorious death.

259
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,017
My feet sinking into the warm sand.

260
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,938
The sound of waves holding me close.

261
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,361
But I guess it's all the same in the end.

262
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,782
Death is death.

263
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:10,085
I ran away, Solomon. I squandered it all.

264
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,674
I don't want that for you.

265
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,095
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,682
Why are you apologizing?

267
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,149
I left you behind. I'm sorry.

268
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:39,489
I'm sorry I didn't look for you sooner.

269
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,951
I always played by their rules.

270
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:50,459
I did everything they asked of me.

271
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,262
And they made a fool out of you,
didn't they?
And they made a fool out of you,
didn't they?

272
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,432
Yes.

273
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,519
They made a fool out of me.

274
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,711
Solomon,

275
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,674
it's time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

276
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,300
Enough.

277
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:45,305
Whatever it takes, grab it all.

278
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,851
Show them no mercy.

279
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:56,066
Because what mercy did they ever show us?

280
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,239
Fuck them.

281
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,121
Do it for me.

282
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:23,510
Our pastor has been taken.

283
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:35,022
Hasegawa and his daughter have been hiding
since the arrests started.

284
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:39,693
Go, talk to him. He'll have your answers.

285
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,449
He says come in and sit.

286
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,086
He says I look like Papa.

287
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,142
Papa talked about you so much,

288
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,436
she says you feel like a sister.

289
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,939
I see.

290
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,859
But you are both strangers to me.

291
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,987
He never mentioned either of you.

292
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,415
Papa didn't want us to know about them.

293
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,177
To protect us,

294
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,847
he had to split up the two worlds.

295
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,849
Something like that.

296
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,560
But what is this place?

297
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,396
Who are you really?

298
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:13,036
He is a professor, and…

299
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,166
a… Communist-something?

300
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,604
He and Papa dreamed of bringing together
workers from other countries.

301
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:43,984
To fight for peace and fair wages.

302
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,363
Then it's true.

303
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,491
You were both working against the emperor.

304
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,250
"It's the emperor
who fights against them."
"It's the emperor
who fights against them."

305
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,296
So,

306
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,174
what happens to us now?

307
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,635
While you men were growing heavy
with these dreams,

308
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,220
who is to put food on our tables,

309
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,722
or clothes on my children's back?

310
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,103
Were we ever a thought to either of you?

311
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,444
She says Papa did it for you and me.

312
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,120
How dare you talk to me like that?

313
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,165
Look at your hands.

314
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:45,879
They've never seen a day's work.

315
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,589
Who are you

316
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,259
to tell me my fears are meaningless?

317
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,641
We don't have time for this.

318
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,227
We need to get your father home.
We need to get your father home.

319
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,355
He says we won't find him.

320
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,824
He's lying!

321
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,952
He says Papa won't ever come home
because he was betrayed!

322
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,164
Mama, it's the police!

323
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,596
I'm pleased.

324
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,806
We'll be good partners together.

325
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,894
I didn't come here to talk about pachinko.

326
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,023
Colton Hotels, they're still a player.

327
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,581
I'm guessing you have a plan?
Let's hear it.
I'm guessing you have a plan?
Let's hear it.

328
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,334
Between Colton and Abe-san,

329
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,545
nearly ten billion yen
have already been sunk into the project.

330
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,132
But it won't be easy for them to liquidate
the surrounding properties so quickly.

331
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,426
Not with that crucial piece
of land missing.

332
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,721
There's an opportunity here,
a lucrative one.

333
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,850
Because whoever gets that woman's land
can ask for anything.

334
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,269
And what makes you think
she'll sell to you this time?

335
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,438
She won't. I know that.

336
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,107
But you…

337
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,862
you have your ways, don't you?

338
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,450
You get her to sell.

339
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:41,078
I'll handle the sale
to Colton and Abe-san.

340
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,332
And I'll make them bleed for it.
That's the point.

341
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,424
You see all that?

342
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,386
What if I told you, in two years,

343
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,389
all that land will be worth
a quarter of what it is now?
all that land will be worth
a quarter of what it is now?

344
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,765
Not possible.

345
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,893
What do you think the collateral
on all that is, out there?

346
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,645
Usually some other company assets.

347
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,943
And if I said the banks have been taking
the land itself as collateral?

348
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,279
That's crazy.

349
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,531
And yet, it's true.

350
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,867
Everyone's lost their minds.

351
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,453
Too busy gorging themselves off
the feast they think will never end.

352
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,747
But it will.

353
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:30,752
As soon as the first bank calls in a loan,
it all comes crashing down.

354
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,551
So we better be quick about it.

355
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,363
There's one more thing.

356
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:02,492
But this one is personal.
But this one is personal.

357
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,914
I want to do something for a friend.

358
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:14,004
Don't you think you should

359
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,549
wait to see how you feel in a day or two?

360
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:23,931
That way--

361
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,599
Mama.

362
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:33,315
I'm not getting any better.

363
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,073
I'm just… so tired.

364
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:49,581
I'm ready for a long sleep.

365
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,351
I'll go tell the doctor.

366
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,689
Mama.

367
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,078
I know.

368
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:31,456
I know.

369
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,677
I just don't understand.

370
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,304
How did it all go so wrong?

371
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,017
Keep it together.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

372
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,518
It's not over yet.

373
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,854
But Mother--

374
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,315
A girl is dying.

375
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,066
Have some perspective.

376
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,860
I know,

377
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,070
but aren't you concerned at all?
but aren't you concerned at all?

378
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,615
After all these years,

379
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,034
why are those people
barging back into our lives?

380
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,746
Solomon is a good boy.

381
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,706
We raised him right--

382
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,791
But wasn't Noa raised right?

383
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,293
Look what happened to him.

384
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:23,050
Just because we love them
doesn't mean we know them.

385
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,558
Were you aware
of your husband's involvement

386
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,228
with the General Council
of Labor Unions of Japan?

387
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:35,979
What is that?

388
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,533
Have you read or written
any anti-government literature?

389
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,576
I…

390
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,874
don't know how to read or write.

391
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:09,388
Have you been to any meetings
with negative views against the emperor?

392
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,140
I've never been to a meeting.

393
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,726
Until today, I've never even heard
these kinds of words before.

394
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,276
And yet you are married to an agitator.

395
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,533
The man I know…

396
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,495
is a husband,

397
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,289
a father,

398
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,957
a pastor…

399
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,546
a good man.

400
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,515
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,227
I don't know why I'm saying these things.

402
00:32:58,812 --> 00:32:59,813
Mother?

403
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,025
You think
I would let that happen to Solomon?
You think
I would let that happen to Solomon?

404
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,860
Are you crazy?

405
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,449
Solomon is not your brother.

406
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,243
And what happened then,

407
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:17,247
I won't let it happen again.

408
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,241
Let's go.

409
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,007
It will take effect soon.

410
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,219
In five to ten minutes.

411
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,263
If you need me, please call.

412
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,810
You can't catch it just by looking at me.

413
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,938
She meant no harm.

414
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:33,614
You will feel the effects
in five or ten minutes.

415
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,159
I will check on you then,

416
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,620
but if you need anything, press this.

417
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,123
I'll come right away.

418
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,292
Is there anything else?

419
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,710
Thank you.

420
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,801
Solomon…

421
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:53,886
where is he?

422
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,187
When will he come?

423
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,333
Noa.

424
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,460
Papa!

425
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,129
-Noa!
-Enough!

426
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,467
-Papa!
-Shut up!

427
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,594
-Noa!
-Papa!

428
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:37,554
Let go of my daddy!

429
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:41,225
Noa!

430
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:45,020
Papa! Papa!

431
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,025
Don't take my father away!
He can't leave us!

432
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:57,449
Papa, don't go!

433
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,034
You can't leave us!

434
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,494
Papa!
Papa!

435
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:15,759
Papa!

436
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:42,244
…it's been nearly 50 years
since the last asteroid came this close.

437
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,706
On its trajectory toward the sun,

438
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:51,587
this asteroid came
within 500,000 miles to Earth.

439
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,841
Scientists estimate that the asteroid

440
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:58,594
is traveling at 46,000 miles per hour…

441
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,846
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

442
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:04,516
You have the paperwork
signed by the director of this hospital.

443
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,809
Yes, but how did you--

444
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,227
That doesn't matter.

445
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,147
You're going on a trip. Ready?

446
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,442
-I wanna go.
-Where are you going?

447
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:14,860
What are you saying?

448
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,864
Be careful!

449
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:23,035
What's he doing? Slow down!

450
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,745
You're going too fast!

451
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,205
Hawaii.

452
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,137
Mama!

453
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,089
Mama,

454
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,176
I'm going to sleep now.

455
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,099
Sweet dreams.

456
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,811
My little Hana.

457
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,612
Sweet dreams.

458
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,741
I'm going to take care of everything now.

459
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,327
Don't worry.

460
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,558
I used to think this watch was a curse.

461
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,854
But I realize now,
But I realize now,

462
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:05,526
this watch saved our family.

463
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:23,043
Perhaps it will do that for you as well.

464
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:26,880
That is my hope.

465
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,436
MATH THE 6TH GRADE
SOCIAL STUDIES

466
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,434
What's with those dogs?

467
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,811
Take them away!

468
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,479
You're waking the street.

469
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:06,855
Sunja,

470
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,232
what is this?

471
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,820
You're making kimchi?

472
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,489
But why so much?

473
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,866
I'll ferment one half

474
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,826
and take the other half to market.

475
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:24,164
I'm hoping there will be
those who like fresh kimchi.

476
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:30,170
He won't be happy.

477
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,382
What choice do we have?

478
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,810
Please understand.

479
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,693
You don't think I'll find another job?

480
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,237
That's what this is about, isn't it?

481
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,491
Just so you know,
I got a lead over at the tire factory.

482
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,910
Of course, we know you'll get another job.
Of course, we know you'll get another job.

483
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,955
I'm sure Sunja means
for this just to be temporary.

484
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,293
I mean no disrespect. You must know that.

485
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,296
But we have no money coming in,

486
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,882
and our savings will run out
in a few days.

487
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,676
I must think of the boys now.

488
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:19,344
And you think I don't?

489
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,889
You don't think it kills me to know

490
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:23,557
my baby brother is in a prison somewhere?

491
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,144
He's in prison!

492
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:35,819
Whether I have to beg or borrow,
those boys will never go hungry.

493
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,071
Not in my house.

494
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,867
Then let me help you.

495
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,829
Because if I don't do something…

496
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,709
This helplessness, I can't bear it.

497
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:35,379
What's with the face?

498
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,716
Aren't you going to school?

499
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,098
When I was your age,

500
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,101
we couldn't afford school.

501
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:55,274
This is a privilege.
Don't take it for granted.

502
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,443
Who are you?

503
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:01,697
Why do you walk this path?

504
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,574
There's a shorter route.

505
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,035
How do you know where my school is?

506
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,204
I know many things.

507
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,082
It's what protects me.

508
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,502
Remember that.

509
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,884
My father preferred this way.

510
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:24,344
And why is that?

511
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:28,432
There's an old woman down the street
who has a piano.

512
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:32,436
She plays every morning
on our way to school.

513
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:36,106
My father liked to hear the music.

514
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,490
Have you heard of the Kanto earthquake?

515
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:50,120
You should answer
when addressed by an adult.

516
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,039
No.

517
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,208
It was before you were born.

518
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,710
A terrible earthquake.

519
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:03,091
So bad it split our world
into a before and after.
So bad it split our world
into a before and after.

520
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,222
I lost my father then as well.

521
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,642
How did you know my father is gone?

522
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:18,315
Right, protection.

523
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:21,109
That's right.

524
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:22,653
You learn quickly.

525
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:25,447
And so, learn this.

526
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:28,408
Noa,

527
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,953
it's not good enough to just survive.

528
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,956
People will tell you otherwise,
but ignore them.

529
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:35,958
Think about it.

530
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,627
Cockroaches can just survive.

531
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,296
Should that be good enough for us?

532
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,935
Be better than everyone around you.

533
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:59,439
Not just the Koreans,
but the Japanese as well.

534
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:02,234
Be so good
that they can't deny you what you're owed.
Be so good
that they can't deny you what you're owed.

535
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:03,819
Make no mistake.

536
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,740
They'll hate to see you rise.

537
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:13,579
But even with their hate,
they'll have no choice but to respect you.

538
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:16,999
Do you understand what I am saying?

539
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,877
Yes.

540
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:22,838
One more thing.

541
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:24,965
Never look back.

542
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,593
Forward.

543
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:30,554
Always forward.

544
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,364
Now go to school
and wipe that glum look off your face.

545
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,033
Tomorrow, take the short way.

546
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:53,994
Only fools would choose otherwise.

547
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,539
Noa,

548
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:00,000
don't live like a fool.

549
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,064
I hate that you're going alone.

550
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:26,360
Who's going to watch Mozasu
or have dinner ready?

551
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,529
Don't worry.

552
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:29,738
I'll be fine.

553
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,245
And you,

554
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:39,748
no troublemaking today, understand?

555
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:47,339
Looking at his face,
I think this is the hardest part of all.

556
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,092
But he'll grow up
knowing you do this for him.

557
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,636
That his mother worked so hard
to raise him.

558
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,288
Excuse me.

559
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,414
Excuse me.

560
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,333
Sorry.

561
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:27,379
Excuse me.

562
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:31,925
What do you think you're doing?

563
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:33,427
Move it!

564
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:38,015
Go on. Get outta here! You'll chase away
the customers with that stink.

565
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:39,141
Hurry and get outta here!

566
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,852
I'm sorry. It's my first day.

567
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,526
Don't even try!

568
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,486
Get your stinky cart out of here!

569
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,157
Want my son to piss on it?

570
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,270
Excuse me.

571
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,231
Excuse me.

572
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,109
Excuse me.

573
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:35,197
Young lady, over here!

574
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,076
Over here.

575
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,415
You can sell here.

576
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,919

My mother's special recipe!

611
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,968
This is my country's food!

612
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:04,341
I think I came here when I was about 18.
I think I came here when I was about 18.

613
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,761
I was 13 years old.

614
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:10,389
We came by boat.

615
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:13,183
It wasn't a plane.

616
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:19,064
I'm 22 years old here, so I'm young.

617
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,318
I came to Japan at 20 years old,
after I got married.

618
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,571
I came here alone from Korea.

619
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,781
I was all alone.

620
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:32,452
I cried and cried. I cried a lot.

621
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:39,543
I came here at 11
and started working at 13.

622
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:46,675
I grew up in sadness.

623
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:50,721
So it's hard for me to be kind
to other people.

624
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,348
I do wonder

625
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:57,936
if that's because of how I grew up.

626
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:01,857
I suffered so much after I got here.
I suffered so much after I got here.

627
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:07,696
I don't like thinking about
those things now, but you know…

628
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:13,118
I do think about so many things.

629
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:17,122
I saw people who had died.

630
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:20,209
I was still a little girl.

631
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,586
It was during the war.

632
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:29,676
The military police came and grabbed
the ponytails of those who had long hair,

633
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,889
and dragged them off by their hair.

634
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,933
I saw them do that.

635
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,938
We were lucky
if we had some cabbage to eat.

636
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:47,277
But they ordered us to give it to them
because it all belonged to the emperor.

637
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:51,240
Nothing you owned
actually belonged to you.

638
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:55,202
So we all ate kimchi.

639
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:57,412
We didn't have anything to eat,

640
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:00,082
so we ate a lot of kimchi.
so we ate a lot of kimchi.

641
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:02,626
There was very little food
in our rice bowls,

642
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,461
so we never felt full after we ate.

643
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:09,258
We'd turn our rice bowls upside-down
to check if there was anything left.

644
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,844
That's how we lived.

645
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:14,221
Now life is too luxurious.

646
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:18,600
I couldn't speak any Japanese.

647
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:20,853
So I really struggled.

648
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:24,147
I don't like saying this,

649
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:29,736
but my children couldn't live in Korea.

650
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,490
So I made sure they assimilated
into Japanese society.

651
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:38,078
Have you gotten used to life in Japan?

652
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:41,248
I'm used to it now.

653
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,750
It was hard.

654
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,589
This is my hometown now.

655
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:54,052
I can't go to Korea.
I can't go to my country.

656
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,014
So this is my hometown now.

657
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:01,351
It's all a dream.
It's all a dream.

658
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:03,103
This one's a dream. That one's a dream.

659
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:05,522
They're all dreams now.

660
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,822
I was so young then.

661
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,962
Well…

662
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:32,966
this was the best time of my life.

663
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,010
What makes you think that?

664
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,679
Because everyone was close by.

665
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,580
How old are you?

666
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,750
I'm 98 years old.

667
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,294
I'm 85 years old.

668
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:13,131
I'm 80--

669
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,258
No, 90.

670
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,634
Am I 98?

671
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:16,718
Maybe 99?

672
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:18,345
I'm 93 years old.

673
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:19,555
When were you born?

674
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:22,724
In 1917.

675
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:24,768
I'm 92.

676
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:29,690
I turned 100 years old the other day,
so they had a celebration for me.

677
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,942
That's why I'm like this.

678
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,486
I think I'm 95 years old.

679
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:36,029
Born in the year of the cow.

680
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:42,953
There were no hardships for me
in the life I chose for myself.

681
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:47,916
I made my own way, my own path,
so I have no regrets whatsoever

682
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,587
about the path I chose and walked down.

683
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:55,674
My son works very hard.

684
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:59,761
I have a good daughter-in-law
and good grandchildren.

685
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:04,641
Everyone calls me grandma,
so I'm thankful.
Everyone calls me grandma,
so I'm thankful.

686
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:08,604
Your smile is very bright.

687
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:15,444
Do you think someone will take me
as his bride?

688
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:20,407
My smile, you say. My smile…

689
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:28,081
I'm sure it must have been boring,
but thank you for listening.
