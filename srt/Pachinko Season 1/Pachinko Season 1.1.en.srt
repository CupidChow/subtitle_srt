1
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:55,597
Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow

2
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,544
(in Korean)
My mother was not fortunate.

3
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,131
And my birth

4
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,049
was a great burden to her.

5
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,555
She died when I was but a child.

6
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,309
In his grief, my father took to drink.

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,980
My three older sisters and I were forced
into the villages to beg.

8
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,651
Then the village matchmaker…

9
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,866
said a family with a boardinghouse
near Dongsam

10
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,328
had a son with a cleft lip
who was not married.

11
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,081
My father readily offered me.

12
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,586
That was three years ago,

13
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,840
and I've tried so hard to be
a good wife and daughter-in-law.

14
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,223
I've given birth to three sons,

15
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,603
but none saw his first birthday.

16
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,899
If it were just me,

17
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,111
I would bear it. But my husband…

18
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,241
he is the kindest of men.

19
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,997
I am with child, but…

20
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,544
there is a curse in my blood.

21
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,140
Listen, there's no easy way to say this.

22
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,143
You're not getting the bump.

23
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,352
Not this year.

24
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,730
I know we gave you
all the signs otherwise,

25
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,232
but the 43rd floor believes

26
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,777
it's better for you if you have
one more year under your belt.

27
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,410
I want to know why.

28
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,746
He told you why.
They don't think you're ready.

29
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,540
Keep busting ahead,
doing what you're doing, and next year--

30
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,209
I helped close the Teestone merger.

31
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,710
Handled Brixley's buyout.

32
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,629
Number one on my year's leaderboard
for two years running.

33
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,839
It's not your year, okay?

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,681
Please call on my ancestors
to lift this curse

35
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,517
so we can have a family.

36
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
Colton Hotels.

37
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,098
Priority client for this firm,
itching to go public,

38
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,183
but their valuation needs
an adrenaline shot.

39
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,893
They need that hotel.

40
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,186
That's in Tokyo.

41
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,439
Where one landowner, one,
holds the entire deal hostage.

42
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,824
She's Korean, the landowner.

43
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,704
Doesn't mean anything to you, I know.
But I'm telling you,

44
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,581
I can close that deal.

45
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,586
So, what do you know?

46
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,131
A 300-plus room hotel
at a 150 to 200 million build cost.

47
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:46,221
Back of the napkin calculations say
ten, 15 million payday for us.

48
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,598
And this landowner,

49
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,641
her being Korean,
you think that'll give you an in?

50
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,060
Wait, wait, I'm confused here.
I thought you were Japanese.

51
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,188
No, I just grew up there.

52
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,108
-You sure about this?
-Yes, I'm sure.

53
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,613
And once I close this deal,
I want to be transferred back right away.
And once I close this deal,
I want to be transferred back right away.

54
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,660
I want that VP title
and the raise backdated to today's date.

55
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,248
And I want my year-end bonus to reflect

56
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,543
just how much
Colton Hotels means to this firm.

57
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,216
And I would like all this in writing.

58
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,223
A child is coming.

59
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,977
She will thrive.

60
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:39,233
And through her, a family will endure.

61
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,458
Hurry!

62
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,876
Come now!

63
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,675
Listen to that cry.

64
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,218
She's sure to be a handful.

65
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,720
Thank you.

66
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,764
Take good care of her.

67
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,561
This one will fight.

68
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,022
We must name her.

69
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,754
Sunja!

70
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,264
Sunja!

71
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,589
Father!

72
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,477
(in Japanese)
Good. You put on weight.

73
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,938
Too much pizza.

74
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,731
I need to watch myself.

75
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,983
How's Tokyo?

76
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,401
The new place, is it nice?

77
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,571
It's a hotel room.
It's fine for a few weeks.

78
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,948
Is he here? Is that Solomon?

79
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,616
Goto-san, I should've known
you'd be here.

80
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,536
Your dad owns this place now,

81
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,038
but I still have to make sure
he's managing the place.

82
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,248
Keep telling yourself that,

83
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,294
but the real reason you come here
is to flirt with the young girls.

84
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,087
I see right through you.

85
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,090
Hirota-san!

86
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,802
This is my son, Solomon.

87
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,888
You finally came home.
You finally came home.

88
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,391
He's been promoted to vice president
by his American bank.

89
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,019
Not bad for the son
of a pachinko man.

90
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,606
Is it true you went to Yale?

91
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,400
If my father says so,
it must be true.

92
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:18,113
Yoshii-san, how do you respond
to the criminal allegations?

93
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:22,534
I understand there are those
in the financial world who do not trust us

94
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,621
because of what my grandfather
was involved in…

95
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,707
Who's his grandfather?

96
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,294
A man who is dead and gone.

97
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,671
Nothing to do with us.

98
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,301
Jackpot!

99
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,679
Look at that!

100
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,265
Clean money, dirty money…
makes no difference.

101
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,850
Money's money.

102
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,155
Sunja.

103
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,741
Sunja, head down.

104
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,014
Hey, you're late today.

105
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,057
I saved this one for you.

106
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,188
This one.

107
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,231
Sunja!

108
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,365
It doesn't look very happy.

109
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,450
That's because

110
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,621
even the most wretched
of creatures yearn to live.

111
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,790
Not the lady who sells chestnuts.

112
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,585
She's always saying
Death thinks he is too good for her.

113
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,088
That's because her husband
is all smiles to the world,

114
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:45,177
but then comes home
and beats his wife and children.

115
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,012
But even she wills to live.

116
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,306
Let's go.

117
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,767
Hey there, brother!

118
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,020
Isn't this one fine?

119
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,315
I dare you to show me
a better catch today.

120
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,984
What should I do with something that big?
What should I do with something that big?

121
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,404
Mr. Kim, you make
the best fish cakes in this market.

122
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,198
You always sell out before noon.

123
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,992
But with this,

124
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,704
you'll have enough
fish cakes for weeks.

125
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,874
In that case, I'll give you 30 for it.

126
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,292
Forget it.

127
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,628
You should be getting three times as much.

128
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,712
Is that so?

129
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,965
And what does this little brat know?

130
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,718
I know the daegu jorim place

131
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:30,055
down the alley gave him
twice as much for a cod half this size.

132
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,391
Let's just go there.

133
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,977
Why go all the way over there?

134
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,397
Eighty.

135
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,065
It's my best offer.

136
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,526
And a fair one.

137
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,027
That'll do.

138
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,741
Thank you for this.

139
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,828
Here! Take your cut.

140
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,457
I can't. I'm not allowed.

141
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,542
Why not?

142
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,002
You earned it.
You earned it.

143
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,629
Didn't your parents teach you
to always obey your elders?

144
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,136
Need to keep an eye on this one.

145
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,639
She won't be satisfied
with just running a boardinghouse!

146
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,641
I did no such thing!

147
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,019
We have two signed accounts
that say otherwise.

148
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,396
They're lying.
I'm not involved in any of that--

149
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,857
We'll talk at the station. Follow us.

150
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,941
I beg you--

151
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,194
Beg at the station.

152
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,408
So they say they're easing up on us.

153
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,160
Is this what they mean?

154
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,288
Sunja,

155
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,165
let's go.

156
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,920
See you back at the house.

157
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,551
Father,

158
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,804
that man in the market,

159
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,140
did he do something bad?

160
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,309
I don't know.

161
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,144
In times like this,

162
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:04,358
guilt or innocence
is no longer a simple question.

163
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,154
What will happen to him?

164
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,031
Will he come home?

165
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,576
Sunja,

166
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,871
I made a promise to you once.

167
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,791
When you were just a week old,

168
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,212
your mom and I, we barely slept.

169
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,217
We stayed up night and day
to watch over you.

170
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,929
That's when I swore to you,

171
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,559
as long as you kept breathing,

172
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:45,023
I would do anything to keep the
ugliness of the world from touching you.

173
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm going to keep that promise.

174
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,745
Grandma!

175
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,476
Listen to that racket.

176
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:51,066
No matter how much you practiced,
it never did any good.

177
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,735
Then why didn't you let me quit?

178
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,446
You know how much that piano cost?

179
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,614
Of course!

180
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,533
You reminded me of it every day.

181
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,451
You needed the reminding.
You needed the reminding.

182
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:06,665
Now stop being one of those lazy Americans
and come help me.

183
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,958
Yes.

184
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,290
That man barely gets by with his catch,
and you go taking money from him.

185
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,083
Let it go.

186
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,921
And you!

187
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,089
You do her no good indulging her.

188
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,718
Talking about sending her to school.

189
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,345
What's the point of that?
What's the point of that?

190
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,097
Hard times, easy times.

191
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,475
Doesn't matter for a woman.

192
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,520
She must learn to feed herself.

193
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,900
The cove is calm today.

194
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,653
I can do my lessons with
the women.

195
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,863
Can I go?

196
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,032
Have you been listening to me?

197
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,244
Next time, I'll tell Mr. Song

198
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,913
that because I'm a girl,
I must disobey him.

199
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,957
Never mind that--

200
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,585
And that he's not a good enough fisherman
to be giving me money.

201
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,047
Fine, off with you.

202
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,594
And you.

203
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,973
It's good that you love her,
but doting on her like that,

204
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,852
it will only ruin her.

205
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,021
Will a bite of candy
really ruin our daughter?

206
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,731
But it wasn't your money!

207
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,900
It was another man's kindness.

208
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:02,406
She needs to know there is
a thing as kindness in this world.
She needs to know there is
a thing as kindness in this world.

209
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,869
She will grow stronger for it.

210
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,273
Sunja!

211
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,526
Watch me!

212
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,412
Sunja!

213
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:17,708
Sunja!

214
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,587
Papa!

215
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,841
I did it!

216
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:32,514
Float atop

217
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:37,519
The boundless expanse

218
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:43,567
Befriend the lone seagull

219
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,987
We shall fight ahead!

220
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:52,743
-Enoya yanoya!
-Uhcha!

221
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,289
Eyano yano uhgi-ee uhcha!

222
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,834
Let us go to sea
Let us go to sea

223
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,631
How lucky you are!

224
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,883
Your daughter catches abalone,

225
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,801
and your wife cooks like this.

226
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,971
Luck has nothing to do with it.

227
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:18,143
-He's earned it all.
-That's right!

228
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,313
Here, have a drink.

229
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,191
Not for me. I'm no drinker.

230
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,568
Come on, just one drink.

231
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:37,746
Let's enjoy our small victories
while we can.

232
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,999
Cheers.

233
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,586
But just wait.

234
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,672
In time,

235
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,717
they'll find a way
to take this from us too.

236
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,220
Nonsense!
How can anyone take the sea from us?

237
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,891
Don't talk like a moron.

238
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,019
Huh? What are you saying?
Huh? What are you saying?

239
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,022
They grabbed our land,

240
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:05,858
right?

241
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,568
Snatched our rice,

242
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,986
our potatoes,

243
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,320
our fish.

244
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,656
Ordered our woman to stop wearing white.

245
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:18,829
Those fuckers make us eat like them,

246
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,539
talk like them,

247
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,293
but they'll never see us as one of them.

248
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:28,422
And why should they?

249
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,091
It's our own damn fault
we lost this country.

250
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,302
That's enough.

251
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:40,309
But look, if each one of us killed
just one of those Japanese,

252
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,146
it wouldn't quench our anger,

253
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,982
but we'd at least have
something to dream about.

254
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,778
To take a rock in this hand

255
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:55,741
and crush a soldier's head with it…

256
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:01,788
to warm my cold hands with his blood.
to warm my cold hands with his blood.

257
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:08,086
Just knowing there's one less
cockroach roaming our land,

258
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:12,883
that would give me pure joy!

259
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,553
Stop this talk now.

260
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,934
It's too much…

261
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,523
living with this hate.

262
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,737
Just like us…

263
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,576
our children will be cursed.

264
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,997
How will this ever end?

265
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,304
Why didn't you stop him?

266
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,350
How could I have stopped him?

267
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,601
If anyone talks…

268
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,311
They won't.

269
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,605
They've slept under our roof
for months now.

270
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,274
It only takes one to--

271
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,525
Hush now.

272
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,237
Calm yourself.

273
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,740
We've done nothing wrong.
Why would they arrest us?

274
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,662
After talk like that, we continue to feed
and house him. Isn't that wrong?

275
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,082
If the Japanese come for us,

276
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,792
who takes care of Sunja?

277
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,796
It will all work out, you'll see.

278
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,174
You don't know that--

279
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,846
Mister, is your belly full?

280
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:42,598
Ma'am,

281
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:47,644
you feed us so well.
You are too good to us.

282
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,681
Sunja, what is it?

283
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,267
Last night you said stupid things,

284
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,228
and everyone's scared now.

285
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:33,607
Scared? Who's scared?

286
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:40,405
All of them. No one says it,
but they want you to go.

287
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:45,494
But where would I go? I have nowhere.

288
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,622
Anywhere. Just go.

289
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,253
Sunja,

290
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,171
I just drank too much.

291
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,925
Those were the reckless words
of a man tired of feeling so small.

292
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,552
You understand, right?

293
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,929
No.

294
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,641
I don't want to crush
the head of a Japanese man.

295
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,562
And I don't want to lose
my mother and father.

296
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,188
To be alone…

297
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,482
I'd rather die.

298
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,615
Sunja, listen well.

299
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:28,287
Forget the things I said.

300
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,166
I'm a man who no longer knows
how to live in this world.

301
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,587
Understand?

302
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,716
Good.

303
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,090
When did you last see
Fisherman Song?

304
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,885
It's been a few days.

305
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,473
Where do you think he might have gone?

306
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:33,435
I am sorry. I don't know
his business.

307
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,112
Papa!

308
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,198
Papa!

309
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,576
Papa!

310
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,497
Papa!

311
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,668
Papa!

312
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,420
Papa!
Papa!

313
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,979
We never saw signs
of disloyalty in him before.

314
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,274
But he left all his things behind.

315
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,944
And he still owes us
two months' rent.

316
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,704
And the night in question?

317
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,624
He had too much to drink.

318
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,294
You believe that excuses him?

319
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,553
No, not at all.

320
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:54,183
We were all
terribly shocked by his words.

321
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,603
But you didn't report him.

322
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,860
If you see such a traitorous man,

323
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,237
it's your duty to report him.

324
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,576
-Sir--
-How dare you interrupt?

325
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:25,172
We give our progress, our innovations,
our education to these idiots,

326
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,717
only to be lied to our faces.

327
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,135
Calm down.

328
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,597
Let's just end this with a warning.

329
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,600
Maybe we've gotten
too soft on them.

330
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,851
We had no choice.

331
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,937
Push them too hard,
and they'll explode.

332
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,401
You don't get a second chance.

333
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:51,657
Tell us if you hear about his whereabouts.

334
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,960
Miss, I've heard much praise
of your cooking.

335
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:08,422
I must visit to see
if what they say is true.

336
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,719
Anytime, you are welcome.

337
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,222
Let's go.

338
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,583
How did he know to run away?

339
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,918
Did someone warn him?

340
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:48,839
I said nothing.

341
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:08,150
There's no way we can eat all of this.
You're making too much.

342
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,027
You have to eat.

343
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,570
Look at yourself in the mirror!

344
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,073
All skin and bones.

345
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,617
Put the green onions in.

346
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:22,873
Run it under cold water.

347
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:27,419
Clearly you're too busy to cook,
just like your dad.

348
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,421
You both work too much.

349
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,798
I told him to sell the pachinko parlor.

350
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:35,928
Real estate is booming, so he should
invest in stores or apartments.

351
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,597
-So he hasn't told you?
-What?

352
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,849
He's opening a second parlor.

353
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,061
Get that look off your face.

354
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,396
You know he's been thinking about it.

355
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,733
Where's he getting the money?

356
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,527
The bank.

357
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,820
That's what everyone does now.

358
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:59,201
He's proud of what he's built.

359
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,246
And he doesn't need to hear your shame.
And he doesn't need to hear your shame.

360
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,540
Who said anything about shame?

361
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,625
You don't need to say it.

362
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:12,381
I've gone through enough in my life
to know how it smells.

363
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,885
Bring me an egg.

364
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,021
Be honest.

365
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,400
You're going back? You're not staying?

366
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,236
What is this?

367
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:39,533
Your father may fool himself into thinking
things have changed here for us Koreans,

368
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,159
but I know better.

369
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,663
You're safer in America.

370
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,457
Safe from what exactly?

371
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:50,711
Solomon?

372
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,504
-Solomon!
-Etsuko-san!

373
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,384
I'm sorry but the restaurant was so busy.
I couldn't leave earlier.

374
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,428
We've been understaffed all week.

375
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:03,473
And your dad said he was too busy
to come pick me up.

376
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,687
But look at you.
You've gotten so handsome.

377
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,107
Oh, how unfair life is.

378
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,276
You're not supposed to get better-looking,
Solomon,

379
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,320
while I just get more wrinkles.

380
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,197
What are you saying, Etsuko-san?

381
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,740
You've hardly aged.

382
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,700
See? This is it.

383
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,203
Why, those American girls must love you.

384
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,621
I know.

385
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,623
Hey! Pajeon!

386
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,671
Are you crazy? Throwing out good food!

387
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:35,839
Put it down here.

388
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,067
"I am Rikidozan!"

389
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:06,555
Those were Hana's favorites,
weren't they?

390
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,391
Yeah.

391
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,148
Why do you still have them?

392
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,401
Sentimental reasons, I suppose.

393
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,744
Has Hana contacted you?

394
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:32,039
Nope.

395
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,462
But we hired a new detective
who we've heard good things about.

396
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,048
It seems hopeful.

397
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,187
Her hand…

398
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,399
is it now bigger than mine?

399
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:02,444
Or are they the same size?

400
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:08,617
How can you be so certain
that she's still alive?

401
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,248
When you have children, you'll understand.

402
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,878
If something happens to her…

403
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,550
I would feel something.

404
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:31,557
You would too,
because you loved her, didn't you?

405
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:40,774
Your father can't stop smiling
since you've come back.

406
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,236
And I thought I was the only one
who could make him smile like that!

407
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,490
And your mother…

408
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,909
she would be proud.

409
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:53,912
I know it.

410
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:27,196
Father, something's happening.

411
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:29,865
Sunja!

412
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,186
Hurry up. Walk!

413
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,530
Get over here.

414
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:31,426
-Enoya yanoya!
-What are you doing?

415
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:37,099
Eyano yano uhgi-ee uhcha!

416
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:40,060
Let us go to sea

417
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,144
Quiet!

418
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:48,235
Float atop

419
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,030
-The boundless expanse
-Enough!

420
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:55,242
You bastard!

421
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:00,330
Befriend the lone seagull
Befriend the lone seagull

422
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,416
We shall fight ahead

423
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:08,046
Befriend the lone seagull
We shall fight ahead

424
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:14,678
Enoya yanoya!

425
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:19,600
Eyano yano uhgi-ee uhcha!

426
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:23,896
Let us go to sea

427
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:45,811
Good morning.

428
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:55,153
Thank you for coming, Yoshii-san.

429
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,369
I saw him on television.

430
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,080
Yes, he is a distinguished client
of the office.

431
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,795
Welcome, Baek-san.
I'll escort you to your office.

432
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:16,592
…first, which we can handle locally.

433
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,093
Therefore, during the summer--

434
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,681
Please, come this way.

435
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,923
-Solomon Baek.
-Mr. Andrews.

436
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,009
-Tom.
-I've heard a lot about you.

437
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:00,969
Be straight with me.
Be straight with me.

438
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:04,640
I gotta watch my back with you?
Is that what this is?

439
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:07,768
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm not here to stay.

440
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:11,688
All right. Welcome.

441
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,443
Excuse me!
Can I please have your attention?

442
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,202
What's going on?

443
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,709
Japan's Emperor, Hirohito, has died.

444
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,712
According to the official announcement,
the Emperor died of cancer.

445
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,089
He was 87 years old…

446
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:51,103
Today, a nation mourns a great man…

447
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,355
He ruled during
the Japanese occupation of Korea.

448
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,023
Once considered a god…

449
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:58,735
He ruled during
the Japanese occupation of Korea,

450
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:03,156
during which many families
were separated and loved ones lost.
during which many families
were separated and loved ones lost.

451
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,643
Sunja.

452
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,257
Papa.

453
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,013
Papa.

454
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:14,394
Papa.

455
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,618
Long ago,

456
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:34,206
I wondered why fortune
seemed to pass me by,

457
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:42,381
why the everyday joys that others enjoyed
seemed impossible to me.

458
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,970
But then, your mother came,

459
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:50,597
and then you…

460
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:57,688
And I realized
fortune had nothing to do with it.

461
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:04,862
I had to prove myself
worthy of you, Sunja.
I had to prove myself
worthy of you, Sunja.

462
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,449
And grow strong

463
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:14,955
to chase away the shadows of this world.

464
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,127
Soon you will be strong yourself.

465
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:25,132
You will have your own children.

466
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:31,805
And you, too, will have
to prove yourself worthy.

467
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,310
You can do it, Sunja.

468
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,898
I believe in you.

469
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,745
Sir,

470
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,997
it is customary
for the new district fish broker

471
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:40,791
to pay his respects.

472
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,253
Yes, he is a fool,

473
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,421
but he is still one of them.

474
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,344
Of course I'll pay my respects.

475
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:53,887
Every week in an envelope.

476
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,978
But if he prefers something else--
But if he prefers something else--

477
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,856
No, he wouldn't prefer that.

478
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:07,484
Since you are new to our ways here
and not used to our customs--

479
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,611
You don't need to tell me how it goes.

480
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,616
Sunja…

481
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,326
That girl, who is she?

482
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,912
Which girl?

483
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:03,916
That one.

484
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:09,463
Sunja, Sunja.
Look. I saved the biggest for you!

485
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,717
She's no one.

486
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:22,267
I believe her mother runs
a boardinghouse in Yeongdo.

487
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,394
A widow.
