[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,940
[Episode 2: After the Soul Swap,
I Became My Grandson]

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,900
So you really are Grandpa?

4
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,280
What else would I be?

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,010
I wouldn't just play
games with you for no reason.

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
What now?

7
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,900
Zefang might already
be home waiting for me.

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,630
Get down.

9
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I don't trust your riding skills.

10
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,440
Don't trust me?

11
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,460
Please.

12
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,300
Kids around here

13
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,170
love joyriding with me.

14
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,470
Hold on tight.

15
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,490
What are you doing?

16
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,920
Trying to channel Zefang,

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,350
see if we can switch back.

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,450
Right.

19
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,940
Do you have a photo?

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Why would I?

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,220
We'd have to request one from the police.

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,440
Don't you think

23
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,020
we should put my body back where it was

24
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,980
and try again?

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,450
Stealing a body

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,310
is illegal.

27
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,440
Besides, if it's like on TV,

28
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,050
we'd have to recreate the exact scene,

29
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,150
with the right time, place, and people.

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,150
So,

31
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,579
we'll have to re-enact the fall.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,340
Let's go up there.

33
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,860
I might not be able to do it alone.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
You'll probably have to help me.

35
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,040
Is your wound okay?

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm fine.

37
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,540
Look, it's just a bit swollen.

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,870
What if we can't switch back?

39
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,690
Then you'll just have to live your life.

40
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,690
No way.

41
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,030
What about Zefang?

42
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,760
Maybe it's fate.

43
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,040
Fate? You're a kid,

44
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,900
talking like an old soul.

45
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,870
Trying to act all grown-up?

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,590
Have you ever felt like

47
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
someone suddenly

48
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,900
felt oddly familiar?

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,300
So…

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,460
Where do you think Zefang's soul went?

51
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,930
Hey kid,

52
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,710
zoning out?

53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,200
You really are Xia Cha?

54
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,480
Watch your manners.

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,710
Call me Grandpa.

56
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,210
Even I can't believe it happened.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,390
What do you young people call it?

58
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,200
Soul swap. Rebirth.

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah,

60
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,810
that's it.

61
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,940
Guess TV wasn't all fake after all.

62
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,150
So you've known Zefang for a while?

63
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,080
Classmates.

64
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,660
But

65
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,160
not close.

66
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,410
Then get closer.

67
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,150
Then you'd know

68
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,390
my Zefang is a good kid.

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,700
Why are all these clothes like this?

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,120
Is this what young people wear nowadays?

71
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,180
He'd get laughed at wearing that outside.

72
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,640
And you say he's a good kid?

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,170
Why don't you change your clothes?

74
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,680
This outfit seems unlucky.

75
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,250
Yeah.

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,270
Who picked this?

77
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,670
It's ugly.

78
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,210
No one wears this now.

79
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,210
Must've been Wang.

80
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,860
He's got no fashion sense.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Why is Zefang so skinny?

82
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,500
Look at that tiny waist.

83
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,550
Clearly not eating well.

84
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,780
You young people

85
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,180
are obsessed with being all toned.

86
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,960
Sure, it looks good.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,700
But it'll all turn
into a blob later anyway.

88
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,470
Why stress over abs now?

89
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,420
You could just eat more and bulk up.

90
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
It's already so late.

91
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,720
Back in the day,

92
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,220
I'd be up exercising by now.

93
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,300
Forget it.

94
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,320
Let's sleep.

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,760
Maybe Zefang will switch back by morning.

96
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,550
You really want to switch back?

97
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,180
Don't you feel attached?

98
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,470
It's my grandson's body.

99
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,650
I've lived long enough.

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
If someone has to go, it should be me.

101
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,390
Stay here and sleep with me.

102
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,500
I just think

103
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,650
if Zefang wakes up in this body

104
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,970
and gets confused,

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,470
you can help explain.

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,320
You young people communicate
better with each other, right?

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,159
Whatever I say to him

108
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,950
ends in an argument.

109
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,710
Sorry,

110
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm used to sleeping alone.

111
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,570
I treated you like a blanket.

112
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,070
Sounded like something just fell.

113
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,620
Let me check.

114
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,750
Wang?

115
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,890
Wang, wake up!

116
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,120
Don't tell me you're dying with me.

117
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
We weren't that close, Wang!

118
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,410
Calm down.

119
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,150
He probably just fainted.

120
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,300
Why would he faint in my room?

121
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,680
Seeing the dead grandson sleeping

122
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
in his dead grandfather’s bed,

123
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
cuddling the downstairs neighbor,

124
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,130
who wouldn't pass out?

125
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
You're saying you're not Xia Zefang?

126
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,260
You're Old Xia?

127
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,260
That's right.

128
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
When I woke up yesterday,
my body was lying there,

129
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,520
but my soul was in my grandson's body.

130
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,170
So now I'm sitting
here looking like Zefang.

131
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
He needs to go to the hospital.

132
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,790
Maybe there's brain damage.

133
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,070
His heart stopped yesterday.

134
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,140
Could be brain trauma.

135
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,200
Nonsense.

136
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,070
He's talking perfectly fine.

137
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,570
It's grief.

138
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,440
He's pretending to be Grandpa.

139
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,980
Zefang,

140
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,720
Grandpa's spirit
in heaven must be touched.

141
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,090
It's fine. I'm really okay.

142
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,140
We can't even eat
or drink without thinking of you.

143
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,720
Old Xia,

144
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
we miss you.

145
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,870
What are you doing with that?

146
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm taking it home.

147
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,370
Excuse me, that's an antique!

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,740
And that tea's worth thousands per ounce!

149
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,020
You can't just take it!

150
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,040
You've got good taste, huh?

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,940
Are you serious?

152
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Snatching from a kid?

153
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe he just wanted it as a keepsake.

154
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,680
Zefang.

155
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,860
This is a little gift

156
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,320
from the neighbors for Grandpa.

157
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,010
Take it.

158
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,390
Grandpa

159
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,610
treats us like family,

160
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,040
so we treat you like our own child.

161
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,220
If anything happens,
come back and tell us.

162
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,300
Meeting all of you in this life,

163
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,860
I, Xia Cha, am truly grateful.

164
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,310
Have you noticed?

165
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,860
Since Zefang woke up,

166
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,860
he talks just like Grandpa Xia.

167
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,570
Coming back from the dead
is a matter of medical probability.

168
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,070
But soul-swapping? That's metaphysical.

169
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,240
If what you're saying is true,

170
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,910
if Cha isn't Cha but Zefang,

171
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,740
then I need to file a report.

172
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,680
Don't make the call!

173
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,580
File what report?

174
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,540
Stop calling!

175
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,270
Quick!

176
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,850
Xia Zefang, due to a near-death state,

177
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,790
head trauma,

178
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,430
and guilt over Grandpa's passing,

179
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,030
is experiencing confusion.

180
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,800
So I suggest

181
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,100
we give him peace.

182
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,360
Time heals all. He'll be okay.

183
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Should I update the report

184
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,600
from two deceased to one?

185
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,540
What's it like

186
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,650
living in a body that's not yours?

187
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,670
Come, have some tea.

188
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,960
I used to think time passed slowly.

189
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,430
Always thinking about being
independent, getting married, having kids.

190
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,600
But now time flies.

191
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,450
Everyone around me is leaving.

192
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,960
The moment I fell down the stairs,

193
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,650
I thought,

194
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,170
"Is this how I die?

195
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,280
How many things are still undone?"

196
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,520
If I thought that,

197
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,980
Zefang must be even more scared,

198
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,410
even more full of regret…

199
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,170
Why aren't you saying anything?

200
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,610
Feeling guilty?

201
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,760
After all, the last person
Zefang thought of wasn't anyone else,

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,750
it was you.

203
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,860
Still smiling? You heartless thing.

204
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm serious.

205
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,550
If you had known this would be the ending,

206
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,100
would you have said yes to Zefang?

207
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,740
No.

208
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,250
Why not?

209
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,090
Why would I?

210
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,600
Can't you just pretend?

211
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,490
I don't want to.

212
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,260
You really are a stubborn kid.

213
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,040
I keep thinking

214
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,590
there are two possible times

215
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,850
when Zefang could come back to this body.

216
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,830
One is on the seventh day after his death.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,540
The other is before my body is cremated.

218
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,220
I don't think you need to wait anymore.

219
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,620
Why would you say that?

220
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,910
You think Zefang's not coming back?

221
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm telling you, he will come back.

222
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,160
Maybe this is fate.

223
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,650
Maybe the ones left behind

224
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,410
have a special mission.

225
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,580
Did you notice

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,720
when we woke up that day,

227
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,430
it feel like
we were struck by lightning?

228
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,380
You mean that spark

229
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,829
when we touched lips?

230
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,290
So I didn't imagine that zap?

231
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,589
That wasn't a kiss.

232
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,329
Was that

233
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,369
your first kiss?

234
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,360
Alright, handsome,
let's put on your cape first.

235
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,160
I always wanted
to straighten my natural curls.

236
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,360
But with such thin hair,

237
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,890
it just clings to the scalp.

238
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,750
Handsome, you've got a full head of hair.

239
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,210
So lush at this age.

240
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,800
Being young is great.

241
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Now let me pick a color,

242
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,090
something cool.

243
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,390
You can speak Cantonese?

244
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,550
Of course!

245
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,740
I lived in Hong Kong for over 50 years.

246
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,390
So what color are we going with today?

247
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,520
Though honestly,
your hair is a bit damaged.

248
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,920
I'd suggest we treat it first,

249
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,470
then straighten it

250
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,370
once the quality improves.

251
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,660
After that,

252
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,330
we can go for a new color.

253
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,590
But I want to get
the hairstyle I like right now.

254
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,510
Just a trim like this is fine.

255
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,130
Alright, give me a moment.

256
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,230
It's rare for me
to even have hair to style.

257
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,390
We don't have time.

258
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,820
My mom's waiting for you.

259
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,510
Can you tell Huimei for me?

260
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,990
Tell her not to force me to go to school.

261
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,360
Don't use that face
to call my mom "Huimei."

262
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,420
Call her "Auntie."

263
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,860
So petty.

264
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,070
Back then Huimei
never nagged me this much.

265
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,930
Tell her yourself.

266
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,070
See if she buys it.

267
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,790
College? I never even dreamed of it.

268
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,360
I wouldn't understand a single class.

269
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,530
I'm scared.

270
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,610
What will you do if you don't study?

271
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,340
Zefang.

272
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,310
You've got to live your life well.

273
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
The dead can't come back.

274
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,580
Ye Haiyuan.

275
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,790
I asked you to look after him.

276
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,400
Are you tired of it?

277
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,740
And now you're
encouraging him to quit school?

278
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,110
I don't have to quit.

279
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,650
A break is fine too.

280
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,040
Tell me,

281
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,760
why don't you want to go back to school?

282
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,990
I…

283
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,730
I hit my head
and got dumber, can't keep up.

284
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,800
Teachers will scold me,
classmates will laugh.

285
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,240
It's okay.

286
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,990
He's here for you.

287
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,240
He'll help.

288
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,360
Zefang,

289
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
tomorrow is Grandpa's seventh day.

290
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,320
Are you sure

291
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,740
you want to cremate
and scatter his ashes at sea?

292
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Let's not just follow trends, okay?

293
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,050
Burial brings peace.

294
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,280
We just...

295
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,050
Huimei,

296
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,760
this old shell isn't that important.

297
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,620
Burn it. Let go.

298
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,240
No one's going to visit the grave anyway.

299
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
No one will visit?

300
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,150
You will, brat.

301
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,850
Grandpa loved you so much.

302
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,830
You're really making me angry.

303
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,360
Grandpa didn't dare find you.

304
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,810
Just waited and waited.

305
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,610
Then you finally called, he was so happy.

306
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,210
But you always
hung up after a few seconds.

307
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,780
Ma.

308
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,090
That was Grandpa Xia Cha's wish.

309
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,100
He said there's no need for ceremony.

310
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,220
Just sincerity.

311
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,080
Yeah,

312
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,090
Grandpa said he wanted freedom.

313
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,310
No more burdens, no more bindings.

314
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,740
Alright.

315
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,350
Where does the soul go after death?

316
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,130
Zefang,

317
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,510
Grandpa's guarding this body for you.

318
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,020
You'd better hurry back.

319
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,160
People often have strange déjà vu.

320
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,040
Like you've seen someone's back before,

321
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,140
watched and waited
for them to turn around.

322
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,120
[You catch a fleeting feeling, like you've
done something somewhere before.]

323
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,290
You like cicadas, don't you?

324
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,890
Yeah.

325
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,290
Then I'll catch you the biggest one.

326
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,340
[Next Episode Preview]

327
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,650
Ye Haiyuan!

328
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,390
Can't you just walk properly for once?

329
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,050
Who told you to leave me alone?

330
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,510
Why do you keep clinging to me?

331
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,450
I've got my own life!

332
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,610
Is he really

333
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,840
that annoying?

334
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,960
Is that why you dislike him so much?

335
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,080
You used to avoid him like the plague.

336
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,500
Now you two
are hanging out like best bros.

337
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,950
Same face.

338
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,300
Why does he not annoy me anymore?

339
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,820
Who starts out like that with someone?

340
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,370
Isn't this the kind
of thing you like about me?

341
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,790
Let's see if your body...

342
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,010
-Remembers me.
-Help!

343
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,110
Ye Haiyuan!
