[Not Others' Business, Just Ours]

3
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,500
Let go of me!

4
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,980
Ye Haiyuan!

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,440
Help!

6
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,260
What are you doing?

7
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Are you okay?

8
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm glad you're finally here.

9
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm here.

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,660
Xia Zefang, come here.

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,340
Show some respect!

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,450
He doesn't want

13
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,220
or need it.

14
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,830
My stuff...

15
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,310
Xia Zefang!

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,960
Fortunately, I left you here.

17
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,490
Did you tell him to take refuge here?

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,320
Is he going to stay here forever?

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,330
He got injured
after he went back this time.

20
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,200
Just a few days.

21
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,130
A few days?

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,250
Aren't you afraid that Guan Riqing
will come here to take him away?

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,310
You're already on bad terms with him.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,250
Forget it.

25
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,640
Anyway, when Xia Zefang yells,

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,500
the whole building will hear him.

27
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,170
As long as he won't disturb me.

28
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,350
I don't think Mr. Chen welcomes me here.

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,430
Then go back to Room 102.

30
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,770
No way!

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,970
You have no idea.

32
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,410
As soon as I entered,

33
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,610
he just groped and kissed me randomly.

34
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,810
He scared me to death!

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,270
Even my wife never did this to me before.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Luckily, I resisted desperately.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Wang bought this for me
when he went abroad. It's expensive.

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,940
Look what he did to it.

39
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,210
That man...

40
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,170
Guan Riqing.

41
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,380
Is that Guan Riqing

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
really Zefang's boyfriend?

43
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,920
Does he usually treat Zefang like this?

44
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,520
Why didn't you run away?

45
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,040
I did.

46
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,540
He's stronger than me.

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
You young people

48
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,390
are just handsy without a care.

49
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,220
If Zefang has a boyfriend,

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
why would he like you?

51
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,770
Go back with me.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,410
How dare you go back in this situation?

53
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,460
I want to get my stuff back.

54
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,090
I can't possibly
live off everything from you.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Guan Riqing is still there.
Aren't you afraid?

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,450
I'm not afraid with you around.

57
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,460
What's up?

58
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,270
For you.

59
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,360
What is this?

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,460
Your favorite.

61
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,360
Did you queue up to buy it?

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,020
I just passed by and bought it.

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Slow down.

64
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,840
No one will take it from you.

65
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,430
Milk.

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,570
Perfect.

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,590
By the way,

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,980
how's the autograph of the swimming team
I asked you for last time?

69
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,580
Not bad.

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,350
Take your swimming trunks
for an auction next time.

71
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,840
I think the price would be high.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,750
No way.

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,980
That's for you to keep carefully.

74
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,440
Who wants your swimming trunks?

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm not one of your fangirls.

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Thanks for the stuff.

77
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,100
Did Ye Haiyuan
take Xia Zefang to Room 103?

78
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,510
You learned the news so fast.

79
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,750
So you're here for a favor.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,660
I wonder if Xia Zefang

81
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,760
would like to make a guest appearance
on the swimming team.

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,180
Why haven't you given up
after being rejected so many times?

83
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,230
That's because
he offered too much last time.

84
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm selling things and earning money now.

85
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,850
But I think he has changed a little

86
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,450
since he came back this time.

87
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,430
Maybe there's a chance.

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,620
Then ask him for me.

89
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,430
Please.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,210
Ask him yourself.

91
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,980
Come on.

92
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,700
You know him well.

93
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,410
Please do it for me.

94
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,960
Can't you throw away

95
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,190
this burlap bag?

96
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,350
Come on.

97
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,780
It can hold so much stuff.

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
Are you going to keep the one
kicked by Guan Riqing?

99
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,170
Zefang.

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,960
Zefang's classmate?

101
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,020
Come.

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,010
Come on.

103
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,480
Make yourself at home.

104
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,810
It's so weird for you to say that.

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,440
After I went back this time,
I went through a life-and-death crisis.

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,630
I've forgotten everything
that happened before.

107
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,470
Excuse me,

108
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,370
who are you?

109
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,960
There's no problem
with the appearance fee you offered.

110
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,090
Please come with me.

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,190
Is he having an affair with Zefang?

112
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,740
How could he engage in prostitution?

113
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,300
He could've told me
if he had had any difficulties.

114
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,000
How could he do this?

115
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,290
Your aftereffects are really severe.

116
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,820
Prostitution?

117
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,550
You've forgotten everything?

118
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,070
The swimming team invited you
to make an appearance,

119
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,000
and you offered a super high price.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,860
So you mean

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,680
Zefang got paid to help others
in the competition?

122
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,890
It's not right to do so,

123
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,420
but our swimming team has limited players.

124
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,010
How can you do this?

125
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,290
You should help your classmates
when they are in trouble.

126
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
So you've agreed?

127
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Yes!

128
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,940
Sorry, I'm afraid of water.

129
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,700
I want to help you,

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,500
but I'm afraid of water now. I can't swim.

131
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,260
You've lost your memory, not your ability.

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,159
I have a video of you swimming.

133
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,299
Look how coordinated
your upper body muscles and movements are.

134
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,190
Perfect.

135
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,240
It's a pity that
you don't join the swimming team.

136
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,850
Look.

137
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,230
So handsome.

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Sorry.

139
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,410
I've really forgotten how to swim now.

140
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,160
Everyone here knows
you're good at swimming.

141
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,150
I really can't swim.

142
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I'm going to take a shower.

143
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,680
Why are you following me?

144
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm afraid I'll run into Guan Riqing.

145
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,080
Do young people like you these days
have such good figures?

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,010
How did you get such a great figure?

147
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,540
What are you doing?

148
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,790
I'm making some comparisons.

149
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,650
See if your figure
is better than Zefang's.

150
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,260
You're so afraid of Guan Riqing,

151
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,990
but why aren't you afraid of me?

152
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,580
You don't like Zefang.
Why should I be afraid of you?

153
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,920
Young people's love lives

154
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,140
are a mess these days.

155
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,650
People were much more loyal in our day.

156
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,760
Haiyuan.

157
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,270
You're the only man in your family now.

158
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,270
Think about your mother and sister.

159
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,450
If there are men's things
you don't understand,

160
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,580
feel free to ask me.

161
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,130
What men's things?

162
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,290
Things about
how to date a girl and get intimate.

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,420
You think I'm inexperienced?

164
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,770
Okay, you're not.

165
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,610
We're men.

166
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,690
We should communicate more, okay?

167
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,750
Why did he stand so close to me?

168
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,560
It's not mine.

169
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,790
Definitely not mine.

170
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,840
It must be Zefang's.

171
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,780
It's Zefang's.

172
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,890
It must be Zefang's. Yes.

173
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,810
Do you have to
wear this kind of undershirt?

174
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,300
You don't understand.

175
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,500
It's cheap and easy to wear.

176
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,180
I bought it with Wang last time.

177
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,190
And this one.

178
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,870
It's cool. It's good for the private part.

179
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,300
If I do this again,

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,700
you have to tell me.

181
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,410
This is Zefang's body.

182
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
I have to return it anytime.

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,390
And before that,

184
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,050
I can't cause any trouble.

185
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,160
I've never thought
I'd be so tired after shopping all day.

186
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,690
This is my bed. Get up.

187
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,580
It's okay.

188
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,930
Join me.

189
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,020
No.

190
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,690
Why don't you
respect an old man like me at all?

191
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,740
To be precise,

192
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,400
Xia Zefang,

193
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm older than you.

194
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,580
Qiansui, say something.

195
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,480
It's much safer here

196
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,010
than being stuck with Guan Riqing.

197
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,240
I should have

198
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,630
brought my pillow and radio here.

199
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,470
Listen to this and sleep.

200
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,480
How to use it?

201
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,540
When did I sleep here?

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,170
Why don't I remember anything?

203
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Yu Chan, don't go.

205
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,050
Yu Chan.

206
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,480
Yu Chan.

207
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,589
Don't go.

208
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,530
That's all for today.

209
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,550
Remember to do your homework, okay?

210
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,360
Class is over.

211
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,170
The exam is next week.

212
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,510
The teacher speaks Mandarin.

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,180
What's the problem?

214
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,670
Exam.

215
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,530
It'll be bad if you fail, you know?

216
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,310
Xia Zefang.

217
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,870
Xia Zefang.

218
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,690
Xia Zefang!

219
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,080
Yes!

220
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,130
Your performance in class

221
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,600
is much worse than before.

222
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,750
Miss,

223
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,240
I don't mean to

224
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,720
forget what I've learned.

225
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,330
No matter what happens at home,

226
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,690
you shouldn't fall behind
with your classwork.

227
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,330
You're already a university student.

228
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,030
Whatever is lagging behind,

229
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,090
hurry to make it up.

230
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,310
If you have any difficulties,

231
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,570
you can borrow others' notebooks, okay?

232
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,280
Thank you!

233
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,280
Zefang.

234
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,930
I will do my best for you.

235
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,010
Hey, can I borrow your notebook?

236
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Hey,

237
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,220
can...

238
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,820
Why did they ignore me?

239
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,280
Could it be that they don't like Zefang?

240
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,920
They don't even lend me their notebooks.

241
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,550
He hates being woken up.

242
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,200
Stay away from him,

243
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,560
in case he punches you.

244
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,660
Help me. I can't do it.

245
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,110
Help me take care of him.

246
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
He's not a kid.

247
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,990
What is there to take care of?

248
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,930
Where are you going?

249
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,210
To work.

250
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,100
You're a student.

251
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,620
Why don't you focus on your studies?

252
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,740
Hello.

253
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,460
Have you watched the video I sent
yesterday?

254
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,260
No.

255
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,960
Xia Zefang.

256
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,100
Xia Zefang!

257
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,100
Are you avoiding me?

258
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,550
No.

259
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
I didn't see you just now.

260
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,260
Come back.

261
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,600
To where?

262
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,440
Stop pretending like that.

263
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,470
You've stayed in Room 103 for days
out of anger. It should be enough.

264
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,000
Just take the olive branch
when it's offered.

265
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,530
Come back. I'll buy whatever you want.

266
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,290
What on earth happened
after you went back this time?

267
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,310
Tell me. I can make a change.

268
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,110
My head hurts.

269
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,700
It must be because I haven't recovered
since the hit last time.

270
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,630
I need to go back to the dorm to rest.

271
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,620
Stop pulling me. My head hurts badly.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,080
My head hurts.

273
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,150
He's lying.

274
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,300
Someone clearly saw him

275
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,730
going shopping with Ye Haiyuan yesterday.
He was perfectly fine.

276
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,530
I think it must be Ye Haiyuan
taking him from you.

277
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,970
[Some things change,
but their nature stays the same.]

278
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,470
Being able to
make any outfit look this way.

279
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,330
That's some “talent,” I suppose.

280
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,210
Do I look equally good

281
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,870
no matter how I dress?

282
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,100
Let's go to class.

283
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,620
I don't think I look good in this.

284
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,110
Ye Haiyuan, wait for me!

285
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,380
Ye Haiyuan, wait for me!

286
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,680
Recently,

287
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,430
[Next Episode Preview]

288
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,940
rumor has it that

289
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,650
Ye Haiyuan has gone into the trade
as a male escort

290
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,990
for money.

291
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,520
Tell me

292
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,910
how much you need
to spend a night with me.

293
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,610
This is not what a student should do!

294
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,530
Why are you getting so close to me?

295
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,130
Aren't you

296
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,540
going to stick with me?

297
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,040
You little kid...

298
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,590
If it weren't for you,

299
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,720
Zefang and I wouldn't be like this today.

300
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,030
You have to be responsible.

301
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,930
How?

302
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,920
You have to take me seriously.

303
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,110
From the bottom of your heart.
