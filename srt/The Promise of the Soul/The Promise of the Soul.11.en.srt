[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,989
[Episode 11]
[If the Red Thread Snaps, A Bond Ends]

3
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,470
Why are you here?

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,500
If you won't go back soon,

5
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,170
I will...

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
What will you do?

7
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,580
Why do people think

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,039
someone like you is suitable
to be a dorm supervisor at school?

9
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,350
I portray myself

10
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,050
as a hard-working postgraduate student
with talent.

11
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,050
Besides,

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,310
I'm so good at acting.

13
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,140
Then when will you come back?

14
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,520
Soon.

15
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,030
Wait a little longer.

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,259
Just a little longer.

17
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,640
You abandoned me

18
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,800
just for a mission.

19
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,000
Listen.

20
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll give you another month.

21
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,560
During the month, if you...

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,640
What if it exceeds one month?

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,480
Then I'll change the lock on the door

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,610
and won't let you in.

25
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,620
Alright.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Go.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,610
Go, go.

28
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,240
Go.

29
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,280
Just go.

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,380
Go back.

31
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,150
Okay.

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,350
Go ask my brother

33
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,650
to find someone to replace me,

34
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,950
so that I can go back early
to accompany you.

35
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,530
Bye.

36
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,579
Go.

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,250
Bye.

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,420
Be careful.

39
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,650
Who is he?

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Who?

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,050
No one is here.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,800
Stop lying.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,730
Boyfriend?

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,490
Don't think that everyone
is in a relationship

45
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,620
just because you're in love, alright?

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,070
I heard,

47
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,770
if you love someone,

48
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,170
your feelings
will leak out from your eyes.

49
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,480
You can't fool me.

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,510
Leak out?

51
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,310
You sound so fancy when you talk.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Why?

53
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,410
Are you in relationship trouble?

54
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,090
Did you look in the mirror

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,790
and see your eyes?

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,140
Between Ye Haiyuan and Guan Riqing,

57
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,820
who are you going to choose?

58
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,800
Haiyuan.

59
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,480
I didn't see you.

60
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,110
I thought you went to the toilet,

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,440
but I couldn't find you.

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,740
Then I checked the social room.

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,240
You weren't there either.

64
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,290
I just went to buy breakfast.

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,990
How would I know you would get up early?

66
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,530
I even knocked on Room 102.

67
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,170
Guan Riqing has trouble using his hands.

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,570
His mother took him back
to take care of him.

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
How do you know?

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,290
I heard about it.

71
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't worry.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,910
Are you going to

73
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,190
become a grumpy man,

74
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,280
a stalker,

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,820
or a control freak
just because you're in a relationship?

76
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,950
I'll be afraid if so.

77
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,760
Be good.

78
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,200
Have breakfast.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,570
What's wrong?

80
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,390
Say something.

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,780
What happened?

82
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,710
You used to be uninhibited before.

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Did something happen at home?

84
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Or do you have a fever?

85
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,510
Chen Qiansui,

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,580
do you not care about me at all?

87
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,820
Yesterday,
I dreamed that you were with someone else.

88
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,950
You even introduced him to me happily.

89
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,130
Why were you with someone else?

90
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,070
Jiang Bailing,

91
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,700
what were you dreaming about?

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,600
Tell me

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,640
who I was with

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,170
and who I introduced to you.

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,370
I don't remember.

96
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,140
It's just a dream.
Don't take it seriously.

97
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,380
Why can we only be friends?

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
If you can be with someone else,

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,050
why couldn't that be me?

100
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,740
That's because

101
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,490
a fortune teller told me

102
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,850
I'm doomed to bring bad luck
to my wife and children.

103
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,650
I probably won't be able to date.

104
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,290
I don't want to hurt the person I like.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,050
So you won't date me

106
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,010
because you like me,

107
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,740
right?

108
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,460
I caught you!

109
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,440
Then why didn't you find someone else?

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,670
Because I like you.

111
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,370
Since when?

112
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,820
I don't follow you around
like anyone else.

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,080
And I'm not good to you.

114
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,820
I just want to be good to you—that's all.

115
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,620
I don't know when I started liking you.

116
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,760
But you have to promise me,

117
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,960
if you want to date someone,

118
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,690
I want to be the only candidate.

119
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,630
I'm not gonna be your wife.

120
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,160
I can't have a baby with you.

121
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,610
You can clear up that doubt
you got from the fortune teller.

122
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,940
I didn't expect you to think like that.

123
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,110
You guys from the sports department

124
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,270
really are a bit straightforward.

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,640
It doesn't matter
even if I'm very straightforward.

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,770
Having you around is all that matters.

127
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,250
Were you bitten by a mosquito?

128
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,980
No.

129
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,780
Where's the bracelet?
Don't you have another one?

130
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,780
How do you know I have it with me?

131
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's give it a try.

132
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,050
But I'm unlucky.

133
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,860
You can't blame me for that.

134
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,980
Look.

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,980
I told you they are together.

136
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,720
What about Guan Riqing?

137
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,250
He's been quiet lately.

138
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,430
Maybe he's accepted the fact.

139
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,860
I didn't expect Xia Zefang

140
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,880
could take down Ye Haiyuan.

141
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,670
They are looking at me.

142
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,470
Stop talking.

143
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,680
Haiyuan.

144
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,580
Is the professor looking for you?

145
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,880
Do you want to go first?

146
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,150
Fine,

147
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,980
I'll go first.

148
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,600
Wow.

149
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,430
Ye Haiyuan can't live without you now.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,860
You surely know
how to get along with your partner.

151
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,060
This is much better than Xia Zefang.

152
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,900
Bailing has the same bracelet

153
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,400
too.

154
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,980
Are you really...

155
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,110
Hi.

156
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,850
This must mean the same thing, right?

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,700
A token of love.

158
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,370
Are you with Ye Haiyuan now?

159
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,140
What about Guan Riqing?

160
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,210
Or has he given up?

161
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,049
Where is Zefang's soul?

162
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,440
Will he come back?

163
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,890
Stop holding my hands.

164
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,060
Guan Riqing and Ye Haiyuan will be jealous

165
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,090
if they see this.

166
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,890
Let me ask you.

167
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,060
If the red thread is missing,

168
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,190
what does that mean?

169
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
When a bond ends,

170
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,530
it snaps.

171
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,670
What if the red thread
is connected to someone else?

172
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,470
When a bond begins, it connects.

173
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,810
Do you believe in destiny?

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,450
If you do,

175
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,290
you will be guided by it.

176
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,470
But if you don't,

177
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,520
everything is an illusion.

178
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,860
It's like...

179
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Say, we usually go to the temple
for Poe divination.

180
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
If the two pieces fall differently,

181
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,600
we would be happy.

182
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,680
But if they
have their curved sides facing up,

183
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,670
we would think

184
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,140
if we should ask again

185
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,900
or ask in another way.

186
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,870
Because the result is not what we want.

187
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,140
If

188
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,770
the red thread is connected to Ye Haiyuan,

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,530
does it mean
you have a romantic bond with him?

190
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,030
What if it's connected to Guan Riqing?

191
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,920
Does it mean
you have an ill-fated bond with him?

192
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,390
Or

193
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,690
does it mean
Zefang has a romantic bond with him?

194
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,930
H-How did you know

195
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,930
the red thread
is connected to Guan Riqing?

196
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,060
Did I call it or what?

197
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,730
What should you do?

198
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Are you going to be with Guan Riqing?

199
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,250
You said

200
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,790
the red thread represents marital fate.

201
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,320
I found the red thread
connected me to Haiyuan before,

202
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,090
so I thought
he was the reincarnation of my wife.

203
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,610
But now,

204
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,860
the red thread
is connected to Guan Riqing.

205
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,560
But I really think

206
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,490
you and Ye Haiyuan are a good match.

207
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,870
So does the red thread

208
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,870
belong to me or Zefang?

209
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,530
Who on earth is it connected to?

210
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,780
Ask your heart.

211
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,840
You, Xia Cha, are staying in the body now.

212
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,890
Xia Cha, which one

213
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,370
do you prefer?

214
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,890
Oh no.

215
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,360
The professor will call the roll
in five minutes.

216
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,690
Hold on.

217
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,720
[It's rude to leave me on read.]

218
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,420
[I just told the professor
that you had diarrhea.]

219
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,290
[Hurry back.]

220
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,230
So you're with me

221
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,610
just because of the red thread?

222
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Ye Haiyuan,

223
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
you left me on read.

224
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,060
Why all the mystery?

225
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,060
Don't you know I'm worried?

226
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,750
Are you sick?

227
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,360
Now,

228
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,260
do you think Guan Riqing

229
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,220
is the reincarnation of your wife?

230
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,790
Why is he connected to the red thread?

231
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,010
How...

232
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,270
How did you know?

233
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,670
You thought it'd be better
if I didn't know?

234
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,820
I don't know yet.

235
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,270
I'll figure it out.

236
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,680
You won't figure it out
by getting close to Guan Riqing, will you?

237
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Didn't you say you'd stay away from him?

238
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,250
Or

239
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,080
you'll get close to

240
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,760
whoever is connected to the red thread?

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
Do you really see me that way?

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I have no opinion of you whatsoever.

243
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,770
Yes.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,270
I overthink it.

245
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,140
I'm the one who's afraid,

246
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,640
not you
who always lead an aboveboard life!

247
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,040
That's unfair.

248
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,900
No one here is more afraid of losing you
than me.

249
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,450
Zefang!

250
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,950
Zefang, come out and talk to me!

251
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,050
Is the red thread

252
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,410
mine or yours?

253
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,540
Why are you here alone?

254
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,630
Where is your Zefang?

255
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,700
He is not Xia Zefang.

256
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,120
Okay, okay.

257
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,450
Where's your Cha?

258
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,250
You had a fight?

259
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,750
Someone said,

260
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,220
time's for loving each other.

261
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,390
You

262
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,560
should go upstairs when you're ready.

263
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,510
He might think I'm annoying.

264
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,180
He's so smart.

265
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,320
If he thinks you're annoying,

266
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,870
he can find whatever excuses to avoid you,

267
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,160
instead of staying by your side.

268
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,610
The braised food stall by the back door

269
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,870
seems to be open today.

270
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,850
You can buy his favorite food

271
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,350
and lay it out all over the table

272
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,080
to make him happy.

273
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,880
Then he'll...

274
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,420
Where are you?

275
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,020
God,

276
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,350
just give me a quick end.

277
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,090
How can I return my body

278
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,110
to Xia Zefang?

279
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,070
Or...

280
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,990
Or do I have to live like this?

281
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,610
Can you give me some hints?

282
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,350
Are you okay?

283
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,860
No.

284
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,320
I regret not treating Zefang well

285
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,090
and not telling Zefang my true thoughts.

286
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,500
Would he think

287
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,230
I was with him

288
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,760
only because of Ye Haiyuan?

289
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,370
If I die,

290
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,500
does it mean I can meet Zefang?

291
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,310
Don't jinx it!

292
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,910
Young people
shouldn't talk about "death" so lightly.

293
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,320
If Zefang were here,

294
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,530
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

295
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,510
Wait for me.

296
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,190
Wait for me.

297
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,990
Just a moment.

298
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,460
This is Zefang's footprint
recorded after his birth.

299
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,770
As I recall,

300
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,630
he weighed only 2,400 grams.

301
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,970
This is a photo of him
taken on his one-month birthday.

302
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,120
Isn't he adorable?

303
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,830
Let me tell you.

304
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,230
He was really hard to take care of.

305
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,820
He cried nonstop every night

306
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
and didn't even like drinking milk.

307
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,340
What is this?

308
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,500
Well, this...

309
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,020
I made this for his grandma.

310
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,400
Before she passed away,

311
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,340
she told me to keep this with me

312
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,480
and said she would come back to me.

313
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,190
Don't they say people have an obsession?

314
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,230
Sometimes I think,

315
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,020
that might be the reason
why I've been brought back to life,

316
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,920
so that there's a chance to meet her again
in this lifetime.

317
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,630
If she were to reincarnate immediately
after death,

318
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,360
she would be the same age as you.

319
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
So,

320
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,950
we don't know

321
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,380
what will happen next.

322
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,920
But I believe,

323
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,660
if Zefang comes back,

324
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,040
you can do better.

325
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,400
I really miss Zefang.

326
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,840
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,410
Go away!

328
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,760
Cha!

329
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,330
Ye Haiyuan.

330
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,930
Can you stop being so childish?

331
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,180
If you don't understand me,

332
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,370
at least learn to respect me.

333
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,230
I don't respect you?

334
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,510
So,

335
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,350
I should've sent you there myself

336
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,880
and closed the door for you?

337
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,270
I just felt sorry for him.

338
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
Could you

339
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,620
stop being so overly compassionate?

340
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,240
Because he didn't believe
I wasn't Xia Zefang.

341
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,130
So now he believes,

342
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
and you hugged him.

343
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,930
I didn't.

344
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,030
He's injured.

345
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,070
How could I ignore him?

346
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,210
Besides,
the red thread is connected to him now.

347
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,830
It means he might be Yu Chan.

348
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,260
How can I ignore him?

349
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,830
If he's Yu Chan,

350
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,760
what about me?

351
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,690
When you die, you die. That's it.

352
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,350
There is no reincarnation.

353
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,920
You've been living in your world.

354
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,260
Why don't you look forward?

355
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,530
What do you know?

356
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,250
What I have in this life

357
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,160
is this limited.

358
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,860
Everything I have has been put in.

359
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,740
I want to follow them
and leave this world.

360
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,480
Do you think it's good to be left alone?

361
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,180
When I miss someone,

362
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,260
I can only hold this iron box,

363
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,310
with no one to talk to.

364
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,840
Yes.

365
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,610
I didn't do enough good deeds
in my past life.

366
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,470
So I can only think about the past
all alone in this life.

367
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,740
Cha, I didn't know about these things.

369
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,500
Ye Haiyuan.

370
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,780
Do you know
what this iron box means to me?

371
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,050
You don't understand.

372
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,320
These are all promises I failed to keep.

373
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,560
Young Master died for me.

374
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,230
Yu Chan waited for me.

375
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,470
It doesn't matter now.

376
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,710
Now that the box is broken like this,

377
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,850
it's time to wake up.

378
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,500
Leave me alone.

379
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,020
Cha!

380
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,980
Zefang.

381
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,180
Zefang.

382
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,460
Why are you staying in my body?

383
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,360
Am I not supposed to live?

384
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,730
What are you talking about?

385
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,110
Give me back my body.

386
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,960
It was yours to begin with.

387
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,790
Aren't you reluctant?

388
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,970
Everyone likes you and doesn't like me.

389
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,670
I'm wondering

390
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,010
if this trip

391
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,010
can really help me understand my grandson,

392
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,910
so that I won't have so many regrets.

393
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,470
Zefang,

394
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,280
don't be unhappy.

395
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,670
The more people feel miserable,

396
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,720
the more unhappy they are.

397
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,260
You have to confirm

398
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,060
that you can come back

399
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,910
after I give back your body.

400
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,490
Grandpa.

401
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,090
I haven't heard you call me Grandpa
for a long time.

402
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,560
I still remember

403
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,280
the first time you called me Grandpa.

404
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,660
After you moved here later,

405
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,460
you pulled me and told me

406
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,210
you didn't want to go to school.

407
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,720
I hit your butt.

408
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,770
You cried.

409
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,380
I cried too.

410
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,030
Later,

411
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,250
you went to school in Taipei.

412
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,110
I seldom saw you.

413
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,970
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

414
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
I didn't spend time with you.

415
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,870
I forgot to accompany you.

416
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,270
I didn't want you to accompany me.

417
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,410
I was just afraid

418
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,970
I didn't know what you needed

419
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,550
and what you wanted.

420
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,340
I didn't take good care of you.

421
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,150
But I have to thank you.

422
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,060
I've had a lot of fun

423
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,810
for the past six months.

424
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,520
I even

425
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,770
dated Haiyuan

426
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,600
by staying in your body.

427
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,560
I have no regrets now.

428
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,920
Things you think don't matter

429
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,460
are just what I never tried to do.

430
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,350
Remember,

431
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,370
even if it's just a few days,

432
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,520
as long as you live life to the fullest,

433
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,550
it's worth it.

434
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,060
You should cherish it.

435
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,540
Don't complain anymore.

436
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,270
Be good.

437
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,140
Grandpa!

438
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,260
[If you want it,
I'll give it back to you.]
