[If I Can't Get him, You Won't Either]

3
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,690
Young Master,

4
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,830
you now want to settle a score

5
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,300
after so many years?

6
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,700
Where are you going in such a hurry?

7
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,900
To take a shower, eat,

8
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,760
or find Ye Haiyuan?

9
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,770
Let go of me.

10
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,430
I don't want to fight with you.

11
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,630
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,650
You don't have to be so against me.

13
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,480
For old times' sake,

14
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,880
at least don't see me as your enemy.

15
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,740
You don't talk nicely every time.

16
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,340
If I talk nicely,

17
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
will you listen to me?

18
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,310
My phone is out of service.

19
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,510
I need to make a call.

20
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,090
Use mine.

21
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm going to call Ye Haiyuan.

22
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,410
My phone number doesn't even deserve

23
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,710
to be written down in your notes?

24
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,310
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

25
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,740
Hello, this is H&H.

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,590
Hello,

27
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,410
I'm Xia Cha.

28
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,710
I want to know whether Haiyuan...

29
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,360
He's already late,
yet he asked you to call me.

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,710
So Haiyuan hasn't arrived yet?

31
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,940
Of course not.

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,650
Tell him to come quickly.

33
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,320
The whole place is booked this afternoon.
We're busy here.

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,990
Bye.

35
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,570
Where has he gone?

36
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,890
Thanks for letting me use your phone.

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,910
You're going out in slippers?

38
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,400
Change your shoes and put on your coat.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,530
I'll take you there.

40
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,990
Aren't you worried
that you can't find Haiyuan?

41
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,970
Fireworks?

42
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,430
From the backs of those two people,

43
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,760
they're the ones who are with Guan Riqing.

44
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,040
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

45
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
After the beep...

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,100
Those who booked the whole place are here.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,620
Where are you?

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,060
Even Xia Cha called to check on you.

49
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,670
Cha called you? When?

50
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,830
Just now.

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,800
When are you coming?

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,670
I'm so busy.

53
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,110
I just got into an accident.

54
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,040
I can't go there.

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,370
If Cha calls again,

56
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,950
tell him to stay in the dorm.

57
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,490
With Qiansui's personality,

58
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,820
I'm sure he'll reject me
if I give him this.

59
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,580
How can I make him accept it?

60
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,070
Cha...

61
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,290
Hurry.

62
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,450
Doesn't he always
try every means to avoid him?

63
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,910
Why are they together now?

64
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,480
Why are you moving back?

65
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,480
You have to prepare for the competition.

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,610
You need a good rest.

67
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,650
I can also have a good rest
with you being around.

68
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,580
It's okay.

69
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,430
The cockroach is gone.

70
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,960
I'll just sleep in Room 103.

71
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,590
What are you doing?

72
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,670
It's not like
we'll never meet again.

73
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,720
You're avoiding me
because I gave you the bracelet?

74
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,880
Don't feel pressured.

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,530
The store gave it to me
when I bought the book.

76
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,240
The bracelet is more expensive
than the book.

77
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,900
Which shop can be so generous?

78
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,150
I got the lucky draw.

79
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,600
I got the lucky draw.

80
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,550
You did?

81
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,020
You asked me before

82
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,360
why I was so nice to you.

83
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,000
Actually, I...

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,260
Let's just be friends.

85
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,950
Just friends?

86
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,330
Isn't it good

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,220
to maintain such a relationship?

88
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,730
As long as you think it's good.

89
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,909
You're so stupid.

90
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,880
How can you think anything is good?

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,220
I just do what you want.

92
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,580
I can't stand you.

93
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,420
Have you seen Cha?

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,220
I saw him going out with Guan Riqing.

95
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,160
Since you saw him being taken away,

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,290
why didn't you stop him?

97
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,750
Because he
pulled Guan Riqing away himself.

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,430
If you see him,

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,590
tell him to stop running around, okay?

100
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,270
Look what you've done.

101
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,500
You just let him be taken away.

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,100
He pulled Guan Riqing away.

103
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,150
He's here?

104
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,230
Haiyuan.

105
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,360
Ye Haiyuan.

106
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,810
You lied to me, didn't you?

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,680
He's not here at all.

108
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,610
You seem anxious

109
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,850
about where he is.

110
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,800
Of course.

111
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,300
I can't get in touch with him.

112
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,560
Of course I'm worried.

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,460
If I were him,

114
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,140
would you be worried about me?

115
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,590
We're at the school.

116
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,950
You can't act improperly

117
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,010
in broad daylight.

118
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,250
This time,

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
he won't come to save you.

120
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,350
What do you mean?

121
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,000
What did you do to him?

122
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,970
Right, the earphones.

123
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,540
Cha.

124
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,970
Do you have them with you?

125
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,950
Let go of me!

126
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,020
Let... Let go of me!

127
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,060
I took this photo

128
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,380
for you.

129
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,440
Turns out you took it.

130
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,750
It's weird.

131
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,750
You just forgot everything?

132
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,450
This day,

133
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,910
you promised to be with me.

134
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,700
You asked me to take a picture for you.

135
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,160
I bought you
these clothes and accessories.

136
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,610
I even put them on for you.

137
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,900
Zefang, Zefang,

138
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,420
you really brought trouble upon yourself.

139
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,370
Why don't you want to be Zefang?

140
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,870
It's not that I don't want to.

141
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm not him at all.

142
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,510
Do you think
you can deny what's between us

143
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,340
if you don't admit you're him?

144
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,930
Don't forget

145
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,410
that you started it first.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,130
With your personality,

147
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,790
no one can force you to give in.

148
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,780
Zefang must have been led astray by you.

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,870
By me?

150
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,690
Me?

151
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,540
I mean,

152
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,190
Zefang shouldn't have been like this...

153
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,720
I shouldn't have been born!

154
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,390
I shouldn't have led you astray!

155
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,270
I shouldn't have tried to stop you

156
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,200
from being with Ye Haiyuan, right?

157
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, Riqing, Riqing.

158
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,130
Calm down.

159
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,720
Xia Zefang,

160
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,860
what more do you want from me?

161
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,000
I've given you everything!

162
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,810
Calm down.

163
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,080
Zefang will be touched

164
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,220
if he knows your thoughts.

165
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,880
But I'm really not Xia Zefang.

166
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,750
Enough.

167
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,420
No matter who you are,

168
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
why

169
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,560
am I not the one you like?

170
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,630
Were you pitying me by being with me?

171
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,450
Zefang didn't mean that.

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,810
What is it
that I'm not as good as Ye Haiyuan at?

173
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,670
Older brother.

174
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,670
He didn't want to change his surname

175
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,370
or accept the money.

176
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,200
He didn't even want to call him Dad.

177
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,710
What a joke.

178
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,910
The mistress's son is my older brother.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then what am I?

180
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,770
And my mom?

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,490
So you and Haiyuan

182
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,380
are half-brothers.

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,210
Why are you entangled with Ye Haiyuan?

184
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
Why does it have to be Ye Haiyuan?

185
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,790
You're fighting Haiyuan for Zefang

186
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,230
just to prove...

187
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,990
He looks down on you.

188
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,830
Yet I treat you so well.

189
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,160
Do I need to prove it?

190
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,930
Fine, fine,

191
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,970
you don't need to.

192
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,360
Love is just a part of your life.

193
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,140
If there's a grudge between you two,

194
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,640
you can sit down...

195
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,670
No way!

196
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,970
Why?

197
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,530
Because he wants to take you away from me!

198
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,210
Please.

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,040
He doesn't take me away from you.

200
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,310
Let me find Haiyuan first.

201
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,570
I'll talk to you later.

202
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,880
Want to find him?

203
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,090
-I won't let you go to him!
-Let go of me!

204
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,520
Let go of me!

205
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,900
Let go of me!

206
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,030
Don't hurt Ye Haiyuan.

207
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,070
If I can't get you,

208
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,200
he won't either.

209
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,490
Guan Riqing,

210
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,710
open the door!

211
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm really scared!

212
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,440
Guan Riqing!

213
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,300
Guan Riqing,

214
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
open the door.

215
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,170
I'm really scared.

216
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,870
You're trying to make me believe you
by saying so.

217
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,980
Guan Riqing,

218
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,620
open the door.

219
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,570
I'm really scared.

220
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,300
I-I promise you.

221
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,800
I won't leave.

222
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,130
Just stay inside

223
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,200
and listen to me.

224
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,780
I care about you

225
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,070
more than Ye Haiyuan does.

226
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,990
Why?

227
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,740
You're not talking?

228
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,920
Now you even

229
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,520
hate hearing my voice.

230
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,920
Zefang,

231
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,860
we're the same kind.

232
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,150
We're born to be together.

233
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,690
Why am I no match for Ye Haiyuan

234
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,820
even though I'm so nice to you?

235
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,430
Cha, where are you?

236
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,240
Cha!

237
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,450
Where is he?

238
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,980
You've got so much stamina.

239
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,780
The bad fall isn't stopping you.

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,210
I don't care if you do something to me.

241
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,280
But why would you do that to him?

242
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,210
Is it necessary?

243
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,970
It really runs in the family.

244
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,460
This way of stealing someone's love

245
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,690
is just like the way
your mother took my dad away.

246
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,260
You don't love Zefang at all.

247
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,520
Why do you want him now?

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Is stolen stuff more appealing?

249
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,790
He is not Xia Zefang!

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,620
Do you think he can be another person

251
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
by calling him another name?

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,640
You can't even
recognize the person you love.

253
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,180
He is not your Xia Zefang!

254
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,410
He is mine!

255
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,510
Why do you have to show up?

256
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,320
I wish you hadn't shown up.

257
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,580
Where did you hide him?

258
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,400
Stop fighting.

259
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,330
I'm going to die.

260
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:53,890
Cha.

261
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,350
Are you inside?

262
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,870
My dad didn't love me at all.

263
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,800
He disdained me.

264
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,230
He only cared about you!

265
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,370
But I only have Xia Zefang!

266
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,500
Why do you have to take him away from me?

267
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,270
You locked him in the iron cabinet.

268
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,190
You keep saying you love Xia Zefang,

269
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,370
but don't you know he's claustrophobic?

270
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,000
Do you want him dead?

271
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,940
Cha,

272
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,790
hang in there.

273
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,260
Cha,

274
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,600
hang in there.

275
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,750
I'm here to save you.

276
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,570
Go find

277
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,570
if there is anything that can cut it.

278
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,060
Zefang.

279
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,300
If you come any later,

280
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,050
I will die here.

281
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,130
Cha,

282
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,160
are you alright?

283
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,840
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,510
I really didn't know.

285
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,560
I really didn't know.

287
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,580
So,

288
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,700
you two

289
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,240
have the same father.

290
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,960
My dad was with my mom.

291
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,240
But he left my mom
and married someone else

292
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,950
for his family business.

293
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Back then,

294
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,900
he didn't know my mom was pregnant.

295
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,520
Later, he found her

296
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,880
and knew my existence.

297
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,120
So your sister

298
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,610
and you are full siblings.

299
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,040
In that case,

300
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,260
Huimei and your father
really loved each other, right?

301
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,280
Your father must have been pretty.

302
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,670
After all, you two are handsome.

303
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,330
Don't associate me with him.

304
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,880
You're the older brother.

305
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,080
You can't be so petty.

306
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,480
Both of you are childish!

307
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,880
He made you like this,
yet you defended him.

308
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,480
You should beat him to death!

309
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,190
Don't.

310
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
Don't mind it.

311
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm fine now anyway.

312
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,130
Isn't this bad enough?

313
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,990
You have me,

314
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,589
but he's all alone.

315
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,339
He told me about your father.

316
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,460
He's a poor kid.

317
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,010
Don't be so sympathetic.

318
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,350
Alright, alright.

319
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,410
Take a break, okay?

320
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,980
Don't be angry.

321
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,520
You locked him in the iron cabinet.

322
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,380
You keep saying you love Xia Zefang,

323
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,290
but don't you know he's claustrophobic?

324
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,620
Do you want him dead?

325
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,940
This is fake.

326
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,460
Everything is fake.

327
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,550
Is your hand

328
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,990
okay?

329
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,530
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,610
I didn't know you had claustrophobia.

331
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,940
I just didn't want you
to contact Ye Haiyuan.

332
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,740
I was angry...

333
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,470
I didn't know it before either.

334
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,320
It's okay.

335
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,180
It's good that we're fine.

336
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,780
What's wrong?

337
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,310
Aren't you angry?

338
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,240
Why should I?

339
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,250
So you're willing to forgive me.

340
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,650
You've suffered more

341
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,460
than we have.

342
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,530
In your shoes,

343
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,390
I know it's hard for you.

344
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,860
But,

345
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
you really need to tame your temper.

346
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,630
If anything had gone wrong
due to what you did,

347
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,650
you would regret it
for the rest of your life.

348
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,600
The grudge is between the last generation.

349
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,000
Why are you overcomplicating things?

350
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,280
The adults won't compromise

351
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,300
because of your discontent.

352
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,730
Guan Riqing.

353
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,160
Are you really not Zefang?

354
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,960
This is Zefang's body.

355
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,200
Here is his grandpa,

356
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,970
Xia Cha.

357
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,300
That's me.

358
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,710
I know it's hard to accept,

359
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,460
but that's the truth.

360
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,340
So Zefang

361
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,770
is really gone.

362
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,260
I still have a lot

363
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,590
to tell him.

364
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,800
Where is Zefang's soul?

365
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Will he come back?

366
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,240
I don't know.

367
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,490
Will Zefang show up again?

368
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,610
I mean,

369
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,730
have you seen his soul?

370
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,010
Is...

371
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,160
Is he okay?

372
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,100
There's someone
who really cares about Zefang.

373
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,680
This body belongs to Zefang.

374
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,250
Can you give him back his body?

375
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,670
If you don't want him,

376
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,930
I want him.

377
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,820
Who said I don't want him?

378
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,130
Didn't he tell you

379
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,060
I love him the most in the world?

380
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,570
I promise you,

381
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,140
when Zefang comes back,

382
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,120
I will return his body to him.

383
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,280
By then,

384
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,320
no one can interfere with

385
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,070
who he wants to be with.

386
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
As long as he is happy.

387
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,810
Are you really going
to give your body back to Xia Zefang?

388
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,380
It's not about giving.

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,500
I borrowed his body.

390
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,370
After he comes back,

391
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,020
shouldn't I return it to him?

392
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
You can't do this!

393
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,470
Even after he comes back!

394
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,060
Be reasonable.

395
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,780
What should I do then?

396
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Why are you so unconfident?

397
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,180
After Zefang comes back,

398
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,830
he might choose you.

399
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,740
I told you,

400
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,620
it can only be you,

401
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,260
and it will always be you.

402
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,720
Why don't you understand?

403
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,590
What's happening now

404
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,090
is only temporary.

405
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,100
One day,

406
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,300
things will return to normal.

407
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,790
No!

408
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,670
Don't you feel good in this body?

409
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,230
It's wrong

410
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,040
to take another's body.

411
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,210
Are you willing to leave me alone?

412
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,760
Xia Cha,

413
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,790
can you stay with me?

414
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,290
Don't go.

415
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,270
[Who is the one you can't let go of
and who's tied by fate’s red thread?]

416
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm leaving.

417
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,820
You just can't find him in the afternoon,

418
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,080
and you're so nervous.

419
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,520
Do you really know
where to find Ye Haiyuan?

420
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,380
The one who knows his movements best

421
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,930
is usually his enemy.

422
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,710
Did you guys fight?

423
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,840
[Next Episode Preview]

424
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,600
Time's for loving each other.

425
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,250
You should go upstairs when you're ready.

426
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:03,850
Haiyuan.

427
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,450
It's not what you think.

428
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,170
You know what this iron box

429
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
means to me.

430
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,520
I'm sorry.

431
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,060
What do you know?

432
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,220
Can you stop being so childish?

433
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,160
If you don't understand,

434
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,060
at least learn to respect.

435
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,800
Cha.

436
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,500
So you're with me

437
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,750
just because of the red thread?

438
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,300
It's time to wake up to reality.

439
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,170
Zefang.
