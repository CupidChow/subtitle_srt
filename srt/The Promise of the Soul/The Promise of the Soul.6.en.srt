[Episode 6]
[The Red Thread That Suddenly Appears]

3
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,840
You almost couldn't breathe just now.

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,900
Could you think about yourself more?

5
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,640
You're the one living in this body now.

6
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,310
Are you worrying about me?

7
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,810
I'm afraid you might accidentally die
in the bathroom.

8
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,560
Then you'd better watch me closely.

9
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,729
I was frightened today.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,900
Can I sleep beside you?

11
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,200
You have such a bad sleeping posture.

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,770
I've slept alone for so many years.

13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,180
I've got used to sleeping
in such a free-spirited way.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,730
I've slept on my own for so many years,
and my posture is good.

15
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,020
I've slept on my own
for much longer than you have.

16
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,579
I've decided.

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,770
Before Zefang's soul comes back,

18
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,420
I'll take good care of
his health and studies

19
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,990
and get his friendship and love back.

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
Zefang. Zefang. It's always about Zefang.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,690
Don't you ever think about
what Xia Cha wants?

22
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,440
If Zefang still likes you

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
after he comes back,

24
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,110
you have to give him a chance.

25
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,140
Anyway,

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,410
you're not against Zefang
getting close to you.

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,490
I'm not

28
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,960
because that person is you.

29
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,010
Why is it getting cold again?

30
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,990
Everyone has fear.

31
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm afraid of swimming.

32
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Zefang is afraid of confined space.

33
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,450
Ye Haiyuan,

34
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,190
is there anything you're afraid of?

35
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,650
Yu Chan also has a mole
at the corner of her eye.

36
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,560
Is this a coincidence or fate?

37
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,900
Are you going to work?

38
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,890
You won't be back late, will you?

39
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,620
It's not good for your health.

40
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,110
You should worry about yourself, not me.

41
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,290
Have you memorized all the key points?

42
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
Hello, Qiansui.

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,380
Do you know the name of the place

44
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,580
where Haiyuan works?

45
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,450
Who is it?

46
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,830
Cha.

47
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,860
It's Xia Zefang.

48
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,460
You seem to be good
with Xia Zefang recently.

49
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,159
Him?

50
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,870
He's funny.

51
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
Funnier than me?

52
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,180
Can I have your autograph?

53
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,580
I like you very much.

54
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,110
I watch your every game.

55
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,140
Thank you.

56
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,340
Jiang Bailing, do you have a girlfriend?

57
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,650
Candid photos of others infringe
on their portrait rights, don't they?

58
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,380
Did you ask for his permission?

59
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,850
And you, Jiang Bailing.

60
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,360
Don't sign your autographs randomly.

61
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,460
This can lead to the swimming team
losing its reputation.

62
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,420
None of your business.

64
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,130
I...

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,860
In this world,

66
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,500
apart from my parents,

67
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,310
he's the only one who can rein me in.

68
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,330
There's no one else.

69
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,130
I can't sign autographs for you.

70
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,270
What's his relationship
with Jiang Bailing?

71
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,860
I don't know. I don't like him.

72
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,320
Don't show up if you don't.

73
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,470
It should be a little sour.

74
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,950
I'll apply some honey.

75
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,530
It should be perfect now.

76
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,200
This isn't some improper venue, is it?

77
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,960
This way. This way.

78
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,300
You're a student.

79
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,560
Why do you have to make yourself so tired?

80
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,190
If you won't stop, I'll call the police!

81
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,090
Let's go!

82
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,910
Who were those two just now?

83
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,380
Why were you there?

84
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,480
Do you have a grudge with them?

85
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,910
Call the police
if you see such a thing happen.

86
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,200
Why did you rush out?

87
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,770
So you really work at a club?

88
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,830
Fill in occasionally.

89
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,480
You're lying.

90
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,170
Do you want me to talk to your mom?

91
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,910
This kind of place is complicated.

92
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,910
There are other jobs for you to pick.

93
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,120
Can you make more money there,

94
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,120
or do you need money?

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,540
Did Huimei not
give you enough living expenses,

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,550
or do you owe someone money?

97
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,600
Say something.

98
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,430
How can I help you
if you don't say anything?

99
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,470
I've never heard
Huimei talk about your dad.

100
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,470
Where is he?

101
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,390
People think my mom is a mistress.

102
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,230
I don't want her
to live on other men's money.

103
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,410
I can take care of both my mom

104
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,490
and my little sister.

105
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,590
Let me hug you. Let me hug you.

106
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,850
I feel so sorry for you. Really.

107
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,000
I didn't mean to yell at you.

108
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,720
You have to tell me.

109
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,800
Otherwise, how can I understand you?

110
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,290
You treat me like a child to comfort me.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,660
You are the same age as Zefang.

112
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,270
In my eyes,

113
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,940
you are both kids.

114
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,650
You...

115
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,240
You're hugging me too tightly.

116
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,830
I can't breathe.

117
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,130
Wait for me!

118
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,590
Young Master!

119
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,380
Young Master, don't go!

120
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,240
Young Master! Young Master, don't go!

121
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,220
Young Master, don't go!

122
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,280
Help!

123
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,180
Help!

124
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,220
It's okay. It's okay. I'm here.

125
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,930
What were you so scared of in your dream?

126
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,100
Is it your dream or Xia Zefang's dream?

127
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,760
The three of you

128
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,890
have a mole at the same spot
at the corner of your eyes.

129
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,070
Why?

130
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,520
It's okay. It's okay.

131
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,780
It's okay. It's okay.

132
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,460
Is it just a dream,

133
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,370
or is there really a red thread?

134
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,570
Hello?

135
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,840
Hello, Qiansui.

136
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm lining up
to buy your favorite fried chicken.

137
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,800
It'll take forever
to get through the line.

138
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,930
It's a waste of time.

139
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,360
You can just come here.

140
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,170
It won't be a waste if it's for you.

141
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,300
I'll be there later.

142
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,470
Okay, bye.

143
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,030
Jiang Bailing is so nice to you.

144
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,870
Yes, he has always been like this.

145
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,640
Always?

146
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,580
I was bullied by my classmates
in junior high school.

147
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,510
He protected me.

148
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,940
After I went to high school,

149
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,520
he was the one
who brought me to know others.

150
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,000
The relationship between you
is really special.

151
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,080
Maybe I'm too used to it.

152
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Why do you keep looking at your hand?

153
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,470
If...

154
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,960
I mean, it's just a hypothetical.

155
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,880
If two people are connected
by a red thread,

156
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,290
what does that mean?

157
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,510
A red thread of marriage unites lovers
across a thousand miles.

158
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,910
The connected red thread

159
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,900
means he's your lifelong love.

160
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,640
Really?

161
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,590
Do you believe in past and present life

162
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,020
or soul reincarnation?

163
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,530
A prominent psychologist
in the United States

164
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,130
once witnessed a case
of past and present life

165
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,230
through hypnotherapy.

166
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,230
Things like dreams, marks,

167
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,140
fear for no reason,

168
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,210
innate skills,

169
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,420
and

170
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,560
the trust in strangers.

171
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,610
Things that can't be explained in life

172
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,160
demonstrate the possible existence
of reincarnation.

173
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,980
Why are you drawing all of a sudden?

174
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,130
Drawing?

175
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,360
I'm writing a dorm announcement.

176
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,910
Drawing?

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,510
Let me try.

178
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
You?

179
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,180
Can you do it?

180
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,770
I've practiced calligraphy, you know.

181
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,020
[Announcement]

182
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,210
[Next Friday, we'll assess dorms
for cleanliness. Please keep...]

183
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,230
If you enter a competition,

184
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
you'll definitely win a prize.

185
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,250
Your calligraphy is amazing.

186
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,580
Is there a calligraphy contest recently?

187
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,980
There is, and it's a key bonus project.

188
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Then I need to practice more.

189
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,850
Look.

190
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,010
The announcement looks different today.

191
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes, the handwriting before
is like chicken scratch—

192
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
completely unreadable.

193
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,650
But today's handwriting is very nice.

194
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,560
You just don't appreciate it.

195
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,930
It's my version of cursive.

196
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,190
Do you understand?

197
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,280
Kids' drawings.

198
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,850
Doodles.

199
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,340
Xia Zefang wrote it today.

200
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,089
Xia Zefang?

201
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,730
He's different.

202
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,730
He can even fix a chair.

203
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,030
Yeah, really.

204
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,920
Don't you think it's so amazing
that he can even fix a chair?

205
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
The chair's leg was broken.

206
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,609
It's easy to fix it.

207
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,190
He can write calligraphy

208
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,619
and fix chairs.

209
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,210
Just like my grandpa.

210
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,130
Grandpa.

211
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
That's ridiculous.

212
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,770
That's ridiculous.

213
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,980
How is that possible?

214
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,150
Look.

215
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,130
Isn't it cute?

216
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,060
What is this?

217
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
I especially made it for you.

218
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,220
Don't waste your time
on unimportant things.

219
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,230
Have you memorized the key points?

220
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,330
Speaking of which,
Zefang is young and has a sharp mind.

221
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,830
I read through the notes once

222
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,430
and have memorized them all.

223
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,100
But my English is weak.

224
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,470
It's too hard
to understand those combined letters.

225
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,810
But the dorm supervisor signed me up
for the calligraphy contest,

226
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,670
saying it can offset some points.

227
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,950
You just came back,
and you're going out again.

228
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,120
It's time for tutoring.

229
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,380
Aren't you tired of working so many jobs?

230
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,750
While students are doing their homework,

231
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,910
I can study.

232
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,080
It's nice to be so smart.

233
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,810
Here.

234
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,640
Yours.

235
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,210
No.

236
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,600
These are your pants.

237
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,790
You can't dislike them.

238
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,140
You ripped them when you fought
with the hooligans last time.

239
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I even sewed a panda pattern on them.

240
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,770
The pattern is too cute for me.

241
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,710
I don't think so.

242
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,360
It just looks like you.

243
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,280
And this.

244
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,250
It's a set.

245
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,810
Come on,

246
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,050
all I thought about was you

247
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,330
while I was sewing this pair of pants.

248
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,060
It took a long time.

249
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,700
My hands even hurt.

250
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,170
And you're the only one

251
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,960
who has this wood carving.

252
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,930
When someone wanted it,

253
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,260
I refused immediately.

254
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,140
And look.

255
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,030
Here's an English word I learnt recently,

256
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,830
soulmate.

257
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,810
It suits us, doesn't it?

258
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,510
You think I'm cute?

259
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,460
Not only cute

260
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,070
but also handsome.

261
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,800
I didn't expect you to be like this,
Ye Haiyuan.

262
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,520
Are you in a relationship?

263
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,630
Who gave this to you?

264
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,990
So cute.

265
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,500
Welcome.

266
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,230
Hello.

267
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm Xia Cha.

268
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,790
I'm Haiyuan's classmate.

269
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,820
Cha?

270
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,650
Why are you here?

271
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,100
This kid

272
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,280
has been taken care of by you.

273
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,820
This is this year's champion tea leaves.

274
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,440
It's a little something for you.

275
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,380
Tea leaves.

276
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,080
Thank you.

277
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,590
These are Haru and Hana.

278
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,270
Last time, I saw

279
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,430
you and Haiyuan buy clothes on the street.

280
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,430
It was you, right?

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,140
I was looking at the embroidery
on the pants.

282
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,540
It's very unique.

283
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,650
You gave it to him as a present?

284
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,140
This one?

285
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,010
Not bad, right?

286
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,330
But I didn't buy it.

287
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I made it myself.

288
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,150
You're polite and good at embroidery.

289
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,880
And you also like drinking tea.

290
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,920
I want to join you with your permission,

291
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,500
so I came to H&H following Haiyuan.

292
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,730
Are you here to work

293
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,930
or supervise him?

294
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,580
What stage are you two in?

295
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,560
Haiyuan is a student.

296
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,040
It's so hard

297
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,570
for him to work so many jobs.

298
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,780
So I want to help him

299
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,940
and keep an eye on him,

300
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,430
so that he won't go astray.

301
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,830
He's a kid, after all.

302
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,440
I'm older than him.

303
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Of course, I should take care of him.

304
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,160
But isn't Haiyuan the same age as you?

305
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,750
You should study hard.

306
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,600
It's okay. Come whenever you're free.

307
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,900
You're welcome here.

308
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,150
It's so nice to experience life together.

309
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,640
Alright.

310
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,430
We're closed.

311
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,700
Hey,

312
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,490
you work here?

313
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,950
No wonder you have money
to keep a man in Room 103.

314
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,350
Don't make trouble here.

315
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,820
Let's talk outside.

316
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,810
Why are you here?

317
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,160
It's none of your business where he is.

318
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,380
So you were the person
who troubled Haiyuan

319
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,180
the other day!

320
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,850
Why are you so sure

321
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,180
I did all the bad things?

322
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,410
Couldn't it be
that Ye Haiyuan did terrible things

323
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,670
and asked for trouble?

324
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,220
If it's not you,

325
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,570
you can just say it.

326
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,350
Given what you said,

327
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,790
it feels like it's you.

328
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,480
Xia Zefang, you're framing me up.

329
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,130
What is done by night appears by day.

330
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,940
Can't you do things more openly,

331
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,140
acting like a man?

332
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,760
Cha, are you okay?

333
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,470
What are you doing?

334
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,730
Don't do this!

335
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,350
I'm going to call the police!

336
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,550
What are you doing?

337
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,320
Stop it! Let go!

338
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,850
What are you doing?

339
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,130
Cha!

340
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,460
Cha, what's wrong?

341
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,340
Cha!

342
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,930
Cha!

343
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,240
Cha, what's wrong?

It's so pretty.

348
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,620
Can you give me this after you finish?

349
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,840
Sorry, I can't.

350
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,190
It's a limited edition.

351
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,950
Okay.

352
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,740

[Next Episode Preview]

354
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,880
stay away from Cha.

355
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,650
Didn't I tell you last time

356
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,240
to run away when you're in danger?

357
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
If something happens to you,

358
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,450
how would I feel?

359
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,570
Are you okay?

360
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,750
I think Zefang has good taste.

361
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,640
Anyone who's with you

362
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,600
must be happy.

363
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,550
It's not the case

364
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,670
that looking identical
will lead to the same feelings.

365
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,130
It's only because it's you

366
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,520
that I feel this way.
