Didn't expect Ye Haiyuan
to be this romantic.

Who's scared?

194
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,440
What?

195
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,560
Have a little more faith in me.

196
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,690
You can compete,

197
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,720
but no betting.

198
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,580
Just look at me.

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,760
Why look at the loser?

200
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,080
Let's beat them up together.

201
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,650
Come on!

202
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,380
Please.

203
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,490
OK.

204
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,220
I'll leave it to you.

205
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,430
Hurry up.

206
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,390
You need to hit this one.

207
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,980
You need to hit here.

208
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,630
Okay.

209
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,410
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,470
It's okay.

211
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll get the scores for you later.

212
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,250
Don't say we're bullying kids.

213
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,510
You knew they were great.

214
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,280
I told you we can compete,

215
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,310
but no betting.

216
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,550
A bet is a bet.

217
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,010
A bet is a bet.

218
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
What do you want us to do?

219
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,590
Baby.

220
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,240
No need to do more.

221
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,410
Just one.

222
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,010
Is that okay?

223
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,630
It's just a student's film.

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,580
Just pretending is enough.

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,430
I'm not pretending.

226
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,960
That's not what I meant.

227
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,700
Then what do you mean?

228
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,170
Kissing

229
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,030
in front of everyone like this,

230
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,700
I'll get shy.

231
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,030
This is what makes you shy.

232
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,260
But we can cut it out.

233
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,210
Boys.

234
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,450
Great job.

235
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,610
In such a short time,

236
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,250
you managed to finish a film like this.

237
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,460
Very efficient.

238
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,580
Especially Zefang.

239
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,620
You're working so hard for the credits.

240
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,960
And Haiyuan.

241
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,690
Putting aside old grudges for him.

242
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,150
Is this how you become his boyfriend?

243
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,320
Great!

244
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Let's give them a round of applause.

245
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,060
Get up.

246
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,280
Thank you.

247
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,230
Thank you, everyone.

248
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,330
There's love.

249
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,160
Love.

250
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
Love is love.

251
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,150
Looks real, doesn't it?

252
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,740
It's too fast, huh?

253
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,640
Didn't you say it's a film?

254
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,580
Does this look like acting?

255
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,910
If Riqing finds out, he'll freak.

256
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,920
So,

257
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,350
we can't let him see it.

258
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440
If you don't want to,

259
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,730
you don't have to submit the film.

260
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,030
No way.

261
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,880
It's my ticket to staying here.

262
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,300
What should I do?

263
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,930
I think…

264
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,440
I like you too much.

265
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,020
I'm not romantic at all.

266
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,810
I don't know any romantic tricks.

267
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,820
My only dating experience

268
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,930
was ordinary.

269
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
But somehow,

270
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,770
I have a different feeling

271
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,270
for you.

272
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,470
When

273
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,140
you get too close,

274
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,810
my heart just goes

275
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,340
thump,

276
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,050
thump,

277
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,010
thump.

278
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,210
That kind of feeling.

279
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,270
Cha.

280
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,720
Thank you for coming into my life.

281
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,800
In broad daylight,

282
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,620
can you be a little more serious?

283
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,260
Then we can do it at night?

284
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,820
You're still growing.

285
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
Don't think about that all the time.

286
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,350
What kind of thing?

287
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,870
Even with my wife,

288
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,060
I'd only do that kind of thing
with the lights off and my eyes closed.

289
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,130
Unlike you,

290
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,620
you're not ashamed at all.

291
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,230
You only care about your wife.

292
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,140
Ye Haiyuan,

293
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,710
you're getting better
at throwing tantrums.

294
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,780
You used to be cold and distant,

295
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,380
but now you're jealous and clingy.

296
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,240
You're not so manly.

297
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,730
Ye Haiyuan.

298
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,430
Ye Haiyuan.

299
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,010
Actually,

300
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,400
you and she have a lot in common.

301
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,080
Maybe that's why

302
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,480
I fell for you.

303
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
So,

304
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,020
you should thank her

305
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,260
and that red string.

306
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,090
Otherwise,

307
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,290
I might not have fallen for you so easily.

308
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,100
You have to take responsibility for me.

309
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,750
If it weren't for you,

310
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,350
I wouldn't be led around like this.

311
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,060
Alright.

312
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,620
Isn't H&H booked out today?

313
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,740
No.

314
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,610
I'll take a day off.

315
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,820
Hey.

316
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,120
I asked you to take a leave,
but you said no.

317
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,990
What's the excuse today?

318
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,480
Sex.

319
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,260
What are you talking about?

320
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,250
It's just a bike ride.

321
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,480
[Male's Dorm 1]

322
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,610
No speeding.

323
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,820
No fighting.

324
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,900
No drinking.

325
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Also,

326
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,190
don't let people
take advantage of you.

327
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,780
Be good.

328
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,330
I haven't finished my report yet.

329
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,130
I'll keep you company tomorrow.

330
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,730
You're going to see Bailing, aren't you?

331
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,030
After meeting you,

332
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,780
Haiyuan really changed a lot.

333
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,580
Before, even though he was handsome,

334
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,890
he had a bad temper.

335
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,120
If I weren't his distant cousin

336
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,580
and the dorm supervisor hadn't asked me,

337
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,080
I wouldn't have wanted to room with him.

338
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,680
You are his cousin?

339
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,510
Before you came,

340
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,530
I took care of him.

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,100
But now,

342
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,850
someone can finally take over.

343
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,740
By the way,

344
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,730
why do you go to Bailing's place
every night?

345
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,580
Because you and Haiyuan

346
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,380
blind me with your PDA every day.

347
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,410
We didn't do anything.

348
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,470
It'll be too late if you do something.

349
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,350
I was lying on the floor.

350
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,080
Unlike you,

351
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,650
lying right on someone's bed.

352
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,520
We're just friends.

353
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,100
You want to be more than friends.

354
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm leaving.

355
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,980
Hey.

356
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,260
Feeling guilty?

357
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,930
With my years of experience,

358
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,730
you two have something going on.

359
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,380
Takes two to tango.

360
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,830
How do I remind him

361
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,530
that I can see Xia Zefang's soul?

362
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,350
Hey.

363
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,480
Are you mad?

364
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,080
Why are you ignoring me?

365
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,220
Take care.

366
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,060
Lend me your bed.

367
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,030
No.

368
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,460
Young Master.

369
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,230
Don't go, Young Master.

370
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,900
Don't go, Young Master.

371
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,560
Let's go catch the cicada.

372
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,360
No, you're not feeling well.

373
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,880
Last time you almost died out there.

374
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,940
If you won't go, I'll go by myself.

375
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,810
Young master!

376
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,660
Young Master!

377
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,850
Young Master!

378
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,180
Young Master, don't go!

379
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,960
Young Master!

380
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,760
Young Master!

381
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,540
Young Master.

382
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
You wanted to settle a score

383
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,210
after so many years?

384
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,610
[No matter the danger ahead,
love is love]

385
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,220
Food's here.

386
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,750
This is yours.

387
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay, thank you.

388
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,600
LGBT Q.

389
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,630
So complicated.

390
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,300
It's just five letters.

391
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,960
How can it mean so many things?

392
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,510
It's really open now.

393
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,120
Back in my day,

394
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,500
if a man loved a man

395
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,480
or a woman loved a woman,

396
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,010
their legs would be broken.

397
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,600
There is nothing wrong
with liking someone.

398
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,480
In the crowd of people,

399
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,860
because it's him,

400
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,120
it's him.

401
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,390
Meals we've shared.

402
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,480
Roads we've walked together.

403
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,310
Scenery we've seen together.

404
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,780
Lives we've experienced together.

405
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,840
Because of love,

406
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,660
these everyday moments

407
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,460
become happier.

408
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,530
Enough.

409
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,220
I think

410
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,120
for this short film project,

411
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,400
we can film your dates with Ye.

412
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,730
It sounds easy.

413
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,390
Why don't you film with Bailing?

414
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,660
You two are close.

415
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,420
I'm different from you.

416
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,870
I have enough credits.

417
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,260
I'd rather play games when I have time.

418
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,190
Are you okay?

419
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,370
It's decided then.

420
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,310
Cha.

421
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,130
Show all your life experiences.

422
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,400
Just film your dates with Ye.

423
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,080
Leave it to me.

424
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Didn't you say you have little experience?

425
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,540
I've never seen a pig,
but I've eaten pork.

426
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,570
I've got lots of hidden skills.

427
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,740
At that time,

428
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,160
I'll make you fall for me.

429

[Next Episode Preview]

430
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,130
Have you seen Cha?

431
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:31,980
Where is he?

432
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,250
You seem anxious.

433
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,970
I can't get in touch with him.

434
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,230
Of course I'm worried.

435
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,340
He looks down on you.

436
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,400
I treat you so well.

437
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,920
What more do you want from me?

438
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,760
You keep saying you love Xia Zefang,

439
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,970
but don't you know he's claustrophobic?

440
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,770
Do you want to kill him yourself?

441
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,950
You're fighting Haiyuan for Zefang

442
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,390
just to prove...

443
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,260
I've given you everything.

444
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,440
Let go of me!

445
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,480
Enough!

446
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,990
This time,

447
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,030
he won't come to save you.

448
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,030
Don't hurt Ye Haiyuan.
