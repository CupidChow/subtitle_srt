[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,980
[Episode 8: Was that person really you?]

3
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
Yu Chan.

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,950
Yu Chan.

5
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,600
Why are your eyebrows thicker?

6
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,340
And your nose higher?

7
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,130
Why did you kiss me?

8
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,030
You kissed me first.

9
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,200
That was a misunderstanding.

10
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,200
Explain yourself.

11
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,079
I just had a dream.

12
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,650
I dreamed of my wife.

13
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,870
And you both happen
to have a mole on your face.

14
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,430
I mixed you up for a moment.

15
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,130
You're using me as a stand-in.

16
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,990
No, no.

17
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,090
Honestly,

18
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,270
sometimes I see a red string on my hand.

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,630
And it's tied to yours.

20
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,110
So…

21
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,990
I suspect you're my wife's reincarnation.

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,850
I'm this guy's wife?

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,370
Did you see that red string?

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm confused too.

25
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,290
We're both guys,

26
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,850
how could that be possible?

27
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
So what?

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,060
Possible or not,

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,150
you won't know unless you try.

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,790
When I kissed you just now,

31
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,280
did you feel anything?

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,670
Just now…

33
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,010
I was still half-asleep.

34
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,340
Then now that you're awake.

35
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,070
What do you want?

36
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,380
Kiss you again to find out.

37
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
No way.

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Why not?

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,440
I've been married to a woman.

40
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,860
How could I be with a man?

41
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
That's why we need to try.

42
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,590
No way.

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,540
As long as you feel something, it's fine.

44
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,030
I don't dare.

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm not used to it.

46
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,450
Then why are you so used to
sleeping while holding me?

47
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,790
What if I don't like it?

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
If you don't like it,

49
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,830
I won't force you again.

50
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,160
Didn't you say

51
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,990
we're connected by a red string?

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,000
Aren't you curious

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,030
what that means?

54
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,850
You could have
cleared that stage yesterday.

55
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,250
Why did you call me
in the middle of the night to help you?

56
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,320
Don't ask, you'll be scared.

57
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,909
Or…

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,660
Should I move in and sleep with you?

59
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,350
So yesterday was a rehearsal?

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,130
We haven't even started dating,
and we've already slept together?

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,430
What are you thinking?

62
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,670
That's because…

63
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,310
There was a cockroach on my bed.

64
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,570
I didn't dare sleep alone.

65
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,630
That's easy to fix.

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,620
I'll go to your room later

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,350
and kill the cockroach for you.

68
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,040
Forget it if you don't want.
I'll find someone else.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,970
You can't sleep with someone else.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,700
Chen Qiansui,
you just can't sleep with someone else.

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,800
Did you hear me?

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,970
See, I'm this close to you,

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,730
and you're not pushing me away.

74
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,550
How can we bravely try?

75
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,270
Then try bravely just once.

76
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,750
How can we bravely
try something like this?

77
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,790
Try what bravely?

78
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,920
Try what bravely?

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,310
Swimming.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Bravely try swimming.

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,870
Wait.

82
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,790
Say that again.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,070
I want to record it.

84
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,380
Come on.

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,710
I will bravely try swimming.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,670
If it's mine, it's mine.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's see how long you can dodge.

88
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,820
Off to swim.

89
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,930
Qiansui, save me.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,220
I'm not going to swim.

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,290
You already promised me.

92
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,760
-Let's go to the pool.
-Let go.

93
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,930
Come on, hurry.

94
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,030
I can't swim.

95
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,960
You can swim.

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,260
Let go, let go.

97
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't squat down, come on.

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's go.

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,550
Help!

100
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,640
Come on, hurry.

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,780
Let me go.

102
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,540
Xia Zefang.

103
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,110
Xia Zefang.

104
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,590
Come here a second.

105
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,680
The teacher's calling me.

106
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,370
Sir, this way please.

107
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,260
Finally caught him.

108
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,830
Forced fruit isn't sweet.

109
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,560
Wait until he figures it out himself,
he'll come.

110
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,640
Last time you told me not to worry,

111
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,840
and you volunteered to learn.

112
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,470
I thought you'd be a natural.

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,470
Couldn't you tell I was joking?

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,670
I take everything you say seriously.

115
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,130
Come on.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
I don't want to.

117
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,790
Hurry.

118
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,880
Don't squat like him.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,980
Move faster.

120
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,460
You said it yourself last time.

121
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,570
Come on, let's go.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,860
At worst, you can do it.

123
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,720
Rare to see you so down.

124
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,740
Did your Ye ignore you?

125
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,580
How could he ignore me?

126
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,540
He's just afraid
that after seeing my grades,

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,770
he'll want to dump me.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,090
No way.

129
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,690
I think you two

130
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,920
are fated.

131
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
You can see it?

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,350
See what?

133
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,090
See your Ye coming back.

134
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,570
Do you believe in lovers from a past life?

135
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,870
Why not?

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,740
If you find them,

137
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,220
shouldn't you hold on?

138
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,490
But…

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
What if you've got the wrong person?

140
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,049
What if I miss them?

141
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,850
Missing them is better
than never experiencing it.

142
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,790
So much food...

143
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,760
How much for one bowl?

144
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,080
No idea.

145
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,860
A customer gave it to me.

146
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,740
A female customer?

147
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,640
Up to no good?

148
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,740
Giving young men

149
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
oysters at night.

150
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,420
Too bad…

151
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,030
I don't eat shellfish.

152
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,410
You finish it.

153
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,330
Next time don't bring back
late-night snacks.

154
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,460
They'll make me fat.

155
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,340
Maybe because Xia Zefang keeps swimming.

156
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,510
But you don't.

157
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,870
Then why's your body so good

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
if you don't swim?

159
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,880
Don't run off every time you grope me.

160
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,640
Why's your heart beating so fast?

161
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,260
Qiansui's not coming back tonight.

162
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,460
I'll sleep in his bed.

163
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,620
Finally no more floor mattress.

164
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,950
Nervous?

165
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,390
It's not like
we haven't been alone before.

166
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,890
Or…

167
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,610
Do you feel different about me?

168
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,980
I haven't showered yet.

169
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,170
I'll go shower.

170
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,270
Why is your face so red?

171
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,610
Must be from that bowl
of oysters just now.

172
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,080
Just youthful energy and a healthy body.

173
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Healthy body.

174
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,990
What do you think I'm going to do?

175
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,330
You're so close,

176
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,380
like you're about to kiss me.

177
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,440
You want it?

178
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,050
Since you saw the red string,

179
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,500
and someone at the temple
was promoting it today,

180
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,360
I happened to have it
blessed in the temple fire

181
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,240
for safety.

182
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,740
Then…

183
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,520
Why do you have one too?

184
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Can't I have protection?

185
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,840
Sure…

186
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,820
But I'm afraid people
will misunderstand us.

187
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:12,860
What,

188
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,090
is that not okay?

189
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,660
Didn't you say we're tied by a red string?

190
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,850
Wouldn't blocking your admirers
be a good thing?

191
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Then give it back.

192
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,370
Once given, it's given.

193
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,830
Why would you take it back?

194
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,460
I just don't want people
saying bad things about you.

195
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,680
If it's you,

196
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,970
then who cares if they talk?

197
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,050
Why are you so good to me?

198
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,210
I told you,

199
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,220
because it's you.

200
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,770
Come down and swim.

201
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,500
I don't want to.

202
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,440
Please.

203
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,470
No.

204
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,540
Come swim.

205
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,480
Come on, you're already in swim trunks.

206
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,510
You forced me into them.

207
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,810
I think you need to be braver.

208
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,510
Braver.

209
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,410
I'll be with you.

210
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,050
Come on.

211
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,480
Go be brave yourself. Why pull me in?

212
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,520
I want to swim with you.

213
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,260
That hurts.

214
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,110
Are you okay?

215
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,500
Easy for you to say.
You can do it, of course it's easy.

216
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm here.

217
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,890
I think you need to be braver.

218
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,900
With you here, I still choked last time.

219
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,200
I drank the whole pool.

220
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,280
You still remember something
from junior high school?

221
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,000
What else?

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
You always force me like this.

223
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,650
You only choked on one mouthful.

224
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,870
And you let go yourself.

225
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,340
No way, you let go.

226
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,540
You let go. How could I have let go?

227
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,200
The pool's completely empty.

228
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,900
Xia Zefang's here.

229
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,280
It's not open on weekends.

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,620
But I made an exception for Qiansui.

231
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,380
For me?

232
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,320
You're waiting for Xia Zefang, aren't you?

233
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,530
Are you hungry?

234
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,690
I'll make you instant noodles.

235
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,650
So you came anyway.

236
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,190
Didn't you say you're scared to swim?

237
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,950
When I was a kid,

238
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,140
someone drowned in front of me.

239
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,120
I tried to save him,

240
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,290
but I almost...

241
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,220
In the end,

242
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,430
we didn't save him.

243
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,620
Ever since, I've been afraid of water.

244
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,800
Now I just take baths at most.

245
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,170
Right now, this body is Xia Zefang's,

246
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,900
but the soul is Xia Cha.

247
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,910
If Xia Zefang comes back for his body,

248
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,180
who could win?

249
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,810
Why fight over it?

250
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,380
Just give it back.

251
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,070
If it were me,

252
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,780
I'd feel it was such a waste.

253
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,520
If Zefang comes back,

254
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,560
treat him well.

255
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
People probably want you back more.

256
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,300
After all,

257
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,060
the current Xia Zefang

258
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,520
is much cuter than before.

259
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,860
Zefang wasn't that bad, was he?

260
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
Wait.

261
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,240
Now the only people

262
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,570
in the world who think

263
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,260
Xia Zefang's a good guy
are you and Guan Riqing.

264
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,870
Come on, lower your body.

265
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,660
Let's push down.

266
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,620
Yes, yes, twist your waist.

267
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,790
Body sideways a bit.

268
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,690
Yes, sideways.

269
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,760
Good, arms straight.

270
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,560
Stretch.

271
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,700
Like this?

272
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,800
Didn't expect you
to forget even the basic warm-up.

273
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
No wonder you said you couldn't swim.

274
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,230
I thought you were making excuses.

275
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,110
So don't expect too much

276
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,610
from how well I'll swim.

277
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,410
Why do Qiansui and Haiyuan call you Cha?

278
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,020
This time I went back,

279
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,190
because of Grandpa's passing,

280
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,120
to remember him,

281
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,220
I decided to use his name,

282
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,190
a fresh start.

283
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,500
You're really much better than before now.

284
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,350
Was I really that bad before?

285
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,300
Hearing that your Cha's here

286
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,410
made you rush over.

287
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,380
I was nearby.

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,840
So this is what you're like
when you're in love.

289
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,410
I'm not.

290
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,030
The way you look at someone
you like never changes.

291
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,690
Look at how you look at him now.

292
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,210
Bend lower.

293
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,390
Yes, arms like this.

294
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,370
Pull your arms in.

295
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes, hold your arms.

296
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,180
Hold arms?

297
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,319
You should see how you look at him.

298
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,079
I'm afraid you'll hit him.

299
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,650
You should be honest, too.

300
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,050
Watch out or he'll get stolen away.

301
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,390
Zefang,

302
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,069
I was afraid of water.

303
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,380
But you're not.

304
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,810
This is your body.

305
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,370
When I let go later,

306
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,780
you have to hold on.

307
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,000
Chen Qiansui,

308
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,810
if Xia Zefang can, you can too.

309
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,390
Come on in.

310
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,960
I don't want to.

311
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,580
Your swim team isn't short on new members.

312
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,410
Hurry.

313
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,240
What are you doing?

314
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,930
Still running? Get back here.

315
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Attacking me?

316
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,900
Did you see that just now?

317
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,860
I can swim.

318
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,740
I can swim!

319
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,670
Let's go eat.

320
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,430
But I want to swim a bit more.

321
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,640
You haven't swum in so long,

322
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
and you just hit the back of your head.

323
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,000
That's enough for today.

324
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,680
I'll take you somewhere delicious, okay?

325
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,270
Okay.

326
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,220
Then wait for me.

327
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,250
Wait for me.

328
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,950
Ye Haiyuan.

329
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,430
That tickles!

330
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
Let me rinse off first, okay?

331
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,080
Ye Haiyuan, what are you doing?

332
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
Stop hitting him!

333
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,450
Jiang Bailing, Chen Qiansui!

334
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,430
Stop hitting him.

335
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,350
You're not a fighting dog.

336
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,860
What's wrong?

337
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,740
Ye Haiyuan.

338
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,210
What?

339
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,380
Haiyuan!

340
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,880
Ye Haiyuan!

341
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,360
Ye Haiyuan!

342
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,680
Come here.

343
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,090
Can you stop being so childish?

344
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,260
Hitting without asking,

345
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,190
then turning away?

346
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,260
He's more mature?

347
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,760
Then go to him.

348
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,110
Ye Haiyuan.

349
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,160
Are you crazy?

350
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,980
Yes.

351
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,320
The crazy one is me.

352
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,600
I thought I mattered to you.

353
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,890
And?

354
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,950
And what?

355
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,330
What did you see?

356
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,650
I had soap all over my head.

357
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,140
I couldn't see who it was.

358
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,790
You couldn’t even see,
and you were still that passionate?

359
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,630
Or maybe…

360
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,850
This body likes him more.

361
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,650
Why are you saying things so nasty?

362
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,120
I thought it was you.

363
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,200
There was no one else in the pool.

364
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,530
Who else would do that

365
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,330
to me there?

366
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,520
How do I know it was Guan Riqing?

367
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
How can you not tell the difference?

368
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,230
Or…

369
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,900
Are we not close enough for you to tell?

370
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,120
How are you
any different from Guan Riqing?

371
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,630
Just because you know my secret

372
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,060
doesn't mean
you can treat me however you want.

373
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,460
I don't want to argue with you now.

374
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,750
Let's cool off for a while.

375
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,410
[Got the question wrong,
wrote the wrong answer, not my intention.]

376
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,630
[Can you not be so mad?]

377
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Sir, I'm really happy to see you.

378
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,090
Wait, wait.

379
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,660
I've never seen the teacher

380
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,120
so popular with students.

381
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,950
Sir, any instructions?

382
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,400
One good news,

383
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,330
one bad news.

384
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,430
Congratulations,

385
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,340
you won an award for calligraphy.

386
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,590
That's great!

387
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,630
I didn't expect it.

388
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,130
And one bad news.

389
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,850
You didn't do

390
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,000
very well this time.

391
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,910
Looks like you'll need
to win lots more awards.

392
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,420
Weren't you just with Bailing?

393
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,400
Swimming.

394
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,650
Swimming's a popular

395
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,190
extra credit item lately.

396
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Isn't that just what you're good at?

397
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,340
Since hitting my head,

398
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,660
I can't anymore.

399
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,520
Xia Zefang,

400
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,470
it's like riding a bike.

401
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,780
If you don't ride for a long time,
you'll be scared.

402
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,680
But our bodies have memory.

403
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,490
[Next Episode Preview]

404
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,860
You're still mad?

405
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,700
Quit acting pitiful.

406
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,190
If you're a man,

407
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,690
show your true heart.

408
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,400
Just let me hold you, that's all.

409
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,270
So it's true

410
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,040
that love really changes people.

411
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,300
Who said we're in love?

412
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,340
You're not?

413
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,880
You two even sleep hugging each other.

414
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,380
Haiyuan's mine.

415
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,490
Do you dare?

416
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,880
Loser has to do

417
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,210
whatever the winner says.

418
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,850
Bet's on.

419
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,650
Who's afraid?

420
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,320
What do I do?

421
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,040
I think…

422
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,690
I like you too much.
