[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,989
[Episode 12]
[It's You, Just You, Only You]

3
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,390
[That would be good.]

4
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,650
[Zefang can come back.]

5
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,950
[Ye Haiyuan,]

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,950
[take good care of Zefang.]

7
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,660
Xia Cha!

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,520
Cha!

9
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,920
Grandpa.

10
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,500
Zefang.

11
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,740
Why are you still here?

12
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,010
Go back now.

13
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,530
Go back to your body.

14
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,650
Xia Cha!

15
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,890
Xia Cha, get up!

16
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,280
Cha!

17
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,230
Cha, wake up!

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,800
Cha!

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,120
Don't you dare leave me!

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,060
Grandpa, you were so easily fooled.

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,930
I connected the red thread
from Haiyuan to Riqing,

22
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,330
and you even believed it.

23
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,180
Cha!

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,480
Wake up!

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
[The red thread in your hand]

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,800
[has always been connected to Haiyuan.]

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
[After all that has happened...]

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,970
Cha!

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,300
[He's still found you.]

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,250
[After I give you my body,]

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,350
[take care of it.]

32
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,120
Cha!

33
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,240
Cha, wake up!

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,840
Cha!

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,600
[Goodbye,]

36
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,640
[Grandpa.]

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,579
[In this life,]

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,650
[you can start all over again,]

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
[carrying my happiness]

40
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,910
[with you.]

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,490
Cha!

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,090
Cha!

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,170
Cha, get up!

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,410
Cha!

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,290
Get up!

46
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,310
Ye Haiyuan!

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,430
Xia Cha.

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,340
How could you jump down like this?

49
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,080
It's okay.

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,030
I'm fine now.

51
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,670
Xia Cha.

52
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,160
No matter what happens,

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,910
you can't leave before me.

54
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,690
So domineering.

55
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,970
What gives you the right?

56
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,860
Because I

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,770
can't live without you.

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,270
Luckily, he's fine.

59
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,190
Cha had a fight with Haiyuan.

60
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,900
Why would he fall on purpose?

61
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,120
Let me ask you.

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,680
If one day,

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
my body is occupied by another soul,

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,670
will you continue to like me?

65
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,150
Why?

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,910
I mean, there could be an accident.

67
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,400
Like one day, out of the blue,
there's a thunderbolt,

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
and then our souls swap.

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,650
What do you mean?

70
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,740
I mean,

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,720
if one day...

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,519
Chen Qiansui!

73
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,920
If that day comes,

74
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,770
I'll be the first one to come.

75
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,420
I'll be the one who never leaves you.

76
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,700
So don't act like you're running away.

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,030
Since you've decided to be with me,

78
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,230
you shouldn't take it lightly.

79
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,970
I didn't.

80
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,800
Don't smile!

81
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,870
Even though your smile is beautiful,

82
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,540
I must let you know

83
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,070
how I feel properly today.

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,070
Since junior high school,

85
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,409
I've been the one who never gave up.

86
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,280
Every day from today on

87
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
will be the same as this, too.

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,010
I've spent my most vibrant years of youth

89
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,850
with you.

90
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,000
You have to take responsibility.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
What if I regret it

92
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,610
and don't want to take responsibility?

93
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,320
How can you regret it?

94
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
You can't regret it.

95
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,860
You've promised me.

96
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,800
Jiang Bailing.

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,100
Now that I've stuck with you,

98
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,560
you can't get away either.

99
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,850
I've never thought of getting away.

100
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,900
My name has "Bai" (100),
and your name has "Qian" (1,000).

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,010
Although your number is bigger than mine,

102
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,610
my love for you
is surely more than yours for me.

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
Let me carry you. Come on.

104
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,370
Keep kissing me like this,

105
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,740
until the end of the world!

106
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,150
You're not allowed to swim anymore.

107
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,430
What if we go together?

108
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,800
Will it be fine then?

109
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,640
Fine?

110
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,110
What if I hadn't seen you?

111
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,130
What if I hadn't had time to save you?

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,740
You have no idea
how scared I was just now!

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
When you laid there,

114
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,050
you seemed dead.

115
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,640
You didn't answer when I called your name.

116
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,540
If something

117
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,520
had happened to you,

118
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,710
I must catch Xia Zefang and...

119
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,010
Don't be angry.

120
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,360
Don't blame Zefang.

121
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,810
Blame me if you must.

122
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,500
I spoiled him when he was young.

123
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,260
I gave him whatever he wanted.

124
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,660
But I forgot to teach him.

125
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,040
Actually, he regretted it too.

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,580
He was so sad to hear that

127
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,450
so many people blamed him

128
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,810
and didn't like him.

129
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,350
On the contrary,

130
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,770
we should thank him

131
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,480
for letting us meet each other.

132
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,860
From now on,

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,470
don't take it off again.

134
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
It's just a string.

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
What if it snaps?

136
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,180
If it snaps,

137
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,110
I'll braid a new one for you.

138
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,990
I always think

139
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,430
the one who leaves first is happier.

140
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,830
Because leaving is a relief,

141
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,620
and those who stay need to face regrets.

142
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,310
But for you,

143
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,180
I will try my best

144
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,580
to be the last person to leave.

145
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,230
Riqing.

146
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,590
I find

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,390
we are really alike.

148
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,030
You lack love.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,230
I crave love.

150
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,210
But we pursued it

151
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,660
in the wrong way.

152
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,550
It seemed that we would find peace

153
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,110
only if the world felt sorry for us.

154
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,940
I'm really leaving.

155
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,210
Thank you.

156
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,430
Though,

157
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,890
our relationship was so dramatic.

158
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,680
You'll meet someone
who really treats you well.

159
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,630
By then,

160
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,800
be good to him.

161
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,060
Guan Riqing.

162
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,570
Bye.

163
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,690
Zefang.

164
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,160
Xia Zefang.

165
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,760
Zefang.

166
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,530
I forgot to say

167
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,660
that I really...

168
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,670
I really like you.

169
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,800
I really...

170
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,220
Really like you.

171
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,060
You came back from working out
so early today.

172
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,540
Why do you take so much luggage back home
for the holiday?

173
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,050
I'm going abroad

174
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
after this summer vacation.

175
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,400
Have some breakfast before you go.

176
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,080
Why do you want to go abroad?

177
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,500
I'll have to take over the family business
eventually.

178
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I have to catch up with the progress.

179
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,240
Where are you going?

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
How long will you stay there?

181
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,010
When will you come back?

182
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,770
Just take care of yourself.

183
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
You talk too much.

184
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,370
I'm not talking too much.

185
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm just concerned about him.

186
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,460
I'm about to leave.

187
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,180
Take care.

188
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,040
Bye.

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,810
The car hasn't arrived yet?

190
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,590
The car is lost.

191
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,060
You should go.

192
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,790
If I don't help put your luggage
in the car,

193
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,990
Cha will nag about it.

194
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Well...

195
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,810
You go first.

196
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,340
Forget about the complex relationship
between us.

197
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,570
It seems

198
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,470
we were too childish.

199
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,660
You were childish.

200
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,040
You started it all.

201
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,070
Yes, I was too childish, alright?

202
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,960
Anyway, for some things,

203
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,930
it's already too late to regret.

204
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,900
Xia Zefang

205
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,530
has really gone, right?

206
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,970
I missed it.

207
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,170
You got it.

208
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,350
This kind of fate

209
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,230
is rare.

210
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,960
I hope

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,260
you two are doing well.

212
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,190
Don't worry.

213
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,050
We'll be fine.

214
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,480
Don't embarrass yourself

215
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,610
after you go abroad.

216
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,280
Be mature, okay?

217
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,130
It tickles.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,860
Did you miss me?

219
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,280
Miss you?

220
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,750
It's only been a few hours.

221
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,000
Only?

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,100
I've been waiting for you for so long.

223
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,230
Wait.

224
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,450
I have a gift for you.

225
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,320
What is it?

226
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,750
This thing

227
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,350
stores your past.

228
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,940
Although I was not

229
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,160
in those memories,

230
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,480
I'll keep them

231
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,080
for you.

232
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,550
I'm sorry.

233
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,820
I broke it.

234
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
I've tried my best to restore it.

235
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,730
Of course,

236
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,020
I guess my hands
just aren't skillful enough.

237
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
You're so clumsy.

238
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,280
You got hurt
even when you stuck the pieces together.

239
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,890
I don't know if there's a past life,

240
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,230
but in this life,

241
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,500
let's grow old together.

242
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,060
[Champion Xia Zefang]
[Champion Jiang Bailing]

243
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,540
[Two years later]

244
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,170
This one?

245
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,650
This suit is so expensive.

246
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,540
Is Haru really giving it to us?

247
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,970
Yes.

248
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,790
That's right.

249
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,690
I finally understand

250
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,990
why people like men in suits.

251
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,930
Because they look handsome in them.

252
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,760
Because I want

253
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,730
to take them off one by one.

254
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,510
Someone's here.

255
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,880
Hi.

256
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,150
Hi.

257
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,020
Where are they?

258
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm already here.

259
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,810
Am I wearing the wrong one?

260
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,010
Isn't it a suit party?

261
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,370
Where's your tie?

262
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,250
I couldn't find it before I went out.

263
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,290
Is it with you?

264
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,420
It shouldn't be that strict for a party
with our own people, right?

265
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,220
Or should I go to your room and find one?

266
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,110
Why are you wearing this for work?

267
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,080
Why should I wear a suit
when I work as a physiotherapist?

268
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,870
And you gave me this.

269
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,370
So handsome,

270
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,400
Qiansui.

271
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,040
I wonder

272
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,970
who was so late.

273
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,100
What were you doing?

274
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,440
None of your business.

275
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,000
Alright, alright.

276
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,110
Happy graduation

277
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,770
to three of you!

278
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,690
It's four.

279
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,060
Happy graduation.

280
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,950
What does our graduation
have to do with you?

281
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,840
Why are you so stingy?

282
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,180
At the very least, I'm a new grad.

283
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,820
Why?

284
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,080
Are you afraid that I'm so excellent

285
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,580
that you're no match for me?

286
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,010
Stop arguing.

287
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,080
I'll ship you two together
if you keep arguing.

288
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,750
Okay.

289
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,650
Since incestuous shipping is so popular
these days,

290
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,050
I'll go after my brother.

291
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,060
Haru and the others
will be late getting here.

292
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,630
They've gone to register

293
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,890
so far this afternoon.

294
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,980
Register for what?

295
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,080
Marriage.

296
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,620
Then we can also...

297
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,240
Happy graduation!

298
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,930
Classmates, happy graduation!

299
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,990
Happy graduation!

300
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,700
Come on, look at me.

301
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,210
Say something.

302
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,510
It's a good thing we found each other,

303
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,100
keeping our unfinished fate going.

304
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,340
It's not that it won't come.

305
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,290
It's just that the time isn't right yet.

306
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,260
Wait patiently.

307
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,630
-In this life.
-In this life

308
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,590
-The next.
-The next.

309
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,250
-And the one after that.
-And the one after that.

310
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,760
Life is wonderful.

311
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
You always meet the right person

312
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,120
at the right time,

313
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,560
who is gonna save you

314
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,490
and protect you.

315
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,470
When you turn around, you'll find

316
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,940
the one who doesn't want anything from you

317
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,600
and stays by your side quietly

318
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,580
can't be lost.

319
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,180
We will meet, right?

320
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,950
Before we meet,

321
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,350
we have to be fine

322
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,680
for that day to come.

323
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,180
[Thank God for letting us meet
after I start all over.]

324
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,970
[I believe we'll meet again
in three lifetimes.]

325
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,200
[Let's walk together into the future.]

326
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,800
I'll give you five seconds,
then I'll start.

327
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,810
I'll be faster than you later.

328
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,500
If you plan to play any tricks,

329
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,610
just be careful.

330
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,560
Start!

331
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,010
In this life,

332
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,110
I found my feelings for you

333
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,050
too late,

334
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,110
but I don't love you any less
than you love me.

335
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,900
Although I'm older than you,

336
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,340
we are the same

337
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,310
in terms of a romantic relationship.

338
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,150
So,

339
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,920
Haiyuan,

340
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,510
have a little more faith in me

341
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,640
and be patient.

342
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,440
I've set my mind

343
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,110
on you.

344
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,510
Don't go back on your word.

345
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,690
I told you

346
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,350
I'm as devoted as you.

347
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,990
If there's a past life,

348
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,480
I must have spent much more time
waiting for you than you did.
