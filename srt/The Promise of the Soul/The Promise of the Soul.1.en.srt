[Episode 1: The ninth hurdle in life]

3
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,250
Help me ask for maternity leave.

4
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,450
You ask for maternity leave?

5
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,250
Will the professor accept that reason?

6
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,800
My mom is going to give birth.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,470
Your mom?

8
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,970
If the professor doesn't believe me,

9
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,370
there’s nothing I can do.

10
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,789
How long are you off for?

11
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,110
I’ll see how things are at home.

12
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,970
I’m hanging up.

13
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,980
The chirping of cicadas.

14
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,910
Why are they so loud all of a sudden?

15
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,180
Haiyuan.

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,690
You've grown so tall.

17
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,620
Came back to see your sister?

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,360
Hurry up. Your mom
has been waiting for you.

19
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm Grandpa Xia Cha. I live downstairs.

20
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,440
Didn’t your mom tell you?

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,240
She's alone.

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
I’m alone.

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,220
So we spend time

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,070
and go lots of places together.

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,280
You and my mom are together?

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,889
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,330
I'm a grandpa.
I don't date anyone casually.

28
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,790
Alright, go back now.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,500
You don’t come back often.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,450
Stop talking nonsense.

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,450
You don't even know what’s going on.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,280
What is this?

33
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,310
A tonic.

34
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,620
I heard it’s good for recovery
after childbirth.

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,030
No need.

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,360
Grandpa Xia from downstairs

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,290
is taking good care of

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,400
confinement meals.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,460
Don't worry.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,700
Why is he so nice to you?

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,480
He was the first person I met
when I came to Hong Kong.

42
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,300
He took very special care of me.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
So we are like a family.

44
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,610
You have
a very broad definition of family.

45
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,710
Grandpa Xia is very pitiful.

46
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,770
His wife died early.

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,150
Then his son and
daughter-in-law passed away.

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,630
He only has one grandson.

49
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,300
He didn't come back to see him all year.

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,420
Funny how things work out.

51
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,470
You and his grandson

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,230
both grew up in Hong Kong.

53
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,230
And you seem to be in the same school.

54
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,579
Drink this.

55
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,660
Must I?

56
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,670
It’s so bitter.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,030
I'll drink it later.

58
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,930
Don’t go around
with that grumpy face all day,

59
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,950
like someone owes you something.

60
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,660
But he owes you.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,360
He is your father.

62
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,840
I’ve told you before.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,490
I did it willingly. No one owes anyone.

64
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,110
I don't understand.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,310
It’s not like no one wouldn’t marry you.

66
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,250
You gave birth to me when you were young.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,310
What's the use of hiding in Hong Kong?

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,390
You came back,
and still ended up with him.

69
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,410
You’re not even that young anymore.

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,830
I just used his sperms

71
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,960
to have you and your sister.

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,430
Right?

73
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,720
I raised you up

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,400
with his money.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't think
I've been taken advantage of.

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,010
Take this red envelope

77
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,140
to Grandpa Xia downstairs

78
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
and thank him properly.

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,280
I put it here.

80
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,990
Good boy.

81
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,600
Why are you here?

82
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,070
I brought your mother's confinement meal
for my grandpa.

83
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,130
Your grandpa?

84
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,240
Yes.

85
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,400
The Xia family downstairs.

86
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,900
You're his grandson?

87
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,400
You don't remember?

88
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,610
I didn't see you when I came back.

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,170
I only found out we were neighbors

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,570
when my grandpa told me.

91
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,400
In the future,

92
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,510
we can come back together.

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,150
No need.

94
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,130
Thank Grandpa Xia Cha for me.

95
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,720
Here’s the money for the ingredients.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
You can leave now.

97
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,160
We can give it to him together.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,690
I’ve got things to do.

99
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,550
Suit yourself.

100
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,830
This is your dad.

101
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,550
Happy birthday.

102
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,020
Here’s a gift for you.

103
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,150
And this is from your brother.

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,590
Take it away. I don't want it.

105
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,880
I don't have a father,

106
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,610
nor a brother.

107
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,159
Haiyuan,

108
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,510
you’re going to have a little sister.

109
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,230
Do you really have to be
such a responsible mistress?

110
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,960
Why won’t he divorce
and give you a proper status?

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,360
Where is my soup?

112
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,300
Zefang,

113
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,990
did you see my soup?

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,300
Xia Zefang.

115
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,940
Didn’t he just come back?

116
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,420
Now both he and the soup are gone.

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,900
Not here.

118
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,780
What are you doing in my bed?

119
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,390
Let's talk.

120
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,140
There’s nothing to talk about.

121
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,700
Then we'll let actions speak.

122
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,720
Xia Zefang!

123
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,920
Let go of me!

124
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,450
I’ve liked you for a long time.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,980
But I don't like you.

126
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,810
Feelings can grow over time.

127
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,250
Just give me a chance.

128
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,150
I’ve already gone this far.

129
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,409
You still don't want me?

130
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,450
Lower your voice.

131
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,630
My mom is sleeping.

132
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,590
Do you really look down on me?

133
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,010
You don’t like me?

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,940
You really think we can't be together?

135
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,540
Aren’t you with Guan Riqing?

136
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,660
Only because you ignored me.

137
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,820
I bought you breakfast every day.

138
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,400
Your clothes were torn.

139
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,730
I gave you a new one.

140
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,130
I was the one
who gave you the umbrella on a rainy day.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,310
I did everything.

142
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,230
Why can’t we be together?

143
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,180
Because I'm not interested in you.

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,750
You don't have a boyfriend either.

145
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,710
We can have a try.

146
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,970
Xia Zefang!

147
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,230
Behave yourself!

148
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,460
I know.

149
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,580
Because I'm a guy.

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,930
If I were a girl,

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,220
would it be different?

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,250
You’re just not a girl.

153
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,000
Ye Haiyuan!

154
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,770
I don’t care what video you’re watching

155
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,170
or who you’re talking to.

156
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,490
Lower your voice!

157
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,020
Zefang, your home is here.

158
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,900
Why don't you go home?

159
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,990
I'm not going home!

160
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,710
Zefang, what's wrong?

161
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,180
Why are you crying like this?

162
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,350
Leave me alone!

163
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,260
Tell me.

164
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,500
I'll help you.

165
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,680
OK.

166
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,510
Turn me into a girl.

167
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,000
You're a guy. How could you become a girl?

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,490
Do a sex reassignment surgery!

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,530
Give me money.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
I’ll go snip my penis off.

171
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,120
You can't have children after you do that.

172
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,040
I don’t care.

173
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,040
I was just lying there,

174
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,710
and he didn’t even give me a second look.

175
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,050
You were lying there and he...

176
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,220
Zefang.

177
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,390
Zefang is the prettiest, right?

178
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,650
How can he be disdainful?

179
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,050
Tell me. I'll go find him.

180
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,780
Who is it?

181
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
Ye Haiyuan upstairs.

182
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,430
Ye Haiyuan upstairs?

183
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll go find him.

184
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,790
Ye Haiyuan.

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,540
Ye Haiyuan?

186
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,540
Zefang.

187
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,730
Ye Haiyuan is a guy.

188
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,550
So what?

189
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,540
Two guys can’t be together?

190
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,680
Then I’ll become a girl!

191
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,000
But you were born with a penis...

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Then I’ll just go die.

193
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
No one cares about me anyway.

194
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,090
Zefang.

195
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Zefang.

196
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,780
Grandpa!

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,100
When I was 10,

198
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,580
young master died trying to

199
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,130
catch a cicada for me.

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,510
When I was 20,

201
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,290
my dad died from

202
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,360
acute hepatitis.

203
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,560
When I was 40,

204
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,630
my wife Yuchan passed from a heart attack.

205
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,630
When I was 60,

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,670
my son and daughter-in-law
died in a car crash.

207
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,830
And now this time,

208
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,050
we two died at once.

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,710
The Xia family line is about to end.

210
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,550
He was always so kind to others.

211
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,860
Why did he suddenly

212
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,530
fall down the stairs and die?

213
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,810
Two at a time.

214
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,370
Mom, stop crying.

215
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,200
It's bad for your eyes.

216
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,370
Listen, there’s no one left
in the Xia family.

217
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,110
You have to help me take care of things.

218
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm here.

219
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,410
Don't worry.

220
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,630
Grandpa,

221
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,660
my mom said this is your favorite flavor.

222
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,480
Everyone will help take care of things.

223
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,720
So don’t worry.

224
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,980
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,690
Why is there a cicada here too?

226
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,790
Why isn’t it chirping now?

227
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,400
Did it die?

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,150
I’m not dead?

229
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,640
So I’m still alive?

230
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,300
Why am I the one lying here?

231
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,260
Where is Zefang?

232
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,730
You scared me.

233
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,270
Why are you standing there in silence?

234
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,770
Are you human?

235
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,550
Maybe I’m not.

236
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,349
But I clearly was dead lying there.

237
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,740
So why am I here?

238
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,480
I must have held my last breath

239
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,050
just to come settle this with you.

240
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,940
Ye Haiyuan,

241
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,720
why don't you want my grandson

242
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,050
and hurt him so badly
that he wanted to die?

243
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,770
Xia Zefang.

244
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,150
What?

245
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm his Grandpa.

246
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,410
What?

247
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,490
You don't dare to recognize me?

248
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,100
If you were Grandpa,

249
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,830
then where’s Xia Zefang?

250
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
He’s still alive?

251
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,130
If he is alive,

252
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,710
then...

253
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,840
I remember

254
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,700
we fell down the stairs.

255
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,960
Then...

256
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,100
we died.

257
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,900
Why am I in Zefang's body?

258
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,610
Zefang, where are you?

259
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,360
Stop staring at me.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,830
I'm really not Xia Zefang.

261
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,540
I’m Grandpa.

262
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,230
Did your stress reaction

263
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,210
make you mentally confused?

264
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,250
You mistook yourself as Grandpa

265
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,980
so that you could
make an excuse to implicate him.

266
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,580
He didn't mean it.

267
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,050
I wanted to pull him

268
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,150
and fell down together.

269
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,540
So what did he say to make you fight?

270
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,280
Don’t get me started.

271
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,800
Tell me, what’s wrong with Zefang?

272
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,430
Why did you hate him so much?

273
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,160
I don’t like girls.

274
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,510
Perfect then.

275
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,940
But he wanted to be a girl.

276
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
What are you doing?

277
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,010
I'll check if his penis is fine and

278
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,940
the reason he wanted to snip it off.

279
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,040
What now?

280
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,810
I need to go home.

281
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,090
Come on,

282
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,050
go with me.

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,170
Hurry up.

284
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,930
Zefang,

285
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,350
stay here and wait for me.

286
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,610
Let’s see if there’s a way to switch back.

287
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,530
Where are you going?

288
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,170
Aren't we going home?

289
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Yes.

290
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,060
Let's go then.

291
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,050
You ride a bike?

292
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,310
Yes.

293
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,810
Why didn't you tell me?

294
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
You wanted me to run beside the bike?

295
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,990
Get off.

296
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,120
Hurry.

297
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,820
Get in.

298
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,690
Hurry up. Don't waste our time.

299
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,370
Are you sure you want to give me a ride?

300
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,340
Please.

301
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,030
I helped Huimei get this bike.

302
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,960
I know the way home better than you.

303
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,180
Hold tight. It's safer this way.

304
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,560
So you're really Grandpa?

305
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,820
What else?

306
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,000
You think I’m playing games with you?

307
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,920
What now?

308
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,380
Maybe Zefang is already waiting at home.

309
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,310
Come down.

310
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,400
I don't trust your skills.

311
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,090
You don't trust? Come on.

312
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,040
All the neighborhood kids

313
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,860
love riding with me.

314
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,130
Hold on.

315

[Everyone has a little box

316
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,360
where they keep the memories
they almost forgot. What’s in yours?]

317
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,130
I haven't seen you for a long time.

318
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,220
When you lost your first tooth,

319
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,980
you cried in my arms,

320
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,460
saying you’d never leave Grandpa.

321
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,820
Now I barely see you around.

322
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,510
What are you doing?

323
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,900
[Next Episode Preview]

324
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,780
What if I can't switch back?

325
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,750
Maybe

326
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,250
this is fate.

327
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,910
If you knew how it ended,

328
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,120
would you still agree to Zefang?

329
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,900
No.

330
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,530
You really are a stubborn kid!

331
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,350
After all, what Zefang cared most about

332
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,280
wasn’t anyone else.

333
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,180
It was you.

334
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,580
How's your wound?

335
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,150
Maybe the people who stay

336
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,510
have a special mission.

337

It felt like I was
watching someone’s back,

338
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,830
just watching

339
