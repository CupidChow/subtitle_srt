[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,019
[Episode 3: Young People's World
Is Beyond Expectation]

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,530
Look, young people really can
unleash infinite energy.

4
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,090
How awesome I am!

5
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,350
After some training for physical stamina,

6
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,720
I can surely beat you.

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,420
Let me ask you.

8
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,220
What did Zefang look like in school?

9
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,960
Every time I asked him,

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,050
he told me to leave his matters alone.

11
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,220
Actually, I don't know him well.

12
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,570
Was he annoying?

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,930
Is that why you don't like him?

14
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,000
Feel it yourself.

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,380
How did it feel
to send your own body away?

16
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,400
Were you sad?

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,630
It was like my soul was floating
in the air, watching this happen.

18
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,700
It was so unreal.

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,060
I don't want to do that.

20
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,400
After all, I used the body
for so many years.

21
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,480
If you don't want to trigger discussions,

22
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,120
don't act like a grandpa at school.

23
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,620
What? Why?

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,620
What's wrong with that?
Is it embarrassing?

25
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,480
Do you want our classmates
to treat Xia Zefang as a freak?

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,130
How can a 20-year-old
act like a 70-year-old?

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,620
Not 70 years old.

28
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,580
Just 69.

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,210
I never thought about

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,329
living on campus.

31
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,030
In the past, a work-study program
was a usual thing.

32
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,910
There weren't many things to consider.

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,280
But now I need to
take care of many things.

34
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,770
You're making me nervous.

35
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,650
Take it as a chance to live again.

36
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,250
Maybe it's a gift from God.

37
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,270
I didn't expect you to look cold normally.

38
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,270
Yet you're actually a nice person.

39
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,550
You must be respected by many students.

40
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,240
Fortunately, I met you after I woke up.

41
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,470
Thank you.

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,690
Be careful.

43
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,030
You'd better
add more lower-body exercises.

44
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,780
Huimei said
you should take good care of me.

45
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,690
Don't leave me alone at school.

46
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,530
Alright.

47
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,240
Don't be so close to me.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm not your grandson.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,209
You just promised me,
and now you're leaving.

50
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,860
Your grandma and your parents died early.

51
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,560
Now, you've also left me in the world,
all alone.

52
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,940
I own your body for now.

53
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,940
Take it back anytime you want.

54
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,680
I've lived a long life, after all.

55
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,640
Sorry.

56
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,630
I came up
because I saw the door wasn't closed.

57
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,920
My mom sent me here to ask

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,260
if you need any help.

59
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,460
Come, come here.

60
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,910
This is my wedding photo.

61
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,490
This is Zefang's footprint
recorded after his birth.

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,330
This is a photo taken
when he was one month old.

63
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,670
People seem to lead a busy life.

64
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,250
But after decades,

65
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,520
just a small box
can contain their whole lives.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,650
When I was young,

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,190
my dad left Taiwan to work in Hong Kong.

68
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
His boss's son was the same age as me.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,900
But he was in poor health.

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,120
I didn't dare to play with him
in case something happened.

71
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,660
In the end, he went to the back mountain

72
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,570
just to catch a cicada for me,

73
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,880
and he died.

74
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,970
Then I met a woman I got married to.

75
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,680
She happened to like cicadas too.

76
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,050
To make her happy,

77
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,909
I made cicadas with a carving knife
all by myself.

78
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,930
The day she got the present,
she told me with a smile

79
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,150
that this was the only summer cicada
in the world.

80
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,080
She said it was priceless.

81
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,730
She asked me to take it before her death.

82
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,770
She said she would come back to me.

83
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,330
I used to take each day as it came.

84
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,580
Now I live for Zefang.
I have to take it seriously.

85
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,060
Do you need me to help pack up?

86
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,520
No, I can do it myself.

87
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,560
Remember to listen to your mom.

88
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,280
Don't ignore me.

89
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,570
Ye Haiyuan!

90
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,420
Ye Haiyuan!

91
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,630
Ye Haiyuan!

92
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,060
Ye Haiyuan, I'm calling you.

93
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,590
Why aren't you responding?

94
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,780
What did you say?

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,400
I kept calling you.

96
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,830
Why did you ignore me?

97
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,440
I can't carry my stuff. Help me.

98
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,150
You're going to school.

99
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,240
Xia Zefang has everything at school.

100
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,049
I'm afraid I can't get used to his things.

101
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,580
I've never lived on campus.

102
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,020
What if I need anything?

103
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,550
Just buy whatever you need.

104
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,120
You young people
just don't care to save money.

105
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,760
It's not easy to make money.
You should save as much as you can.

106
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,560
Let me take this.

107
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,040
Don't think I'm annoying.

108
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,870
They say elders are a family treasure.

109
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,900
You think old men are annoying,

110
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,200
who fail to keep up with the times,

111
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,840
but...

112
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,410
How can you do this to me?

113
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,150
Now you are my peer,

114
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,380
who is even a few months younger than me.

115
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,920
Let's agree on a few things now
to save us from headaches later.

116
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,420
First,

117
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,080
don't keep calling yourself Grandpa.

118
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,800
I don't want to explain it to students
who are curious about you.

119
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,700
Second,

120
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,290
I'm not your grandson.

121
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,100
Don't try to pressure me with any ethics.

122
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,090
Third,

123
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,990
after you get used to this body,

124
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,370
don't stick to me.

125
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,570
I have my own things to do.

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
I just need some time to get used to it.

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
It's only been a week.

128
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
How do you think I should introduce myself

129
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,540
to everyone?

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,060
Whatever you like.

131
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,480
Can I say I've changed my name to Xia Cha?

132
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,220
As long as you like it.

133
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,330
Or can I say I came up with a nickname

134
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,480
to commemorate my grandpa?

135
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,030
Which one do you think is better?

136
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,570
Alright.

137
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,460
I won't raise questions anymore.

138
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,500
You look exactly the same.

139
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,870
Why aren't you that annoying?

140
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,410
Hello.

141
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,680
Hello.

142
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,270
Hello.

143
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,400
Haiyuan! Ye Haiyuan!

144
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,320
Can't you walk on your own?

145
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,910
Why did you ignore me?

146
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,760
What now?

147
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,640
You college students are not friendly.

148
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,190
I greeted them, but they ignored me.

149
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,010
This is not your hometown.

150
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,870
Not everyone can recognize you

151
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,170
or greet you, as if they knew you.

152
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,870
They must know Zefang.

153
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,520
They saw me,

154
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,080
yet they looked away
and pretended to be cold.

155
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,960
Maybe Xia Zefang owes them something.

156
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,670
How could Zefang
possibly owe them anything?

157
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,160
You are weird.

158
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,530
You don't listen to me
even if I've told you.

159
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,170
Feel it yourself later.

160
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,710
You don't make it clear, huh?

161
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,180
I'll ask them myself.

162
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,520
Xia Zefang.

163
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,840
You know my grandson?

164
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,340
Who is your grandson?

165
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,970
Xia Zefang.

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,140
How could someone call himself that?

167
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,220
It's not like that.

168
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,360
After he went back,

169
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,080
his grandpa had an accident,
and he hit his head,

170
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,670
so he might act weirdly.

171
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,780
Hey, what's your name?

172
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,240
Qiansui.

173
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,470
What a special name.

174
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,750
Is your surname Qian?

175
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,970
My surname is Chen.

176
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,440
Do you know me well?

177
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,720
No.

178
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,590
Do you know my Haiyuan well

179
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,370
Your Haiyuan?

180
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,620
[Ye Haiyuan is with Xia Zefang.]
[Guan Riqing will be furious.]

181
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,510
[Xia Zefang's outfit is so dated.]
[They came back together.]

182
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,380
[Ye Haiyuan is helping him
with his luggage.]

183
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,510
Hello, everyone.

184
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,950
Hello.

185
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,720
Hello, guys.

186
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,340
Hello.

187
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,260
It's your room.

188
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,800
We don't live in the same room?

189
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,540
You live with someone else.

190
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,820
But I want to live with you.

191
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,500
I have my own roommate.

192
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,410
Xia Zefang is really good at this.

193
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,510
He hasn't given up
after being rejected so many times.

194
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,040
He's playing with fire,

195
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,500
talking about this at his door.

196
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,030
I think Guan Riqing will explode again.

197
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,390
Besides, his acting has improved.

198
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,480
Acting like
he's the innocent one in a relationship.

199
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,350
"I want to live with you."

200
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,810
Go back to your room.

201
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,730
Which room do you live in?

202
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,690
Room 103.

203
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,640
Why are you following him?

204
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,610
I live with him.

205
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,810
Can we swap rooms?

206
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,850
No.

207
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,099
Why is your place still so messy
even as a grownup?

208
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,960
Would your roommate get used to that?

209
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,070
Zefang.

210
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,750
Were you unhappy at school?

211
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,440
You went out with Xia Zefang?

212
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,420
I told you
I went back to take care of my mom.

213
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,500
He lived next door.

214
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,220
But why do I feel

215
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,720
it's different this time?

216
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
How is it different?

217
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,510
You avoided him
as much as possible before,

218
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,520
but now you're back like buddies.

219
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,340
What is this?

220
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,460
Be careful.

221
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,570
Is it from Xia Zefang?

222
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,370
You don't even want what others give you.

223
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,200
You like this kind of stuff?

224
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,720
Antique... It's expensive.

225
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,490
It belongs to him. He asked me to keep it
in my place in case it breaks.

226
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,700
You helped Xia Zefang with his stuff

227
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,360
because he asked you to keep it
in case it breaks?

228
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,570
Maybe Guan Riqing is back.

229
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,870
I heard that he knew
you two were neighbors in your hometown.

230
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,000
And Xia Zefang even followed you back.

231
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,810
He must be furious now.

232
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,400
Why didn't you tell me
you went back to your hometown?

233
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,730
Hey, calm down.

234
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,710
Don't you just like me doing this?

235
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,780
Wait!

236
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,770
You can't do this to me!

237
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,360
As your boyfriend,

238
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,770
it's normal to do so,
for we haven't seen each other for days.

239
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,860
Boyfriend?

240
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,300
You and Zefang?

241
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,860
Why? Are you playing memory loss?

242
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,620
So romantic.

243
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,480
You even changed your clothes.

244
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,190
Who bought them for you?

245
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,200
Let's sit down and talk.
What do you think?

246
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,290
Sit here.

247
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,240
Here.

248
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Okay. What do you want to talk about?

249
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,820
You may not believe me,

250
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,540
but I'm not Xia Zefang.

251
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,960
I'm his grandpa.

252
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,620
Here's the thing.

253
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,240
We had an accident after we got back.

254
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,900
We both fell to our deaths.

255
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,170
So my soul

256
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,700
is in Zefang's body.

257
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,400
So you mean

258
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,570
you're Zefang's grandpa?

259
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,710
Yes.

260
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,900
And Zefang died?

261
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,150
Yes.

262
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,070
So this is

263
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,570
Zefang's body with his grandpa's soul?

264
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,550
Yes!

265
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,790
You're so smart.

266
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,380
Soul exchange, huh?

267
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,390
Let me see if your body

268
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
remembers me.

269
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,700
How could I possibly remember?

270
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,730
I'm not him!

271
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,970
Forcing me like this

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,260
is a criminal offense!

273
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,330
You're turning your back on me?

274
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,120
You want to break up and go to Ye Haiyuan?

275
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,310
It's none of his business!

276
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,180
I'll scream if you keep doing this!

277
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,200
Scream if you want. No one dares to come.

278
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,920
Help! Help!

279
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,150
Ye Haiyuan, I'm dying!

280
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
Ye Haiyuan!

281
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,740
Let go of me!

282
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,250
Let go of me!

283
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,770
Ye Haiyuan!

284
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,250
Help!

285
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,940
What are you doing here?

286
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,430
Are you okay?

287
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm glad you're finally here.

288
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,180
I'm here.

289
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,340
Xia Zefang, come here.

290
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,970
Show some respect!

291
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,850
He doesn't want it at all.

292
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,490
My stuff...

293
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,770
Xia Zefang!

294
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,700
Guan Riqing forced Xia Zefang,
and Xia Zefang asked for help.

295
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,900
Ye Haiyuan broke the door and saved him.

296
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,820
[I've been waiting for someone
to come back

297
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,810
and take away the only summer cicada
in the world. Could it be you?]

298
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,680
Then I met a woman I got married to.

299
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,210
She happened to like cicadas too.

300
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,070
She took the photo
and asked me to find it for her.

301
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,760
You know, this one is very beautiful.

302
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,560
You can find it only in Taiwan.

303
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,790
Cicadas are so beautiful

304
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,280
that many people use them as specimens.

305
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,880
In the end,
they're on the verge of extinction.

306
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,280
Xia Zefang.

307
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,020
[Next Episode Preview]

308
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,070
That man...

309
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,080
Guan Riqing.

310
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,970
Is he really Zefang's boyfriend?

311
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,710
Come back to me.

312
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,940
I'll buy you whatever you want...

313
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,920
Help me take care of him.

314
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,990
He's not a kid.

315
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,650
What is there to take care of?

316
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,030
Together.

317
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,980
No.

318
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,820
Don't go.

319
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,300
If Zefang has a boyfriend,

320
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
why would he like you?

321
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,970
You're so afraid of Guan Riqing,

322
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,700
but why aren't you afraid of me?

323
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,760
Why did he stand so close to me?
