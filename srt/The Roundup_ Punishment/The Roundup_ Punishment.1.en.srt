Please save me!

Please save me!

4
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,920
Please save me!

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,840
Hey, Jo Seong-jae!

6
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,460
Help me, help me!

7
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,880
Help me, help me!

8
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,380
Please help me

9
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,670
What should I do?

10
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,050
Ha, really...

11
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm sorry

12
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,960
Hey

13
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,960
Did you hide it there?

14
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,460
- What is it, Mr. Lee?
- Hey, catch it, catch it!

15
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,590
IC!

16
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,590
Are you staying still?

17
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,880
Hey, if you move you'll get hurt, you

18
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
It's here

19
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,050
Okay, okay, okay

20
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,170
uh? Why am I not going?

21
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,210
What, Mr. Why
isn't this coming out, Mr.

22
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,170
Turn off the ignition

23
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
- I secured the entrance key
- Okay.

24
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,670
- Did you turn off the water?
- Yes, I locked it.

25
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,590
What about the turtle house?

26
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,380
I confirmed the
location of the toad nest.

27
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,000
Uh, you guys
are doing well out here.

28
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,920
Yes

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,590
- Let's go in
- Yes

30
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,960
- What about the elevator?
- None.

31
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,170
It's the rooftop.

32
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,420
AC

33
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,170
Hyung, this way.

34
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,960
Fish oil, seeds

35
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
Brother, shall we open it first?

36
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,050
- Uh
- Yes

37
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,460
uh

38
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,750
- Now, don't move!
- Stay still! This bastard...

39
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,380
- What is this? What?
- What?

40
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,880
Fuck, put it away, get it away!

41
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,670
- Why is this here?
- Hey, hey, don't move!

42
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,420
Hey, hey!

43
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,130
Open it, you bastard, hurry!

44
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,300
You open it, you fucking bastard.

45
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,750
- Hey, tear it, tear it, tear it
- 'Fuck you, you bastard'?

46
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,880
- Rip it
- Rip it?

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,250
- Hey, hey, hey
- Hey, come to work, you bastard!

48
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,670
Hey, get it and throw it away, you bastard

49
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,250
I need a tool...

50
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,630
Hey, find something to cut.

51
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,210
Hey, hey, come out, come out, come out

52
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,210
Come out and see me

53
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,920
It's done, it's done

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,130
- It's done, it's done
- It's done!

55
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,880
That's enough, that's enough, just
a little more, just a little more

56
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,880
That's right!

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,000
You bastards, come to work!

58
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,090
Hey, catch them all, catch them

59
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,210
- Hey, bathroom, bathroom
- Come back to work, you bastard!

60
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey, hey, you bastard!

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,800
Oh, you bastard!

62
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,920
Come back to work, stay still!

63
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,880
You bastard

64
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,210
Baby, this is

65
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,960
Do you know how dangerous this is?

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,590
Hey, did you catch everything?

67
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,840
Yes, I caught you - Oh

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,170
Eoyu, take a
look at those bastards.

69
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,130
- Hey, even if you look for this, you can find it
- Hey, you bastards, this is it.

70
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,710
Hidden everywhere, huh?

71
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Wow, bro, look at this, this

72
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,920
With this app

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,050
You're buying drugs like
you're selling used goods online.

74
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,250
First, look
for the developer of this.

75
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,670
Yes, I understand

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,670
Order

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,800
Huh? What?

78
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,550
What is this?

79
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,630
What is it?

80
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,500
What is this, did you order rice?

81
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,170
Ah, this is the drug
order that has just come in, this.

82
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,460
Let's clean up here first.

83
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,130
One guy is going up

84
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,920
What is it?

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,750
Why is the door off?

86
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,750
There must be some reason, right?

87
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,630
Hey, don't look at each
other in the eye and stay quiet, okay?

88
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,670
Wow, how many people
used this delivery book?

89
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,420
- This is too much
- Oh, you guys, Mr.

90
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,550
Another person is coming up.

91
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,880
Now, to each position.

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay, come, you
bastards

93
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,250
Eat a lot

94
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,670
- Ah, the meat is delicious
- Yes

95
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,090
- Sister-in-law
- Yes!

96
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,420
Here, please
give us some more meat.

97
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Now, here comes
galmaegisal

98
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,300
Thank you

99
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,590
I know that Detective Ma is
always looking for you on purpose.

100
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,750
Thank you so much

101
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,050
Oh, no, I'm coming
because the meat is delicious.

102
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,670
- It's really delicious
- It's so delicious.

103
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,380
If you need anything
else, please let me know anytime.

104
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,420
Thank you - Yes

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,590
Hey here bro

106
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,130
He died a long time ago
after being stabbed with a sword.

107
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,550
Yes, my sister-in-law
is raising the baby.

108
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm running this restaurant.

109
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,800
Uh, Soyul

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,050
Come to work

111
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,750
wait for a sec

112
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,170
Uh, now, this

113
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,460
Don't tell your mom, just
buy something delicious.

114
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,300
- Thank you
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

115
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,800
- You're good at greeting people
- Oh, you're pretty.

116
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,130
Hey, you guys eat a lot -
Yes, I understand

117
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,750
Oh, what happened
to that developer?

118
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,210
Oh, that's Seongjae Jo.

119
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,420
I immediately picked up the new
item and placed an arrest warrant.

120
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,800
I got a call from you earlier.

121
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,050
He died

122
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,670
He's dead?

123
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,050
Yes, he was found dead
in downtown Philippines.

124
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,460
The body was delivered
to Korea a few days ago.

125
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
What is the cause of death?

126
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,840
The autopsy is tomorrow, so
tsk, something will come out, right?

127
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,420
The autopsy is tomorrow?

128
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Yes

129
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,300
There are signs
of being severely beaten.

130
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,460
I also fractured several of my ribs.

131
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,670
The direct cause of death was a
penetrating wound with a weapon.

132
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,500
This knife pierced the solar
plexus and lodged in the heart above.

133
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,210
So, is there
anything else special?

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,130
Uh, I looked at the old data and

135
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,670
My weight decreased
from 74 to 59 kg.

136
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,750
Well, no drug substances
were detected in the blood.

137
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,800
I suspect that he was
subjected to long-term abuse.

138
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,250
This is not simple robbery and murder.

139
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,670
Are you a detective?

140
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,590
Yes

141
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,840
I am Seongjae's mother.

142
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,750
Ah, yes

143
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,750
Yes

144
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,210
Our Seongjae

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,420
I heard you were wanted.

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,210
What crime have you committed?

147
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,960
After I got a job in the Philippines,
we became less and less in touch.

148
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,630
Suddenly like this...

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,800
Who on
earth killed my child?

150
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,090
Not yet

151
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,460
Oh, we don't know either.

152
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,460
Could it be that Seongjae worked there?

153
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,880
Do you know the company name?

154
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,420
I think he said it was the HB trade...

155
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
We'll do our best to find out

156
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,960
Yes

157
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,670
The task of handing
over the deceased has been completed.

158
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,090
- Then
- Yes.

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,130
Hey there.

160
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,960
Please let Seongjae take a breath.

161
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,920
Seongjae

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,380
Oh my, seniors.

163
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,710
CEO Jang, how are you?

164
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,880
Yes, well

165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,090
Now here's your gift

166
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,550
Key with primary coin address and password

167
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,710
Well, hold on to the wind
once it gets listed.

168
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,630
However

169
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,420
Opening a large cryptocurrency exchange

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,380
I heard it's
as difficult as stock listing.

171
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,840
Can you break through?

172
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,210
How can you break
through it, CEO Go?

173
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,380
We are planning to meet the
last remaining examiner soon.

174
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,050
Don't worry, we will take good care of you
and make sure you don't have any trouble.

175
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,090
So, if the
expert says don't worry, then

176
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,250
do not worry

177
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,550
I'll just go on a cruise for the rest
of my life and go somewhere to fly cuckoo.

178
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,380
Just worry about that

179
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,380
Now

180
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,750
Then it seems like the shares
have all been liquidated.

181
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,250
Anyway, I will just
trust CEO Jang and go.

182
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,500
Since I was young, I
was an IT genius and all.

183
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,210
It'll be worth the name

184
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,380
yes?

185
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,630
That was my nickname.

186
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,800
He's still an IT
genius.

187
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,460
Did you hear
about Jo Seong-jae who ran away?

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,550
Don't think about anything else

189
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,500
Are you here?

190
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,550
The number of members has increased,
but why is the dividend the same?

191
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,250
CEO Jang is not
keeping his promise.

192
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,170
The location of the new
site has been identified.

193
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,670
- Get ready
- Yes.

194
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,840
Yes, I will
pass it on to you that way.

195
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,840
Yes, ah, yes

196
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,130
Bro, bro, wait a minute

197
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,090
Well, I just got a call from
the cyber investigation team.

198
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,590
They say the drug app
distributor has now been caught.

199
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,920
So I don't think it was
distributed by Seongjae Cho?

200
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,050
So, when Seongjae Cho was a
student at engineering college,

201
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,340
It is an application source
created for exchanging reports.

202
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,920
This was open to everyone

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,920
It's open

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,340
Then shouldn't we go there
quickly before it closes?

205
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,590
No, I'm not saying
the store is open.

206
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,420
So there is
such a thing as open source.

207
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,710
So, whoever
develops the software and

208
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,710
This is a program that
allows you to provide again.

209
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,420
No, that doesn't mean it's
not Jo Seong-jae, it's just that

210
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,380
That's right.

211
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,670
I said that
very difficultly.

212
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,630
So, I have just looked
into Seongjae Cho's company.

213
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,170
Well, the phone number is
showing up somewhere else now.

214
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,920
They're all out of business now.

215
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,840
Shall we call Jo Seong-jae's
mother and find out more?

216
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,550
Oh, I'll do it.

217
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,590
Is that so?

218
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,670
- Look after your work
- Yes, yes, I will do that.

219
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,380
Ah, yes

220
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,340
Oh, the guy I saw last time is
Detective Maseok from Gwangsoo University.

221
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,960
Are you Jo Seong-jae's mother?

222
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,130
Where?

223
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,250
Are
you a detective?

224
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
Ah, yes

225
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,880
Since I had no family, I held a
funeral as an unrelated person.

226
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,420
And this

227
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,750
It looks like a will

228
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,800
Uh, Manager Lee

229
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,460
- Proceed with the shutdown
- Yes.

230
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Hey, let's start

231
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,250
Why are you like this?

232
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,460
Why are you like this?

233
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,460
Hey, check it out! Seed

234
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
push

235
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,420
Fuck

236
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,550
Hey, you son of a bitch

237
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,210
Hey, come out quickly!

238
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,340
Hey, you bastards!

239
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,880
Come out, you fucking bastards!

240
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Come out!

241
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,800
Because I'll blow the whole thing up!

242
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Fuck!

243
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,920
Hey!

244
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Please save me.

245
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,880
When Seongjae Cho
worked in the Philippines

246
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
He synced his
account to the cloud

247
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,340
There were some
automatically backed up data.

248
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,250
What?

249
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,670
Ah, when you change
your cell phone, senior.

250
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,630
It's the same thing as syncing.

251
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,130
Oh, I don't change my
cell phone if possible.

252
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,090
You have to save all
your contacts one by one.

253
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,090
When are you going to do all that?

254
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,050
That's
why we synchronize.

255
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,090
Uh, anyways

256
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,210
Well, this is what Seongjae Cho
made in the Philippines, right?

257
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,210
- Yes
- That's right, yeah

258
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,880
But while
I was downloading

259
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,590
Whoever hacked the cloud
deleted all the data.

260
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,550
So we failed to secure
the site address and name.

261
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,460
But hey, I
apologize for what I said.

262
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,710
Wouldn't it be better for the cyber
investigation team to handle this sort of thing?

263
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,420
That's right, that's
right, you're an expert in the field.

264
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,420
It doesn't go well with digital.

265
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,630
We have to do it.
There is a murder case on the line.

266
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,710
Yes

267
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,840
You catch
those who use computers.

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,250
I'm going to catch
the guy behind it.

269
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
- Okay?
- Yes, I understand.

270
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,750
Hey, Taesu, where did you go?
Did you go out to work?

271
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,550
Well, you were there earlier.

272
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,210
- Hyung
- Oh, what a surprise, Mr.

273
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,920
Oh, where do you keep running away?

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, tsk

275
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,750
Did you see the planning investigation proposal?

276
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,420
I didn't see it!

277
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Hey, bring something to show for it.

278
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Why suddenly freeze to death

279
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,380
Is it digital crime investigation?
Digital crime investigation

280
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,380
Ah, I saw it, kid.

281
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,380
Hey, Seokdo.

282
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,000
If you do a digital investigation,
everyone else will swear at you!

283
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,960
Just catch the thugs
like you always do

284
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,840
No, someone died.

285
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
And the detective
said he was going to catch the criminal.

286
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,250
Who says what?

287
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,250
Hey, make a fist

288
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,090
What?

289
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,880
Is this digital?

290
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,050
Does this look digital?

291
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,670
Digital? Really

292
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,960
Do you know what cloud sync is?
Cloud Sync

293
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,630
What?

294
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,800
See, you don't even know that, Mr.

295
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,170
My brother is changing his cell phone.

296
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,880
Then, my classmates
come and do it right away.

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,500
Without even knowing, Mr.

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,090
My classmates came and asked me what?

299
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,380
You bastard, why are you saying such
confusingly ignorant things, Mr. Lee?

300
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,380
Anyway, the initial investigation is over.

301
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,630
All you have to do is start the main game

302
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,340
So, let's just put two
of our cyber kids together.

303
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,630
Let's create a dedicated team

304
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,420
Hey, Seokdo, we can't
handle a case like this!

305
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,550
Brother

306
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,920
I have to catch these bastards

307
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,840
Mistress

308
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,500
Ugh, prostitute.

309
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,670
I've organized it here

310
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,710
Okay, I'll give
the administrator approval.

311
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,920
Hey, how many members are there?

312
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,960
It's 300,000

313
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,500
If you add 100,000 more people,
I will increase your stake by 10%.

314
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,500
Keep your promise this time

315
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,130
Hello?

316
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,750
No, fuck, what's wrong
with phone manners?

317
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,420
Now, now, now, now

318
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,750
We have a new family here, so
let's start by saying hello.

319
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,170
I joined Gwangsu
University this time.

320
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,250
This is Jisoo Han, head of the cyber team.

321
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,250
I look forward to

322
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,920
This is Gangnamsu
of the digital forensics team.

323
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,090
- Oh, yes, welcome
- Namsu, Namsu

324
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,670
- Move on quickly
- Hehe, hey, hey

325
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,840
Still, let me introduce myself.

326
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,960
Well, it would already be awkward
since it was our first meeting.

327
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,340
- We know each other roughly
- I saw you a while ago.

328
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,460
What I'm sharing now is

329
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,670
This is the casino site skin
screen on Seongjae Cho's cloud.

330
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,590
Uh, what kind of organization is this casino?

331
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,750
I think we need to find
out as soon as possible.

332
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,630
But there is not enough information

333
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,590
I guess I'll have to start
again from the beginning

334
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,840
They said the initial investigation was complete.

335
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,800
Brother, the initial investigation is complete.

336
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,710
Oh

337
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,420
Let's start again

338
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,750
What is it?

339
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,880
Now, these bastards who kill
people never end in one go.

340
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,710
We need to catch it quickly
before there are more victims.

341
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes

342
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,340
Senior, please
take a look at this.

343
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
Right?

344
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,710
I think this is right

345
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,500
Oh, that's right

346
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,960
Found it!

347
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,960
Did you find it?

348
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,050
Yes, you can look here.

349
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,460
What is the name of the site?

350
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,960
I will share the address of Emperor
Casino, so please check it out.

351
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,210
You should even try to get an IP

352
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,250
Yes

353
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,920
Hey, this...

354
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
But this is the
recommender's name and ID.

355
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,840
I guess I have to put it
in and it will be approved?

356
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,500
And another problem

357
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,170
Here, the subscription terms and conditions
require pre-deposit of game money.

358
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,630
They said they would complete the registration.

359
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,960
But we haven't received
the processing fee yet...

360
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,420
Oh, progress fee?

361
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,750
I'm good at that

362
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,840
Tae-su
hyung - Oh

363
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,050
Brother, let's go

364
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,630
Where are you going?

365
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,920
Anyway, I have to stay here so my brother
won't understand, let's go quickly.

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,710
- Oh, where are you going?
- Oh, follow me, just

367
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,460
Can I go back up?

368
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,460
I want to go to the field, but
I don't have much opportunity.

369
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,880
Hey, put this kid in a bullet proof suit.

370
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,590
Give me a gun filled with ammunition

371
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,420
- Yes, I understand
- Yes?

372
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,090
That's a lie, follow me

373
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,420
- Hey, come quickly
- Thank you

374
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,550
Oh, huh?

375
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,460
If only I had come a little late.

376
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,500
I almost saw something that I couldn't see!

377
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,460
I'm going crazy, Mr.

378
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,590
What about this store?

379
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,170
Daindy originally agreed
to do business with me.

380
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,500
Why
are you being such a slut?

381
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,340
What do you say?

382
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,800
This area is

383
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,630
It was my area from the beginning.

384
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,300
What
are you fussing about?

385
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,920
You mop-headed bastard!

386
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,840
Aren't you this bastard?

387
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,960
Are you an asshole?

388
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,340
Hey, stop moving!

389
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,590
You bastards, this is

390
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,550
Hey, mister

391
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm busy right now so just go

392
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,710
You bastard!

393
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,210
I.C.

394
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,750
Hey, Mr. Lee, did you turn, Mr. Lee?

395
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
Mr. Lee

396
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,800
Mr. Lee

397
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,340
Hey, you bastards

398
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,380
If you fuss, you'll burst
like this. Stand up straight.

399
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,050
Hey, why
are kids so violent?

400
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,750
These
guys over there are new.

401
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,300
That's
why I didn't know you.

402
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,670
Hey, why aren't you answering the phone?

403
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,130
What are you doing here, again?

404
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,500
Oh, this
bastard is creeping into my area.

405
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,170
This is an idiot with no basic
concept of business ethics.

406
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,630
No,
brother, you little guy.

407
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,130
Big breasts belatedly spitting on my area

408
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,210
- Huh?
- Huh?

409
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,670
Are these bastards going to die?

410
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,840
Ugh, no.

411
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,170
Hey, you guys agree.

412
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,670
What about this bastard?

413
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,590
Hey, Detective Han, just arrest him.

414
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,340
- Yes?
- Arrest him.

415
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,050
You were disappointed, weren't you, President Man?

416
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,670
I'm sorry, President Cheon.

417
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,130
Yes, yes, we get along
so well that we fight half and half.

418
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,050
- Uh?
- Yes

419
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,710
And because we agreed

420
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,050
Now, pay the settlement amount.

421
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,800
You three, you five

422
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,090
No, this guy
has three and I have five? Why?

423
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,460
- Curious?
- Ying

424
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,090
Then I'll give you two more, I'll let you know

425
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,250
Are you curious?

426
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,670
- That's right
- Oh, bring it quickly.

427
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Good job

428
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,340
Okay

429
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,250
Hey, open an account with this
and recharge the kids' game money.

430
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,500
Yes, I understand.

431
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,050
Hey, among you kids.

432
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,090
Are there any kids
from online casinos?

433
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,300
- No need
- No need

434
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Don't you have any?

435
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,130
Come find me

436
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,590
- Yes?
- I...

437
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,670
Let's go

438
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,750
I've gained a lot of weight.

439
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,250
- The money has increased even more
- Wow, really.

440
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,800
IC

441
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,710
Hey, Yoosung Choi

442
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,340
Why is the quantity increasing?

443
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,750
Oh, well, CEO Jang
said he needed more cash.

444
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,800
To run the washing machine,
you have to align the objects, right?

445
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,380
Don't send me money this time

446
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,130
Oh, then I'm in a bit of trouble.

447
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,800
All right

448
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,670
I will only follow Boss
Baek unconditionally.

449
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,250
As long as the developer of
the new office building is handled well,

450
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,960
I'll give you 1 billion right away

451
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,300
Don't worry

452
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,090
Anyway, President Kwon
will wait until the day after tomorrow.

453
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,920
- Please pay some attention and finish it
- Yes.

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,460
Hey, it's good to
eat well

455
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,630
- How many days have you starved?
- Ah, yes

456
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,590
Ugh, prostitute.

457
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,500
I received the item

458
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,210
Hey, well, you called me like
this when you were busy, huh?

459
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,840
You haven't raised my dividend yet.

460
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,380
Should I not send money?

461
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,420
Whore, just send me the money

462
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,630
Hey, how much dividends
are falling on you

463
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,920
Are you sitting
there making a deal with that?

464
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,550
Hey, are you a janbari?
Don't fret, send the money quickly

465
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,340
Your words are getting longer

466
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,880
I...

467
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,710
Last...

468
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,420
okay! I quit
first, this bastard!

469
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,960
Haha! What the fuck kind of
employee makes a deal with the boss?

470
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,550
Enter South Korea

471
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,250
You need to take care of yourself.
There's a lot of money to be made, eh?

472
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,050
Yes, I'll keep that in mind

473
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,630
- No, he, Mr Kwon
- Yes

474
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,500
Well, have you ever operated a casino?

475
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,670
- Casino?
- Yes

476
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,050
No, one of our employees
was a little disobedient.

477
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,670
I think there will be some personnel changes.

478
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,050
Ah, yes, anything you ask me to do.

479
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,880
Let's go

480
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,340
yes

481
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,300
Ha, fuck, it's hard to make money

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,550
I'm sorry for talking about
work while we were having a delicious meal.

483
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,420
How is the progress going so far?

484
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,050
First of all,
take whatever money you have.

485
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,960
I have secured a
few more accounts.

486
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,550
Other than that, there's little
else you can know from the site...

487
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,710
If you ask a question,
they say they don't know everything.

488
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,550
The top is making a fuss,
telling us to bring the results now.

489
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,050
IP is being
circulated overseas.

490
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,500
It's tricky to track.

491
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,250
The personnel composition
of the casino people there.

492
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,800
If you know the inside story

493
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
It would be much easier
to get your bearings.

494
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,380
Hey, Seokdo.

495
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,090
Have you heard from the night gangsters?

496
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,340
- What is it?
- Uh, what is it?

497
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,130
- Oh, that's right
- Ms.

498
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,800
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly

499
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,550
Hello, brother.

500
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,500
President Man, do you want to leave?

501
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,670
Why haven't I heard from you?

502
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,630
I was
going to call you already.

503
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,340
I heard you figured it out

504
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,710
While running a gambling house

505
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Do it online over
there on the internet

506
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
There's one guy who's completely
ruined

507
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,630
Who is that?

508
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,300
Brother, thank you for the gift.

509
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,800
I was sorry yesterday

510
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,250
You know that I'm meeting
you by looking at your face, right?

511
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,460
So damn handsome

512
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,590
It's good, Mr. Lee

513
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,920
Chairman

514
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,090
Are you out!

515
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,550
Have you touched all the new statues?

516
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,840
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

517
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,130
I touched everything

518
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,170
Let's see

519
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,800
Gucci

520
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,420
8,000 points!

521
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,050
You've set another record, Chairman!

522
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,630
As you said, you can
never get over 8,000 points.

523
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,750
- I touched everything...
- Hey, hey

524
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,880
Bring this down to 7,000 points, huh?

525
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,460
That way people will have their pride hurt...

526
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,050
Is this my car kid?

527
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,590
Some bastard messed with my car!

528
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,340
You are a nugi!

529
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,630
Take out the car, you bastard, it's illegal parking.

530
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,750
Fuck, that sucks.

531
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,670
- Huh?
- Huh?

532
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,050
How did you know I was here?

533
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Oh my, this bastard
crawled out again and took it.

534
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,500
He operated this machine and
siphoned off people's money, Mr. Lee.

535
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,670
Again, again, again,
Ssang8nyeon says it again, again

536
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,340
So someone manipulated it!

537
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,130
Yeah, that's too much in
a democratic country, yeah

538
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,750
- You didn't manipulate it?
- Yes!

539
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,500
- You put this down
- Don't do it.

540
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,210
- Don't do anything, come out
- Don't do it, you bastard.

541
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,800
- Don't do it, don't do it
- Come out.

542
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,380
- Ah, please come out, come out
- Really, please, ah...

543
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,800
What is it?

544
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,050
Do you have a conscience?

545
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,630
I'm sorry, I misunderstood, huh?

546
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,670
Hey, you need to come
with me. Follow me.

547
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,460
Again, to mistreat people again, again

548
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,800
child winding up

549
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,170
Do you know how much
I make per hour now?

550
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,630
You died and
came back to life last time, Mr.

551
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,880
You have to have something left to cooperate!

552
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
Follow me before they take that car away.

553
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,300
That's all I have
to say between us

554
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,340
Follow me

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Fuck you, really, man.

556
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,670
Isn't it coming out?

557
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,750
Yes, I'm going

558
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,670
Gucci

559
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,050
Answer me straight, don't get scolded

560
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,670
Online gambling sites

561
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,380
I thought I would make a lot of money
if I hit the jackpot, so I gave it a try.

562
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,670
How did you create the program?

563
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,420
My what, Steve Jobs?
I bought it with money, Mr.

564
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,550
How?

565
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,210
Elsewhere, labor costs are reduced.

566
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,880
There were also places where children were
caught, imprisoned illegally, and made to work.

567
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,130
I'm different, huh?

568
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,340
Just opened
an office overseas

569
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,550
We officially hired employees
and did it cleanly and legally.

570
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,500
The whole thing you said
is illegal, you bastard.

571
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,750
AC

572
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,050
Do you know where this is?

573
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,130
You know Emperor Casino

574
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,590
I started watching
this and it crashed.

575
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,050
Do you know how much
these people earn per day?

576
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,960
200 million

577
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,340
How much is one year? Do the math, eh?

578
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,500
73 billion

579
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,840
Uh, here it is

580
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,340
Look at this

581
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,710
The only difference here is the
store name and phone number, huh?

582
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,250
We're all in the same house

583
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,960
This is something they're
going to do among themselves.

584
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,630
In a word, a monopoly, a monopoly

585
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,500
And in casinos, live
broadcasts always make money.

586
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,880
Even the detectives should have done
it live?

587
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,460
We don't, this
baby is a detective

588
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,250
Where did you create
the server in preparation?

589
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,710
Stuffy, stifled

590
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,800
I did it in the Philippines

591
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,090
How much did you do?

592
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,670
Good question

593
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,300
I don't blame you
if I've been around a while.

594
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
I've only been in business
for 3 days and some bastards

595
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,170
They invaded the business
and destroyed everything.

596
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,920
Me too, Sibe, I died and came back to life.

597
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,840
Hey, where are those bastards now?

598
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,800
How do I know that?
If you know, you'll become a detective

599
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,380
Ah

600
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,750
But I know where the link is

601
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,000
Where is it?

602
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,750
No, how come the
detectives don't know anything?

603
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,090
Tsu-eup, lady

604
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,250
No, I don't know how
they caught the culprit.

605
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,670
Where are you?

606
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,380
Something like this

607
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,880
Unless you're an expert like
me, you'll never catch it.

608
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,710
Oh, so where are you, Mr.

609
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
See

610
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,710
Samseong-dong

611
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,840
Samseong-dong?

612
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,460
- Hey, come out
- Yes.

613
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,630
Hey, hey, where are you going? Follow

614
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,170
- How come again?
- Follow me

615
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,170
Okay, everyone, have a good day

616
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,210
- Yes!
- Fighting

617
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,880
- Follow me
- I will come back.

618
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,840
Oh, fuck, you're being mean to me again, again

619
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,000
Let's go

620
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,750
One more banker

621
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,250
3, Banker wins

622
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,250
Hey, how is it going?

623
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,340
You're screwed, Mr.

624
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,630
We have 4,000 to last 5,000
left. Let's do our best, okay?

625
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,750
Hey Jang Yi-su, do you want to die?

626
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,090
They say if you wait, they will come, Mr.

627
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,050
Become a detective...

628
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,210
Oppa

629
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,130
I need to come to my senses,
come to my senses, come to my senses.

630
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,710
Are you okay?

631
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,920
Be careful what you say

632
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,550
It's amazing, Mr.

633
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,670
Good, Mr.

634
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,960
A man has to have guts, huh?

635
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,210
Take it all!

636
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Why are you doing this?

637
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,710
It's a once in a lifetime experience!

638
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,380
- Oh, what are you doing...
- Shut up

639
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,000
Cara

640
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,300
Player 0

641
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,920
Banker 9, Banker wins

642
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,750
Fucked, let's go

643
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,750
C, A.C.

644
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,750
Ah, Gucci

645
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,090
Good luck

646
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,840
Hey

647
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,380
- Whiskey
- Yes.

648
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,590
Ah, why is
this place so small, huh?

649
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,920
It's boring!

650
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,210
Isn't there
somewhere big to sell, baby?

651
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,000
'Self'?

652
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,800
Have you ever driven a Porsche?

653
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,340
Boss

654
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,500
Ah, are you a bit bored here?

655
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,960
Well, there's no taste whatsoever.

656
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,050
Oh

657
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,670
My boyfriend always
hangs out in Las Vegas

658
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,210
It's boring to do it here

659
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,420
Then, may I introduce myself?

660
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,340
There is a good place.

661
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,590
Mai do you like it?

662
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes

663
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,050
Hey, I asked, everyone get ready.

664
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,050
How do you like it here?

665
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,300
Here, here

666
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,000
It's like playing live
with a cell phone in hand.

667
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,960
I
Will help you sign up.

668
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,170
Baccarat,
Hold'em, Baduki, stood.

669
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,800
We have all the games you want

670
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,750
Hey

671
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,840
- Is this good?
- Yes?

672
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,340
Fuck, isn't there
something bigger than this nonsense?

673
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,420
- Ah...
- Not none, Mr.

674
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Hey, hey, hey, don't go too hard

675
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,630
If you don't know, just stay
still. I'll take care of everything.

676
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,130
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, boss.

677
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,340
Baby

678
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,210
Let's
just listen to the story.

679
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,170
Huh?

680
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,050
- Is that right, baby?
- Yes, honey.

681
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,670
- Okay, let's listen
- Let's listen.

682
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,750
Why
are you in such a hurry?

683
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,960
Boss, then it's called Emperor Casino.

684
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,210
There is a VIP game room on the
site that operates through membership.

685
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,460
However

686
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,960
The basic stake is a bit high.

687
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,130
Oh, fuck, you fucking ignore people.

688
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,090
How much is it?

689
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,210
10 billion

690
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,250
1 billion?

691
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,170
Detective Ma, are you okay?

692
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,000
Huh

693
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh my! You!

694
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,920
AC, boss

695
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
Ai, catch it!

696
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
Hey, hey, hey, block
it, block it, block it, block it

697
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Mr.

698
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,550
Oh, Mr.

699
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,130
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

700
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,590
Don't come, don't come!

701
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,710
- Don't you put it down?
- Don't come in.

702
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,670
Ah, you bastard!

703
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,000
Put it down, you bastard!

704
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,130
You bastard! You bastard!

705
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,960
Hey, hey, grab the arm, arm, hey, knife!

706
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,630
Sword, sword, sword!

707
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,750
Put down the knife, you bastard!

708
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,340
- Come and see, come and see, come and see
- Bro!

709
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,670
Hey, are your hands okay?

710
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,630
Yes, it's okay.

711
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,590
Hey, wake him up
quickly - Yes, oh...

712
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,630
Isn't he dead?

713
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,840
- Hey, look at your hands
- Hey, hey, wake up.

714
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
- It's okay, it's okay
- Hey, you're bleeding, you bastard.

715
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,920
You, kid! Crazy bastard, this is real

716
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,500
Are you really not going to talk?

717
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,550
I told you

718
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,460
I'm just running
subscription sales.

719
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,800
Write, ah, this guy keeps lying.

720
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,340
Huh?

721
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,210
Oh, surprise,
fuck

722
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,670
Hey, hey,
don't look, don't look

723
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,460
That guy came from China
and killed several people.

724
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,710
Hey, I told you not
to look at me, you bastard.

725
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,250
You're not even looking at me.

726
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,210
Look at your hands

727
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
Just cut that bastard off.

728
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,880
He's in your casino, in your casino

729
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,590
It looks like you lost a lot of money?

730
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,420
If one of you gets caught,
they'll just chew you alive?

731
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,340
So, talk to your brother...

732
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,590
Fuck you

733
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,090
Leave this bastard to me!

734
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,920
Did you see it?

735
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,420
I'll protect you, tell
me straight, quickly.

736
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,050
Quickly

737
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,550
My name is CEO Yoo-seong Choi.

738
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,550
He's just a boss who
gives me sales work.

739
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,920
In fact, he takes
almost 70% of what we earn.

740
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,380
We don't take much

741
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Hey, take 70%?
This bastard is a bad bastard.

742
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,380
You man, you keep getting taken advantage of

743
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,000
That's a gaslighter

744
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,250
Where is that bastard now?

745
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,130
That's right, right?

746
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,300
- Hey, quietly follow along
- Yes

747
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,670
Oh my, my waist,
oh my, my waist, oh my

748
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,710
Oh, I got out of the car.

749
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,300
Will we get together right away?

750
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,880
Wait a minute

751
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,630
- Go in
- Yes.

752
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,920
- Hey, over there
- Yes.

753
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
Where is President
Choi Yoo-seong? Yoosung Choi

754
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,960
I already know everything, so
tell me quickly. Where are you?

755
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,050
Who are you?

756
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,380
I'm a police officer.

757
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,420
- Mr. Choi Yoosung here...
- Mr. I.C.

758
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,670
- Wait a minute
- Why?

759
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,000
It's going to spin.

760
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,920
Damn!

761
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,340
Hey, Manjae! Yuseong Choi!

762
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,170
Hey! You bastard, come to work, hey!

763
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,420
Aren't you here for work? Hey!

764
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,590
- Hey, stand!
- Stand there!

765
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,050
Hey, stop it!

766
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,210
Come to work, you bastard!

767
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Hey, block it, block it!

768
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,880
Hey, you're a detective!

769
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,800
Hey, Manjae, quickly, quickly!

770
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,840
Hey, hey, Yoosung Choi!

771
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,800
Hey, come to work, man!

772
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,710
Hey, stand there!
You bastard!

773
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,750
At there!

774
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,340
Yuseong Choi!

775
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,340
Hey, hey, let's go!

776
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,300
Hey, why is the car here?

777
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,460
There must be some reason, right?

778
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,800
Oh, wait a minute...

779
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,500
Fish oil, baby, it's really fast.

780
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,090
You worked hard

781
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,000
Hey, let's go

782
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,550
I'm leaving

783
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,050
Oh my gosh,
people are surprised, huh?

784
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,920
Ah

785
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,460
Maybe it's because my occupation is a mercenary.

786
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,130
Is this thing that goes around quietly, like
an occupational disease or something like that?

787
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,960
Casino

788
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,250
Let's liquidate the shares.

789
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,840
Ah, why is President
Baek so anxious?

790
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,500
This is big.

791
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,090
I can't eat alone anyway.

792
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,340
Right, CEO Go?

793
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,630
Yes, the coin
developed by CEO Jang

794
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,000
We plan to list it

795
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,460
Technology preparations are complete
and investors have been secured.

796
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,590
Well, let's play a media
game with CEO Jang's fame.

797
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,960
When investors come in at the right time

798
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,750
Well, raising the coin
price is not a problem.

799
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,840
Then the swarms of ants
will just flock to you.

800
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,880
The coin
has a large drop.

801
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,210
It's just perfect to just stick
a straw in and shake it out...

802
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,590
CEO Jang

803
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,050
Please answer me.

804
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,340
You prostitute

805
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,130
listen to me carefully

806
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,000
If this goes well, this
and the casino will all be hole stores.

807
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,460
Oh, and what are you doing with the
casino profits from Choi Yoo-seong?

808
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,250
They say it's regrettable
and ask me to launder money

809
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,670
No need to hoard cash

810
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,960
Yes, of course.

811
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,670
I guess you don't understand.

812
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,090
- Representative Ko
- Yes

813
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,050
The time we wasted
because of that examiner

814
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,250
Well, how much is it?

815
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,050
Oh, I'm still persuading you.

816
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,380
All the other examiners
agree, so it won't last long.

817
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,300
Therefore

818
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,380
Stop just talking
and go out and do some work.

819
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,590
Okay?

820
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,590
Hey, prostitute.

821
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,800
Hey, great, huh?

822
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,670
Since I'm in Korea, please
take care of the examiner's work.

823
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,880
Hey, once approved, this
will be listed right away.

824
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,500
Uh? Hey, if that happens

825
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,630
I'll hand over all your casino
shares and administrator keys.

826
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,380
Dongcheol-ah

827
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,090
You must keep those words

828
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,750
- Uh, hey, did you get something?
- Ah, yes

829
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,050
It's a place called Yuseong Apparel.

830
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,090
Because I have to bring the
casino profits back to Korea.

831
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,960
Exporting fake clothes

832
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,750
It is a company that launders money
in the form of receiving payments.

833
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,960
And Choi Yoo-seong

834
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,170
I have a history of
habitual gambling and fraud.

835
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,840
Let alone a server inside the company

836
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,880
The network wasn't
in place properly.

837
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,960
He just looks like the boss of pants.

838
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,550
You've withdrawn a
lot of cash from this bank account.

839
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,880
Where is all the money here? Uh?

840
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
- Or that, in the Philippines
- IC

841
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,460
Isn't there a
gambling program running?

842
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,670
Where did you get that from?
Just tell me this

843
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,960
Boy, I don't know

844
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,880
Yeah, I don't know.

845
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,000
So I'm just trying to
find out. Talk to me.

846
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,960
I was just doing
what I was told to do.

847
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,250
If you do this, you will
take care of everything yourself, okay?

848
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,670
You're just a shell

849
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,210
I can't speak

850
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,130
I'm dying

851
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,710
Hey

852
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,920
Have you ever heard
of the Room of Truth?

853
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,210
You're not talking now, are you?

854
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,130
Then you will be killed by this man.

855
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,250
Oh, I really don't want to die.

856
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,710
Hey, I mean

857
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,090
Just say who told you to do it.

858
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,590
I'm calling a lawyer.

859
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,800
He won first place.

860
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,050
2 billion

861
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,550
The CEO bought it with 30% more.

862
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,750
Source: I want to give a gift
with clean money without worries.

863
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,710
So, please feel at
ease and feel good.

864
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,840
Woori Coin Qualification Review

865
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,800
Please just approve

866
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,420
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

867
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,090
If you keep
doing this, I will report you.

868
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,090
Boy, you really
don't understand what I'm saying.

869
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,750
This is...

870
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,630
It's your last chance

871
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,840
Boy, it's not over yet.

872
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,000
Therefore

873
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,670
Because CEO Go threw
it at your construction site.

874
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,630
Take care of it

875
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,250
Prostitute, what
if you kill CEO Go?

876
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,840
Why?

877
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,670
No?

878
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,050
It's not that it can't be done.

879
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,340
Well, if you work,
you live and die.

880
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,210
I'm afraid
you'll get into trouble.

881
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,300
Hey

882
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,590
Choi Yoo-seong was caught by
that bastard police officer?

883
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,250
He
Won't blow, right?

884
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,090
I had a lot of lawyers, but

885
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,960
If that bastard blows his
ass, we'll all be screwed...

886
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,590
This fucking guy is real, man.

887
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,300
Arriving at 3 o'clock, get it ready on time.

888
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,090
Mr. Choi Yoo-seong

889
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,550
I'm meeting with a lawyer
at 3 o'clock. Come out.

890
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,250
Delivery.

891
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,380
Delivery has arrived.

892
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,050
- What is this?
- Ah, delivery has arrived.

893
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,250
- Please pay
- What?

894
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,920
- We didn't order it to be delivered
- It was delivered.

895
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,710
Isn't this the investigation
department? Seoil Police Station?

896
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Wrong...

897
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,670
Hello.

898
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,500
Hey, what's going on?

899
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,090
Hey, why?

900
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,130
Get out, get out!

901
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh,
then who ordered this?

902
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,460
Boss Baek, I
really didn't say anything...

903
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,050
Mr...

904
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,050
Oh,
fuck CEO Go, ah...

905
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,340
I feel like this prostitute
doesn't know my pure heart.

906
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,090
That bastard who works hard, Mr. Lee, tsk

907
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,340
President Kwon

908
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,880
I saw this guy go to the police
station and set things up with a knife.

909
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,130
Someday you'll put
a knife in my back

910
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,170
Let's put it aside

911
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,250
CEO Goh Baek Chang-gi's
Philippine casino funds

912
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,750
Did you take care of it for me?

913
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,840
Let's pretend that something happened because
we got caught playing around while eating.

914
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,880
If the police investigation network is narrowed,
they will be cornered by Baek Chang-gi.

915
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,710
Let us catch the prostitute
first and kill her.

916
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,840
How is it?

917
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,840
That's right!

918
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,130
Cold

919
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,550
Oh,
hey, what smell is this?

920
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,500
What is it?

921
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,090
His real name is Go Jaehyuk.

922
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,460
The securities company is now
shut down due to insider trading.

923
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,170
It is true that he worked to
manage the assets of rich people.

924
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,960
And now this body

925
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,750
Inside the export
container of Yoosung Apparel

926
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,960
It was discovered?

927
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,460
As we guessed

928
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,210
I think it's true that it's
related to Emperor Casino.

929
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,460
Contacted me
about the stab wounds on this body.

930
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,250
It looks identical to the stab wound suffered by Cho
Seong-jae, who was killed last time in the Philippines.

931
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,050
It could be the same
criminal using the same weapon.

932
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,880
Until just before he died,
he went around various companies.

933
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,880
It seemed like they were
giving advice like this.

934
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,750
And after listening to my acquaintances,

935
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,460
Well, I'm thinking of
pulling a big one soon.

936
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,840
I heard you were
talking around like that?

937
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,340
Have you secured
a list of those companies?

938
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,840
Yes, I have secured it. I
think I need to look into everything.

939
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,300
Inside a
container at Incheon Customs

940
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,050
The body of a man in his 40s was found.

941
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,340
Police believe it is highly likely
that he was involved in a violent crime.

942
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,960
We are investigating
by securing nearby CCTV.

943
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,500
Reporter Lee Hae-jin covered the story.

944
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,250
Around 8:30 this morning

945
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,340
A
Philippine clothing exporter

946
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,250
Inside the Yoosung Apparel container

947
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,250
The body of a man in his 40s was found.

948
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,210
The deceased man managed the
assets of individual clients...

949
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,170
Wow, this,
your backside is killer.

950
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,210
Mr.

951
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,170
Oh, fuck, really.

952
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,960
Ah, what is this
guy really doing...

953
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,050
Uh, prostitute, I'm
busy. What's going on?

954
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,630
I watched the news

955
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,130
Oh, that?

956
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,920
It looks like our employee made
a mistake while handling the work.

957
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,250
I'll find out

958
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,590
The police said the
victim was killed by someone he knew...

959
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,340
Are you listening, prostitute?

960
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,130
Hey, I'm busy preparing for
the listing party right now.

961
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,050
Uh?

962
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,500
Hey, let's meet tomorrow and talk.

963
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,880
I'll go where you are

964
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,130
No, I'll go.

965
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,550
Oh fuck, I'm scared

966
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,210
uh?

967
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
- President Kwon
- Yes

968
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
Well,
let's increase security.

969
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,670
Oh, and do you have a gun?

970
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,130
Blow your head off

971
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,880
A gun?

972
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,590
Well, let me try to get it.

973
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:41,960
Okay

974
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,750
To the dead Go Jaehyuk

975
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,500
The company that was entrusted
with asset management is QM Holdings.

976
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,800
They said they were holding
a coin listing party here.

977
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,090
Yes, everyone.

978
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,550
Please cross your
arms and shake hands.

979
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,460
Uh, our investor
teachers, please exchange greetings.

980
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,210
Hyung, this is Jang
Dong-cheol, the CEO of QM Holdings.

981
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,340
Lee, he has made quite a name for
himself as an IT talent since he was young.

982
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,500
It seems like I made a lot of money
while developing various programs.

983
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,250
It seems like you've been
dabbling in coins recently.

984
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,300
I don't know from the outside,
but I'll have to look into it.

985
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,340
Yes

986
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,340
- What floor is the event hall?
- The 20th floor.

987
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,710
Going up

988
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,340
This is the lobby floor.

989
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,050
I'm here

990
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,460
Yes

991
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,340
Come to the 19th floor.

992
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,340
Here? Here? Uh?

993
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,460
Brother, brother, keep going?

994
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,500
Over there

995
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,250
Could you please show me your ID?

996
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:18,960
Are you a police officer?

997
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,670
Brother!

998
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,840
Brother!

999
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,500
Huh?
Hey hey hey

1000
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,250
Hey, you asshole, what are you doing?

1001
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,460
Let me go, let me go, let me go, huh?

1002
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:34,920
Hey, hey, don't do it, don't do it

1003
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,090
This needs to be blocked tightly.

1004
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,420
Hey, wait a minute, hey, hey

1005
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,880
- There will be a lot of blood
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no!

1006
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,090
Hey, fuck!

1007
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,500
Hey, this dog!

1008
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,500
Ouch, Mr.

1009
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,670
Hey, you're a jack of all trades!

1010
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,090
Wait a minute, just a little bit,
just a little bit, just a little bit

1011
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,800
Really

1012
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,250
You're not going to talk until the end?

1013
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,000
Are you saying it's better
for you to just talk to me?

1014
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,300
Uh?

1015
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,590
- 127700:59:59,670

1016
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,590
I heard you
have such a heavy mouth?

1017
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,500
Rumors are spreading

1018
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,250
Ugh

1019
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,840
Thank you for your effort

1020
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,750
Hey, what happened to
the people who went to the hospital?

1021
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,840
Oh, Manjae is getting treatment
and coming back with David.

1022
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,090
Fortunately, her aunt
is also recovering.

1023
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,380
Oh, Mr.

1024
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,710
Ah, you're pissed again, Mr.

1025
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,130
Hey, what are these guys, so?

1026
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,960
Real names are
Baek Chang-gi and Jo Ji-hoon.

1027
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,880
He is a former STS special mercenary.

1028
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,210
He caused many casualties,
both civilian and military.

1029
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,670
It's just that he was kicked out.

1030
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,750
And the time of expulsion

1031
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,920
It coincides with the
appearance of Emperor Casino.

1032
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,880
I took Seongjae
Cho and made him work.

1033
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,130
I killed you because you didn't listen.

1034
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,880
Choi Yoo-seong, who was laundering
money in the middle, was also caught.

1035
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,250
I processed it.

1036
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,130
I'm sure these bastards
went to see CEO Jang.

1037
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,210
Then

1038
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,550
CEO Jang may be the
developer of Emperor Casino.

1039
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,050
It's
still related to CEO Jang.

1040
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,960
There is no evidence

1041
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,920
- Yes, this is Gwangsoo University
- Now, President Jang and Baek Changgi.

1042
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,750
Find out what kind of
relationship these bastards have.

1043
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,460
- Yes
- Yes, just a moment.

1044
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,550
Older brother

1045
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,500
The conductor is looking for you two.

1046
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,590
- Mr. I
- Mr. I.

1047
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,500
Tell me about one achievement

1048
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,050
Yes, that is...

1049
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,170
Cho Seong-jae is murdered and
the police station is attacked.

1050
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,550
A body is found in the port!

1051
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:46,130
You guys wouldn't have
been playing around during that time!

1052
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,250
What is the relevance of CEO Jang Dong-cheol?

1053
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,670
It says that's where
the final money is spent.

1054
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,670
And that's still something…

1055
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,840
We're still looking for evidence

1056
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,170
Baek Chang-gi?

1057
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,670
Isn't Korea already popular?
Are you sure you're here?

1058
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,000
Maseokdo

1059
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,920
If it's this much of a mess, it's better
to investigate somewhere else, right?

1060
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,880
Ah, ah, you can't do that.

1061
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,710
I will definitely finish it

1062
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,460
No more, man.

1063
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,800
Get out, get out, get out, get out!

1064
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,880
No, brother,
you can't do that.

1065
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,000
- I'm finishing it now...
- Hey, Seokdo.

1066
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,210
- Get out
- Hey, Seokdo.

1067
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,750
No, why did you change like this?

1068
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,840
No...

1069
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,340
He became deputy chief...

1070
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,920
Let's disband the team
and hand it over to another team.

1071
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,170
Things have gotten too big

1072
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,170
Study hard

1073
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,800
- Thank you
- Okay

1074
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,340
Oh my, what are you doing
alone in such a difficult situation?

1075
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,250
What is it? What are you here to do?

1076
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,210
Oh, I came
here to drive you.

1077
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,380
Hey, hey, let's
drink together, okay, now

1078
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,250
Hello

1079
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,300
- Hello
- Hello

1080
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,630
Oh, yes,
you study hard.

1081
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,210
- Hey, have a glass
- Yes, here it is.

1082
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,590
Bro, can't we
just investigate on our own?

1083
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,590
Hey, say something that makes sense.

1084
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,500
Yes

1085
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,840
Ayu casino
sites have also increased.

1086
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,000
Just lift the restrictions that
made membership registration difficult.

1087
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,130
Two bastards

1088
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,380
- What is that?
- Huh? There was a fight

1089
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,420
- Stand up
- Yes.

1090
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,670
Oh, what should I do?

1091
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,590
Ah,
why are you doing that?

1092
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,630
Oh, what's wrong, really!

1093
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,340
Why are there so many scoundrels
in our country? Mr. Lee

1094
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,800
Don't do it!

1095
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,250
- Fuck, come to work
- Hey, man!

1096
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,210
- Oh, let go!
- Mr. Lee

1097
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,170
Hey

1098
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,170
What!

1099
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,300
Are you okay?

1100
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,880
Are you okay?

1101
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,250
- I'm the police, police, yes
- Stay still, you bastard.

1102
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,670
Hey, stop!

1103
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,710
What is it, Mr. Lee?

1104
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,340
Brother!

1105
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,000
Hey! Fuck

1106
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,750
Oh, I'm dying, I'm dying!

1107
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,960
Brother, brother, kid is dead!

1108
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:21,090
Bro, bro, don't do it!

1109
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:27,420
Hey, the three of you can't
just talk to one person like that...

1110
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,210
I can't stop you, I can't stop you, ugh

1111
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,500
The only difference here
is the store name and phone number.

1112
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,170
This is all one house

1113
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,130
In a word, a monopoly, a monopoly

1114
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,630
hey

1115
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,170
You said they had a monopoly, right?

1116
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,630
Yes

1117
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,800
This prostitute
was that time

1118
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,170
She should have been caught
by the police at the event.

1119
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,300
Ah, I can't live
with my anxiety.

1120
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,420
The police
are watching closely right now.

1121
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,340
Even President Baek won't
be able to move arbitrarily.

1122
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,670
No, boss Kwon

1123
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,630
That bastard has no
fear cells at all.

1124
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,050
Oh, they said they have found
the location, so quickly put it in front of me.

1125
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,300
Yes, I will catch it.

1126
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,630
Oh, fuck

1127
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,960
Ah, if I don't have a prostitute,
who will I hang out with now?

1128
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,710
At Seoul Seoil Police Station

1129
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,210
Mr. Choi of Yuseong Apparel,
a clothing export company,

1130
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,300
There was an incident where a person
was murdered while receiving a report.

1131
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,090
While the police are investigating

1132
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,050
The suspect was identified as the person
captured on CCTV and a search was launched...

1133
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,750
Brother

1134
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,380
Let's go to the Philippines.

1135
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,460
If that's the case, I haven't even started.

1136
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,710
I have to see the end

1137
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,250
Are you looking for me?

1138
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,920
Ha, I thought you ran away.

1139
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,090
Hey, you bastard!

1140
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,880
Fuck

1141
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,710
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1142
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,420
CEO Jang gave you a casino?

1143
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,050
- Hey
- Yes?

1144
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,000
Do you know what the rich want?

1145
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,920
Have more

1146
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,590
I'll share it in moderation

1147
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,000
- What do you want to do?
- Good, good.

1148
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:33,750
Hey, why on earth are you
doing this when they tell you to disband?

1149
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,050
Hyung, when it comes to digital
crimes, you shouldn't chase after what you see.

1150
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,090
We have to make these
bastards move

1151
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,500
When are you moving?

1152
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,380
When competitors are doing well

1153
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,210
I can't stand that, what's wrong?

1154
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,670
Oh, of course you're going
to eat it all by yourself.

1155
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,380
Because we have to monopolize it

1156
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,000
Now, can we do it?

1157
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,800
What?

1158
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,050
Investigation!

1159
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,960
- Hey, Seokdo
- brother

1160
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,090
I really have to catch
these bastards

1161
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:00,840
I'll talk to the conductor.

1162
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,550
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, not the conductor.

1163
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,090
Hey, don't touch the conductor, man!

1164
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,460
Please excuse me for a moment.

1165
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,670
What are you?

1166
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,800
Deputy Director

1167
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,250
I will handle this case

1168
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,170
Hey, Seok-do, what are
you doing here? Wake up quickly

1169
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,550
What are you doing
when the Commissioner is here? Tsk

1170
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:31,840
I made a promise
with the victim's mother.

1171
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,590
I will finish it.

1172
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,880
Hey, that still doesn't work

1173
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,960
Hey, wake up!

1174
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,130
Older brother

1175
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,210
The number of heads of those I will
catch is three digits, three digits!

1176
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,340
Three, three, three, three digits?

1177
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,880
Is that so?

1178
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:48,210
I will take responsibility and catch everything!

1179
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,880
Well, well, still that...

1180
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,300
It has to be three digits

1181
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,460
Ah...

1182
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,000
yes

1183
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,380
Hey, upload the plan.

1184
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,500
Yes, I will
organize it well and upload it.

1185
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,960
I will do my best

1186
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,960
Our goal is
always to arrest criminals.

1187
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,880
It may be later than you think

1188
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,920
Just like the law
can't outrun crime

1189
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,800
Still, if you try,
you can catch up.

1190
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,210
I'll keep that in mind

1191
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:20,050
Thank you!

1192
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,250
Changed

1193
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,880
Is he a magic stone?

1194
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,380
Ah, yes

1195
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,500
Commissioner, I am truly sorry.

1196
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,800
A detective must have that kind of taste.

1197
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,050
Hey, this
costs a lot of money.

1198
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,250
If something really goes wrong,
I'll jump into the Han River, really.

1199
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,960
I said I understood.
Hey, let's all gather together.

1200
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,210
Yes

1201
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,380
Hey, listen carefully.

1202
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,710
Now we are going to play
the Philippine Emperor Casino.

1203
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,300
I confiscated their main server.

1204
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,670
We need to find evidence
that CEO Jang is the manager.

1205
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,170
Well, then what about Baek Chang-gi?

1206
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,670
When my front head gets shaved, I get even more anxious.

1207
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,880
No matter what, I will
try to meet CEO Jang.

1208
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,550
Well then he catches the bastard.

1209
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,420
Ah, brother, everything is good.

1210
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,300
How do I find a casino business?

1211
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,380
We'll start a company that
competes with those bastards.

1212
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,960
Then they will come looking
for us to monopolize it.

1213
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,050
- Ah
- You know what I mean, right?

1214
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,340
Yes

1215
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,630
Hey, you have to catch them all
at once or they'll all run away.

1216
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:17,300
Yes, I understand.

1217
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,800
Oh, and listen carefully.

1218
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,590
When we always catch the
criminal

1219
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,420
It may be later than you think

1220
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,550
Because the law is a crime...

1221
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,630
Uh, you can get ahead.

1222
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,960
But the crime

1223
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:31,960
I'm trying

1224
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,960
Do you understand?

1225
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,420
What are you talking about?

1226
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,090
You heard it together earlier.

1227
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,500
But we do the setting?

1228
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,710
No

1229
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,750
A professional should do it

1230
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,090
What should I do?

1231
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,420
No, I'll pay for it so
you can give it a try.

1232
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,050
I'm going crazy, really, Lee.

1233
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,750
Whew

1234
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,670
Oh, if I do that, will
something happen to me?

1235
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,880
No, do we need something
like that between us?

1236
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,250
What is our relationship?

1237
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,550
'Chinshungdihaimingjjang'

1238
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,130
'No matter how blood-related you are,
your money transactions must be accurate.'

1239
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,500
This is it!

1240
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:25,880
Take this

1241
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,210
This time, we
need an expert like you.

1242
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,500
I asked for it from
above and received it.

1243
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,380
This is a badge given only to secret
police officers on special missions.

1244
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,170
- Hi, Mr.
- This is yours, yours!

1245
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,550
Oh, again,
again, again, again, again

1246
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,460
Playing with people
again, again, again, Mr.

1247
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,340
Huh? If we
have a special mission

1248
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,630
Originally, people were selected
through special recruitment like this.

1249
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,750
Without even knowing, this bastard

1250
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,500
How can I believe this?

1251
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,880
Hey

1252
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,710
You don't trust the detective?

1253
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,840
You said your original dream was to be a police officer.

1254
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,960
If this operation is successful,

1255
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,630
Please shake off the bad
things I have done so far.

1256
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,130
I thought about it when I made it.

1257
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,300
- Mr., bring it with me
- Child

1258
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,500
Oh, just pick someone
else and bring it with you.

1259
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,090
- Hey, just stay still!
- Oh, bring it!

1260
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,000
Drive, damn it! Seed

1261
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,090
Oh, then you really
treat me like a police officer too?

1262
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,550
No, that's right

1263
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,210
Your rank is sergeant.

1264
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,500
Fuck, it's killing me

1265
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,000
Secret view...

1266
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:17,130
Ah...

1267
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,920
So what is this English?

1268
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,630
'FDA', nigga

1269
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,420
So what?

1270
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,090
This is not 'Police Dark Army'

1271
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,000
Not 'dark police', secret police

1272
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,590
Oh, I see.

1273
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,960
Ah, then what is this bird?

1274
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,380
This eagle?

1275
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,550
That's salty

1276
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,250
Ah, ah, fuck!

1277
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,710
That's why it's called salt!

1278
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,590
Oh fuck you bastard

1279
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,090
Ah, sir...

1280
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,750
Secret police?

1281
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,840
Good night

1282
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,050
Let's do it, Detective Ma.

1283
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,050
Let's go

1284
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,550
Let's go, Detective Jang!

1285
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,340
Mr.

1286
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,250
Let's go

1287
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,920
- Behind, behind, behind, behind
- Oh, be careful.

1288
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,590
Back, back, back

1289
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,500
Instead of connecting right away,
use a VPN to change to a foreign IP.

1290
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,000
Yes, I understand.

1291
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,840
- This is where he was killed.
- He told me...

1292
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,460
Report back when the setting is complete.

1293
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,670
Yes

1294
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,090
What about Seokdo?

1295
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,590
Ah, Detective Ma.

1296
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:33,300
Who picks the people to work?

1297
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,670
You

1298
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,840
Oh

1299
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:40,300
The operation group, dividend group, charging
group, and currency exchange group are

1300
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,670
It should be installed by default

1301
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,250
Oh, there have to be people
who do maintenance too.

1302
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,460
If you lose money and
the screen pops like this

1303
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,420
I feel like I'm being scammed, this

1304
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,960
Since we need to run the site 24 hours a
day, we need to hire people accordingly.

1305
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,800
Now, the site operation team
is in charge of the investigation department.

1306
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,750
Yes

1307
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,710
- The game payout is for the cyber team
- Yes

1308
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,800
Recharge and exchange

1309
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,920
Please let the intelligence team
take care of finance-related matters.

1310
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,960
Yes

1311
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,460
Our forensics team
will handle the maintenance.

1312
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:18,210
Well, if you do this, you are ready.

1313
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,670
You did well. Hey,
what time is your flight?

1314
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,300
I think
we should leave now.

1315
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,630
I have all the cash ready.

1316
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,340
- Okay
- Plane?

1317
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,250
You don't need
to prepare anything, just go.

1318
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,960
Where should I go other than work?

1319
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,380
Don't you have to go to the
Philippines and open a business?

1320
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,340
What Philippines?

1321
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,420
We have to make
it at the same level as them.

1322
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,050
No, I have to direct
the work from here.

1323
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,250
Detective Jang

1324
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,710
Your shoulders are
heavy

1325
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,920
Okay, the flight will be late.

1326
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,300
Detective Jang, let's go!

1327
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,460
Hey, hey

1328
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,960
police dark army

1329
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,000
Alright, fuck it, let's do it!

1330
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,250
That's right

1331
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,500
- Go!
- Let's give it a try!

1332
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,750
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1333
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,130
- Dispatch
- Let's go

1334
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,250
- I will come back
- I will come back.

1335
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,250
- Oh, yeah
- Be careful, bro.

1336
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,500
Take care of yourself

1337
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,000
- It's so hot I'm dying!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1338
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,920
- Take off your clothes, take off your clothes, take them off, take them off
- Give me your clothes, give me them, okay.

1339
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,500
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
- Fuck, fuck

1340
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:27,840
- What the fuck?
- Hey, don't start a fight.

1341
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,460
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it

1342
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:32,710
Ai, this
bastard looks like shit, Mr.

1343
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,000
Sure, Mr.

1344
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,090
- Oh, quickly, quickly
- Let's go in.

1345
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,340
Oh, it's hard, Mr.

1346
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Let's go

1347
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,920
- Hey
- You saved it well.

1348
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,710
So, hey, good job!

1349
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,630
Oh, it's empty.

1350
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,380
I have to set it up from now on.

1351
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,250
Oh, good.

1352
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,380
- Well done
- Yes

1353
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,840
Hey, hey, wait a
minute, what, what, what are you saying?

1354
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,170
Oh, there
are three in total?

1355
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,250
Hey, hey, it's different
than what you said in the beginning, man.

1356
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,300
Is he talking strangely?

1357
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,500
Are you being ripped off or what?

1358
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,550
Okay

1359
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,630
Now, calculate
it. You get what you give.

1360
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,090
Oh! Well done,
well done

1361
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:05,380
- Is it done? Okay?
- Let's buy some short sleeves, Mr.

1362
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,670
- Okay, okay, okay
- Okay, deal

1363
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:07,590
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

1364
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,800
- Everything is ready outside
- Oh, are you done?

1365
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,750
I'm ready

1366
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,920
Okay

1367
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,090
This side is ready too

1368
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,960
I requested cooperation from the Philippine
police, so I cooperate well with them.

1369
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,210
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes.

1370
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,960
Start

1371
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,300
Yes, it runs well
without any interruptions.

1372
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,500
He was acting so proud.

1373
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,380
Oh, where is the prostitute?

1374
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,880
Boy, fuck, really.

1375
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,210
Ha, ugly, you son of a bitch, Mr.

1376
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,380
Huh?

1377
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,500
Hey, our boss Kwon is not normal.

1378
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,090
Oh, is it strong? Uh?

1379
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:16,050
Ah, but your face is a little damaged.

1380
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,630
How many times did you hit Changgi?

1381
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,050
That bastard is really good at fighting, isn't he?

1382
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,460
Where is this son of a bitch?

1383
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:22,710
It's over there.

1384
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,130
What you said before

1385
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,840
Hey, really this...

1386
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,090
Fish oil, it's heavy.

1387
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,550
President Kwon

1388
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,090
Thank you for your hard work so far

1389
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:49,710
Phew!

1390
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,800
Oh!

1391
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,210
Oh, fuck, damn it!

1392
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,170
Hey, President Kwon is cool!

1393
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,300
Huh?

1394
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,800
I'll kill the prostitute and come back.

1395
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,250
Hey, prostitute!

1396
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,630
Where the fuck did you go?

1397
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:10,960
Hey, window...

1398
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,920
Hey, prostitute

1399
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,920
These fucking guys
didn't even tie it up, man.

1400
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,710
Huh?

1401
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,840
Hey, don't come any closer!
The giant crab will fly away!

1402
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,880
What? Seed

1403
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,460
What is the administrator key number?

1404
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,340
Hey, are you curious
about that since you're falling down?

1405
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:42,550
Ugh, fuck, you fucking bastard, shit, shit.

1406
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,960
Okay

1407
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,550
It's 159357, you son of a bitch!

1408
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,750
Baro, fuck

1409
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,380
Kwon, Bog!

1410
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,460
Hey, fuck, hey, hey, hey,
hey, stay away from me!

1411
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,460
Don't come back, you bastard!

1412
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,750
Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck are you
doing with the number, you fuck!

1413
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,420
You know you can't solve it
without me, you son of a bitch!

1414
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,960
You don't have to yo
u-

1415
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,630
This is all you need

1416
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:33,590
Oh, you son of a bitch

1417
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,340
My fingers

1418
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,130
So why don't you keep your promise?

1419
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,130
Hey

1420
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,590
You prostitute!

1421
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,250
Hey!

1422
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,960
OMG!

1423
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,170
Oh, fuck

1424
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,250
That bastard

1425
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,170
Boy, I feel sorry for you because it's time to go.

1426
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,090
Mr. Lee

1427
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:19,840
Do you have any last words?

1428
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,550
Fuck you, you fucking bastard.

1429
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,840
Hey, hey, over there

1430
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,960
Take this...

1431
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,880
What, what?
Speak straighter, please

1432
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,630
Look, look, please look

1433
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,300
What, where is this?

1434
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,630
That's Pagio
District 2

1435
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:58,090
damn you bastards

1436
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,960
Uh, okay, okay,
get ready to shut it down.

1437
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,670
Brother

1438
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,840
A new Labang business
has opened locally.

1439
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,630
Find and sweep

1440
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,250
We will proceed.

1441
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,250
Admin key secured

1442
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,670
go to the villa

1443
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,500
Team leader, the shutdown
has begun

1444
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:38,050
Oh, they're coming
for these bastards, get ready.

1445
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:39,250
Yes

1446
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,090
It's up,
it's up, it's up, it's up

1447
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,250
Manjae, you must not make a mistake.

1448
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,670
Yes, I understand, bro.

1449
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,170
What is this?
Where has everyone gone?

1450
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,670
IC

1451
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,300
- Secure the server
- Yes.

1452
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:09,550
Mr.

1453
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,340
Uh, what is this?

1454
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,170
I can't see it clearly.

1455
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,880
Don't move!

1456
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:20,380
Throw away your weapon! Stay still!

1457
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,710
Hey, you bastard!

1458
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,000
Come to work, you bastard!

1459
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,880
Fuck you, Mr. Lee

1460
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,210
Hey, hey, Carl!

1461
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,210
Come out and kill me

1462
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,130
You, you, you, you

1463
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,250
You bastard, what are you doing!

1464
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,170
Should I kill him?

1465
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,210
Okay, I won't do it, I
won't do it, I won't do it, you bastard!

1466
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,210
- Come out
- Okay, okay.

1467
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,420
- To the neck, to the neck, let's put the knife down first
- Come out

1468
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,380
Put down the knife

1469
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,960
- Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey
- Please save me

1470
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:50,300
Put down the
knife, calm down first.

1471
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,590
- Get out of the way
- Don't do something you'll regret.

1472
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:53,340
Okay, don't do anything
you'll regret, put down the knife and talk!

1473
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,960
- Don't you put down the knife?
- Damn, kill me?

1474
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:57,050
Okay, okay,
no, no, don't do it!

1475
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,960
- Hey, let's solve it through conversation, through conversation
- Please save me.

1476
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,590
What do you want? I'll listen to everything

1477
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,340
That's right!
Hold on, hold on

1478
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,250
- Mr. Lee, Mr.
- Stand up

1479
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,380
You bastard, where
are you at the Emperor Casino?

1480
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,300
Uh?

1481
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,840
Hey, hey, walk fast

1482
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,840
Brother, I have now found the
location of the Emperor Casino.

1483
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,210
I'm moving now

1484
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,630
Okay, let's go

1485
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:30,880
Hey, Seok-do, be careful.

1486
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,800
I'll be back!

1487
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,050
I changed
my brother's manager.

1488
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,750
I thought you were here

1489
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:12,750
I'll just take care of
this, so you guys take care of the rest.

1490
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,050
Or should I try again?

1491
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,130
I'm busy too, let's go our separate ways

1492
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,630
Hey, hurry
up and get in, get in, get in!

1493
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:07,460
It's a shame, you bastards!

1494
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,050
Stay still, you bastard!

1495
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,420
Hey, you should mark it
on the left, left, top left.

1496
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:24,920
This way, come
to work, come to work

1497
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:28,800
Stop, you bastards!

1498
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,130
Don't move, put your hands up, come
here, everyone kneel, here! Come to work

1499
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:44,550
Don't
break, don't break

1500
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,960
To access
important information here

1501
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,250
The administrator must approve

1502
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:52,840
The administrator key was changed a while ago.

1503
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,170
And now the data here

1504
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,630
There are traces
backed up elsewhere.

1505
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:57,090
Is your IP confirmed?

1506
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:58,840
Okay, I'll check it out.

1507
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,590
I found it, QM Holdings!

1508
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,920
The backup server address
appears as QM Holdings.

1509
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,840
This is Jang's company.

1510
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,380
Oh

1511
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,170
I caught evidence from CEO Jang.

1512
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,050
But I saw that the manager had changed.

1513
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,340
I think Baek Chang-gi is
trying to secure the server.

1514
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,670
Uh, okay

1515
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,960
Hey, go faster

1516
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,340
Don't spill
it, just fill it up quickly.

1517
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,300
Yes

1518
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:37,130
Lady, hey, what are you doing!

1519
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,750
- You bastards!
- What!

1520
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,500
Hey, relax, relax

1521
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,250
Mr.

1522
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,300
Hey

1523
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,710
Where is Jang Dong-cheol?

1524
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:44,960
Baek, Baek Chang-gi killed him.

1525
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,670
Where
is that bastard now?

1526
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,800
Hyung, these
bastards went to the airport.

1527
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,130
Find it quickly!

1528
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,500
- What about the plane?
- Oh, I don't know, look for it quickly!

1529
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,340
I looked into the departure schedule.

1530
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,550
Since it is a fake passport, there
is no information to be searched.

1531
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,090
So I'm trying
a different way now.

1532
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:12,170
Baek Chang-ki's body data

1533
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:14,420
I will compare it in real time
with the airport security camera.

1534
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,750
The analysis data was handed over to the airport
police through the National Forensic Service.

1535
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,050
We will soon start tracking
and monitoring there as well.

1536
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,630
Brother, you have to find it no matter what.

1537
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:24,090
If these bastards come to Korea,
you will never be able to catch them.

1538
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,460
No, I heard there are
people with high odds, yes?

1539
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,300
We must search and arrest them all!

1540
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:52,920
The odds are too low

1541
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,920
I'm still looking
for a 50% match.

1542
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,750
These people alone are too many.

1543
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:03,130
Thank you and goodbye.

1544
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,050
Thank you

1545
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:08,550
hello

1546
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,170
thank you

1547
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,130
Found it!

1548
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,170
Senior, AStar Air
KR620 to Manila

1549
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,670
Only 10 minutes left before departure

1550
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,960
okay!

1551
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,550
Hey, Mr.

1552
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:30,960
Hello.

1553
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:31,880
Hello

1554
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,960
Yes,
you can go to the right.

1555
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:35,380
Welcome, we
will help you check your tickets.

1556
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,250
I'll take you inside.

1557
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:35,000
Yes, this is Secretary Ha Bo-ram.

1558
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:37,800
An emergency arrest warrant has been
issued, so we will briefly connect to the air bridge.

1559
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,090
Yes?

1560
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:52,960
This is the police. Did you receive a call?

1561
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,630
Yes, this way.

1562
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:01,170
I have been contacted.

1563
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,590
- Are you a police officer?
- Yes, sorry.

1564
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,840
How much time do I have?
How many minutes?

1565
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,210
5 minutes?

1566
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,550
That's enough

1567
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,420
I'm a police officer.

1568
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,550
I'm on official business, so
please move on for a moment.

1569
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,500
Yes, we
ask for your cooperation.

1570
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,590
Yes, please evacuate here.

1571
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:31,750
Uh, hey

1572
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,050
You guys stay still.

1573
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:40,090
Ha, these bastards, they killed
people and rode first class comfortably?

1574
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,050
Is it this guy again?

1575
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:46,880
I made a promise to someone

1576
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,250
They say they will catch you

1577
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:52,460
Are you okay alone?

1578
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,250
This bastard

1579
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,380
Lonely

1580
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,960
Let's go out

1581
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,170
Let's deal with this bastard first.

1582
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,960
I can't go out.

1583
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,750
Hey, I'm a cop.

1584
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,840
I don't hit people really hard
because I'm afraid they might die.

1585
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:23,090
But you can't do it

1586
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:26,920
I'll take it easy

1587
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:42,550
Why doesn't it work because I don't have a knife?

1588
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,130
Sons, without scary

1589
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,800
Asshole cop cunt

1590
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,670
Mr Lee...

1591
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,960
This bastard, for real

1592
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,710
Just lying down, why

1593
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:58,250
You bitch...

1594
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,250
Mistress

1595
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:19,340
ah!

1596
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,000
Madam

1597
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,420
Are you trying to put jam on me?

1598
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,590
I'll apply it!

1599
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:35,750
Madam!

1600
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:17,210
Mistress!

1601
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:26,590
Fun?

1602
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:54,460
Stick to the front, walk while looking
at the feet of the person in front of you

1603
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:59,380
Wow, those cops are
risking their lives, huh?

1604
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,800
Moving applause, Mr. Lee

1605
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,710
Hey, you shot like
this earlier! He avoided it

1606
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,500
- Pababakpak this!
- Ah, that's enough, that's done, that's done

1607
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:07,590
- Huh? That was amazing
- You're Agent Black.

1608
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,710
Oh!

1609
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,840
Pak

1610
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:16,550
Oh, is it just one body?
What about the evidence?

1611
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,920
Oh, uh, are you okay?

1612
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:23,500
The hand...

1613
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:25,880
- Hey, Seok-do!
- Brother!

1614
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,380
Hey, Seokdo, hey

1615
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:29,420
- Good job, good job, huh?
- Are you okay?

1616
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,050
Hey, good
job - Miss!

1617
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:33,710
What is this?
Hey, get treatment quickly, okay?

1618
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,800
Hey, don't worry here,
I'll sort it out, okay? Damn

1619
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,800
Hey, wait a
minute. Who is in charge here?

1620
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,420
Oh, yes,
it's me. Yes, it's me.

1621
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,460
Hello, this is Team Leader Jang Tae-su
of the Metropolitan Investigation Team.

1622
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,460
Ah, yes.

1623
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:45,380
The damage to our first
class plane was so severe.

1624
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:46,340
Come in with me!

1625
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,050
I think you need
to check it out.

1626
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,710
Hey, Seok-do, I
heard something is broken here?

1627
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,880
Let's go.

1628
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,800
Ah, teacher,
I came now and brought...

1629
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,210
You will find out
when you go.

1630
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,090
It's coming out, it's coming
out, it's coming out!

1631
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,960
Did the team
leader plan this operation himself?

1632
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:05,670
Yes, that's right, uh...

1633
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:07,340
Detective Ma,
you investigated this case.

1634
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,500
I heard that you led it yourself.

1635
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:10,170
Please tell me your thoughts.

1636
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:12,340
Detective, please
tell us your thoughts!

1637
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:14,130
- Go in quickly
- Hey, just go in one at a time.

1638
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:15,800
No matter how intelligent crimes become, they become more common every day.

1639
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,420
Even if it's beyond imagination

1640
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,840
Our 120,000 police officers

1641
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,050
We will protect the safety of our citizens

1642
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,710
Mother...

1643
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,590
I kept my promise

1644
01:41:58,840 --> 01:41:59,800
Stop!

1645
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:02,130
Hey, why is the
fucking signal so short?

1646
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,250
Oh, what is it?

1647
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,090
Oppa, I'm a
police officer, what should I do?

1648
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:08,420
Fucked!

1649
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,840
Don't worry!

1650
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,590
Do you know who I am?

1651
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:18,960
Excuse me, you
violated the red light.

1652
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,250
Please present your license

1653
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:22,090
Ah, thank you for your hard work.

1654
01:42:23,130 --> 01:42:24,710
We are the same family

1655
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,880
Get off!

1656
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,550
I will impersonate a police officer
and arrest you on the spot. Get off.

1657
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:37,340
Police! Police!

1658
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,920
FDA, Police Dark Army!

1659
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,460
FDA is the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

1660
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:45,420
'Police' is P, not
F. Get down, you idiot!

1661
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,460
- Policeman Kim! Get off, quickly
- What is it?

1662
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:49,050
Get down, get down, get down!

1663
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,300
- Oppa! Uh? Oh, what should I do
- Get off, quickly.

1664
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,210
Oh, let go! Fuck

1665
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,250
Uh, Agent
Black, what's going on?

1666
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,750
Is this son of a bitch playing me?

1667
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,840
'Police' is not an F

1668
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,340
P, P!

1669
