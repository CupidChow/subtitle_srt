00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,672
(This drama series is fictional,
and the places, persons, organizations,)

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,474
(settings, and events depicted
have been fictionally created.)

3
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,587
With that look,

4
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,824
you should head to an idol agency,
not ssireum.

5
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,063
Is there a reason you joined this show?

6
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,800
I have feelings for someone.

7
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,337
It's been a while,

8
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,906
but I never got to tell her I like her.

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,945
So I want to win
and ask her out with pride.

10
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,348
I don't want to wait any longer.

11
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,155
- Tae Jin Ah.
- Tae Jin Ah.

12
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,590
Your clothes look pretty.

13
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,024
Are you...

14
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,160
Park?

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,867
- Tae Jin Ah.
- Tae Jin Ah.

16
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:48,775
- Tae Jin Ah.
- Tae Jin Ah.

17
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,220
(Episode 7, Does Anyone Love)

18
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,690
So lucky.

19
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,895
Tae Jin Ah.

20
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,898
My goodness.

21
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,204
Is that man waiting for you?

22
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,939
Probably.

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,942
I will get going first.

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,748
She isn't only good at cursing,

25
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,051
but singing and dating as well.

26
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,754
There's so much to learn from her.

27
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,426
Now,

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,664
why don't you prove yourself?

29
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,903
Where do I start?

30
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,538
Yes.

31
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,642
Selling pots and all stainless bowls
at home...

32
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,111
just to go to Tae Jin Ah's concert?

33
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,247
What else?

34
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,549
Right. That Kyung Tae or Dong Tae guy
from church.

35
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,818
You went to ask him out.

36
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,754
Then you farted in front of him...

37
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,657
and cried for the next couple of days.

38
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,060
There's more.

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,094
Stop. That's enough.

40
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,908
Gosh, you jerk.

41
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,011
Do you know how much I was worried?
I thought you dropped dead on the street.

42
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,480
You look well.

43
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,216
Did you meet that taxi driver too?

44
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,458
I'll tell you about it later.

45
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,565
Good to meet you again.

46
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,033
Ms. O Du Ri.

47
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,583
Right.

48
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,753
My name is Park Jun.

49
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,356
What? Jun?

50
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,958
My goodness.

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,427
How ugly.

52
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,397
Jun? Seriously.

53
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,466
I can't believe you. Jun?

54
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,138
Anyway, see you later.

55
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,107
My goodness.

56
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,753
Was Park Gap Yong that attractive?

57
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,924
("Strange Sisters who rushed the stage
and showed a legendary performance")

58
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,293
(The advent of true retro deities)

59
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,705
What's your plan?

60
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,709
An unexpected reaction
at an unexpected timing.

61
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,277
I didn't see this coming.

62
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,946
It's not like we can reveal they're
from our agency just for that reaction.

63
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,383
In terms of marketing strategy,

64
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,486
this is better than clumsy mysticism.

65
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,056
- What?
- Regardless of our will, people are...

66
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,659
paying attention to them,
and it's our job to take advantage of it.

67
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,430
Let's prepare a press release first.

68
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,669
Mother is back, but she's a bit...

69
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,471
No, she's very weird.
You have to come home now.

70
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,577
(Managing Director Office)

71
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,014
That's all I can tell you.

72
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,716
I'm not hurt,

73
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,420
but I'm being forgetful.

74
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,990
If I act weird, don't be startled.

75
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,361
Of course. Don't worry.

76
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,831
I like your new sophisticated look.

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,035
But the way you speak...

78
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:08,936
What about it?

79
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,270
Pardon?

80
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,240
Well, you used to speak in a dialect.

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,442
I'm surprised
that you suddenly got rid of it.

82
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,778
She always knew how to talk without it.

83
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,347
Are you sure you're not hurt?

84
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,283
Why? Are you even worried?

85
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,955
Aside from the way you speak,
you look like a totally different person.

86
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,023
Isn't that what you wanted?

87
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,032
After the near-death experience,
the world seemed different.

88
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,134
It kind of cleared my mind.

89
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,404
Clear your mind.

90
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,007
That's a good thing.

91
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,041
Right, honey?

92
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,013
I dedicated my life to you long enough.

93
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,716
There is a limit to a mother's love.

94
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,086
And I've exceeded the limit.

95
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,125
From now on, it's give and take.

96
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,196
No meddling and no replying.
Let's live our lives now.

97
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,434
What? You got a problem?

98
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,650
We need to take Mother to the hospital.

99
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,451
She said she wasn't ill.

100
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,488
She knew how to speak without a dialect?

101
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,358
If a young woman speaks in a dialect
while running a restaurant,

102
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,360
people would ignore her,
so she avoided using it.

103
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,498
That's how meticulous
your mother-in-law is.

104
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,369
Yet, "give and take"?

105
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,438
Why is she using English
like someone else?

106
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,208
How could you be so apathetic?

107
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,110
She's been attending senior university
and English academy for a while...

108
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,179
to avoid being a shame
to her smart daughter and granddaughter...

109
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,316
for not knowing English.

110
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,784
But...

111
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,154
I've never seen her using it
with pride before.

112
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,023
She seemed determined.

113
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,425
Right?

114
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,127
She's cutting us off, right?

115
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,230
She's definitely not acting like herself.

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,699
But it doesn't mean it's not her.

117
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,101
Something clearly happened...

118
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,737
Dedicated her life to me?

119
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,707
She saw that right through.

120
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,776
Actually this is better.

121
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,779
Now we can talk.

122
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,084
I don't know about that.
She said it's give and take.

123
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,386
I'm worried she might want...

124
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,721
the late rent...

125
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,890
- The late rent?
- Shoot.

126
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,561
Dang it.

127
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,885
Is she really a mother of a daughter?

128
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,210
What are you doing here?

129
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,182
Mal Soon.

130
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,931
Okay. I get that you came to me
because I'm your family.

131
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,033
But...

132
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,770
what the heck are you doing in my house...

133
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,540
pretending to be me?

134
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,809
And I made it clear...

135
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:11,912
that our relationship was over a long ago.

136
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,947
There's no end to family.

137
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,949
Just because you don't want to see me,

138
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,118
you think you can end the family
like that?

139
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,420
It came this far
because I thought it was over.

140
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,523
Every time...

141
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,860
I think about a family,
it makes me furious.

142
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,834
I don't know what you're thinking,
but let's end it here.

143
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,470
- Leave.
- No.

144
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,373
I can't do that.

145
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,807
What?

146
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,342
Now I know the life you had...

147
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,711
and the life you have now.

148
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,880
How can I possibly leave you after that?

149
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,283
What are you saying?

150
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,619
You'll need my help.

151
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,589
What if I refuse?

152
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,527
How are you going to kick me out?

153
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,097
Tell them that you're O Mal Soon.

154
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,971
Two heads are better than one.

155
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,373
What?

156
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,610
Two people working together is
better than one person.

157
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,746
Leave hopeless O Mal Soon to me.

158
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,014
Cherish your time.

159
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,651
And enjoy it.

160
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,356
What are you blabbering about in English?

161
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,426
Do you think this riddle is funny?

162
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,633
Are you being rude
to my mother-in-law again?

163
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,534
No.

164
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,536
I can...

165
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:44,171
explain.

166
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,975
My mother-in-law is
under my protection now.

167
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:51,011
If you startle or bug my mother-in-law
one more time,

168
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,914
I will be really furious.

169
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:57,117
It's not that I don't know how to get mad.
I just don't get mad often.

170
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,386
I don't care that you're a lady.

171
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,789
This is frustrating.

172
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,860
Anyway,

173
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,430
I'll take care of it.

174
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,669
How can you avoid my help under my roof?

175
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,583
Okay.

176
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,318
I will be...

177
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,087
careful from now on.

178
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,095
How dare you?

179
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,598
Glaring those big eyes...

180
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,533
at my mother-in-law?

181
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,470
Mother, are you okay?

182
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,774
We have an unfinished conversation.

183
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,043
You better explain yourself well.

184
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,352
Dang it.

185
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:09,590
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

186
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,295
<i>That quiet man</i>

187
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,868
<i>For some reason</i>

188
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,081
Ae Sim.

189
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,551
How many schedules today?

190
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,753
Do I have to work all night long
like yesterday?

191
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,856
I almost passed out.

192
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,493
So why did you become a hit?

193
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,929
From broadcasting stations to army camps.

194
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,431
Everyone wants Kim Ae Sim.

195
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,433
Even yellow fabric is sold out...

196
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,903
in Dongdaemun Market.

197
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,072
Come on. Let's go.

198
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,111
You...

199
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,246
What are you doing here?

200
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,081
Did you just see the Grim Reaper?

201
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,084
What's that look on your face?

202
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,387
Excuse me, but who are you?

203
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,889
A friend?

204
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,823
A friend?

205
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,559
Right.

206
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,261
Even a thief is still a friend.

207
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,432
She's a waitress at the bar
I used to go to.

208
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,436
I don't know what it's about,
but I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

209
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,507
Let's talk.

210
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,747
Why now?

211
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,751
We have to leave in five.

212
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,429
What are you pulling here?

213
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,764
And what was that? A thief?

214
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,935
If you're not a thief,
should I call you a robber?

215
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:02,769
What?

216
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,272
Your face is on every channel
in this land.

217
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,741
I hear your voice even if I shut my eyes.

218
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:13,013
Because of that,
someone can barely have a sip of water.

219
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,516
Yet you have the guts to go to work?

220
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,886
How can you be wearing this?

221
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,587
This wasn't going to be yours anyway.

222
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,690
- Face it.
- It was mine.

223
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,225
Choon Ho gave it to me.

224
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,794
When he saw me running around...

225
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,564
with heavy beer mugs,

226
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,233
I reminded him of a yellow chick
and bloomed forsythia.

227
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,435
I reminded him of exciting...

228
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,504
and throbbing lyrics.

229
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,240
So what?

230
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,144
You can't even tell
if that's music or bean sprouts.

231
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,817
I met Choon Ho way before you did.

232
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:55,255
Until you appeared, I was his muse.

233
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,526
What? Muse?

234
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,330
Everything's back to its place.

235
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,832
Don't be so sad about a mere song.

236
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,034
Live your life.

237
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,102
And don't come back to me again.

238
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,705
You think you only stole a song?

239
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,975
You stole my dream and my life.

240
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,913
That was the only thing...

241
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,583
this uneducated and poor loner...

242
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,451
liked, was good at,

243
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,887
and the only reason to carry on.

244
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,755
And that's what you stole from me!

245
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:34,027
You gross me out.

246
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,833
And that's not how you sing
"The Man in the Yellow Shirt."

247
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,805
You're not supposed to stand firmly
and act all pretty when you sing it.

248
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,475
Open your eyes softly,

249
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,044
leave your body to the rhythm,

250
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,213
and enjoy singing,

251
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,750
so all listeners would dance.

252
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,152
That's how you're supposed to sing it,
you wench.

253
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,461
We're late. Let's go, Ae Sim.

254
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,558
There's this suspicious girl.

255
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,326
Will you look into her?

256
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,866
What are you watching?

257
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,502
It's Ha Na. We haven't seen her...

258
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,671
smiling like this for years.

259
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,775
My goodness.

260
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,547
I don't see or hear...

261
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,650
anything else.

262
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,387
All I see is the big smile on her face.

263
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,065
Father.

264
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,283
(Missed Call, Chairwoman Kim)

265
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:35,469
You're up early.

266
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,970
Do you want some?

267
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,377
Mother has...

268
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,446
not only changed her style,
but her taste as well.

269
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,116
It's coffee. Americano.

270
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,987
I know that you've changed.

271
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,423
So stop forcing yourself.
Or you'll get sick.

272
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,525
She wants something light for breakfast
from now on.

273
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,864
Your taste changes when you grow old.

274
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:18,145
Good to meet you again. Ms. O Du Ri.

275
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,148
My name is Park Jun.

276
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,950
How are you going to kick me out?

277
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,052
Tell them that you're O Mal Soon.

278
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:25,886
What?

279
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:29,122
How can you avoid my help under my roof?

280
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,092
And my mom doesn't like it
when other people touch her things.

281
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:33,160
Go upstairs.

282
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,496
Leave hopeless O Mal Soon to me.

283
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,399
Cherish your time. And enjoy it.

284
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,368
Shoot.

285
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,041
You almost scared me to death.

286
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,593
Hey.

287
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,566
What's going to happen to Ha Na and me?

288
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,237
You're not going to kick us out
or something...

289
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,907
just for some small mistakes, are you?

290
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,075
Who knows?

291
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,281
You even let people
play rock-paper-scissors three times.

292
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,117
If we show you how hard we try,

293
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,352
would that change your mind?

294
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:36,590
Yes. The video at the park.
It's going viral.

295
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,960
Would that extenuate the situation?

296
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,328
Extenuate, my butt.

297
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,664
It's not like you committed a crime.

298
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,500
All it takes to be a sinner...

299
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,102
is desperation and weakness.

300
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:52,172
Don't worry.

301
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,976
I'll make you a savior, not a sinner.

302
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,544
What?

303
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,814
Remember what I said
after the audition in LA?

304
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,386
I said I would take care of you
no matter what.

305
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,271
Were we...

306
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,276
really in such a serious...

307
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,380
relationship?

308
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:36,850
What?

309
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,187
You don't want that?

310
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,126
No food in the restroom.

311
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,697
No dating at work.

312
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:02,142
If anyone says you're tacky,
I'll make it retro.

313
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:06,213
If anyone says you have an old sentiment,
I'll make it a rich sentiment.

314
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,883
If you cause trouble sometimes,

315
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,286
I'll cover it up as marketing.

316
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:16,790
Don't be scared, Emily.

317
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,868
What...

318
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,506
How can he say he'll take care of me
that easily?

319
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,379
What am I thinking?

320
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,424
I haven't been able to sleep lately.
Coffee is my medicine.

321
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,894
Sorry to make you come
early in the morning.

322
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,662
No, I don't mind.

323
00:24:56,597 --> 00:25:00,234
I've known you since you were 20
as Jun Hyuk's friend.

324
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,736
So I can say we're close, right?

325
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,242
To be honest, I was disappointed in you.

326
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:12,279
I know Han Jun Hyuk is stubborn,

327
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,215
but I expected you to understand me.

328
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,885
I understand you're displeased.

329
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,355
Emily, that girl.

330
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:25,058
She's not just getting on my nerves.
She's too much to handle.

331
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,563
It's embarrassing and painful...

332
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,566
to feel this way about a young girl
especially when she's my artist.

333
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,236
But I guess I'm getting old.

334
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:40,007
I don't want to deal
with any situation or people...

335
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,411
that gives me a hard time.
What should I do?

336
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:46,547
Chairwoman Kim.

337
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,884
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to put you in a spot.

338
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:55,255
It's common for a trainee to quit.

339
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,625
I'll get rid of her in my own way
as soon as possible.

340
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,261
And you just need to come up
with a backup plan.

341
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:04,998
Have you seen the video
of her performance?

342
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,003
She doesn't sing with her head,
but with her body.

343
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:14,675
Her vibe is different
from those who learned it.

344
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:19,313
It makes sense why Daniel favors her.

345
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,583
When I was young,

346
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,153
there was someone like her.

347
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,089
Some people called her a genius.

348
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,126
She was my competitor
for a short period of time.

349
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:38,198
Then I recently found out
that she's running a rice soup place.

350
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:42,002
That was all she had.

351
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,841
Genius talent and popularity.

352
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,945
The public's brief attention.

353
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,116
I'm not interested in that.

354
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,655
Based on the fair evaluation,

355
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:07,160
aren't Elements' members
already determined?

356
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:35,622
Stop.

357
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,091
Don't you move.

358
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:45,732
I'm doing my best...

359
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:48,035
to fulfill my duty as a breadwinner.

360
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,770
But you know what Ji Sook said?

361
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,940
If I'd ever stop my pity job.

362
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,876
She's so tired that she doesn't
even want to talk to me.

Even when I was in the army,

364
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:05,152
not even my senior insulted me like this.

365
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:13,227
Who did your daughter take after?

366
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,563
Are you belittling me?

367
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,736
Well, it's not my business.

368
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,705
I can't meddle with your relationship.

369
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,711

improve my relationship with her?

371
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,083

Gosh, I'm out.

372
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:39,987
I heard that cute koala...

373
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:41,989

376
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:53,066
Well,

377
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,336
I might sound cheap,

378
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,172
but that's how desperate I am.

379
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:00,874
You should be desperate too.

380
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,378

381
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:06,413
something occurs to me.

382
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:11,985
I was a signalman,
so I'm quite good at wiretapping.

383
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:13,687
- Cut to the chase.
- Yes.

384
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:16,723
It seems this incident occurred...

385
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,325
after she communicated
with a woman in her 60s.

386
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,329
Come on.

387
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,832
I'm talking about Ji Sook
starting to act like an adolescent girl.

388
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,036
"Yes. I'll see you at the hospital."

389
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:30,737
Then she returned...

390
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:33,240
with red eyes.

391
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,143
And she was depressed
and refused to eat all day.

392
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:40,414
Anyway, the smoking gun of this mystery...

393
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:44,051
is definitely that woman who called
Ji Sook to the hospital.

00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:14,154
I'll have to talk to the A&R Team
for details.

545
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:15,889
But we got the theme clear.

546
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:16,790
Awesome.

547
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,093
It's new,

548
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:23,997
but don't you think it's too dangerous
to change the title song now?

549
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:25,432
I think we have a chance.

550
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,968
What do you say?

551
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:44,384
Gosh. Stop it. That's bad luck.

552
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,620
Why won't they tell us the result?

553
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,590
They're making me nervous to death.

554
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:53,427
If you have time to bite your nails,
practice.

555
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,862
Look at this.

556
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,397
Is it just me?

557
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,498
Aren't you worried?

558
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,882
As you know, there was a big issue.

559
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:18,452
And as a result,
there will be a big change.

560
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,023
It's ironic that the two who recorded
the lowest in the evaluation...

561
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:26,126
got approved by the public first.

562
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:27,861
But take that as your new motivation.

563
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,071
I'll let it slide this time...

564
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:40,140
because it was just a coincidence.

565
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,742
No more acting on your own.

566
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,079
Even if you record ten million views,

567
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,515
you'll be out. Keep that in mind.

568
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:49,917
Yes.

569
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,717
Yes.

570
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,224
I'm safe.

571
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,325
Let's practice.

572
00:40:58,825 --> 00:40:59,593
Hey.

573
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:05,599
Fair play?

574
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,136
Acting on your own behind our backs
and manipulate the comments?

575
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,671
So much for playing fair.

576
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,573
How can you backstab us like this?

577
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,277
Beating someone fairly
with my own skills...

578
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,013
isn't called backstabbing
but teaching you a lesson.

579
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,717
If it hurts, you should try harder.

580
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:26,053
Don't vent your anger on me.
That's pathetic.

581
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,655
What? Pathetic?

582
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,657
Yes, that's pathetic.

583
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:34,628
What do you lack so much
that you're always restless...

584
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,430
and dying to come at me?

585
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,299
Why can't you just focus on yourself?

586
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:43,871
You think you know everything
and you're always right?

587
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:45,806
You have no idea how annoying that was...

588
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,475
since the day I first saw you?

589
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,577
You think you're the grown-up
and you're so smart?

590
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,915
I get that you're smart,

591
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,483
but stop acting like you're the leader.

592
00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:58,252
Stop showing off...

593
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:00,787
when you have no sense of teamwork.

594
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:02,756
Let's go.

595
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,064
Are you okay?

596
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,501
I said that out of concern.

597
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,237
I didn't realize how it'd sound.

598
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,541
I lived my life in vain.

599
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,476
Don't say that.

600
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,845
You've held back a lot too.

601
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:29,183
It's not easy.

602
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:34,821
(Sung Moon, Mal Soon, Ji Sook)

603
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,190
(Mal Soon versus Ji Sook)

604
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,357
(Where, hospital?)

605
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:39,393
A woman in her 60s.

606
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,765
Is she not her birth mother?

607
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:53,607
No.

608
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:07,321
Her husband died
when Ji Sook was three years old.

609
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:11,692
But why aren't there any pictures
before that?

610
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,994
There should be...

611
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:17,564
a picture of their wedding at least.

612
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,741
She got rid
of all her husband's pictures...

613
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,411
just like pictures of me and Mom...

614
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,849
I wish Mr. Park was here to ask.

615
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,064
Daddy.

616
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,369
Dad.

617
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:09,983
Here.

618
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,789
It's been days.

619
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:19,193
My dad wouldn't leave home
for this long...

620
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:22,362
because he can't trust me.

621
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:26,800
Daddy, you must come back home.

622
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:30,604
What if he's kidnapped?

623
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:37,277
You think your dad is
that easy to deal with?

624
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,414
Your dad is doing just fine...

625
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,083
I think.

626
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,853
Don't worry.

627
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:09,142
This is perfect.

628
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,482
We met again.

629
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,217
Good to see you again.

630
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:18,819
"Again?"

631
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:21,388
Who's he?

632
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:23,056
What?

633
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:32,799
Well...

634
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:37,771
I ran into him by chance before.

635
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:42,075
I'm a new tenant here.

636
00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:48,048
Nice to meet you.

637
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,252
I'm heading in first.

638
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:02,963
That young boy needs to learn his manners.

639
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,003
What's your plan?

640
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,342
I'll just...

641
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:17,711
do my best.

642
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,020
Excuse me.

643
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,122
Are you a celeb?

644
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:30,591
Or a model?

645
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,537
Not bad.

646
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,172
Of course.

647
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,307
I may not be as good as my dad...

648
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,475
Dad.

649
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,477
Dad.

650
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,312
Stop crying and be a man.

651
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,648
Show me an empty room.

652
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,650
This way. Follow me.

653
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:00,921
Wait.

654
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:13,433
Has anyone told you
that you look like Jung Bo Seog?

655
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,304
You look just like him.

656
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:20,040
If I look like a celeb,
do I get a discount?

657
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,375
Of course.

658
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,776
How many followers on your social media?

659
00:47:22,776 --> 00:47:25,879
Ten percent off for over 10,000 followers.
Fifty percent off for over 100,000.

660
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,015
Free if you have over 200,000.

661
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,316
Free, my butt.

662
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:31,218
Gosh.

663
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:33,820
- Where are you going?
- Room Three.

664
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,289
How did he know Room Three was empty?

665
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:39,526
I'll skip the check-in.

666
00:47:42,095 --> 00:47:44,565
Dad will be happy that it's full. Dad.

667
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,868
Dad.

668
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:05,652
So merciless.

669
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,330
You met him only once
in the broadcasting station.

670
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,232
And you were already so close...

671
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:20,801
when you met him again by chance.

672
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:24,538
Are you expecting me to buy that?

673
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:27,374
Did you ever buy anything from me before?

674
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:28,709
Hey, brat.

675
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,612
You're not planning to get
into a relationship, are you?

676
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,046
What?

677
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,483
I'll take that as a no.

678
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,989
Why bother asking me
if you're not going to hear my answer?

679
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,957
I can tell from your face now.

680
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:47,628
Will you stay low until the debut?

681
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:48,962
Please?

682
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:52,466
Gosh.

683
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:01,175
I knew he was being too nice.

684
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,310
That little...

685
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,547
- Isn't it tiring?
- Tell me about it.

686
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:07,915
I just can't...

687
00:49:13,854 --> 00:49:15,155
What's wrong? What are you doing?

688
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,457
What are you looking at?

689
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:26,900
Stop showing off...

690
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,203
when you have no sense of teamwork.

691
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,274
Hey, glutton.

692
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,116
Follow me if you're curious.

693
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:52,593
This is from years of experience,
so listen carefully.

694
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:53,861
I won't say this twice.

695
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:57,798
First of all, the men you must avoid.

696
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,170
A man who likes to hang out
and has many friends.

697
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,171
He's an X.

698
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:05,739
- Why?
- Why?

699
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,242
He'll drink six days a week,

700
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:11,879
so he has no time to see you or money.

701
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:13,180
I see.

702
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,615
What's she doing?

703
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:15,983
Next.

704
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:19,186
And a man who spends a lot on you.

705
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,355
He's also an X.

706
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,991
- What?
- Isn't that a good thing?

707
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:26,193
He has a zero balance in his account.

708
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:30,297
A man like that will soon rip you off.

709
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:31,298
I guarantee you.

710
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:35,669
Also, avoid a kind and good-natured one.

711
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:37,938
- Why?
- Why?

712
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:38,639
But why?

713
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,174
A man like that...

714
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:43,443
will buy insurance for all his friends,
colleagues, relatives,

715
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,979
and everyone he knows
with the money he makes.

716
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:47,915
I see.

717
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:51,685
A man who's friendly
and constantly expressing love.

718
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:54,354
Another X.

719
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:57,124
- Why?
- Isn't that nice?

720
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,661
They'll give you a hard time for the rest
of your lives with a woman problem.

721
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,663
Seriously, that girl...

722
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,965
It's so hard.

723
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:08,702
But if we filter them
for this and that reason,

724
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:10,704
who are we supposed to meet?

725
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:12,039
You're supposed to live alone.

726
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:17,344
Yes.

727
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,349
You must avoid a man
who can't read the room.

728
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:25,886
Especially when he's full of himself.

729
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:32,326
How come your eyes are shining
brighter than when you were practicing?

730
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:34,494
Practice with that enthusiasm.

731
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,301
Yes, producer.

732
00:51:42,836 --> 00:51:43,937
Strange Sisters?

733
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:46,607
They're from my agency. Yes.

734
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:48,942
Yes. Let's do that.

735
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:50,777
I'll meet you soon.

736
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:52,412
Bye.

737
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:57,217
That's enough. Break off.

738
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:01,088
- Bye.
- Bye.

739
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:06,326
Keep going.

740
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:10,697
That's all for the day. Until next time.

741
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,669
It might be awkward
because it's a new singing style,

742
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:17,971
but you must practice. Okay?

743
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:18,805
- Yes.
- Yes.

744
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:20,607
Bye.

745
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,810
- Bye.
- Bye.

746
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:34,154
You looked like Anni and Agnetha.

747
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:38,959
I've been listening to ABBA lately.

748
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:42,262
Anni's attractive low voice
and hollow tone.

749
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:45,299
And Agnetha's high voice
and powerful technique.

750
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:47,534
I thought we could apply that...

751
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,570
to our parts as if we were talking.

752
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:51,638
Not bad.

753
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,675
Don't bother.

754
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,143
I should.

755
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,846
I'm a free rider and a troublemaker.

756
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,448
This is the least I could do for my team.

757
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,022
Well done.

758
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,407
If you're done, let's talk.

759
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:34,681
Thanks to you, I'm busy now.

760
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:36,617
I'm already getting offers.

761
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:38,385
Daniel.

762
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:41,054
No, CEO Han is visiting
the broadcasting station.

763
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,190
You're welcome.

764
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:45,626
By the way,

765
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,295
when are you going to return to the dorm?

766
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,901
I made sure it didn't affect the practice.

767
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,202
But I guess not?

768
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:56,503
No, you're doing great.

769
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:58,071
But I can't say it doesn't bother me.

770
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,910
You and CEO Han...

771
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,945
living in the same neighborhood.

772
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:07,347
You know it's a perfect bait for gossip.

773
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:15,789
My goodness.

774
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,359
Come on.

775
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,564
Even if he and I are
the two last people on earth,

776
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,999
you don't need to worry.

777
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,402
I agree with you.

778
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,238
Daniel doesn't just date anyone.

779
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,476
Daniel...

780
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,146
is having a hard time covering you up.

781
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:42,950
You've crossed the line
with Chairwoman Kim already.

782
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,351
It's going beyond his limit.

783
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:47,554
Calling me a daughter...

784
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:49,723
and pretending to be all cool.

785
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,892
What did she say behind my back?

786
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:53,927
Did she say she doesn't like me?

787
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,329
Emily.

788
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,265
I'll keep it simple.

789
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:02,536
Before I'm an employee here,
I'm Daniel's friend,

790
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:04,605
and before I'm his friend,
I work for this company.

791
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:08,542
Take this as my last warning and behave.

792
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:13,213
Return to the dorm as soon as possible.

793
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:33,200
Thank you so much for coming here
when you're so busy.

794
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,768
I really appreciate it.

795
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:37,037
It was important.
I should've come in person.

796
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,108
These days, YouTube is popular,

797
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:42,809
but once we broadcast it,

798
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:45,779
more people will be aware of them.

799
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:47,848
I'll look forward to good content.

800
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:51,118
I'll reach you as soon
as I talk to my employees.

801
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,186
Yes. I'll see you again.

802
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

803
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:56,350
I missed you so much,

804
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:57,551
Jun Hyuk.

805
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:39,259
Hello.

806
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:44,898
A gift for your girlfriend?

807
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:48,202
Yes, it's for my girlfriend.

808
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,770
Anything you're looking for?

809
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,575
Maybe something like that.

810
00:58:01,014 --> 00:58:02,883
Is that for your granddaughter?

811
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,385
Granddaughter?

812
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:10,157
Yes. My granddaughter.

813
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:14,795
I'm looking for something
for my granddaughter.

814
00:58:17,297 --> 00:58:19,132
What's her size?

815
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:28,609
Take this as my last warning and behave.

816
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:34,014
Return to the dorm as soon as possible.

817
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,449
There isn't much time left.

818
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,421
My goodness.

819
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:46,126
Stop it. What if someone sees us?

820
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:47,761
I already told you many times!

821
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:50,097
It's not like we're an old man
and a young lady anymore.

822
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,632
So what if someone sees us?

823
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:53,600
Don't try to ruin my future.

824
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,969
My agency told me to behave.

825
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:58,472
If I act rashly again, I might get fired.

826
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,377
Go now.

827
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,116
It's you again.

828
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,753
- What are you doing?
- What?

829
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:16,690
No, I was just...

830
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,058
We were talking as you can see.

831
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:23,297
Talking?

832
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:31,438
Why did you lose so much weight?

833
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:35,242
Are you sure they're not exploiting you?

834
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,477
Go home.

835
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:40,380
- What?
- Go.

836
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:43,016
That's up to her.

837
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,786
A trainee isn't your employee.

838
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:49,423
You've only met her once.

839
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,592
Who are you to cross the line?

840
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:53,861
I can always get to know her.

841
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:57,331
We turned out to be neighbors.
Maybe we're meant to be.

842
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:59,433
Stop the lame jokes.

843
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,401
Stay away from her.

844
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:03,337
- What?
- What's wrong?

845
01:00:03,337 --> 01:00:05,739
He's obviously a stalker.

846
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:06,874
It's best...

847
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,443
to eradicate stalkers early.

848
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,712
What? Stalkers? Eradicate?

849
01:00:12,212 --> 01:00:14,014
Are you done?

850
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,782
If I keep going,
it won't be in words anymore.

851
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:18,485
Seriously...

852
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:46,346
(Who Is She!)

853
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:47,681
Do you really want to do this?

854
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:48,916
You started it.

855
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:49,783
That's so cold.

856
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:50,918
Do you want to take this to the end?

857
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:51,919
I'll tell you the truth.

858
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,120
Stop it.

859
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:54,655
He is...

860
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,324
The menu and the presentation.
It's Mother's food.

861
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:59,293
Since when were you left-handed?

862
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:01,695
O Mal Soon?

863
01:01:01,695 --> 01:01:04,431
Did you have fun playing with us
until now?

864
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:07,334
You don't stop people
from going on dates, do you?

865
01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:10,470
Is he flirting with me?

866
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,507
I didn't realize it
when everyone else could see it.

867
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:15,075
Anyway, I'm not going to break it anymore.
