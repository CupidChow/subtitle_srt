behind my back.

51

is a bigger jerk than the one
who stole it.

by someone else.

55

- No.

I don't care about saving my face.

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,665
I should still be honest.

79
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,002
I know that's the answer,
but I do not have it in me to tell her.

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,272
I'll find a way by all means necessary
and tell her.

81

82

00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,907
The girl's gone,
and no one could reach you.

183
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,509
It must have been chaos at work.

184
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,780
Why is everyone going overboard?

185
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,614
What do you mean?

186
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,518
It was you who brought her from the US,
looked after her,

187
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,953
and put her in the center.

188
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,455
I heard you. Stop making a fuss.

189
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,090
Check on the other girls.
Don't let this influence them.

190
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,328
I told them she's on vacation.

191
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,763
I realized after this incident...

192
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,233
that know nothing about Emily.

193
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,936
Even if she makes her debut,
what if something comes up later?

194
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,639
Like school violence or criminal record?

195
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,210
(O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup)

196
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,086
Hello, ma'am.

197
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,055
Here.

198
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,325
Be careful.

199
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,328
Good morning.

200
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,963
Say it out loud.

201
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,665
- Bring it.
- Yes.

202
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,951
I did my best to teach them.

203
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,288
Is it not good?

204
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,025
Well.

205
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,995
It doesn't smell.
You removed the blood just right.

206
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,965
The temperature and time are just right.

207
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,769
You didn't go overboard
to meet young people's tastes.

208
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,738
You must've worked hard
to make your brother a decent man.

209
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,173
It's getting pretty good.

210
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,445
I'm learning from him with my best.

211
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,547
By the way,

212
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,417
are you sure you quit smoking?

213
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,552
Of course.

214
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,956
You always told me
I'd lose the taste and customers...

215
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,757
while he goes in and out to smoke.

216
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:14,761
Ma'am.

217
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:19,399
Young Seok has learned his lesson, ma'am.

218
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,001
Stop speaking up for him.

219
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,637
By the way,

220
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,907
when are you going to get rid
of those disgusting oriental paintings?

221
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,676
Do you want me to scrub it off
with sandpaper?

222
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,579
I know it is kind of scary.

223
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,047
- Cover it up.
- Okay.

224
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,251
Ma'am, it takes quite a long time
to get rid of it.

225
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,053
I'll make sure to get rid of it clean
on our day off.

226
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,290
Anyway, let's begin the takeover.

227
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,858
Let's keep the money issue clean.

228
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,660
Do you mean it?

229
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,962
Are you really transferring
this restaurant to us now?

230
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,731
Of course.

231
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,267
She never talks nonsense.

232
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,334
Ma'am.

233
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,505
By the way, I feel so bad
for your son-in-law.

234
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,440
Are you sure about this?

235
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,942
What do you mean?

236
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,145
You think he'd eye on a small store
like this?

237
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,382
Honestly, he did.

238
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,450
He looked at me like this...

239
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,958
I heard his academy isn't doing so well.

240
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,859
I see.

241
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:23,063
Mind your own business and keep the taste.

242
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:27,034
The moment I hear the taste changed,
I'm going to pull down the sign...

243
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,635
and open a convenience store.

244
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,270
Are you leaving?

245
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,840
Ma'am, goodbye.

246
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,975
Take care.

247
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,245
What do they take Min Seok for?

248
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,095
Who are they to gossip about him
and act up?

249
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,421
Why couldn't he have done better
when he had a chance?

250
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,592
What is it now?

251
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,897
(My Sweetie, Ha Na)

252
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,969
Ms. O! Time for your lesson.

253
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,543
<i>Perhaps still I'm so weak</i>

254
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,248
<i>I didn't think I'd get a chance again</i>

255
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,717
<i>No matter how much I try</i>

256
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:20,287
<i>I end up looking for you again</i>

257
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,913
<i>You mess with my head</i>

258
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:23,580
<i>I'm still weak</i>

259
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,075
<i>Get ready</i>

260
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:26,693
<i>I'm ready for the moment with you</i>

261
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,029
<i>Every day I miss that night</i>

262
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,231
<i>Your eyes on me blow my mind already</i>

263
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,830
<i>I'm betting everything on this emotion</i>

264
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,867
<i>Just stay with me</i>

265
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:38,338
<i>My heart continues to spread and grow</i>

266
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:42,242
<i>It's burning like a flame</i>

267
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>Burn with love</i>

268
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,382
You are something.

269
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,449
Sweetie.

270
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,253
Have you been singing instead of studying?

271
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,223
No way. This is nothing.

272
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,027
No.

273
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,496
You look like you've been slacking off.

274
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,898
No way.

275
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,234
How did you know?

276
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,803
I couldn't focus on studying
at all lately.

277
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,407
If you don't want to, don't.
Just have fun.

278
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,643
- Really?
- Sure.

279
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,214
If you have fun like there's no tomorrow,

280
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:23,217
Seoul National University
may not accept you,

281
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,420
but Seoul Station will.

282
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,222
Grandma!

283
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,726
Forget it.
Are you ready to start practicing?

284
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,062
- Me?
- Ms. O's turn.

285
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,030
- What?
- Ms. O's turn.

286
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,766
Don't speak English.

287
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:43,537
Here we go. Ms. O, let's get it.

288
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:44,738
Yes.

289
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,307
("The Man in the Yellow Shirt")

290
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:56,617
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

291
00:16:56,617 --> 00:17:01,989
<i>That quiet man</i>

292
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,657
<i>For some reason</i>

293
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,494
What was that? I just got started.

294
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,829
No.

295
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,598
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

296
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:12,466
This is wrong.

297
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,938
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

298
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:18,939
This is right.

299
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,073
Come on.

300
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,379
Do I have to sing so cheesy?

301
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,246
Ms. O.

302
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,551
Trot is all about twists.

303
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,853
The vocal trend now is
half air and half sound.

304
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,591
Strike the judges' brains, not their ears.

305
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,928
A single blow that will make
the original singer Kim Ae Sim cry.

306
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,829
That's not the problem.

307
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,034
<i>For me too</i>

308
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,837
I'm worried about that part the most.

309
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,575
In the old days,

310
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,744
even a higher pitch was a piece of cake.

311
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,746
But I can't do it anymore.

312
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,749
Of course. Your vocal cords age too.

313
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,318
Right.

314
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,222
My body is crawling like a squid on fire.

315
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,057
My voice wouldn't be an exception.

316
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,728
It's not my wrinkles nor dim sight.

317
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,366
The fact that I can't sing is
what saddens me the most.

318
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,109
Don't be like that.

319
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:25,822
Why are you acting so weak?

320
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,543
How are your knees? Are they okay?
You said they were in pain.

321
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,145
That's what happens when you age.

322
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:37,050
Still, you're all I have.

323
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,521
Your mom doesn't even care.

324
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,160
Sometimes I'm confused...

325
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,896
whether you're Mom's mom or Dad's mom.

326
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,533
Are you sure she's your daughter?
You can tell me the truth.

327
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,468
What are you saying?

328
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:59,373
I mean, Mom is such an old fossil.

329
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,375
She'd be worse at work.

330
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,776
Seeing how she treats you or me,

331
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:05,012
she must be an eyesore there too, right?

332
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,947
That wouldn't work on young people.

333
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,849
She's lucky if they don't shun her.

334
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,286
So,

335
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:15,389
you can't join the show
because of a mere concert?

336
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,326
Do you think that makes sense?

337
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,963
It's not just a concert.
I waited three years for it.

338
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,876
And it doesn't make sense
to force me to work...

339
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,168
outside the work hours.

340
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,171
What's this girl saying?

341
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,508
It's inappropriate to call me a girl.

342
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,343
- Cha Joo Young!
- What's going on?

343
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,946
Ms. Ban.

344
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,283
The show schedule changed...

345
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,852
to after Ms. Yang goes on maternity leave.

346
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,589
So I asked Joo Young to go instead.

347
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:52,259
Let's be honest. You didn't ask me.

348
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,394
So did you refuse?

349
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:56,697
I also have plans.

350
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:00,267
But you prepared the show together
with Ms. Yang.

351
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,070
If Ms. Yang can't do it, you have to go.

352
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,204
That's not true.

353
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,674
Technically, that's Ms. Yang's problem.

354
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,311
It's not like she asked me in person.

355
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,981
If you force me like it's my obligation,

356
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,049
it's unfair.

357
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,385
There you go again.

358
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,787
Do you know that people call you
Ms. Unfair?

359
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,357
People call you Ms. Unfair
because you say unfair all the time.

360
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,993
Can I report that...

361
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,494
for harassment at work?

362
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,463
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.

363
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,565
Joo Young.

364
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,600
When's the show?

365
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,801
The 27th.

366
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,539
I'll go.

367
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,207
What?

368
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,476
Please, don't. I'll go.

369
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,412
Why do positions matter in a team agenda?

370
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,648
Whoever can make it should go.

371
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:48,615
But still...

372
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,618
- And Joo Young.
- Yes?

373
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,053
You have a point.

374
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,622
They could ask you,
but they can't force you.

375
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,626
But this show was specially ordered
by the CEO,

376
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,828
and the PR team poured all the budget.

377
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,698
Every famous figure in this field
will be there,

378
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,567
and it'll make the headline.

379
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,971
I thought you were fast and quick
at learning,

380
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,439
so I wanted to give you a chance.

381
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,640
Ms. Ban, I...

382
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,409
What you thought was reasonable...

383
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,278
often turns out to be not so reasonable.

384
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,214
The faster you realize it,
the more you'll benefit from it.

385
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,256
What is this?

386
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,829
What is all this?

387
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,866
Tell me the truth.

388
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,670
Are you sure nothing happened
between you and Emily?

389
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,308
She ran away
because she couldn't handle it.

390
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,177
That happens a lot.

391
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:52,679
She practiced
until she injured her knees...

392
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,016
and watched her weight
by drinking only two cups of coffee a day.

393
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,585
Yet she suddenly couldn't handle it
and ran away before the debut?

394
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,057
I'm not blaming you.

395
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:08,061
But you need to tell me the truth.

396
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,163
Even the most minor and smallest detail.

397
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,933
Well, her period...

398
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,970
I heard her worrying
about how her period stopped.

399
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,838
What?

400
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:22,576
I heard her calling a doctor before.

401
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,579
Her voice wasn't in good condition either.

402
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,582
She couldn't sing high notes,
and her voice kept cracking.

403
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:32,119
She told the vocal trainer she had a cold,
and she'd be better in a few days.

404
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,788
Her condition was wasted a long ago.

405
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,791
Do you know how much we struggled
to defend her?

406
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,294
Maybe she went back to the US.

407
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:41,495
To see her mom.

408
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,464
Is that what you want?

409
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,340
If she was going to quit,

410
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,043
she would've grabbed her passport first.

411
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:00,447
I just wanted to check
if something happened.

412
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,250
Why don't you worry about getting better
while Emily's not here?

413
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,286
You don't have time for this.

414
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:09,790
Let me check.

415
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:17,397
I'm home.

416
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,766
Did you have a good day? Did you eat?

417
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:20,767
Yes.

418
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:24,838
Mom.

419
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,640
Yes?

420
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,576
Dad's deathday and grave.

421
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:32,379
Do you really not know?

422
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,649
If I'd known,
I would've held a ritual a long ago.

423
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,753
He left without a word.

424
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,422
Only the skies may know where he is.
How am I supposed to know?

425
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:46,193
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

426
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,700
You lived without him for nearly 50 years.

427
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,372
Imagine as if he never existed.

428
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,276
Easy for you to say.

429
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,241
(Total Profit Rate)

430
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,376
First place. First place in profit.

431
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:37,611
First place from the back.

432
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,713
(Total Profit Rate, minus 80.06 percent)

433
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:45,285
I love it.
At least the colors are matching.

434
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:46,386
I love it so much.

435
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:49,990
I'm home.

436
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,160
How was your day?

437
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,163
I'm going to wash up.

438
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,331
Wait. Honey.

439
00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,299
What do you think...

440
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,770
about closing the academy?

441
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,005
Do you have an alternative?

442
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,807
You know the patent I issued?

443
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,243
I think I'll be getting an investor soon.

444
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,512
Because the idea is so good,
I don't need a lot of seed money...

445
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,449
It lasted exactly three years,
the academy principal title.

446
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,018
Is that the longest?

447
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,754
I know you're not happy with it.

448
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,656
But this time, I swear...

449
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:25,959
I remember what you said when you opened
the academy three years ago.

450
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,662
You'd pay off all the debt
in five years...

451
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,031
and buy the same size apartment
you lost...

452
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,566
to put an end to living
with your mother-in-law.

453
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,968
You said you'd endure it until then.

454
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,471
I was going to.

455
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:38,739
Every time people came
to offer an investment...

456
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,008
or instigate me to start a new business,

457
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:42,175
I turned them all down.

458
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,112
You know you're the only choice
I made in my life...

459
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,881
by going against my mom, right?

460
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,084
And what I hate more than death is...

461
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:53,287
regretting that I should've listened
to her.

462
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:56,623
But what now?

463
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,093
I think I'm going to say that soon.

464
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:14,208
Just be mad...

465
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,809
or curse at me.

466
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,212
Maybe just punch me in the face instead.

467
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,955
The person you have reached is not...

468
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,443
It's becoming more like a team.

469
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,045
If you were under pressure, let's...

470
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:58,552
What are you doing?

471
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,053
Have a sense of responsibility.

472
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:10,230
No Emily, no debut.

473
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,266
I bet everything on you.

474
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,908
Enjoy your meal.

475
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,676
Thank you.

476
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:26,647
Here.

477
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,650
What were you doing till now
without having dinner?

478
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,952
Eat up.
It's your favorite braised hairtail.

479
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,754
That's why I brought you here.

480
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:36,156
I'm going to travel for a while
once things settle.

481
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,993
I should start looking...

482
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,262
for where I'm going to live
and how I'm going to make a living.

483
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,799
You always have to ruin my appetite.

484
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:50,370
To be honest,
this is my first proper meal today too.

485
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,241
The girls are getting
a good response already.

486
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,076
It'll get even better once we reveal them.

487
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:59,313
Yes, let's talk again
when this project is over.

488
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:00,681
Don't just say it. Promise me.

489
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:01,582
Enough.

490
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,019
Let me enjoy my meal in peace.

491
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,466
I worked so hard to give you birth,

492
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,768
and you don't even thank me?

493
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,374
Enjoy it at least.

494
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:30,277
Let's just dine out next time.

495
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,446
Why bother cooking in the morning?

496
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,281
I'll eat a lot instead.

497
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,349
Count me in.

498
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,087
Awesome.

499
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:41,755
- Here.
- Thank you for the food.

500
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,559
By the way,

501
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,832
have you heard about "Legendary Songs?"

502
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:54,001
I heard it's very popular these days.

503
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,502
Of course, I do.

504
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,338
Why do you ask?
Are you going to join the show?

505
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:00,707
Yes, I'm thinking about it.

506
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,076
Don't.

507
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,748
Not anyone can do that.

508
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,984
Aging makes you childish.

509
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:13,453
That makes me want to do it even more.

510
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,591
You'll be humiliated and regret it.

511
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,193
My life's been full of regrets.

512
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,496
What could be worse
than getting eliminated?

513
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:23,764
I wouldn't regret it.

514
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,999
Just like those who offered
to promote your restaurant.

515
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:27,834
You know
what broadcasting stations are like.

516
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,737
They're gathering old people
to sell their stories and appeal to pity.

517
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,642
What? Do you find me embarrassing?

518
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,778
Am I humiliating?

519
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,018
If you don't make it,
the whole neighborhood will find out.

520
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,687
It'll be kind of embarrassing.

521
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:49,623
She's right. You don't sound
as good as before.

522
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,092
And you also have a knee problem.

523
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,393
If you get humiliated...

524
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:55,229
Stop saying that.

525
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,798
Is it my fault that I'm old?

526
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,467
I was you when I was young.

527
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,302
You'll be me when you age.

528
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,940
Come on. Don't be so upset.

529
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,141
You have my full support.

530
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:12,112
I saw people sending video messages...

531
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:13,981
to confess and reconcile.

532
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:17,484
You could take this chance to improve
your relationship with Ji Sook, right?

533
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,622
What's wrong with my relationship
with her?

534
00:30:21,622 --> 00:30:25,025
Let's admit it. You're not that close.

535
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,661
The lady who comes here
to inspect the gas.

536
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:31,498
She thought I was her son,
and you were the daughter-in-law.

537
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:38,238
How can a confession in front of a camera
be sincere when you can't do it in person?

538
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,473
It's all fake.

539
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,744
Ha Na, you have a mock exam
next month, don't you?

540
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:45,546
Yes.

541
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,948
Don't rely on your grade and focus.

542
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:50,450
If you mess up on the SAT,
you won't get to go to SNU.

543
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,289
Why pressure her when she's eating?

544
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:03,630
- Thank you for the food.
- Are you leaving already?

545
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:07,401
Eat more. You need to eat to recharge.

546
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,502
I had enough.

547
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:11,972
Besides,

548
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:14,341
no family has breakfast together
like this these days.

549
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,877
I better get a place on my own soon.

550
00:31:19,513 --> 00:31:22,482
How will you get a place
on your own when we couldn't?

551
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,750
You wish.

552
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,354
Great. Get a place on your own, now.
Ha Na is free!

553
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,691
You're so annoying.

554
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:34,461
Bye.

555
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:41,335
That kid. Who did she take after?

556
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:44,004
Leave her alone. I did just fine...

557
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,607
even though no one ever made
breakfast for me before.

558
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,256
No one made you breakfast?

559
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,658
It's not that I didn't, but I couldn't.

560
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,728
What a morning.

561
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:11,999
It must feel great to break
her old mom's heart.

562
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:15,269
I can only carry on because I'm breathing.

563
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,212
Lady, hop in.

564
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:28,982
Act like your age.

565
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:33,587
Seriously, you need to cut it out if you
don't want people to talk about you.

566
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:36,423
What are you wearing?

567
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:38,292
It's so tight.

568
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,893
Those pants and what is this?

569
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,329
Shame on you.

570
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:46,033
Be proud to have a male friend like me.

571
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,603
With this hardware and software,
I'm still good.

572
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,706
- Here.
- What?

573
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:53,840
What is this?

574
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,210

Ms. Jang.

577
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,988
You're doing very well.

578
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,323
Of course.

579
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:13,026
The best love of all is
the husband's love.

580
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:15,329
When it's cold, he bundles me up.

581
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,631
When it's hot, he wipes my sweat.

582
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:21,869
Only those who have been loved
understand it.

583
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:26,673
What's so great about having a husband?
You have no money.

584
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,809
Let it slide.

585
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,450
Ms. O.

586
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,820
Are you having a hard time today?

587
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:44,224
A crush or a first love. Anything is fine.

588
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,193
No pressure.

591
00:33:56,537 --> 00:34:00,007
Even a criminal has the right
to remain silent.

592
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,975
Let me use that too.

593
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,345
Ms. O, what's wrong?

594
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:06,947
My husband left me when I was young,

595
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:09,516
and I lived alone for nearly 50 years.

596
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:12,586
Are you expecting me to write about love?

597
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:16,323
Read the room
just like my granddaughter says.

598
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,425
You won't be able to renew the contract
like that.

599
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:19,560
You're right.

600
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,662
I should've known better.

601
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,407
If you don't want to do it,
just don't do it.

602
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,175
Why would you get so angry?

603
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:38,078
She just wouldn't leave me alone...

604
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,680
and kept poking me.

605
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,616
Love isn't only for men and women.

606
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,285
Love for parents or love for children.

607
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,087
When you think about it,
there are many kinds.

608
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:49,423
What love?

609
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,293
Love for my father who made me
care for him until he died?

610
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:56,597
Love for my mother who abandoned
her young daughter to her sick husband...

611
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,165
to start a new life?

612
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:04,504
A love for my daughter who doesn't
thank me for her birthday meal?

613
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:05,873
What love?

614
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,876
For a very long time...

615
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:11,812
For six decades,

616
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:15,983
your male friend
who's always been there for you.

617
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,051
Love for that male friend.

618
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,254
Right.

619
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:22,756
You acted like you were into me,

620
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:25,425
and then you took off to Vietnam.
Whatever.

621
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,728
When I came back,
you were already pregnant.

622
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,930
Let's not talk about the painful past.

623
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:34,635
Why don't we grab something good
to refresh?

624
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,970
I'm busy. Besides, I'm not in the mood.

625
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,473
Then what do you feel like doing?

626
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:42,442
How can everyone be so careless?

627
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:45,010
Do you really not know
what day it is today?

628
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:46,547
What?

629
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:49,216
- They're here.
- They're here.

630
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,166
Why did you call so many?

631
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,936
Because you wouldn't.

632
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:10,504

Your girl group Elements
became very hot...

637
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,826
because you planned everything...

from member selection and production.

639
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:36,697
Could you describe the group concisely?

640
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:38,966
Concisely?

641
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,904
I can say my future relies on them.

00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:29,149
<i>For some reason he appeals to me</i>

719
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:34,922
<i>Although he's not good-looking</i>

720
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:39,960
<i>He looks strong</i>

721
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,932
<i>I like him</i>

722
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:49,436
<i>For some reason he makes my heart flutter</i>

723
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,075
<i>This strange feeling</i>

724
00:42:55,075 --> 00:43:00,113
<i>I've never felt this before</i>

725
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:05,185
<i>I wonder</i>

726
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:10,090
<i>If he has feelings for me too</i>

727
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,295
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

728
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:18,665
<i>That quiet man</i>

729
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,734
What's wrong? She was doing just fine.

730
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:24,071
<i>For some reason I like him</i>

731
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:29,018
<i>For some reason he appeals to me</i>

732
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:41,121
Thank you.

733
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,291
It sounds like she used
to be a good singer.

734
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,697
Becoming a singer...

735
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:54,968
is not something that anyone can just do.

736
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,423
Honey, you're home.

737
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:04,504
Honey.

738
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,673
Are you okay? Honey.

739
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,483
Are you okay?

740
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:22,222
You know you can't drink.
Why did you drink so much?

741
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:23,824
Where's Ha Na?

742
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:25,592
She just came home.

743
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,228
She was all serious saying
she has something to tell us.

744
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,501
I went for it with determination,

745
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,337
and I went down with determination.

746
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,775
How humiliating, O Mal Soon.

747
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:44,444
Don't be like that.

748
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,114
I wanted to...

749
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:52,753
I just wanted to sing well
for everyone to see.

750
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:57,057
Don't think about anything
and just go to sleep.

751
00:45:57,858 --> 00:45:59,893
Sleep tight.

752
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:00,894
Okay?

753
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:03,864
On a day like this,

754
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,568
I wish I'd never wake up again.

755
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:09,636
Watch your mouth.

756
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:12,172
What? You want to give up on what?

757
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,908
What? Isn't that Ji Sook?

758
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:19,146
Honey, did I hear that right?

759
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:21,548
Yes.

760
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,618
I'm quite drunk today.

761
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:29,723
Are you trying to drive us insane?

762
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:32,926
You suddenly want to give up
on repeating the SAT?

763
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:35,696
I've been sending you signs
that I didn't want to study,

764
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:39,132
but you always ignored them.

765
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,602
What are you saying?

766
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,871
Living as a smart daughter like you...

767
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,873
doesn't make me happy at all.

768
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,008
I want to do what I want.

769
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,043
Choi Ha Na, are you...

770
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:55,249
Wait. What did I just hear?

771
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,183
Mother.

772
00:46:57,017 --> 00:46:59,052
Even if you graduate
from a prestigious university,

773
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:01,505
your resume will barely make it
to my company.

774
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:05,626
And this girl who's out of her mind
refuses to get into a university.

775
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:09,162
What does this have to do
with your company?

776
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:11,732
I feel confident to be well off
even without working there.

777
00:47:12,432 --> 00:47:14,668
At least I'll be way more
happier than you.

778
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,736
Ha Na!

779
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:20,908
Stop yelling at her
and listen to what she has to say.

780
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:24,945
I know she can be crazy sometimes,
but she's not stupid.

781
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:28,415
That's how she behaves in front
of her parents when she's not stupid?

782
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:30,751
Defending her isn't all.

783
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:32,986
Yelling at her isn't all either.

784
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:35,556
That's not how you raised me.

785
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,225
So much for defending me,

786
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:40,327
you always scolded me
even for the smallest mistake,

787
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:41,862
so people don't say I don't have a father.

788
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:42,796
Honey.

789
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:45,933
So?

790
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,703
Are you struggling to make ends meet
or talk all you want?

791
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,942
I'm the miserable one for wasting my life
after making soup all my life.

792
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,744
Yelling at your husband and child
wasn't enough,

793
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,013
now you yell at your old mom?

794
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:01,448
What more do you need?

795
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:03,016
Not again.

796
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:06,320
"I did this for you. I did that for you."

797
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,622
Do you know how much that suffocates me?

798
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:13,360
Besides,

799
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:17,431
you say I don't understand my daughter,
and I'm coldhearted.

800
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:20,634
But what can I do?
That's what I had for a mom.

801
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:23,203
You never showed me otherwise.

802
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,140
Honey, stop it.

803
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:34,615
You're drunk.

804
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:36,817
It's alcohol talking.

805
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:37,985
That's enough. Go to sleep now.

806
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,621
I don't feel like arguing with you either.

807
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:41,655
No.

808
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,391
I couldn't be more sober.

809
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:48,562
You don't know anything.

810
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,231
You never told me to study,

811
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,066
but I studied on my own,
got a job on my own,

812
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,434
and got promoted on my own.

813
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,938
You don't understand what it's like
to worry about your child.

814
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,507
Ban Ji Sook. That's enough.

815
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,746
Do you really want to do this today?

816
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,183
Is it my fault that your daughter wants
to go against your will?

817
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:11,752
Yes.

818
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:15,255
You're that great. You're so great

819
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,391
that you changed your diapers
since you were born,

820
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:20,327
fed yourself, and grew up on your own.

821
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,530
I didn't do anything for you.

822
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,866
I don't even deserve to be called a mom.

823
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:28,402
- Mother.
- Ha Na is my daughter.

824
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:30,871
Whatever happens,
I'll raise her on my own.

825
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,806
So stop telling me what to do.

826
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:37,644
Yes.

827
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:42,683
I can barely hear and see.

828
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,354
And you are telling me
to ignore everything I hear and see?

829
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,223
Fine.

830
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:53,460
Since you're at it, get it off your chest.

831
00:49:54,528 --> 00:49:58,665
If you hate me that much,
how did you live with me all these years?

832
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:00,901
Do you want me to leave?

833
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,340
Is that what you want?

834
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:05,906
Mother, don't be like that.

835
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:08,008
Say you're sorry.

836
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:09,643
Honestly,

837
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:13,780
if we lived separately,

838
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:16,149
this wouldn't have happened.

839
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,088
We did live together for too long.

840
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,221
Grandma.

841
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,624
- Mother.
- Grandma, where are you going?

842
00:50:57,624 --> 00:50:58,492
Mother.

843
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:02,829
Mother.

844
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:24,484
For no use, no reason,

845
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:27,287
I lived too long.

846
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:52,412
Hello?

847
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,281
Where are you going?

848
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:57,851
If you get rained on a day like this,
you'll get sick.

849
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:02,022
Hop in. I'll drive you.

850
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,936
Where is your destination?

851
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:52,839
I don't know.

852
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:55,375
Let me just...

853
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:58,679
avoid the rain for now.

854
00:53:00,314 --> 00:53:01,715
Okay.

855
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:20,133
What a day.

856
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:01,341
Where am I?

857
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:31,271
He got me to the just right place...

858
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:37,544
since I'll be leaving soon.

859
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:46,153
Anyone there?

860
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,755
I want to take a picture.

861
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:53,026
I'm coming.

862
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:04,605
Wait. When did you get changed?

863
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:07,908
What happened to your taxi?

864
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:10,878
Why is there a camera?

865
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:14,882
I've taken photos for my whole life.

866
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:15,983
What taxi?

867
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:20,120
Have you ever seen anyone
who looks as good as me?

868
00:55:22,456 --> 00:55:27,227
But you just drove me here in your taxi...

869
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:30,364
Are you here to take a portrait?

870
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:33,667
Yes.

871
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:40,841
Judging by the photos,

872
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,242
you must be good.

873
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:46,213
Take one good picture of me.

874
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:49,349
You're beautiful. It'll come out well.

875
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:54,354
Wait. One second.

876
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:07,728
Don't frown. Smile.

877
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:10,464
Tilt your head.

878
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:11,398
Good.

879
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:13,901
Youth never comes twice.

880
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:18,906
One, two...

881
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,865
<i>Toad, toad, let's trade an old house
for a new one</i>

882
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:51,038
<i>Toad, toad, let's trade an old house
for a new one</i>

883
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:52,873
What are you doing here?

884
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,375
Where are your parents?

885
00:57:57,578 --> 00:58:01,882
<i>Toad, toad, your house is on fire</i>

886
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:06,134
<i>Hurry with a pitchfork</i>

887
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:12,753
What...

888
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,122
That face.

889
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,258
Whose face is that?

890
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,535
Where am I?

891
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,103
Up in the skies or in the underworld?

892
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:33,640
My Lord.

893
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:36,210
I was miserable to death,

894
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,178
but it didn't mean I wanted to die.

895
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,753
There's light,
so it can't be the underworld.

896
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,798
It hurts, so it's not a dream.

01:00:57,124 --> 01:01:01,628
Do I look like a grandma
or a young lady to you?

900
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:04,565
Your grandma seemed to be doing well.

901
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:05,895
Her style has changed.

902
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:07,958
Blood is more accurate than eyes.

903
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:09,503
Mom, it's you, right?

904
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,672
- What do you want to eat?
- What?

905
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:12,739
We've found Emily.

906
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:14,741
Emily or family.

907
01:01:14,741 --> 01:01:16,476
I don't know you.

908
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,313
I don't care if it was an accident
or memory loss, or if you're just acting.

909
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:20,781
You have three months until your debut.

910
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:22,316
Just live as the person I'm looking for.

911
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:24,351
Are you telling me to learn this
in three months?

912
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,653
How ridiculous.
