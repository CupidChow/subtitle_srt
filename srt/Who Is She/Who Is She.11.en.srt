188
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,174
Stop it, Mother!

189
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,085
Is that what you're talking about?
That she's my mom?

190
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,122
You've used it once already.

191
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,692
Look who's talking.

192
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,295
What's so good
about what's already happened in the past?

193
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,764
It's over already.

194
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:24,698
Right.

195
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,168
If I gave up on my career to cover you up,

196
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,404
you should've stopped.

197
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,605
That's not how my heart works.

198
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,073
At first,

199
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,475
I was going to return to the US
after seeing your face.

200
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,010
But...

201
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,814
Anyway, I only wanted...

202
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,616
to get rid of that weird wench
next to you.

203
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,652
You better get Chairwoman Kim
out of your plan.

204
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,021
If you disclose it,

205
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,524
that will only be added to your crime.

206
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,894
I have nothing more to say.

207
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,197
- Jun Hyuk...
- If I call the police here,

208
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,499
it'll only worsen your situation.

209
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,783
Jun Hyuk...

210
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,319
You...

211
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,522
Did you...

212
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:23,657
No, right?

213
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,565
So you...

214
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,933
When did you know?

215
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,737
Jun Hyuk, when you...

216
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,940
When you retired...

217
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,308
Was that...

218
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,510
Was that because of me?

219
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:46,747
Don't worry.

220
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,516
Yoo Ji An can't disclose it.
She's not stupid.

221
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:51,685
No.

222
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,421
No, I will...

223
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,758
I will say it.

224
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,626
I will...

225
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,362
hold the press conference and confess it.

226
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,732
I will say everything,
so she has nothing on...

227
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,633
No.

228
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,771
I'll protect myself.

229
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,308
As I have always done.

230
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,581
No, Jun Hyuk...

231
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,549
I...

232
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,854
Is everything okay?

233
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:31,545
Thanks.

234
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,988
Don't forget.

235
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,924
If it's a mountain, you can climb it.

236
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,659
If it's a river, just cross it.

237
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,794
Life is not a big deal.

238
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,399
Okay. I'll follow you with trust.

239
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,737
You won't tell me what it's about, do you?

240
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:05,646
Right. I also have so many secrets
I haven't told you yet.

241
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,381
We're even now.

242
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,050
See you tomorrow.

243
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,722
Right. If you can't sleep,
drink jujube tea.

244
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,625
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

245
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,111
The person you have reached is
not available.

246
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,247
Please leave a message after the beep.

247
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,348
You may hang up after the message.

248
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,182
(Ms. O)

249
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,588
She can't be with him after what happened.

250
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,491
What are you doing?
That's harsh on your stomach.

251
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,665
For your information, I'm on your side.

252
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,201
What?

253
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,904
You're fighting with Daniel over Du Ri.

254
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,239
I know everything.

255
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,141
My motto is the winner by my side.

256
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,945
But this time, I'm on your side.

257
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,585
What?
Do I resemble your father or something?

258
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,856
Why do you keep talking about my father?

259
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,459
I miss him.

260
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,329
Do you miss your dad?

261
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,968
You said he only nagged at you
and blamed you.

262
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:37,771
It's better without him, isn't it?

263
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,090
I'm scared
that I might never see him again.

264
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:05,832
The only person who'd like me
as long as I eat well...

265
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,734
and stay out of trouble.

266
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,772
Who else is there other than my dad?

267
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,808
Even I consider myself weird.

268
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,643
He may have nagged at me,

269
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,479
but he never criticized me for once.

270
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:28,488
I've seen him wiping his tears
without showing me.

271
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:37,564
Gosh.

272
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,601
I only gave him a hard time.

273
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,004
What if I never get to see him again?

274
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,046
Why are you worried?

275
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,316
A parent would never leave his child.

276
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,821
A man shouldn't weep.

277
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,827
Don't hesitate. Just go for it.

278
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,596
My dad says...

279
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:14,501
if you do nothing,
nothing's going to happen.

280
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,237
You have to do something.

281
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,740
More than Daniel.

282
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,144
Do everything you want, Jun.

283
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,718
What are you doing?

284
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,354
Go see your dad.

285
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,130
How do you feel about being famous
even before the debut?

286
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,733
I'm not famous.

287
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,669
Noise marketing is still marketing.

288
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,639
Now that people know our names,
it's time to show them our skills.

289
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,275
Anyway, CEO Daniel is amazing.

290
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,644
Our trip was all planned.

291
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,279
A trap to catch the stalker.

292
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,982
I'm not sure about this.

293
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,484
It wasn't solely for us.

294
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,620
Did he take advantage of us?

295
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,021
Come on.

296
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,656
Are you saying
you don't want to go next time?

297
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,226
- Hello.
- Hello.

298
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,071
Wait.

299
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,911
Part A looks too plain.

300
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:06,880
Is there a way to make them stand out?

301
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,651
Let's reduce the movement...

302
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,452
and come up with a new theme.

303
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,420
Got it.

304
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,458
Let's start over.

305
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:21,595
("The Way I Love")

306
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

307
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,586
Good.

308
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,387
You know what's nice?

309
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,256
That you all look different...

310
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,692
yet you have good teamwork.

311
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,528
Let's keep it up.

312
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,029
Yes.

313
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,464
Du Ri and Min A.

314
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,766
You were offbeat twice.

315
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,902
Okay.

316
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:18,652
I've never seen so many stars before.

317
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,791
The stars look closer and brighter...

318
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,494
when it's cold.

319
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,764
You know everything like a granny.

320
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:35,903
My father loved stars.

321
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:39,039
He dragged his body to the balcony...

322
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,042
when he could barely move...

323
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,878
and stared at the stars for a long time.

324
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:49,416
That's first.

325
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:52,986
Telling me about yourself.

326
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:55,822
Is that right?

327
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,892
What about you?

328
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,329
You never told me...

329
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,831
about your parents or siblings.

330
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,433
Not even about your dog.

331
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,003
It's not that I didn't. I couldn't.

332
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,341
Because I have none.

333
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,078
What do you mean?

334
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,815
What about your aunt?
She cares about you so much.

335
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:27,754
Care about me so much?

336
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,025
That's interesting.

337
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,361
I didn't know you could be wrong.

338
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:41,702
You know Chairwoman Kim...

339
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:46,206
doesn't care about anything...

340
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,142
other than singing.

341
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,079
Even if I were her son...

342
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,650
not a nephew,

343
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,521
things wouldn't have been any different.

344
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,959
You must be disappointed in your aunt.

345
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,595
I know what she's like.

346
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,267
I mean, I think I understand.

347
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,240
My biggest strength is... Well...

348
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,210
That I'm a loner.

349
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,246
I have no one to protect me...

350
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,782
or that I have to protect.

351
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,052
I was able to say I'd quit and leave...

352
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,321
for that reason.

353
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:40,527
Because I have no regrets in this country.

354
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,437
Don't pity me.

355
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,072
It's not time for that yet.

356
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,079
You must be cold.

357
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:10,190
If you give me your jacket,
what about you?

358
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,695
I'm okay.

359
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,531
You wish.

360
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,800
You're already going pale.

361
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,075
See? You're cold as ice.

362
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:29,810
Wait.

363
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,020
Good now?

364
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,825
Let's go.

365
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:55,462
What are you thinking?

366
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,664
Nothing.

367
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,369
Right. Did you not tell my mom?

368
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,204
She was worried
that you suddenly disappeared.

369
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,987
What brings you back here at this hour?
I thought you moved back to the dorm.

370
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:24,191
I left in a rush.

371
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,326
I'm going back tomorrow.

372
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,129
I see.

373
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,774
I saw it on the way.

374
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,112
You love the ones with red...

375
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,714
bean...

376
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:50,083
Ha Na told me.

377
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,154
Yes. Thanks.

378
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,523
I was actually hungry. Thanks.

379
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,626
Bye now.

380
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:17,211
I saw them getting out of
the car together before.

381
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,679
I know.

382
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,248
Now that his mother-in-law's gone,
he doesn't even try to hide it.

383
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,018
One more bottle of soju, please.

384
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,860
It's not a meeting. It's torture.

385
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:35,929
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

386
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,332
That sounds tough.

387
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,068
Still, hot rice soup and soju with you...

388
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,003
makes up for it.

389
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:53,447
Mi Jin.

390
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,316
I...

391
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,854
can't help you with your work anymore.

392
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,124
What do you mean?

393
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:08,095
I appreciate your help,

394
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,364
but...

395
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,300
I need to do my job.

396
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,935
Did I upset you?

397
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,670
- Are they Romeo and Juliet or what?
- No. Wait.

398
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,406
The finance team manager position is
vacant. Do you want that spot?

399
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:22,209
If you just say it, I will...

400
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,611
I'll work for you
until you find someone new.

401
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,646
Thank you...

402
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,514
for everything.

403
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,250
I really appreciate it, Mi Jin.

404
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,752
Min Seok.

405
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,656
Why are you acting like this?

406
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,058
I have to save this restaurant.

407
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,695
This is my family business.

408
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:45,465
And it's going down
because of the new owner.

409
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,113
Of course.

410
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,850
This is the best spot.

411
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,687
You know everyone's eyes are on it.

412
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,423
Come on.

413
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:13,560
If it weren't for my other business,
I would've kept it.

414
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,196
Is this the rice soup restaurant that
tastes different after the owner changed?

415
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:17,331
Yes.

416
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:19,566
After the owner changed,
they lost all their customers...

417
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:22,236
and ruined the neighborhood too.

418
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:23,504
What a pity.

419
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:28,342
They're crazy...

420
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,710
It's ruined!

421
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,746
You're done for.

422
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:33,780
The end.

423
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:39,720
Are you out of your minds?

424
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,626
Why are you making a fuss
in my restaurant?

425
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,995
All because of this.

426
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:51,265
Contract Clause 13 Special Agreement.

427
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:54,168
"If any problem occurs regarding
the quality in less than a year,"

428
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:56,270
"the contract will be terminated..."

429
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,138
"for violating
the quality maintenance issue."

430
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:01,175
It means you're doomed.

431
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:22,362
I released everything Yoo Ji An did
to the press...

432
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,897
and sent it to the prosecutors too.

433
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,832
We'll have to wait for the result,

434
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:28,435
but this time, even with her dad's help,
she won't be able to avoid prison time.

435
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,471
Thank you for everything.

436
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:32,439
Whatever.

437
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,575
Can't you at least try to hide it?

438
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:36,577
What do you mean?

439
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,212
You'll soon pierce Emily.

440
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:42,416
Unless you want to tell everyone,
stop gazing at her like that.

441
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,127
What's wrong with my gaze?

442
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,375
Are you crazy?

443
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,910
What are you doing here?

444
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,912
What if a scandal breaks again?

445
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:14,214
Hey, the whole country acknowledges...

446
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,450
I'm your official male friend.

447
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:18,952
Besides,

448
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:23,624
as long as you cover your eyes,
no one will recognize you.

449
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,561
- What are you saying?
- Whatever.

450
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,730
Today, I have no tomorrow.

451
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,934
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

452
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,206
(New Seoul Record)

453
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:50,250
I didn't know a place like this
still existed.

454
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,253
This place is popular among kids
these days.

455
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:56,390
Really?

456
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,992
Kids these days listen to turntables?

457
00:35:58,992 --> 00:35:59,960
Yes.

458
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,266
It's working.

459
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:33,694
Stop dragging me.

460
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,529
What is this place?

461
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,097
- Hold on.
- What?

462
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,972
I know. Press this.

463
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:47,875
Wait. Our faces are on here.

464
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:49,710
What's this?

465
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,677
What?

466
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:52,546
I think it started already.

467
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,348
- Time's up.
- It started.

468
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:56,717
Get in the pose. It's taking pictures.

469
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:14,935
Ms. O.

470
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:17,538
Let's go there.

471
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,140
(Spring Hanbok)

472
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:22,576
You look pretty.

473
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:23,510
Let's go.

474
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:28,081
Do you like it?

475
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,783
Yes.

476
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:31,652
Don't just eat everything alone.
Give me some too.

477
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,154
Ae Sim.

478
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,959
Did you book the surgery?

479
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:20,934
I don't need a fake document like this.

480
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,305
I'm keeping the baby.

481
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,441
Are you crazy?

482
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,042
I'll be 40 soon.

483
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,879
It's a miracle that I got pregnant.

484
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:34,147
Look.

485
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:37,084
The nation's favorite graceful singer...

486
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,052
Kim Ae Sim got pregnant?

487
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,221
Without anyone knowing
before getting married?

488
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,891
Gossip won't last long.

489
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,826
I'll rise again.

490
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,565
Do you know how much debt we have?

491
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,269
What?

492
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,773
Every time the boys got in trouble,
I had to settle with the victims.

493
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:02,743
And that darn Mr. Park who promised
to build your own concert hall...

494
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,712
took off with the budget, so
the interest costs 10,000 dollars a month.

495
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,250
You don't have time to be distracted...

496
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,618
for the next few years.

497
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:16,290
What the hell have you been doing?

498
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,662
Whatever. I'm having the baby.

499
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,132
Ae Sim.

500
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,137
Ae Sim.

501
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,810
If you go to a hospital,
people might spread the word.

502
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,445
I'll look for a midwife...

503
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,714
Son of a gun.

504
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:45,285
Unless you have a death wish,
don't ever appear in front of me again.

505
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:50,624
You know I do what I say.

506
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,574
Sis.

507
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,243
Ae Sim.

508
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,377
Aunt Ae Sim?

509
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:43,010
Jun Hyuk, it's okay.

510
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:03,297
Want a glass?

511
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,967
Just say it.

512
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,441
The happiest time of my life.

513
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:18,779
Yes, it was Emily's age.

514
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:23,016
I spent most of my time...

515
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,118
in Royal Salon.

516
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:30,324
People who dreamed of becoming a singer.
Obscure singers.

517
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:34,394
We sang, laughed, cried,
and talked together.

518
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:40,367
I idled so much
that I was even on academic probation.

519
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:44,204
There was a time...

520
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:47,941
when singing meant everything to me.

521
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,946
And that continued until now.

522
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,550
Singing meant everything to you,

523
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,218
and it still does.

524
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,123
I understand what you mean exactly.

525
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,127
Yes.

526
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:13,867
So it was tough for me...

527
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,604
to regret that life and retrieve it.

528
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,340
I couldn't ask...

529
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:22,876
for your understanding...

530
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:26,513
No.

531
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:30,651
For your forgiveness.

532
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:38,492
It sounds terrible.

533
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:40,160
What kind of excuse is that?

534
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:42,629
Nothing's going to change.

535
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,998
Just keep the life you had until now.

536
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:45,899
But that doesn't mean...

537
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:53,440
that you meant nothing to me.

538
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:56,643
Don't...

539
00:42:58,345 --> 00:42:59,546
take that wrong.

540
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:05,853
There's a timing for everything.

541
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,255
To get mad.

542
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,225
To hear an excuse.

543
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:14,695
And to expect...

544
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:17,431
with slight hope.

545
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,503
I'm really sorry.

546
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:27,140
How can I make it up to you?

547
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,675
No, don't do anything.

548
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:34,515
Now I finally feel relieved.

549
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,217
Let's not shake up each other's life...

550
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:39,520
and root for each other with respect...

551
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,156
like now.

552
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:07,814
(Owl Cabin)

553
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:10,684
Here.

554
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,820
Cheers.

555
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,721
Cheers.

556
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:25,199
It's good.

557
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:29,469
I heard kids these days love retro.

558
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,605
This place is real retro.

559
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:33,006
This is amazing.

560
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,775
What? What is?

561
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:37,077
Just until recently,
we had no place to go...

562
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,880
other than the senior center or a park.

563
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,481
It's amazing that we're hanging out...

564
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:43,817
like young people in the city.

565
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:46,119
And it's amazing that it was so much fun.

566
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,089
Right.

567
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:52,226
How did we survive
our boring and dull lives until now?

568
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:55,329
Perhaps...

569
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,731
we were sad because of our hearts
that didn't age,

570
00:44:57,731 --> 00:45:00,434
not our aged bodies.

571
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,937
So what?

572
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,809
What matters is that we can be together
in young bodies again.

573
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:13,547
By the way, is the scandal resolved now?

574
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,550
Can you debut?

575
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,455
I'm okay,

576
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,125
but I'm worried about him.

577
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:28,295
Him?

578
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,396
As much as I am...

579
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:30,864
No.

580
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,967
He turned out to be lonelier than I was.

581
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,005
He was pretending to be okay.

582
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:39,973
But...

583
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:43,877
his eyes keep bothering me.

584
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:51,985
No.

585
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:57,157
You're not in love with that young boy,
are you?

586
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:01,862
Can I?

587
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:06,567
Come on. What a lame joke.

588
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:10,237
How can you fall for him?

589
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,573
That's what I thought at first.

590
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:14,074
No.

591
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:16,376
Just until recently.

592
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,012
- But...
- Ms. O.

593
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:21,815
I can't fool myself.

594
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:28,989
You know it's not going to work out.

595
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,792
Why are you taking the hard way?

596
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,595
I don't care even if it doesn't work out.

597
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:38,265
I'm okay as long as I can like someone.

598
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:55,349
Do you like that man that much?

599
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:00,621
When you think about him,

600
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:03,690
does he cheer you up?

601
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,804
Sure. That's all that matters.

602
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:19,840
You're young again. What stops you?

603
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,043
Sing and love...

604
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:25,312
all you want.

605
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:28,782
Okay?

606
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,107
(O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup)

607
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:55,843
What the?

608
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,492
What are you doing here?

609
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,761
Du Ri.

610
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:17,364
I thought you went back to the dorm.
What are you doing here?

611
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:19,633
Mr. Park... No.

612
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,669
I met Jun. I'm going back...

613
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,238
That's not the point.

614
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,273
What are you doing here alone?

615
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:31,278
They got rid of the recipe.

616
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:35,549
My mother-in-law lost her memories
and went off the grid.

617
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,252
I can't...

618
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:41,955
What am I going to do
about our restaurant?

619
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,170
Get up.

620
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,181
How do you know...

621
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,751
I've seen my cooking before.

622
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:13,587
I learned it from her just in case.

623
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:16,590
You learned it?

624
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:28,068
What matters the most?

625
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:30,204
The ratio between ox head broth
and leg bone broth.

626
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:32,739
What's the ratio?

627
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:33,640
Three...

628
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:35,175
Three to seven.

629
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:38,111
Okay.

630
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:42,115
Boil the head for 5 hours,
and 2 days for the leg.

631
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,351
If you boil more than that, it'll stink.

632
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:46,186
- Make sure to keep track of time.
- Yes.

633
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:48,222
Scoop the meat separately in parts...

634
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,090
to keep it tender and delicious.

635
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,892
And what matters the most?

636
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:00,934
Remove the grease in the leg broth...

637
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:03,837
every five hours.

638
00:50:05,572 --> 00:50:08,308
Yes! Remove the grease every five hours.

639
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:16,683
Thanks, Du Ri.

640
00:50:22,823 --> 00:50:24,324
The scoop is dented.

641
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:29,963
Did you call the contractors?

642
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:32,266
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry?"

643
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,536
- The exhibition is around the corner.
- Ms. Kang.

644
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:46,914
The windows and system are delayed.

645
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,550
I'll finish it up.

646
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,820
Then we couldn't appreciate...

647
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:57,524
No, we'll take care of it.

648
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,993
You're busy working on the proposal.

649
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,904
I don't plan to steal your career.

650
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,906
I just want to end it on a good note.
Don't worry.

651
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,108
Even if you haven't eaten anything
for three days,

652
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:17,411
you shouldn't eye on other's food.

653
00:51:17,978 --> 00:51:19,346
I learned that from my mom.

654
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,841
Look at the time.

655
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,243
Are you still up?

656
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:53,146
How can I sleep when you aren't home?

657
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,115
Look at your face.

658
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:58,151
The deadline is near.
I have a lot of work. Goodnight.

659
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,754
Even if you die tomorrow,

660
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:02,189
do you think your work will cry for you?

661
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:05,292
They'll find someone new to replace you.

662
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:08,996
But I will die...

663
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:11,431
and follow you.

664
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:14,902
Die? How can you say...

665
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:18,272
Unless I say that, you never listen.

666
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,075
Take care of yourself, will you?

667
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,611
Why are you going so hard on yourself...

668
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:27,414
for what?

669
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,299
Honey. You're home.

670
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:46,834
Come here for a second.

671
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:47,835
What's the matter?

672
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,736
Why are you so hyper? I'm getting nervous.

673
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:52,372
No. Come here. Hurry.

674
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:03,584
Don't say anything.

675
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:04,952
And try this.

676
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:15,996
What do you think?

677
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:19,266
It tastes just like Mother's rice soup,
right?

678
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,301
Did you make this?

679
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:24,204
How can I do that alone?

680
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:25,906
Du Ri...

681
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:28,242
gave me the recipe.

682
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:29,743
Isn't it amazing?

683
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:32,179
- Du Ri told you?
- Yes.

684
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,115
She asked Mother.

685
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,517
My gosh.

686
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:40,787
She's so shrewd and smart, right?

687
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:50,097
He's trying so hard.

688
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:51,265
I'm proud of him.

689
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:58,105
Look at the time.

690
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:17,057
Did I push myself too far?

691
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,106
When the moon is full, it declines.

692
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:37,644
And the flower that blooms first
withers first.

693
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:44,451
The moon is so bright.

694
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:59,700
Why the long face? Something happened?

695
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,468
Nothing.

696
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:05,806
I think I pushed myself too far
these days. I'm just tired.

697
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:06,773
Right.

698
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:12,412
What about you? Are you not feeling well?

699
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:13,981
I'm on my period.

700
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,117
I took the medicine, but it's not
getting any better. What about you?

701
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,686
That reminds me.

702
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:24,124
My period is due, but there's no sign.

703
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:25,225
What's wrong with me?

704
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:26,894
Are you that tired?

705
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:29,796
Your skin looks dry.

706
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:32,499
You need to take care of yourself.

707
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,368
Okay.

708
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,103
Hello.

709
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:38,438
Hello.

710
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,343
Hello.

711
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:45,846
Thank you.

712
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:14,575
What's this?

713
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:24,017
Again?

714
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,222
It happened to you before.

715
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,457
You suddenly got spots like a granny.

716
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:35,295
It happened to me before?

717
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:37,531
It happened to you for a while,
then you soon recovered.

718
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:39,433
Don't worry too much.

719
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,268
Excuse me.

720
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:47,341
Tell me what you know about Emily.

721
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:48,342
Everything.

722
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:58,018
No.

723
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:00,220
That can't be true.

724
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:05,526
Hello. I'm Ha Na from Element.

725
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:07,461
We're here...

726
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:10,898
to film our first music video.

727
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:13,901
I will introduce you to...

728
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:17,137
my members...

729
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:18,672
and UNIS teachers...

730
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:20,507
who are beautiful enough to be mistaken
as my members.

731
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:23,577
Min A, Jay, Olla, and Soo Jin. Say hi.

732
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:25,946
- Hello.
- Hello.

733
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:29,917
Everyone.

734
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:31,318
Our Du Ri.

735
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:33,987
No, Emily is busy getting ready.

736
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:38,792
The Strange Sisters' main vocalist's
flashy transformation.

737
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,227
What do you think?

738
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:41,562
Are you surprised?

739
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:44,698
You look beautiful, Du... I mean, Emily.

740
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:46,934
You're shining like a diamond.

741
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:52,906
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

742
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,241
Yes, I'm fine.

743
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:57,277
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

744
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,450
Soo Jin, say something as a leader.

745
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,352
We can do it.

746
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:08,021
Olla? Say hi.

747
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:09,423
- Hello.
- Hello.

748
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,898
Did you get into an accident or something?
Is that it?

749
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:52,099
Did you lose your memories? Let me see.

750
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:54,301
If you lost your memories,
we'll find them.

751
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:56,503
Even if you can't,
we'll force them to come back.

752
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:59,473
Or just live as the person
I'm looking for.

753
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:02,643
How did you recognize me?

754
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:05,145
Mr. Park.

755
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:07,080
Yes. Mr. Park told me.

756
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:09,783
Leave hopeless O Mal Soon to me.

757
00:59:09,783 --> 00:59:11,118
Cherish your time.

758
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:14,021
And enjoy it.

759
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:17,591
Don't look at anything.
Don't think about anyone.

760
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:19,426
Just do as your heart says.

761
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:22,796
Especially for your last choice.

762
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,845
Cut.

763
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:40,981
- Hey.
- Du Ri.

764
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,049
Du Ri.

765
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:44,418
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

766
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,186
If Janet was Emily,

767
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:51,058
am I going to get old again?

768
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:57,164
Emily, are you okay?

769
00:59:57,164 --> 00:59:58,065
Hey.

770
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:16,350
Mom.

771
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:37,704
(The last episode
will be aired tomorrow at 9:50 p.m.)

772
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,256
(Who Is She!)

773
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:59,726
Did you enjoy the spring?

774
01:00:59,726 --> 01:01:01,528
I have to choose?

775
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:04,898
If I return, is there a place for me?

776
01:01:04,898 --> 01:01:07,134
Tell me what's going on.

777
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:09,603
I will finish up...

778
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:13,207
what you started.

779
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:15,242
Don't forget me.

780
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:18,545
Or I will be really sad.

781
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,448
- It's time.
- Let's do this.

782
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,150
Have you made up your mind?

783
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,619
So I...
