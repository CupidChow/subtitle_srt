"Love" by Shin Soon Ae.

6
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,523
In a small supermarket,

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,792
I dream of a lost love.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,596
Even when I'm 70, even when I'm 80,

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:33,667
my heart will burn with love until I die.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,371
Love won't pay the bills?

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,108
I'll pay for love.

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,611
I can't even.
I've heard something I shouldn't.

13
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,850
Seriously?

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,351
Park, even you?

15
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,826
A man's love.

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,099
That is a river that only flows one way.

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,039
It flows and flows.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,442
It flows forever...

19
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,545
and becomes a sea.

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,617
(55 years ago)

21
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,227
(Park Gap Yong)

22
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,379
The sweet first love.

23
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:58,352
Its brief and strong scent...

24
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:06,226
sadly could not be controlled or stopped.

25
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,897
Even so,

26
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:15,435
one should fully embrace that as well.

27
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,971
A man's love is...

28
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,408
the endless sea.

29
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,711
(Episode 6, Passionate Goodbye)

30
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,849
This is outrageous.

31
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,752
You're saying everything's over
without any notice.

32
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,986
Do you think a contract is a joke?

33
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,254
That's what I want to ask you.

34
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,659
I shouldn't have forced you
in the first place.

35
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,993
You didn't force me.

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,295
It doesn't matter anymore.

37
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,367
How could you not listen
to what I have to say?

38
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,572
You haven't changed at all.
You shouldn't expect a different result.

39
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,373
Don't you have a conscience?

40
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,010
What you're saying is...

41
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,646
that I'm in some kind of relationship
with an old man,

42
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,181
I extort money from him,

43
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,216
I don't even practice...

44
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,685
and shamelessly just skip group practice,

45
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,320
I fight with the other girls so easily,

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,021
I act rude toward elders for no reason,

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,290
and I can't even honor the contract
that I promised.

48
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,291
Is that it?

49
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,594
Don't get worked up.
Say something for yourself.

50
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,097
How long do you expect me
to cut you some slack and cover for you?

51
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,436
How could you think of me like that?

52
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,511
Ms. O.

53
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,212
Ms. O.

54
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,647
Ms. O.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,997
I didn't want to be wronged ever again.

56
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,705
What if they kick Ha Na out too?

57
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,862
"The Man in the Yellow Shirt?"
How do you know this song?

58
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,265
My grandma used to sing this a lot.

59
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,802
I arranged this song with the program
you told me about last time.

60
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,571
What do you think?

61
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,009
It's nice.

62
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,046
You're clearly talented in this area.

63
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,950
But we're not looking for someone
who's good at arrangement.

64
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,818
You know you lack in dancing, don't you?

65
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,154
You have to pass this evaluation...

66
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,889
to show what you're good at.

67
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,642
(Mr. Park)

68
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,446
Mr. Park.

69
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,082
Yes, O Du Ri.

70
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,684
How do you know her?

71
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,689
- I'll get going now.
- Okay. Bye.

72
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,139
No.

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,984
If I call first, I lose.

74
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,455
This is wrong.

75
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,724
What's wrong with me?

76
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,760
Again.

77
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,517
Look at this mess in the house.

78
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,359
She meant for me to hear that, right?

79
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,230
Ha Na.

80
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,499
- Who?
- My girl, you're back.

81
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,069
You say I'm your girl,
but you don't mean it.

82
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,072
Even Mom came to see me,
but I saw nothing of you, Dad. So bye.

83
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,144
That was because I thought your mom
would kill me if I went.

84
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,280
How did you know I was here?

85
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,082
Mr. Park told me everything.

86
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,185
What's going on?

87
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,720
Do you two know each other?

88
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,323
Emily has always been strange.

89
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,958
Don't you think you came on too strong?

90
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,862
Private life matters, of course.
Attitude in training as well.

91
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,332
But Emily was actually doing a good job.

92
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,802
And you know she's too honest
to do something dirty like that.

93
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,105
Right.

94
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,507
I should've let her explain herself.

95
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,278
- I shouldn't have taken it personally.
- Exactly.

96
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,446
Why did you take it personally?

97
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,019
I'll pretend nothing happened,
so you take care of it.

98
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,855
Take care of it like Han Jun Hyuk would.

99
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,231
This is what you should do.

100
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,233
Only think about the evaluation.

101
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,935
Keep your place no matter what.

102
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:49,903
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,541
Thinking you're leaving
suddenly makes me lose confidence.

104
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,542
No!

105
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,144
I'm not going anywhere.

106
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,112
I'm not a pushover.

107
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,115
I know.

108
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,818
But how long are you going to stay
at my house?

109
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:11,124
I'll check how things are going
in the house, and see.

110
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,092
What?

111
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,996
To prepare for being kicked out like this,

112
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,299
I need a place to stay.

113
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,234
Right.

114
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,201
Right.

That's true hip-hop.

118
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,925
She'll soon be rushed to the hospital.

119
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,960
Ha Na, it's you.

120
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,928
Mr. Park.

121
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,732
Your phone was off. What happened?

122
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,934
Do something to stop that old lady.

123
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,885
What's going on here in the early morning?

124
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,223
This is the Jongno-gu
Senior Singing Contest.

125
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,628
If only Ms. O was here.
She'd eat up the stage.

126
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,964
You're absolutely right.

127
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:25,966
Indeed.

128
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,138
Those skills are enough...

129
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,674
for our community center to win.

130
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,042
She's amazing.

131
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,678
Win? No way.

132
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,847
Where have
all the amazing old people gone?

133
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,524
Everyone, is this all you've got?

134
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,127
Is this the most excited you can get?

135
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:02,069
Mr. MC, may I sing a song?

136
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,975
They're quite daring young ladies.

137
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,543
Let's invite them to the stage.

138
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,144
Please give them a round of applause.

139
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,516
Mr. Park, just tap this.

140
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:16,884
I'll signal when we're ready.

141
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,485
- Thank you.
- I got it.

That's it.

Great.

165
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,763
Yes.

Why isn't Choi Ha Na there?

178
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,754
Probably because of Emily.

179
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,423
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,593
I was worried about Du Ri,
so I went to see her.

181
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,862
So did you see her? Where is she now?

182
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,599
You've gotten her wrong.

00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,668
That old man is like my grandfather.

184
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,169
He's like a family to Du Ri as well.

185
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,573
She should've just told me that.

186
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,775
She must be really upset.

187
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,212
What if she says she'll give up
becoming a singer?

188
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,348

(Soon Ae's Supermarket)

190
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,325
You must've used up
all your energy to sing.

191
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,259
Here you go.

192
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,197
Ramyun always tastes the best
after you sweat.

193
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,804
You eat just like someone I know.

194
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:07,007
You're such a great singer, Miss.

195
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,676
You completely won my heart.

196
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,045
I could be your number-one fan.

197
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,014
That was nothing.

198
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,385
Right. Did you break up
with that old gold digger?

199
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,387
He's not a gold digger.

200
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,489
It seems your hobby is
acting like a doormat...

201
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,858
and your dream is
to become a poor old lady.

202
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,160
Don't say that.

203
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,097
You sing beautifully,
but you're a potty mouth.

204
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:30,998
Whatever.

205
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,636
He'll soon come to you with excuses
to borrow your credit card...

206
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,104
so don't increase your credit limit.

207
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,440
He actually told me
to lend him my credit card...

208
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,576
so I was about to increase
my credit limit.

209
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,079
How did you know this, Miss?

210
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,083
If you still have a bad taste in men
at that age,

211
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,685
living alone is your fate.

212
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:54,655
No way.

213
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,169
How are you here?

214
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:14,641
Why are you here too?

215
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,343
You look happy.

216
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,546
It seems I was the only one
who was struggling.

217
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,356
Why did you bring that man with you?

218
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,859
I told him he got you all wrong.

219
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,295
He wouldn't understand anyway.

220
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,432
I heard that.

221
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,605
My job is done. You take care of the rest.

222
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,973
Where are you going?

223
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,081
We have to talk.

224
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,684
I thought we were done.

225
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:01,889
Well...

226
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,358
Yesterday,
there was some kind of misunderstanding.

227
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,661
I mean,
there was definitely a misunderstanding.

228
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,199
I got too emotional.

229
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,635
That's why we should now try
to have a sincere...

230
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,304
Why go around in circles like that?

231
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,140
If you're sorry, apologize.

232
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,909
If you're sad to see me go, apologize.

233
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,678
If you want me back, apologize.

234
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,382
Aren't you here because you want me back?

235
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,517
It's not like I want you back,

236
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,485
but...

237
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,555
I'm just thinking of not pushing you away.

238
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,125
Is that right?

239
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,495
If your boyfriend looks like that,

240
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:44,731
you should let it pass
even when he boosts his ego all the time.

241
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,068
- Here you go. It's on the house.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,703
He's not my boyfriend.

243
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,372
Pay one dollar.

244
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,409
Show generosity to the poor.
This guy is rich, so make him pay.

245
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,811
My goodness.

246
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,881
Are you saying he looks like that
and he's even rich?

You've got yourself a great boyfriend,
Ms. Potty Mouth.

248
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,320
I said he's not my boyfriend.

249
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:09,790
I said no.

the board member of your rival company.

I'm not good at beating around the bush.

You won't be able to keep that position
for more than two years.

259
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,027
So you should come to my company.

What?

261
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,866
Even that great Director Kang
was kicked out of that position.

262
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,502
So you know you can't stay there for long.

- Yes.

makes me feel rotten.

and gotten rejected.

- Min Seok, hold on.
- What?

360
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,140
What is it?

361
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:16,089
This makes me upset.

362
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,592
When did we grow so old like this?

363
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:21,161
This is new.

364
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,964
It's a surprise my wife missed that.

365
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,300
Does she even care?

366
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,702
Don't say that.

367
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:32,606
She can't stand gray hair,
not even nose hair that's sticking out.

368
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:36,210
She actually cares about me a lot.

369
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,246
I know you eat sandwiches for breakfast
because she doesn't cook for you.

370
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,116
And I know you're wearing the same shirt
for two days now.

371
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,724
That car in front is too slow.

372
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:51,992
Someone's out for a drive.

373
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,177
It's close,
so I'll surely be able to check on you.

374
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,380
Don't say that.
I'm not done thinking about it.

375
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,949
Don't say that.
It shows on your face you are.

376
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,684
No!

377
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,955
I know you won't give up
on becoming a singer because of this.

378
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:22,990
So I'll trust you and leave.

379
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,092
How can you be so sure?

380
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,229
Anyway, you should wait for my response.

381
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,064
Sorry about yesterday.

382
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:35,936
I thought it over.

383
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,472
I was too careless.

384
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,807
I mean it.

385
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,183
I didn't hear that.

386
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,617
What, again?

387
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,488
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

388
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:05,332
That's cute, but this is prettier.

389
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:06,200
Let's go.

390
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:12,706
Guys.

391
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,042
What?

392
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:19,680
I know how you guys feel.

393
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,982
I haven't been here long,

394
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,385
but I saw how hard you guys work...

395
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:28,722
and how desperate you all are.

396
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:30,524
So...

397
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,827
What is she saying?
Did anybody ask you to recognize us?

398
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,295
My grandma said...

399
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,331
you never know what will happen.

400
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:40,400
She said yesterday's foe
may become today's savior,

401
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,203
and today's enemy
may become tomorrow's ally.

402
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:49,610
So let's not go the long way.

403
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,546
No matter what the result is,

404
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:54,214
I will do my best not to trouble the team.

405
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:17,271
Honey.

406
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,874
Thank you for driving her. Bye.

407
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:24,912
Honey.

408
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,514
Were you out?

409
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,651
I told you
I'm helping a friend these days.

410
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,186
Helping?

411
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,523
She does business,

412
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:38,292
and I'm paid, of course.

413
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,561
Right. Ha Na came home today.

414
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,030
She said you went to the company
to see her.

415
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,166
It seems you were worried, indeed.

416
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,036
I knew you weren't a robot, Ji Sook.

417
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,638
You're a man in his forties
who has a family...

418
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:54,308
and you're being paid by a friend
for helping her. What's that?

419
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:58,212
What you said just now...

420
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,380
was not nice.

421
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,351
It pays the four major insurances,
and there's a severance pay as well.

422
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,186
You're just watching someone's back
and driving...

423
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,188
and you're planning to do it
until you get your severance pay?

424
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,161
I have to do what I can.

425
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,430
I know this won't satisfy you, but...

426
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,331
Stop.

427
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:20,200
I've had a very long day today
and I'm tired.

428
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,436
I don't want to use my energy
on useless things.

429
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:26,473
Fine.

430
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,710
You're such an accomplished individual...

431
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,445
so you don't have to speak
with someone useless like me.

432
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:34,114
Just go home and sleep tight.
I don't care.

433
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,350
Good night, ma'am.

434
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,418
I hope you have sweet dreams.

435
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,458
So sad.

436
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,792
Cheer up, brother.

437
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:47,828
Life is tough, isn't it?

438
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,163
Here.

439
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:53,400
God bless you.

440
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,438
I'm going to kill that...

441
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,473
I can hear you.

442
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,151
Sorry about yesterday.

443
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,054
I thought it over.

444
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:16,857
I was too careless.

445
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,092
I mean it.

446
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,432
Should I pretend to give in
and return tomorrow?

447
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:31,238
Should I play hard to catch
for one more day?

448
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,121
Why are you drinking
when you should sleep?

449
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,924
Because I can't sleep. Isn't it obvious?

450
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,430
I wanted to ask.
When is my mom coming back?

451
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,701
She's closer to you than I am.

452
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:03,637
You're even slurring.

453
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:06,773
You drink because you can't sleep.

454
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:08,909
You drink to keep your job.

455
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,944
You drink because you're sad.
And you drink because you're happy.

456
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,647
What a daughter you are.

457
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,119
You even talk like her.

458
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,589
That's enough. Go to bed now.
You have to go to work tomorrow.

459
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:26,026
I'll tell you a secret.

460
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:30,797
I...

461
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:34,434
hate my mom so much.

462
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:43,110
She never recognized how I felt ever
in her whole life.

463
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,346
What kind of a mom is that?

464
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:48,916
Isn't that right?

465
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,323
Right.

466
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,692
You're going to tell on me, aren't you?

467
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,666
Go ahead and do that.

468
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,401
It'll at least make me feel light-hearted.

469
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:12,139
I told you that's enough.

470
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:22,416
Did you drink all of that on your own?

471
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,386
You're the one who left her
to drink all of that.

472
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,922
Me? But...

473
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,992
But...

474
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,710
She should just tell the whole world
that she hates her mom.

475
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,279
What are you doing?

476
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,483
I think Mother visited.

477
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:34,421
How did she know you drank last night?

478
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,256
Did Du Ri tell on you or something?

479
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,091
You're going to tell on me, aren't you?

480
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:41,328
I hate my mom so much.

481
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,639
Mother's kimchi soup is the best, indeed.

482
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,653
I'm thinking of returning to the company.

483
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:11,158
Don't mind what she said
when she was drunk.

484
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,327
I'm not confident.

485
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:18,031
I came here
because I wanted to know what she thought.

486
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,600
But now,

487
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:23,036
I'm scared I might really learn
what she truly thinks.

488
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,372
Ridiculous, right?

489
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:30,711
Ji Sook may know something about it.

490
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,819
What you want to hide.

491
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,922
Why suddenly talk about that?

492
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,592
Don't even think
about mentioning that to her.

493
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,394
If you do, you and I are over, Park.

494
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:56,170
I'll drive you to work.

495
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,773
Where's my helmet?

496
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:08,582
Hop in.

497
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:16,056
I'll take Du Ri to work,
so you can get on with your work.

498
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,026
Thank you for being considerate,
but this is to protect our artists.

499
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:20,727
Hop in. We shouldn't be late.

500
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,364
I received a commendation
from the Jongno Police Station...

501
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,900
for a 30-year safety record.

502
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,703
So don't worry about safety.
Aren't you hopping in?

503
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,438
Company policy does not permit...

504
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,707
riding motorcycles, extreme activities,
riding planes, and riding boats...

505
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:34,775
until debut.

506
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,410
I'm sorry, sir.

507
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:46,420
I'll get going.

508
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:14,248
Get off and walk.

509
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,318
What? From here?

510
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:21,088
I've never let a trainee in my car.

511
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:24,725
I can't even.

512
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,495
You insisted and made me hop in,
and you changed your mind so fast.

513
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:29,596
There's not much time. Get out.

514
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:32,432
Come on.

515
00:35:57,124 --> 00:36:00,494
Welcome, guys. My body feels different
after missing training for a day.

516
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,196
What? I thought she was kicked out.

517
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,504
Hi, girls.

518
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,072
- Hello.
- Hello.

519
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:13,740
My gosh.

520
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,010
You're so tenacious.

521
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,214
I'm not even surprised you're back.

522
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:22,082
You always make things fun.

523
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:24,084
Sir.

524
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,956
Guys, are you okay?

525
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:31,658
I heard you had a difficult time
because of rumors.

526
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,661
I'm glad you look okay.

527
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:40,801
This is what gossip is about.

528
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,037
When you gain weight, they say you're fat.
When you're skinny, they say you look ill.

529
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,906
When you wear roomy clothes,
they say you look like a boy.

530
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,541
When you wear tight clothes,
they say you're too provocative.

531
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,344
Eat a lot, they call you a pig.
Eat too little, they call you picky.

532
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:53,947
Dress up, they call you spoiled.
Throw something on, they call you poor.

533
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:58,952
Haters are always going to hate.

534
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:00,287
In the end,

535
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:03,390
what matters is
whether you feel confident and sure.

536
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:08,896
Anyway, I'm totally fine.
So you don't have to worry...

537
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,466
I mean,

538
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:15,536
you don't have to be disappointed.
Fair play, always.

539
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,070
Okay?

540
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,350
Thank you for being considerate,
but this is to protect our artists.

541
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,554
Yes.

542
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,957
It's Ms. O's safety that's important,
and nothing else.

543
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:44,064
That brat pretends to be polite
and courteous.

544
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,699
But he's somewhat arrogant.

545
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,369
Dad!

546
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,072
What?

547
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:06,687
I gave a change in my style.

548
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,524
Yes.

549
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:14,027
You said you'd never change it
even if I beat you.

550
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,065
Son, what made you change your mind?

551
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,067
What on earth happened?

552
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:25,038
To be honest, my previous hairstyle
was Daniel's old hairstyle.

553
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:28,141
I saw the other day
that his neat hairstyle also looked nice.

554
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,745
And Du Ri seemed to like
this kind of hair.

555
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,484
The reason is not that important.

556
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,156
I finally feel like a weight
has been lifted after 11 years.

557
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,458
This is what you call a filial duty.

558
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:49,630
Dad.

559
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,599
What's this?

560
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,268
That's Ms. O's...

561
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:58,305
I mean, that's Du Ri's clothes I bought.

562
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:04,678
Why would you buy clothes for Du Ri?

563
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,579
What?

564
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:07,848
Well...

565
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,583
Actually...

566
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,684
My gosh.

567
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,520
I knew it.

568
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:18,158
Love for the daughter-in-law comes
from her father-in-law.

569
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,227
You're such a softie inside.

570
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:23,130
You're the only one
who thinks about me, Dad.

571
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:28,435
You chose such nice clothes.

572
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,670
This looks so hip.

573
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:37,311
Thank you very much, Daddy.

574
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,982
I will return
with rapidly becoming a couple.

575
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:48,288
You can't date Du Ri.

576
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:51,458
Don't get your eyes on her.
Don't even think about it.

577
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,331
What?

578
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:03,637
He really thinks
his son is out of her league.

579
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,618
What did you just say?

580
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,054
You moved to where?

581
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,655
You didn't let me sleep in your house,

582
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:30,424
so I found myself a house.

583
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,961
I slept soundly without any medicine
after a very long time.

584
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:36,797
Maybe the location is full of luck.

585
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,334
I look better, don't I?

586
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,036
Wake up, CEO Daniel.

587
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:44,638
Everyone's already saying
you favor her and she's privileged.

588
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:47,241
And you're now settling down
right next to Emily's house.

589
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,277
- Are you out of your mind?
- What is it that worries you?

590
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,013
Don't tell me...

591
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:57,117
you're worried I might demean myself.

592
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,352
That's not what I mean.

593
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:02,556
Actually, it is.

594
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,125
What?

595
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,828
I'm not worried you might demean yourself.
You're already doing so.

596
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,664
There's no in-between for you
when it comes to Emily.

597
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:11,665
Don't you know that?

598
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:19,239
I should stay especially alert
for the evaluation today...

599
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,808
or there will be fairness issues.

600
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,130
She still stands out...

601
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,599
but they are in better harmony now.

602
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:47,501
Yes.

603
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,538
I'll text you the time of the evaluation.

604
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

605
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:03,851
Is everyone ready?

606
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:05,586
Let's start now.

607
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:11,925
But...

608
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,094
Chairwoman Kim.

609
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:17,898
You're here.

610
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:18,966
Yes.

611
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,035
I'm sorry an uninvited guest is here.

612
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:23,370
I was too curious.

613
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:01,835
<i>I wonder if he has feelings for me too</i>

614
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:05,706
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

615
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,025
She's getting everything wrong.

616
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:04,198
She'll be here any minute now.

617
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,233
That seems like women's clothing.

618
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,602
Is that for me?

619
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:11,805
Why are you here?

620
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:15,576
How do you think I knew this place?

621
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,947
Tell me who you are.

622
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,548
Why do you keep hovering around Du Ri...

623
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:23,784
I thought you two have known each other
for over 50 years.

624
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:26,353
Then you should know who I am.

625
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:32,926
Are you...

626
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:50,677
What brought you here?

627
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:53,714
I had business outside,
so I came here on my way to give you this.

628
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,582
- What?
- You said...

629
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:57,184
the girls think
your clothes are out of style.

630
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,588
I heard this clothing is
what the young like the most these days.

631
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:02,623
So take it.

632
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,263
Thank you for caring.

633
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,667
But it's only been a few days
since that incident.

634
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:17,571
I failed the evaluation today...

635
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,608
so you visiting me here
will make things worse.

636
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:24,144
Sorry.

637
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:26,480
I was too thoughtless.

638
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:30,017
I've become senseless with age.

639
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:33,320
I'm not saying it's your fault.

640
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:41,728
I'll go now.

641
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,730
Okay. Bye.

642
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:53,674
I'm such a foolish old man.
I shouldn't have come here.

643
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:29,276
I failed the evaluation today...

644
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:31,612
so you visiting me here
will make things worse.

645
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:35,148
If you still have feelings for O Mal Soon,

646
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:36,416
you know that won't do anymore, right?

647
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:13,587
What nasty ties.

648
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,384
(Internet Cafe)

649
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,890
Yeah. Fresh air.

650
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:52,726
What's wrong with you?

651
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:54,228
- Jung Sik.
- Yes?

652
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,497
I'm going to live life to the full
from now on...

653
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,233
and also be a filial son.

654
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:01,635
That's not what someone who's been playing
computer games for ten hours should say.

655
00:50:01,635 --> 00:50:02,603
Shut up.

656
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:04,872
I won't be able to do it from now on,
so I crammed today.

657
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:08,842
I had a dream last night.

658
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,444
In my dream, my dad said,

659
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:13,747
"My son Ja Yeong."

660
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:18,485
"You will become really successful."

661
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:23,357
And he told me the PIN number...

662
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:26,393
that he'd always kept top secret.

663
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:28,428
- Then you should buy a lottery ticket.
- You punk.

664
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:32,332
It was my first time
being recognized by my father.

665
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:33,901
It's greater than a mere lottery ticket.

666
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:37,437
This is what humans need.

667
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:40,274
If there's a single person who trusts you,

668
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:43,210
your life changes forever.

669
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,879
Your whole life.

670
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:48,982
From now on, I'll be good to my dad.

671
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:53,420
You're giving me the goosebumps.

672
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,923
Stop laughing.

673
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:57,791
You're acting so strange.

674
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,493
Ja Yeong.

675
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:07,234
The person you are calling
is not available.

676
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,503
Please leave a voice message
after the beep.

677
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:16,043
I came because I felt bad.

678
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,046
But why is he not home?

679
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,923
The two days off after the evaluation...

680
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,159
felt like 200 days.

681
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:34,361
They'll probably tell us to leave,
right?

682
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,297
No, they won't.

683
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:39,466
Don't be scared.

684
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,048
Let's go.

685
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:57,384
Let's go.

686
00:51:59,052 --> 00:52:02,155
You've all had enough time to think.

687
00:52:02,689 --> 00:52:03,624
Don't hesitate to share your opinions.

688
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:07,661
Soo Jin, Min A, Olla, Jay.

689
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:09,830
The girls who were in the debut group
for long were not perfect...

690
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,765
but they've become much more stable.

691
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,134
Emily is the only one who is a bit...

692
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:17,004
Not just a bit, but quite lacking.

693
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:19,473
I knew this would happen.

694
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,010
She danced out of the overall formation
during the evaluation.

695
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,280
It's not like she can't catch up
with the rest.

696
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,315
She's just the worst.

697
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,419
No matter how hard they practice,

698
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:34,521
they completely lack in skills.

699
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:38,125
I'm not sure
they'll even be able to catch up.

700
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:45,132
Emily broke her habit of layback singing.

701
00:52:45,132 --> 00:52:47,801
Ha Na has a husky voice
that no other member has.

702
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:49,436
She also has a perfect sense of rhythm.

703
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:51,939
So she has the potential to improve
after more training.

704
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:54,174
Everybody has the potential to improve.

705
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:57,377
That habit of Emily's is not to show off.

706
00:52:57,377 --> 00:53:01,548
I think it's a charm
that no other girls her age have.

707
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:04,618
I've also heard a song Ha Na arranged,
and...

708
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:05,619
But...

709
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,189
they have to debut to show their talents.

710
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,559
The problem is, we don't have much time.

711
00:53:17,764 --> 00:53:19,299
I feel like you're saying...

712
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,970
if we proceed as planned,
their debut stage will be their final one.

713
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:30,410
Who is that?

714
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,246
But I had it in silent mode...

715
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:37,885
It's a message
from the youngest in my team.

716
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:41,955
They say this is the video that went viral
on Instagram and YouTube.

717
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:43,123
I'll send you the link.

718
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,658
What is it?

719
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:49,263
Did someone cause trouble again?

720
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:51,865
("Strange Sisters who rushed the stage
and showed a legendary performance")

721
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,267
(This is the coolest video
I've seen recently.)

722
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:54,668
(It was impromptu,
but they did that great.)

723
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:56,203
That troublemaker.

724
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:58,005
When did they...

725
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,306
(What a great arrangement.
This is amazing.)

726
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:00,541
(What are the broadcasting companies doing
not contacting them?)

727
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,075
(Why do I strangely feel comforted?)

728
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,410
(Great arrangement)

729
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,045
(Duo who jumped up the stage)

730
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:06,580
(Look at those singing skills.)

731
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,889
(Kim Ji Eun)

732
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:25,232
What?

733
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:27,668
Du Ri.

734
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:29,803
What?

735
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:30,737
Look at this.

736
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:37,277
Why is this...

737
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:44,885
(The Yellow Shirt did it!
Incident at the park, Strange Sisters)

738
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:52,726
(1,020,000 views
3,200 comments)

739
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:55,462
(Retro Goddess' advent.
That guitarist is a genius.)

740
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:59,633
(Retro Goddess's advent,
This is true retro.)

741
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,169
- Brass band, cue.
- Cool. She's the Yellow Shirt Girl.

742
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:03,403
Yes.

743
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,975
- Yellow Shirt Girl.
- Yellow Shirt Girl.

744
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:09,576
You look super pretty in real life.

745
00:55:09,576 --> 00:55:12,446
Tell me your Instagram account.
I want to follow you.

746
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:16,183
Instagram? I don't have that.

747
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:17,651
What?

748
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,588
- Yellow Shirt Girl.
- Yellow Shirt Girl.

749
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:22,956
Don't follow me.

750
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,026
Don't follow me. Go home.

751
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,098
They say when you become a star,

752
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:34,101
little kids in the neighborhood
recognize you first.

753
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:37,771
Did I become famous?

754
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:47,347
Park would've been pleased to see this.

755
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:50,317
But he hasn't responded for three days.

756
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:52,419
What is he doing?

757
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:58,992
(Closed for today)

758
00:55:58,992 --> 00:55:59,927
Are you going somewhere?

759
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,295
Miss.

760
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:05,632
My man is coming
to the broadcasting station today.

761
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,801
I've been his fan for 50 years,
so I should go.

762
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:09,369
Who's your man?

763
00:56:14,274 --> 00:56:16,977
Mi Jin, I'm on my way out.

764
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:18,645
I'll be there soon.

765
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,918
You surprised me.

766
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:27,454
Mother.

767
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:29,690
You look well.

768
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:31,825
Me?

769
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,061
Well...

770
00:56:34,628 --> 00:56:37,364
I look well because you're back, Mother.

771
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:39,700
Have you prepared alimony
and the litigation expenses?

772
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,102
Alimony?

773
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:43,437
Litigation expenses? Why?

774
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:48,108
Ji Sook will definitely file a lawsuit.

775
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,543
You're clueless but quite daring.

776
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:53,514
What is it, Mother?

777
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:56,750
She must have dementia.
She was kicked out by her own daughter.

778
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,653
The whole neighborhood gossipped about me.

779
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:02,189
And my son-in-law
who doesn't even have a decent job...

780
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:05,559
is chatting and giggling in the morning
with a lady who's not his wife.

781
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:10,531
Excuses or apologies.
Say them inside the room.

782
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,635
Mother.

783
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:17,171
Your things.

784
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:19,873
Should I unpack your bag?

785
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:25,112
Yes.

786
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:53,307
(Tae Jin Ah, you're all I know.)

787
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:59,112
- What?
- Who's pushing like this?

788
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,684
Stop pushing.

789
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:05,919
Why are you pushing your way in?

790
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:08,021
- Remember your manners.
- What?

791
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:09,756
Do you treat your own grandma
like that too?

792
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:13,060
Why ask about someone
who passed away even before liberation?

793
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,695
Don't make me sad.

794
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:15,929
Just move.

795
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:18,131
- Even before what?
- Don't be like that.

796
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,538
There's Jin Ah.

797
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:33,714
Jin Ah!

798
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:35,449
Don't push me.

799
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:45,993
Jin Ah.

800
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:48,629
You're pretty.

801
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:20,761
- Tae Jin Ah.
- Tae Jin Ah.

802
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:30,871
Please be careful.
You might hurt yourself.

803
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,246
Your clothes look pretty.

804
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:46,787
Are you...

805
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:49,957
Park?

806
01:00:22,422 --> 01:00:25,058
(Who Is She!)

807
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:27,895
Was Park Gap Yong that attractive?

808
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:29,463
What's going on right now?

809
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:33,066
I know you need my help
because you're in my house.

810
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:36,837
Ji Sook has started to act
like an adolescent girl.

811
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:39,840
Is she not her birth mother?

812
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,276
There's this suspicious girl.

813
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:43,243
Look into her.

814
01:00:43,243 --> 01:00:44,478
I have feelings for someone.

815
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:45,812
I never got to tell her I like her.

816
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,814
Don't tell me
you're even planning to date someone.

817
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:49,149
Get away from her.

818
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,651
What did you just say?

819
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,587
I said I would take care of you
no matter what.

820
01:00:53,587 --> 01:00:56,156
Were we really
in such a serious relationship?
