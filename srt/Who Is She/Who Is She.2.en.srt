(This drama series is fictional,
and the places, persons, organizations,)

00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,474
(settings, and events depicted
have been fictionally created.)

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,248
What...

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,617
That face.

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,653
Whose face is that?

6
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,696
Where am I?

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,632
Up in the skies or in the underworld?

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,702
My Lord.

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,771
I was miserable to death,

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,873
but it didn't mean I wanted to die.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,382
There's light,
so it can't be the underworld.

12
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,393
It hurts, so it's not a dream.

13
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,269
This is...

14
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,941
my old face.

15
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,179
Yes. The taxi driver.

16
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,250
I knew he was strange
when he forced me to get in his taxi.

17
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,253
What on earth has he done?

18
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,133
Spring?

19
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,509
Am I dreaming?

20
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,855
(Youth Photo Studio)

21
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,823
(Find your youth again.)

22
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,133
Whether I've gone crazy...

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,235
or the world has gone crazy.

24
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,039
Either one has gone crazy for sure.

25
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,225
Excuse me, kids.

26
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,864
Listen to me carefully
and answer with honesty.

27
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,665
What's she saying?

28
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,600
I don't know.

29
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,436
Do I look like...

30
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,708
a grandma or a young lady to you?

31
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,476
You look like a madam to me.

32
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,310
An aunt to me.

33
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,979
She's definitely not a grandma, right?

34
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,152
Why are you being so ambiguous?
You can do better than that.

35
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,821
To be honest, a young lady.

36
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,090
But your style is lame.

37
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,691
Yes.

38
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,861
And you sound weird.

39
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,963
Especially your hair.

40
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,665
You're trying to be funny, right?

41
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,201
What's wrong with my hair?

42
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,903
Even worse than my grandma.

43
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,543
You brats. Show some respect.

44
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,191
That means...

45
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,529
I'm not crazy.

46
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,102
But...

47
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,975
How can I be relieved with this?

48
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,010
My goodness.

49
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,753
No.

50
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,890
Mom. Dad.

51
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,228
(Episode 2, Face)

52
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,047
If we lived separately,

53
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,916
this wouldn't have happened.

54
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,753
We lived together for too long.

55
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,994
Mal Soon didn't come home last night.

56
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,231
And her phone is off.

57
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,601
Do you even remember?

58
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,336
No.

59
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,372
Where's Ha Na?

60
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,008
She left saying she has plans,
but I don't know.

61
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,779
It just feels like a dream. A nightmare.

62
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,248
You wish. But it's reality.

63
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,517
Are you okay with that?

64
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,819
When I think about it, it drives me crazy.

65
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,189
What drives you crazy?

66
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,791
Ha Na giving up on SAT?

67
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,660
Or what you said to Mother last night?

68
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,494
Honey.

69
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,163
You had a hard time growing up.
You were disappointed at Mal Soon.

70
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,699
You two didn't get along. I know that.

71
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,367
But you shouldn't have done that.

72
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,936
Then what was I supposed to do?

73
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,273
If that was enough to bother her,

74
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,008
I wouldn't have turned out this way
in the first place.

75
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,845
So focus on your daughter.

76
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,582
We have to send her to university.

77
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,883
She said she isn't happy.

78
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,985
And...

79
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,489
she said you don't look happy.

80
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,510
Where do I even begin?

81
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,212
(Soon Ae's Supermarket)

82
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,348
Young lady, watch out.

83
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,263
Why am I so fast?

84
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,835
Wait. My knees aren't in pain.

85
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,970
Shoot.

86
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,705
- Ma'am!
- What do I do?

87
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,742
What is this?

88
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,676
Park's son, Ja Yeong?

89
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,878
Where did you pop out?

90
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,680
What are we going to do?

91
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,321
Did you drink all night again?

92
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,757
My god. What's the problem?

93
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,958
What are you saying?

94
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,394
At least, you're sober now.

95
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:41,895
Sorry.

96
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,334
Ja Yeong.

97
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,269
It's me.

98
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,905
Do you recognize me?

99
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,777
Wait.

100
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,315
You look very much like someone.

101
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,150
Who was it?

102
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,451
Do I?

103
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,485
Like whom?

104
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,923
Everyone called you a rogue,

105
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,992
but I knew I could trust you.

106
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,162
- Shoot.
- What...

107
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,964
You're the one who took off
with my wallet...

108
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,999
at the bar last night, didn't you?

109
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,834
What are you saying?

110
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,973
Ja Yeong, it's me. Mal Soon.

111
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:31,178
But seeing that you followed me here...

112
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,250
Jesus Christ.

113
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,054
You like me, don't you?

114
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,857
Did you drink your brain too with alcohol?

115
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,762
I'm old enough to be your mother.

116
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,299
And you dare to butter me up?

117
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,135
Let me beat you until you become sober.

118
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,403
Crazy woman.

119
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,838
My goodness.

120
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,973
Women these days are so shrewd.

121
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,576
You're good to go.

122
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,149
Even I don't recognize my face.

123
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,517
Who would believe it?

124
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,454
If I go home like this,
things will only get worse.

125
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,990
I need a strategy.

126
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,538
I had nice hands.

127
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,647
I was more flexible than anyone else.

128
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,324
And my skin couldn't be fairer.

129
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,361
Perhaps it's not a punishment,
but a chance?

130
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,166
A chance from paradise...

131
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,436
to compensate for my long and tough life?

132
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,453

134

(Read)

135
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,109
The call cannot be completed.
You will be directed to the voice...

136
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:48,015
The person you have reached is
not available.

137
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,384
Please leave your message after the tone.

138
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,455
Is she sleeping in the sauna?

139
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,891
Why on earth isn't she picking up?

140
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,332
What a pain in the neck.

141
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:11,505
This young man must've drunk so much.

142
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,740
It must not be easy to run a business.

143
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,942
Daddy.

144
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,446
Hurry up.

145
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,382
I'm dying. Come on and tap my back.

146
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,619
- Is he your son?
- Yes.

147
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,221
That must be refreshing.

148
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,628
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's not like you.

149
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,562
Daddy.

150
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,131
I saw someone strange today.

151
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,634
No one's stranger than you
in this country.

152
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,002
No.

153
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,037
She looked like Mal Soon.

154
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,273
What?

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,175
You saw Ms. O?

156
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,779
By the way, what do you mean
she looked like Ms. O?

157
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,182
She looked like her,

158
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,050
but she's a girl.

159
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:58,986
She was young.

160
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,188
You little...

161
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,426
Welcome.

162
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:16,937
What would you like?

163
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,839
Why do you bother asking? The same thing.

164
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,411
Well, give me one ox soup.

165
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,113
Yes.

166
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,748
One soup.

167
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,982
One soup.

168
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,491
It's hot.

169
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,826
Enjoy.

170
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,755
This place knows how to serve good water.

171
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,425
No place can do better than this.

172
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,427
For water.

173
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,864
The meat stinks.

174
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,599
And why is the kimchi so sweet?

175
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,534
Excuse me, owner.

176
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,936
And the chef.

177
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,305
Is this the best you can do?

178
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,406
Seriously.

179
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:32,513
Don't you know how to use honorifics?

180
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,482
- Do you know me?
- Stop it.

181
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,483
Don't.

182
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,953
What would I not know
about you stupid and lazy bum?

183
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:44,157
Do you think this is why I let you
take over the restaurant?

184
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,829
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,898
If you don't like it,

186
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,168
you can leave without paying.

187
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,602
Stay out of it.

188
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,472
Do you think I'm doing this
because I don't want to pay?

189
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,975
Do you know what this restaurant means?

190
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,580
This soup restaurant is second to none
in Jongno!

191
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,454
(O Mal Soon Ox Head Soup)

192
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,026
Thank you.

193
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,829
Remove the blood for 30 more minutes.

194
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,265
Reduce the sugar by half a spoonful.

195
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,099
Yes.

196
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,436
Anyway, just focus on subtracting
than adding.

197
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,804
- Keep that in mind.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:35,175
Well, I don't know where you're from,

199
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,411
but everything you said is true.

200
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,279
Thank you for your advice.

201
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,185
Thanks.

202
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,558
Only if it wasn't for your brother.

203
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,798
Bye.

204
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,802
Now that I'm full, where should I go?

205
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:09,042
She's Mal Soon's spy.

206
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,180
That old woman.
It's in our hands now. Let it go.

207
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,628
Blood is more accurate than eyes.

208
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,398
A daughter would notice her mom.

209
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:49,449
Even if she becomes a man,
I'd recognize her right away.

210
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,454
I don't have a choice like this.

211
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,390
I need to find that taxi driver first.

212
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,537
The bus stop is here,

213
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,040
and I met the students here.

214
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,042
It has to be somewhere here.

215
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,512
That strange man.

216
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,988
(For Lease)

217
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,490
What?

218
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,925
What happened?

219
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,729
But the studio was right here
until this morning.

220
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,264
This is impossible.

221
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,878
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

222
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,021
Why am I getting so nervous?

223
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,022
What?

224
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,659
I think CEO Daniel knows something.

225
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,463
I think Emily's in touch with him.

226
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,498
What does that have to do with us?

227
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,035
Well, it does have to do with us.

228
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,005
It was her choice to leave.

229
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,840
I only did what I had to do as a leader.

230
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:23,343
If she comes back and gets in our way,

231
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,446
I'm going to do everything it takes
to make her leave again.

232
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,954
You barely ate.
Is everything all right?

233
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:35,956
I heard everyone loved
the get-together last night.

234
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,257
I heard things went well?

235
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,526
It was only good until the get-together.

236
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,198
Wait. Isn't that your mother?

237
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,868
She looks so different.

238
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,006
- Grandma.
- Mother.

239
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,341
Grandma, where are you going?

240
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,812
That is my mom, isn't she?

241
00:17:58,812 --> 00:17:59,780
Yes.

242
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,915
You can never confuse her
with someone else.

243
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,564
I look like a total bum.

244
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,349
My goodness. So pretty.

245
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,783
You're dazzling.

246
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,821
You look like someone else.
You look so pretty.

247
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,992
This is too bright and colorful.

248
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,960
It's perfect.

249
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,730
Why did you dress like that
when you could be so hip?

250
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,932
I know.

251
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,134
It's our latest model.

252
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,771
You pulled it off. So beautiful.

253
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,583
I'll take the shoes too.

254
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,617
Yes?

255
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,356
I'll throw out
those ugly clothes and shoes.

256
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,859
- Do you need the receipt?
- No thanks. It's only burdensome.

257
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,332
Just kidding.

258
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,902
- A joke.
- It was a joke.

259
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,138
That's hilarious.

260
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,007
Gracious. She's so funny.

261
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,143
- Here's your credit card.
- Thanks.

262
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,544
Bye.

263
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,612
Bye.

264
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,982
Right. Wait up.

265
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,954
Ms. O's family is in deep water.

266
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,756
She left home after a fight.

267
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,992
But I saw her last night on the street.

268
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,761
She zoned out like a lunatic...

269
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,431
and kept walking
in the middle of the night.

270
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,999
She got kicked out.

271
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,369
When a tiger loses its teeth,
even a rabbit belittles it.

272
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,704
It could happen to us too.

273
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,973
She said giving money to children
would only ruin them,

274
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,141
so she never gave her daughter
a big sum before.

275
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,276
Never.

276
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:12,713
Honestly, what kind of son-in-law
would want to live with his mother-in-law?

277
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:13,647
No one.

278
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,316
And when her son-in-law tried
to learn how to make the soup,

279
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,918
she kicked him out in just three days.

280
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,785
She's unbelievable.

281
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,488
It's not what you think it is.

282
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,358
Ms. O tried to teach him,

283
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,527
but her son-in-law made a mistake.

284
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:29,162
- You don't know anything.
- What do you mean we don't know?

285
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,565
It's obvious
that she didn't live a good life.

286
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,066
Speaking up for her won't help.

287
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,602
Are you her henchman?

288
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,972
What? Henchman?

289
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,109
You're crossing the line.

290
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:42,976
The line?

291
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,245
Who had what life?

292
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,693
The place you wanted to go was
a pork cutlet restaurant?

293
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,694
That's boring.

294
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,996
It feels like a dream come true.
I love it.

295
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,982
It's nothing special.
why do you like it so much?

296
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,651
Everything is special to me.

297
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,931
It tastes just like what I had
at the US army camp.

298
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,932
That's interesting.

299
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,068
The US army camp?

300
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,741
I expected you to be picky,
but it's great.

301
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,710
I'll bring you here from now on.

302
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:03,190
It's good.

303
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,868
The food is cold now.
Do you want me to get you a new one?

304
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,005
No, I'm waiting for someone.

305
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,841

00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,997

I don't know you either. So we're even.

368
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,216
Draft beer. Are you down?

369
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,385
Yes.

370
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:34,288
- Give me your card.
- Yes.

371
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:36,256
- Ten seconds left. Hurry.
- Yes.

372
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:42,963
Done.

373
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,131
Okay.

374
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,132
Thanks.

375
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,836
Are you done?

376
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,771
Can you move if you're done?

377
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,741
What should we get?

378
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,610
Where did she go?

379
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:15,429
The next performer is Ha Na Band.

380
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,464
- Ha Na?
- We'll begin right away.

381
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,445
What's she doing there?

382
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:40,120
<i>The rain stopped after a long time</i>

383
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:45,192
<i>It's very sunny today
I have a good feeling about it</i>

384
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:48,896
<i>I'm meeting you today</i>

385
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:58,238
<i>I used to cry to sleep
But last night I had</i>

386
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,407
<i>A bluebird in my dream</i>

387
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:05,245
<i>It was beautiful
I have a good feeling about today</i>

388
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:08,916
Grandma, do you think Mom looks happy?

389
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,984
She should consider herself happy.

390
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,221
No.

391
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:17,024
She doesn't look happy to me at all.

392
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,329
I'm not going to be
a smart and obedient daughter.

393
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,265
Even if Dad, Mom,

394
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,002
and you cut me off,

395
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:31,171
I'm never going to do that.

396
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:34,341
I feel confident to be well off
even without working there.

397
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,976
And I'll be smiling way more than you.

398
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:38,679
<i>I can't end it like this</i>

399
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,716
<i>On my lucky day</i>

400
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,637
<i>With a pleasant feeling</i>

401
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,772
<i>With a pleasant imagination</i>

402
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:09,476
<i>I was excited to meet you</i>

403
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,312
<i>But with that boring look on your face</i>

404
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,548
<i>And with those boring words</i>

405
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:19,052
<i>You're saying goodbye</i>

406
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:22,456
<i>I can't let you go like this</i>

407
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,794
<i>But please not today</i>

408
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:31,131
<i>I can't let you go like this</i>

409
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:35,068
<i>On my lucky day</i>

410
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,272
That was fun.

411
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,573
- Good job today.
- Good job.

412
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:41,175
- Bye. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

413
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:42,843
See you tomorrow.

414
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,645
My goodness.

415
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:47,181
I told you I don't know you.

416
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,250
I told you I know you very well.

417
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,252
Since when? Since when have you known me?

418
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,221
Since the moment you were born.

419
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,723
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

420
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,725
I'm not joking.

421
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,595
Your grandma's name.
It's O Mal Soon, right?

422
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:05,065
How did you know?

423
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,867
I told you I know you better
than you know yourself.

425
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,245
We found Emily. Check your social media.

426
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:22,216
We're having an opening event.

427
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,785
Can I take a picture of you
in those clothes?

428
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:25,986
A picture?

429
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:28,889
To post it on our social media
for promotion.

430
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,725
We have to let everyone know
how pretty you are.

431
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:32,693
Please?

432
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,095
A ten-dollar discount?

433
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,735
Okay.

434
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,537
I'll even give you a cashback.

435
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,109
Say 20 dollars?

436
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:50,744
Deal.

437
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,090
So,

438
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,492
you're O Mal Soon's old friend...

439
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,662
Ms. Kim Haeng Sook's granddaughter
from Okcheon, Chungcheong-do?

440
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,864
- Twenty-one?
- Yes.

441
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:16,236
How did you recognize me?

442
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,242
Because I saw you when I was young.

443
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,343
I see.

444
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,846
You know you have a unique look.

445
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,052
Who said you could take that tone on me?

446
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,154
I'm an adult just like you.

447
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:38,325
You just turned 20, and you're already
calling yourself an adult?

448
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,160
Besides, you were born in December.

449
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,895
So you're just born 18 years ago.

450
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,164
Still, you can't take that tone on me
just because I'm younger.

451
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:45,766
You might know me,
but I've never seen you before.

452
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:46,733
Whatever.

453
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:50,904
You should be studying for the SAT.
What were you doing there?

454
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:52,940
What do you care?

455
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,942
How did you know I was preparing
for another SAT?

456
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:57,377
Is this how you want to play?

457
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:03,784
Do you want me to call your parents now?

458
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:04,751
No.

459
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,688
My family's on the rocks right now.

460
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:08,889
I'm...

461
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:11,558
Wait. You have the same phone
as my grandma.

462
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:14,795
No way.

463
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,531
It's not even antique.
That's more of a relic.

464
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,436
I know you're from the countryside,
but how can you be like that?

465
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,104
The way you talk. Especially that accent.

466
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,741
I noticed at the kiosk.

467
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,109
You can't even read English, can you?

468
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,645
What do you take me for?

469
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:33,514
Korean, Chinese,

470
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,282
and I even learned the alphabet.

471
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:43,390
I don't even know where to start.

472
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:47,394
So? What are you doing here?

473
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,395
Do you have a place to stay?

474
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:50,564
What?

475
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,644
Ms. Ban.

476
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,812
The HR team wants you
in the CEO's office on the 20th floor.

477
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,081
They said you weren't answering
your phone.

480
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,425
Sorry for scaring you at this hour.

481
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,762
It's better to celebrate early than late.

482
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,531
Congratulations on your promotion.

483
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:26,600
Pardon me?

484
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,235
We decided to promote
the product development team...

485
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,337
and promote the team manager.

486
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,008
Thank you.

00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,318

00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,721
Congratulations.

00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,223
Congratulations.

490
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:50,224
Thank you.

491
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,059
Congratulations.

492
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,333
Congratulations, Ms. Ban.

493
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:02,402
No, wait. Director Ban.

494
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,939
Sir.

495
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:08,575
Someone's party is another's funeral.

496
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:11,078
What a coincidence, right?

497
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,647
I just heard the news.

498
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,749
I had no idea what happened to you.

499
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,851
No need to apologize.

500
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,520
This is what contract workers get.

501
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,123
You're on contract now too.

502
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,595
Good luck, everyone.

503
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,566
- Allow me...
- Give it to me.

504
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,371
Let's grab a drink later.

505
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:52,786
I'd like to stay with you,

506
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,955
but I have a very important audition
tomorrow.

507
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,959
It was nice to see you.
I'm not sure if we'll meet again.

508
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:02,563
Anyway, don't let anyone rip you off
in this concrete jungle.

509
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,565
Good luck.

510
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,200
Bye.

Sweetie.

512
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:11,071
I told you not to call me like that.

513
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,008
You remind me of my grandma
who's wandering outside.

514
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:23,116
I'm scared.

515
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,154
I have no place to go.

516
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:30,257
I don't know what to do.

517
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,527
I have no hope.

518
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,508
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

519

Actually...

520
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,847
I'm here to find someone.

521
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,149
What? Who?

522
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,853
Are you...

523
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,055
Yes.

524
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:04,157
Are you...

525
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,630
the guy that came in
for the weekend part-time interview?

526
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:11,832
What?

527
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,367
No?

528
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,141
I'm here to find someone.

529
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,878
So, who are you?

530
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,550
What a hassle.

531
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,685
Wait.

532
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:36,590
Yes, Ms. Kim.

533
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,691
What?

534
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:41,595
IGNIS' tenth-anniversary concert?

535
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,899
We disbanded a long ago.
Stop making a fuss.

536
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,937
Okay, then.
I'll hold an autograph event later.

537
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:51,738
IGNIS?

538
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,910
- IGNIS?
- IGNIS.

539
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,045
Anyway, what are you doing here?

540
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:03,150
Right.

541
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,687
Do you remember this customer
in the picture?

542
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,956
Of course, I remember.

543
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,858
I took those pictures.

544
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:14,061
Did she tell you where she was going
by chance or her number?

545
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:15,829
Why do you ask?

546
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:16,797
Emi...

547
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,934
Because she has an unprecedented look.

548
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:23,270
I want to recommend her to my agency.

549
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,340
My goodness. Awesome. That's great.

550
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,941
If she turns out well,

551
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:30,744
would our store become famous too?

552
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,981
Yes. You're right.

553
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,917
Where is she? We have to find her.

554
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:41,221
<i>This strange feeling</i>

555
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:46,326
<i>I've never felt this before</i>

556
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:51,365
<i>I wonder</i>

557
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:56,503
<i>If he has feelings for me too</i>

558
00:38:56,503 --> 00:39:00,307
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

559
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:05,279
<i>That quiet man</i>

560
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,284
<i>For some reason I like him</i>

561
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:15,255
<i>For some reason he appeals to me</i>

562
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,728
What the? I thought you were scared.
I thought you had no hope.

563
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:24,765
Why are you singing so much?
Aren't you getting tired?

564
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:33,006
<i>If he has feelings for me too</i>

565
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,977
Did you see me reaching the high note?

566
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:40,047
I didn't believe it
when they said your vocal cords age.

567
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,815
Now I get it.

568
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,051
Singing has never been so fun.

569
00:39:44,977 --> 00:39:46,353
Is that right, ma'am?

570
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,923
Now I can die with no regrets.

571
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:50,824
What?

572
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,195
Let me sing just one more, and I'm done.

573
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:02,135
What? Just say it.

574
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,806
- "Face."
- '"Face?"

575
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:06,673
Yes.

576
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:09,543
("Face" by Heo Soon Ja)

577
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:10,377
This one?

578
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:11,512
Yes.

579
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:20,387
Wait. My grandma sings this
every time she's drunk.

580
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:22,089
How do you know this?

581
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:26,393
Everyone with a story knows this song.

582
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:35,903
<i>While trying to draw a circle</i>

583
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:41,608
<i>I ended up drawing a face</i>

584
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:50,784
<i>It bloomed in my heart</i>

585
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,230
I saw her going to karaoke
with her friend earlier.

586
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:22,349
<i>Like a dew on grass</i>

587
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:28,589
<i>Your eyes shined</i>

588
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:34,528
<i>Like a dew on grass</i>

589
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:40,334
<i>Your eyes shined</i>

590
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:45,939
<i>In a circle</i>

591
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:49,776
<i>In a circle</i>

592
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:54,982
<i>Your face circles around</i>

593
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,192
Are you okay?

594
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:08,762
What's wrong?

595
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:12,499
One second.

596
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,434
What? Why...

597
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,942
(Restroom)

598
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,745
Darn it.

599
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:30,651
Could it be urinary incontinence?
But I never had it even when I was old.

600
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,520
No. It can't be.

601
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,897
(Restroom)

602
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:00,814
(60 years ago)

603
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:01,982
Mal Soon.

604
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,251
Mal Soon.

605
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:08,822
If you don't finish the laundry today,
no food.

606
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,170
Why is there so much?

607
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,750
This is no big deal.

608
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:12,386
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

609
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:15,489
What's not strange?

610
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:18,692
Why is it so awkward and embarrassing?

611
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:39,947
I didn't do anything wrong.

612
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:42,549
Why should I be ashamed?

613
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,384
Your old body is gone.

614
00:44:44,384 --> 00:44:46,420
Throw away your old thoughts too,
O Mal Soon.

615
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,510
Why...

616
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,516
What? Is he a pervert?

617
00:45:18,852 --> 00:45:19,686
Hi.

618
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:23,123
He really is a pervert.

619
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,168
What?

620
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:37,304
Did I age that much?

621
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,640
That you can't even recognize me?

622
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:42,576
Whose fault is that?

623
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:44,745
What are you saying?

624
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:50,984
Too bad.

625
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,254
Now, you can't go anywhere
without my permission.

626
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,858
- Not even the restroom?
- Of course not.

627
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:00,661
Are you crazy?

628
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:02,429
Let me go. I'm in a rush.

629
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,135
Okay.

630
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,971
I'll wait outside.
Come out when you're done.

631
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:16,677
He's completely lost it
unlike how he looks.

632
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,950
Put it in a black plastic bag, please.

633
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:30,858
What?

634
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:33,026
Do you remember...

635
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:36,530
Are you leaving already?

636
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:38,298
What do you mean already?

637
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,534
I have an audition at UNIS tomorrow.

638
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:43,770
Are you...

639
00:46:44,705 --> 00:46:45,939
You know UNIS, right?

640
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,610
I worked so hard to be their trainee.

641
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,712
Anyway, see you later.

642
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,183
UNIS or whatever.

643
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,452
What's so great about it?

644
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,156
My goodness.

645
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:09,096
You good-looking crazy jerk.

646
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:10,731
What? What now?

647
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:12,766
Emily.

648
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,904
You didn't have to be so mean...

649
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:19,606
No, you should've done that earlier.

650
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,542
Either cuss out or punch me.

651
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,644
You should've resolved it
instead of running away.

652
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:29,716
Emily or family. I don't know you.

653
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:31,919
You think it's funny?

654
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,989
It's not funny. It's driving me crazy.

655
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,524
Why is your acting so real?

656
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:39,560
Because I'm not acting.

657
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:45,966
Did you get into an accident or something?
Is that it?

658
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:49,102
Did you lose your memories? Let me see.

659
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,272
You're fine.

660
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,740
You pervert.

661
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:57,444
How dare you touch me?

662
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,046
What? Pervert?

663
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:04,451
Don't cross the line.

664
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,628
Look, young man.

665
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,566
Because you're like a son... No.

666
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,338
Because you're like a brother,
let me give you a piece of advice.

667
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:28,208
I don't know how you lost it,

668
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,247
but think about your parents
who gave birth to you?

669
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:36,817
So, when the sun rises, go see a doctor...

670
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:37,718
Seriously.

671
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,555
Cut it out.

672
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:43,423
What is that moron doing?

673
00:48:48,562 --> 00:48:49,563
Look.

674
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:54,735
<i>In a circle</i>

675
00:48:54,735 --> 00:48:59,907

680
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:27,801
You still got something to say?

681
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:29,837
My goodness.

682
00:49:31,705 --> 00:49:33,974
This is just frustrating,

683
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:37,277
but I have no energy to nitpick at you.

684
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:41,949
You're about to debut,
and I'm about to be free.

685
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,484
Let's focus on that for now.

686
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,622
If you cross the line,
I'm calling the police.

687
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:52,492
Fine. Okay.

688
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:56,697
Whether you lost your memories
or you're acting, it doesn't matter.

689
00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:58,832
If you lost your memories,
we'll find them.

690
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:02,169
Even if you can't,
we'll force them to come back.

691
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:04,004
Or...

692
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:07,674
just live as the person I'm looking for.

693
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,578
At least, that will be better than now.

694
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:21,121
I'll give it to you just in case
you lost your memories.

695
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,525
I can't wait for too long.

696

697
00:50:43,644 --> 00:50:45,279
What's between him and the bumpkin?

698
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:48,949
Wait.

707
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:54,248
Yes, honey.

708
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:57,551
What?

709
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:06,527
What happened?

710
00:52:08,562 --> 00:52:09,863
What is it?

711
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,133
Come on. I thought you were hurt.

712
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:17,137
I wanted to take a walk with you.
It's been so long.

713
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,805
So I made a fuss.

714
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:20,774
My goodness.

715
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:24,011
Did something good happen?

716
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:26,713
Thank you.

717
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:28,916
For what?

718
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,318
For everything.

719
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:34,655
For everything you did.

720

Mal Soon isn't home yet.

721
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,332
Maybe we should look for her.

722
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,801
You still don't know...

723
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:49,469
how strong and dogged my mom is, do you?

724
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:53,941
When she feels better,

725
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,809
she'll come back as if nothing happened.

726
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,411
So...

727
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:03,150
just be happy for me today.

728
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,789
I got promoted to director today.

729
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,829
My company finally approved me.

730
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,207
What do you want for your promotion gift?

731
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:28,809
A car?

732
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,879
No, I'm in a good mood.
Do you want me to get you one?

733
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,616
What a show-off.

734
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:38,418
I'll let it slide
since I'm in a good mood.

735
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:40,254
Right.

736
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:43,457
When Ha Na comes home,
we should blow candles.

737
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:45,158
We should celebrate this day.

738
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:46,693
Whatever.

739
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:49,162
Anyway, it feels great.

740
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:51,632
Are you down for one more round?

741
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:54,835
Sure. Not just one.
Two, three, even four rounds. Let's go.

742
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,503
- Deal.
- Let's go.

743
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,132
How did it go yesterday? Did you find her?

744
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:26,667
It was definitely her in the photo.

745
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,138
What? She doesn't want to do it anymore?

746
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:32,706
Does she want to quit?

747
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,877
I don't know whether she's acting...

748
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,613
or she lost her memories.

749
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,619
She's here. Emily's here.

750
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,988
Is this right?

751
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:24,625
- No, that's not what you did last time.
- Seriously, cut it out.

752
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:26,527
I can't do anything right.

753
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:29,963
Emily?

754
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,403
That was fast.

755
00:55:36,403 --> 00:55:40,240
I couldn't make you wait for too long
when you bet everything on me.

756
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:47,281
Now explain in detail...

757
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:50,617
what you can do for me...

758
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:54,454
and how you're going to make me a celeb.

759
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:59,426
Are you going to keep that tone?

760
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:01,195
Forget it if you don't want to.

761
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:04,765
Considering all those years I lived...

762
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:08,502
Seeing that you drop honorifics easily,
I can see that you're not sane.

763
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:10,571
Let me ask you a question.

764
00:56:11,238 --> 00:56:12,272
Ask away.

765
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,107
What if...

766
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,376
I'm not the one?

767
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:20,747
What if I'm not the Emily
that you are looking for?

768
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:25,686
It doesn't matter.

769
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:28,655
Because that's impossible.

770
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,025
Forget it.

771
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:38,332
What if that Emily comes back?

772
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:43,637
You know,

773
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:46,507
if it's not mine,
I don't mess with anything.

774
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,842
I have a situation,

775
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,878
but I can't steal someone's life.

776
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:52,279
Emily won't be back.

777
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,181
How do you know?

778
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,950
Because you're right here.

779
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:02,689
Never mind.

780
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,392
We'll talk about that later.

781
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:08,896
How much time do I have?

782
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:11,999
- Three months until the debut.
- What?

783
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:15,102
You think I'm a genius?

784
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:17,604
You think three months is enough?

785
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:20,674
Your brain denies it, but not your body.

786
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:22,509
I believe in you.

787
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,015
Do you provide housing?

788
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:29,316
What...

789
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:35,689
And one more thing.

790
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:17,764
Ms. O Mal Soon. Wish me luck.

791
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,076
Excuse me. What brings you here?

792
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,580
Daniel. I'm here to meet CEO Daniel Han.

793
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:37,150
Did you book an appointment?

794
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:39,219
Yes.

795
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,455
Tell him I'm here about Emily.

796
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:42,589
I'll check.

797
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,040
Grandma?

798
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,299
Is he expecting me to memorize...

799
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:27,467
that strange dance and that fast song
in just three months?

800
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,603
Is that even possible?

801
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:32,840
That's ridiculous.

802
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:35,442
Right here.

803
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,212
- That's cute.
- Try again.

804
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:40,214
Is this right? Isn't that what you did?

805
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,751
What? I did it.

806
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,019
Let's try something else.

807
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:49,723
Not that. Here.

808
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:51,859
No, that's wrong.

809
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:53,961
You try.

810
01:00:54,721 --> 01:00:57,057
(Who Is She!)

811
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,160
You're full of surprises, you know?

812
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,994
What do you mean?

813
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:03,030
I told you I'd take care of you.

814
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:07,401
Did we promise to have a future together?

815
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,636
Is this Kim Ae Sim's company?

816
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,438
Is your name Emily?

817
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:13,707
Does that make you happy?

818
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:15,909
We have someone strange.

819
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:16,844
Will you look into her?

820
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:17,778
Park.

821
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,881
Why do you have her phone...

822
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:24,251
We can't let a grown-up woman
in our house.

823
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:28,055
Why does that strange woman
feel like my mother-in-law?

824
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:30,624
She even sounds like her.

825
01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:33,493
Maybe Ji Sook knows something.

826
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:35,796
Who are you to act like me in my house?

827
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,565
It's time. Come on.

828
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:40,367
What are you doing?

829
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,469
Then say you're O Mal Soon.
