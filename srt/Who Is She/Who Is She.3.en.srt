What are you doing?

8
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,728
What?

9
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,034
Look. Emily from LA.

10
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,603
What on earth are you doing?

11
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,372
Have you changed your theme
from a show-off to a country loser?

12
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,076
Do you know what we went through
because you left like that?

13
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,645
What is this puffy ramyeon hair?

14
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,814
That's crazy swag.

15
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,816
This time, it was clearly your fault.

16
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,151
We can't cover you.

17
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,621
Let's stop. What if she runs away again?

18
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,156
Stay out of it.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,964
I can see that they gave
their colleague a hard time.

20
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,034
How can we take it easy
when she just won't let us?

21
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,836
She thinks the world goes around her.

22
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,438
Doesn't it upset you?

23
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,139
We didn't bully her.

24
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,475
It was she who ignored us.

25
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,477
Calm down.

26
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,912
Do you want to be misunderstood again?

27
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,514
No. Not me.

28
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,450
The instructor's looking for us.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,451
Hurry.

30
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,388
Anyway, Damily, you...

31
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,391
if you try to have it your way again,
you're out.

32

Who's Damily?

35
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,746
He's waiting for me.

36

I have to meet him.

You can't enter without approval.

38
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,818
And I couldn't confirm
your appointment with him.

39
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,954
Who sent her here?

40
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,324
I lived here for three months.

41
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,792

44

No, I wasn't. I was...

Grandma.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,942
Grandma, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,778
I was worried about you.

48
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,614
Grandma?

49
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,616
Do I know you?

50
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,686
Ms. O, what are you pulling?

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,588
Are you still sullen?

52
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,990
Mal Soon?

53
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,161
Grandma, I'm busy.
I can't talk to you right now.

54
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,863
Let's talk at home later.

55
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,332
Everyone was worried
and waited for you so much.

56
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,336
Don't think about going anywhere else.
Wait for me at home.

57
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,303

to open your wallet, Ms. Cheap?

61

67

- Sure.

68

In the audition, there will be a girl
named Choi Ha Na.

76

Accept her as a trainee.

77

without a word.

Are you in or not?

Nice arrangement. She's fresh.

111

Her singing isn't so bad.

112

Her arrangement skills are impressive.

113
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,882
Still, she's not the girl group material
we're looking for.

114

No way.

135
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,277
I ran here as fast as I could
for her tteokbokki too.

136
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,613
When she kept telling you to eat,

137
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,149
you always complained.

138
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,885
Besides, have you forgotten
that she's not home?

139
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,755
Why do you think I ran here?

140
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,990
She's probably back.

141

What?

142
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,263
Really?

143
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,843
- Mother.
- Grandma.

144
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,018
Are you sure you met Grandma?

145
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:45,953
Yes.

146
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,121
I told her to go home repeatedly.

147
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,358
- I shouldn't have let her go like that.
- You shouldn't have let her go like that.

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,465
Do you want me to make you ramyeon?
You said you were hungry.

149

I don't feel like eating.

150
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,238
I wasn't hungry for food.
I was hungry for Ms. O's nagging.

Grandma seemed to be doing well.

154
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,381
Her style has changed.

155
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,749
Has she forgotten about us already?

156
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,588
She lost her memories?

157
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,490
No way.

158
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,392
She uses dialect. She's talking all weird.

159
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,327
What's wrong with her? Split personality?

160
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,930
You seem to have many questions,
but leave that to the past.

161
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,466
Consider it a temporary memory loss.

162
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,736
How are we going to practice
when she knows nothing?

163
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,038
That brat. She's just unbelievable.

164
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,274
We don't have much time left.

165
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,912
Is it just me
or are you all good to see her again?

166
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,517
What is wrong with their teamwork?

167
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,021
They're just flustered.

168
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,756
They were worried about her so much.

169
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,659
They had great teamwork.
They'll pick up again soon.

170
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,628
She is so hard-to-like.

171
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,098
Worry, my butt.

172
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,668
They were all dying to come after me.

173
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,042
Why so serious?

00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,278
A wench fight is normal

175
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,480
What?

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,049
What fight?

177
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,218
You can't debut without her anyway.

178
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,320
Either support her, abandon her,
or discard her.

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,788
The choice is up to you.

180
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,613
Stop putting on a show.

181
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,781
What?

182
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,719
I know you're putting on a show
to hide your disgusting past.

183
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,756
Aren't you the disgusting ones?

184
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,730
Why did you have to push her
until she ran away?

185
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,229
What?

186
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,232
This is not even ridiculous.

187
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,801
Is this how you want to play?

188
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,406
I never said how I wanted to play.

189
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,407
What are you saying?

190
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,510
If you don't quit it, I'm going
to tell them about your secret.

and let's play fair.

196
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,309
Now, it's time for a round.

198
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,715
"Colleagues?"

You think losing your memories
would make everything okay?

204
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,948

Not yet.

215
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,254
How deeply were you heartbroken?

216
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,690
That you completely went off the grid?

217
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,339
How can someone change just like that?

218
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:06,840

Who else? Emily.

The way she talks, acts, and thinks.

221
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,981
It's like her MBTI changed
from an extreme introvert to an extrovert.

222

Unless she was struck by lightning.

223

You think it's about her look?

Still, if you mix a newbie
with girls who are ready to debut,

288
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,741
they'll revolt.

289
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,376
They were also part of the reason.

between them and Emily?

You seriously didn't get anything I said?

311
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,453
Don't bother sounding me out.

312
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,622

do you think I'd be here right now?

after eating only greens,

No need to be sorry. It's your body.

00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,349
Starve...

367
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,051
for what glory?

368
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,388
It's not just about your weight,
but self-control, you know?

369
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:58,392
Don't expect to stand before the public
when you can't even control your body.

370
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,794
Run for one more hour.

371
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,634
Kids these days are so dogged.

372
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,473
Stretch.

373
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:15,876
All right. Five, six, seven, eight.

374
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,811
One, two, three, four,

375
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,746
five, six, seven, eight.

376
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,582
Point.

377
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,317
Poke. Good.

378
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,086
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

379
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,788
Point.

380
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,823
Five, six, seven, eight.

381
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,293
You brat.

382
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:35,462
Do it.

383
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,370
Now?

384
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,905
It's your body...

385
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,207
that remembers the choreography,
not your brain.

386
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,175
Do it.

387
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,547
Don't you look at me like that.

388
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:54,481
Here.

389
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,250
Stand here.

390
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,151
My head.

391
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:03,223
Five, six, seven, eight.

392
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:04,258
Okay.

393
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:07,761
Point. One, two.

394
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,365
What's she doing?

395
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,869
- What is that?
- Focus.

396
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,371
Focus.

397
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,372
- Yes.
- Yes.

398
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:36,356
Hello?

399
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:37,824
You think it's funny?

400
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:39,960
Daniel?

401
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,562
Look up.

402
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:43,897
Why...

403
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:46,400
Tell everyone to leave
except you and Emily.

404
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,203
Can't you see
that everyone's laughing at her?

405
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,472
Teach her 1-on-1 until she picks up.

406
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,910
If Emily doesn't improve,
it's all your fault.

407
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:01,181
But Daniel...

408
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,486
So much stress!

00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:09,523

417
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,549
Thank you.

00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:13,687
Hi.

419
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,690
Go ahead.

420
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,829
How's everything going?

421
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:27,634
I've calmed reporters down
from making a fuss.

422
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:31,071
Of course. It's my chance to run away.

423
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,106
I have to make it happen.

424
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,043
- Jun Hyuk.
- This will be the last time.

425
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,111
Keep your promise.

426
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,247
Aunt Ae Sim.

427
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:09,309
Fine. Laugh all you want.

428
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,413
Only those who lived long enough
understand this happiness.

429
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,121
- Hello.
- Hello.

430
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:31,632
I can't take it anymore.

431
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,066
Follow me.

432
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,218
Is that an onion root or a broccoli
on her head?

433
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,956
I can't believe you had to deal with it.

434
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,357
Don't even get me started.

435
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,692
Not just my eyes,

436
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,295
but it was an insult to my career too.

437
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,296
My gosh.

438
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,398
Manager.

439
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,666
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,127
Where did the onion root go?

441
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,431
Are you sure she's the same person?

442
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,533
This is unbelievable.

443
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:53,313
You look great.

444
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:58,285
While we're at it,
let me ask you one more favor.

445
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,022
Instead of Emily,

446
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,791
call me Du Ri.

447
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,495
O Du Ri.

448
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,789
What do you think?
Doesn't she look like someone else?

449
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,427
Well, it's better.

450
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:42,996
That's right.

451
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,599
I told her already.

452
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,101
Instead of Emily,

453
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:50,037
call me Du Ri from now on.

454
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,607
O Du Ri.

455
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:43,657
So what if it's a midsummer night's
dream or a curse?

456
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,226
I feel so alive.

457
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,197
(Push)

458
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,274
Are you going somewhere?

459
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,609
Any news about her yet?

460
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,378
No.

461
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,850
But she's well.

462
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,520
You said no news from her yet.

463
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,255
My wife and Ha Na saw her.

464
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:18,625
They said she looked even better.

465
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,593
What?

466
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:23,297
When she's not answering my calls?

467
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,135
How can a granny be well
after leaving home?

468
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:31,905
I should've stopped her that day.

469
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:36,743
Ji Sook is shrewd,
but she's only book-smart.

470
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:40,247
Why is it so hard for her
to understand her mom?

471
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,217
She worries about Mother a lot too.

472
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,518
Although she never expresses it.

473
00:34:45,986 --> 00:34:48,956
It wasn't that bad before.

474
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,093
Something must've happened.

475
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:58,465
Ji Sook always kept her mouth shut...

476
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:01,201
if she didn't like something
ever since she was young.

477
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:05,906
When bullies pulled her hair
or ripped her clothes.

478
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:09,443
Or when she was the only one who couldn't
afford to go on a school trip to Jeju.

479
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,778
She should've said it.

480
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,047
If she was born a man,
she could've become a general.

481
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,052
She obviously has an issue with her mom.

482
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,322
I have no idea what that is though.

483
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,593
Do you want me to look into it?

484
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:31,832
Have you found a job yet?

485
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,974
May I say one more thing before I begin?

486
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:45,279
This is my first official schedule...

487
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,381
after I've become an executive.

488
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:49,349
Your roles are most important...

489
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,652
to win a contract from Junha Construction.

490
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,621
I know it wasn't easy...

491
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:56,690
because of some people
who treat a partner company...

492
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,326
like their subcontractor.

493
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:03,797
I will not let that happen
at least while I'm here.

494
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,039
She was talking about us, right?

495
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,843
She wasn't just talking about us.
She was aiming at us.

496
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:26,987
Kang Young Eun.

497
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:29,189
She and Director Kang went
to the same university,

498
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,557
and they're from the same clan.

499
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:35,062
She's been in the team
longer than you at least.

500
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,064
She won't be an easy game.

504
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:57,351
People who lost their general
in the war...

505
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,886
are full of spite.

506
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:03,524
Come here.

507
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,098
She's the new cook.

508
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,599
But she's so young.

509
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,603
She looks like she can't even make a fire.
How is she going to cook?

510
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,338
I'll make her leave on her own.

511
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,413
Yes. It's perfect.

512
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:45,899
You can fool everyone,
but you can't fool yourself.

513
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:49,937
If you stay proud of yourself,
you will one day see the path.

514
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,040
Here you are.

515
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:54,775
- Honey.
- No.

516
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:58,712
Sit down and pour me a drink, will you?

517
00:37:58,712 --> 00:37:59,680
No.

518
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,387
My goodness.

519
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,792
Thank you.

520
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,461
No need to thank me. Weren't you scared?

521
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,263
To win the war,

522
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:18,899
you must turn people to your side first.

523
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,039
I may not be as good as Director Kang.

524
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:29,109
I look forward to working with you,
Ms. Kang.

525
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,382

through the back door</i>

548
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:39,766
<i>And he's getting beaten for that</i>

549
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,768
<i>Hahaha that's funny</i>

550
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,871
<i>Hohoho that's funny</i>

551
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,939
<i>Hihihi that's funny</i>

552
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:48,075
<i>Hehehe that's funny</i>

553
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:51,945
<i>Haho hihe that's funny</i>

554
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:56,283
<i>If he had no money</i>

555
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:59,720
<i>He should've had bindaetteok at home</i>

556
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:04,591
<i>How dare a thug with no money</i>

557
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:07,127
<i>Go to a restaurant</i>

558
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:11,331
<i>How dare he go to a hostess bar</i>

559
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,243
I see that you know
how to play the guitar.

560
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,612
Well, I know how to play a little.

561
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,656
Really?

562
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,226
Thank you. Thank you so much.

563
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:48,602
What?

564
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,137
Nothing.

565
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,108
Apologize for what you said the other day.

566
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,111
I'm in a good mood today.

567
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,882
I might accept your apology.

568
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,116
What are you saying?

569
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:05,419
Come down for dinner.

570
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:17,397
This is insane.

571
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:19,032
This can't be true!

572
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:21,835
Good job, Choi Ha Na. I'm so proud of you.

573
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,785
Girls.

574
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,120
Everybody, attention.

575
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,421
What brings you here at this hour?

576
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,024
Big bad news.

577
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:48,028
The new trainee is Emily's best friend.

578
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:49,663
- What?
- What was that?

579
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:51,265
She's completely new to this,

580
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,966
but that was the condition Emily demanded.

581
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:56,470
No. That is just wrong.

582
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,005
This is so upsetting.

583
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,407
I only had one.

584
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,346
Seriously.

585
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:11,251
What is this song?

586
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:17,291
You can't sing old songs forever.

587
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,561
Consider it a lesson and sing this.

588
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,334
(K-POP Playlist)

589
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,203
All of them?

590
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:37,511
Now that Ha Na's coming, I must do better.

591
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:46,286
<i>Tell me who's next</i>

592
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:54,695
<i>Game is over here I come</i>

593
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:56,363
What...

594
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:58,298
What is wrong with this?

595
00:45:18,952 --> 00:45:20,654
Do I have a fever?

596
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:25,325
Why is it beating fast?

597
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:43,710
Mom.

598
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:47,080
I'll be living in the dorm from today.

599
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,016
I became a trainee at UNIS Entertainment.

600
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:52,019
Although it's only temporary.

601
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:52,953
What?

602
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,856
What are you saying?

603
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:59,359
You're more than welcome to check
if it's true.

604
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,327
Choi Ha Na.

605
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,464
I'll take this chance...

606
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:07,634
to see whether I'm fit for this...

607
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,169
or I should stick to studying.

608
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:12,506
Ha Na.

609
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:20,147
Isn't UNIS the one with many girl groups?

610
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:22,916
What?

611
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,459
- Wait.
- Is this your first day?

612
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,861
What are you doing here?

613
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:35,362
Let's go.

614
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,046
Are you that happy?

615
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:54,147
Of course.

616
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:57,117
I could even die today.

617
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:59,253
Watch your mouth.

618
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,557
Did your parents approve?

619
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,693
I'm not sure if they approved,

620
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:09,830
but I still told them.

621
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:11,999
Good job.

622
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:16,136
Try your best,

623
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,839
and if you're not fit for this,
leave with no regrets.

624
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:19,840
Okay?

625
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,911
You.

626
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,714
Why are you so nice to me?

627
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:33,120
Because...

628
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,456
our grandmothers are friends.

629
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,959
I don't need your pity.

630
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,328
I don't know
about the position you take here,

631
00:47:41,828 --> 00:47:43,997
but I'm going to impress them
with what I have.

632
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:53,240
Besides,

633
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,045
it's no time for you to look after anyone.

634
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:04,952
Emily has her maid here now?

635
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:08,388
Is it just me who thinks
the company's going crazy?

636
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,890
I know it's only temporary,

637
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,459
but can you believe
we have to practice with her?

638
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,330
She gets to practice with a debut group?

639
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:19,600
Should we just reveal...

640
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,069
that Emily's a junkie?

641
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:37,718
(To Choi Min Seok)

642
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:46,193
(Final Notice)

643
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:47,060
(Second Notice)

644
00:48:58,172 --> 00:49:00,707
You already have a lot of loans,

645
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:02,309
and your income is low.

646
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,546
Are you saying I can't extend
the due date?

647
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,019
The car's been upgraded since this year.

648
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,220
You're the first beneficiary.

649
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,689
You should try it out with your family,

650
00:49:15,689 --> 00:49:16,823
Director Ban.

651
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:18,959
Sure. Thanks.

652
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,994
I'll get going.

653
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,511
Yes, Aunt.

654
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:39,273
He kept reassuring me not to tell you.

655
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,543
He didn't even tell me
the date of his surgery.

656
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:45,746
How is he?

657
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:48,315
When the doctors checked,

658
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,885
it had already spread in all his organs.

659
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:54,755
He has three months at max.

660
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,562
He'll soon be leaving in vain.

661
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,265
It would've been nice if you kept in touch
when he was sound and healthy.

662
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,671
Do you know how much your dad missed you?

663
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,943
But then you're not to blame.

664
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:19,646
It's all your mom's fault.

665
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,852
No matter how much she hated him,
he's still your father.

666
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:29,189
How could she hide him from you
for all these years?

667
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,159
How dare she break ties
between father and daughter?

668
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:34,027
How spiteful.

669
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,705
- Slippers.
- Yes.

670
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:49,643
Awesome.

671
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,679
I still can't believe it.

672
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:55,449
No need to check.

673
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:57,851
I've already checked everything.

674
00:52:01,522 --> 00:52:02,856
- Our room is here.
- What?

675
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:09,963
Is this our room?

676
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,870
This is really pretty. Is this my bed?

677
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,738
Yes.

678
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:19,773
Awesome.

679
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:23,677
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's so comfy.

680
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:25,646
Right.

681
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,183
What's between you and Daniel?

682
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,619
What do you mean?

683
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:34,421
An employer and an employee.

684
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,958
No.

685
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,527
There seems to be something more to it.

686
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:44,831
What are you saying?
I'm not interested in young men.

687
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,766
What?

688
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,402
Don't get ahead.

689
00:52:49,603 --> 00:52:50,904
Whatever.

690
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:54,775
Is your grandma back yet?

691
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:57,477
No.

692
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:00,314
It's taking longer than expected
this time.

693
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:03,317
Aren't you worried about her?

694
00:53:04,718 --> 00:53:07,387
You said you know my grandma, right?

695
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:11,458
She's strong enough to beat a ghost.

696
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:15,062
No one's more careful or agile
or faster than her.

697
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,598
She's no ordinary granny.

698
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,633
Is that why you're so laid back?

699
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:21,201
You don't even try to find her?

700
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,638
You wouldn't do that even to a dog.

701
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,440
Why are you so worked up?

702
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:30,043
You always get so worked up
at a strange point.

703
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:33,580
My grandma is well.
You don't need to worry.

704
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:35,249
I bet.

705
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:43,290
Where are you going? It's past curfew.

706
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,760
Why is she all angry?

707
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:48,996
My goodness.

708
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,921
What was that? Strong?

709
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,356
No ordinary?

710
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:19,259
A heart can still be broken
no matter how strong they are.

711
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,594
They can be hurt too.

712
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,096
How can they be so heartless?

713
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,445
A young and pretty lady like you...

714
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,480
shouldn't drink alone.

715
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:44,685
What if other guys eye on you?

716
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,622
Only drink what I give you.

717
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,063
I feel crappy enough.

718
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:59,499
Keep that cheesy smile out of my sight.

719
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:02,369
What a nice world we live in.

720
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:05,105
Back in the day, you would've been
locked up in the coffin already,

721
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:08,542
yet here you are walking around.

722
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:14,114
You're so sly and cunning.

723
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,218
Cheeky girls are appealing these days.

724
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:20,454
Very nice.

725
00:55:21,255 --> 00:55:22,289
Right.

726
00:55:23,757 --> 00:55:25,592
- Cheeky?
- Yes.

727
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,831
Watch your darn mouth
before you get beaten up.

728
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:38,572
Do you even have any muscles in your body
other than the sphincter?

729
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:40,974
Yet you consider yourself a man?

730
00:55:45,546 --> 00:55:46,480
You're cute.

731
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:50,317
You're so adorable. I can't help it.

732
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:52,386
Let me touch you. Come here.

733
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:56,123
Pervert.

734
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,260
Is this what you like?

735
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,562
Go easy on me.

736
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,864
You pervert.

737
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,533
Just wait until the police get here.

738
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:07,367
O Du Ri?

739
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:10,337
What are you looking at?

740
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:13,207
Call 911 and tell the police to...

741
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:22,015
My goodness. That annoying little...

742
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,116
Did she just beat someone?

743
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,057
I want to touch the other arm, too.

744
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:37,998
What are you doing? Call the police.

745
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,534
Wait. What are you doing?

746
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,137
You'll break my arm. Be careful.

747
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:07,094
Do you even have any muscles in your body
other than the sphincter?

748
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:11,198
"The sphincter."

749
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:44,164
I usually stick to rules,

750
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:49,603
but last night, I had so much on my mind.

751
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:51,405
What's there to worry about?

752
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:54,641
If you drink all night and cause trouble,

753
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:57,110
you won't get to debut,

754
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,279
and we'll all go down together.

755
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:02,616
Right?

756
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:11,925
Sorry.

757
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:18,298
I promise never to do that...

758
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:22,369
again.

759
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:32,079
I don't care whether you drink
or pick a fight...

760
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,347
or punch anyone.

761
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:37,584
Please. Will you please...

762
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:42,489
hold it back until you debut?

763
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:45,726
You may leave.

764
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:49,196
Is that all?

765
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:55,335
- Am I really good to go?
- I saw you fighting yesterday.

766
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,337
I should be careful.

767
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:03,544
Hello?

768
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:06,313
Okay.

769
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,651
- Follow me.
- What?

770
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:17,758
- Chairwoman Kim. Hello.
- Hi.

771
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,027
Girls. Everybody, stand up.

772
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:23,330
Come forward. Keep moving.

773
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,698
Say hello to the chairwoman.

774
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:26,767
- Hello.
- Hello.

775
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:27,734
Hi.

776
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:30,304
- You must be trainees.
- Yes.

777
00:59:30,304 --> 00:59:32,206
- Are you all doing your best?
- Yes.

778
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,541
I thought a president was here.

779
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,845
Who on earth is here?

780
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:40,647
Come here.

781
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:06,974
Kim Ae Sim.

782
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:09,376
It was you?

783
01:00:54,188 --> 01:00:56,823
(Who Is She!)

784
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:59,326
Does that make you happy?

785
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,694
Decided to be rude?

786
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:02,462
- Are you crazy?
- How did you know?

787
01:01:02,462 --> 01:01:03,430
You!

788
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,898
You're a total junkie.

789
01:01:04,898 --> 01:01:07,334
Did it really belong to her?

790
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:10,704
Emily, that girl. She's not just getting
on my nerves. She's too much to handle.

791
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:12,172
It'll be even better
if she leaves on her own.

792
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,842
And she won't make the debut.

793
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:15,976
Hello?

794
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:18,679
Why do you have her phone...

795
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,681
Don't ask me anything for now.

796
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,482
What's happening in Jongno...

797
01:01:22,482 --> 01:01:24,618
while I'm gone?

798
01:01:24,618 --> 01:01:27,020
What if Ji Sook recognizes me?

799
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,955
Mother.

800
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,056
Mom.
