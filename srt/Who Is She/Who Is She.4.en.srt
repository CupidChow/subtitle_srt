<i>It's a lie</i>

<i>Your love is a lie</i>

<i>Your smile is a lie</i>

11
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,560
You're Emily, right?

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,732
No, I'm O Du Ri.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,036
Last name O, first name Du Ri.

14
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,641
You should understand.
She lost her memories.

15
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:19,046
You put so much effort into her.
I should understand.

16
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,019
Here.

17
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,092
I'll see you around.

18
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,107
(Episode 4, It's a Lie)

19
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,280
Is this Kim Ae Sim's company?

20
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,150
My goodness.

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,959
Have you lost your manners?

22
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,561
What was that attitude earlier?

23
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,795
What did I do?

24
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,864
Did you decide to be rude today?

25
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,901
Let me ask you something.

26
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,840
If I turn out well,
it works for your chairwoman.

27
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,110
Will my effort...

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,380
improve her later years or something?

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,251
No one should worry about her later years.

30
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,086
If I were you tell you anything,

31
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,057
you could put a period
in her perfect life.

32
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,961
The only thing she hasn't done is
going global.

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,198
So, Emily.

34
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,800
Accomplish your dream
to accomplish her long-cherished dream...

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,036
and my dream as well.

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,904
Please?

37
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,075
And please don't act out of the ordinary.

38
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,415
Then I should never let that happen.

39
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,017
(Edit: "The Man in the Yellow Shirt")

40
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,140
No practice today?

41
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,142
What if...

42
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,312
you can choose between realizing
a dream cherished for 50 years...

43
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,449
or taking revenge?

44
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,285
What would you choose?

45
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,152
All of a sudden?

46
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,225
I'm not sure...

47
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
because I haven't lived that long yet,

48
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,495
but I'd choose...

49
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,097
my dream, obviously.

50
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,833
- "Obviously?"
- Yes.

51
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,203
I can't let my enemy ruin my dream
of 50 years.

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
Especially if it's your arch-enemy,

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,409
what's a better revenge
than accomplishing your dream?

54
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,314
(Condolences)

55
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,816
(50 years ago)

56
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,079
Excuse me.

57
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,352
No.

58
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,556
I know you're a good singer.

59
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:50,991
What?

60
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,995
It's sorrowful, sad, touching,

61
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,065
and provoking.

62
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,833
"Provoking."

63
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,271
Well, anyway...

64
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,843
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,747
- What were you doing?
- Nothing.

66
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,335
Are you...

67
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,171
O Mal Soon?

68
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,146
Here.

69
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,516
My brother wrote this song.

70
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,220
He assured me...

71
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,989
to give it to Ms. O at the salon.

72
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,562
But why...

73
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,597
He said you had a unique sound
and emotions.

74
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,133
He wanted to make you debut.

75
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,839
He wanted to listen
to you singing his song.

76
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:30,924
Mal Soon.

77
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,432
(Dear Ms. O at the Royal Salon..)

78
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,669
Did he leave this for you?

79
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,109
I'm not sure if I should accept it.

80
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,912
Besides,

81
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,582
I don't know how to read music.

82
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,653
They look like bean sprouts
and spoons to me.

83
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,054
("The Man in the Yellow Shirt")

84
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,936
I have a piano at home.

85
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,839
I'll play this and record it on a tape.

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,809
Okay. Thank you.

87
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,547
Ms. Kim Ae Sim the everlasting legend...

88
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,816
and Mr. Ahn Sung Hoon
who's standing here today...

89
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,518
for his love for his favorite singer.

90
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,422
("The Man in the Yellow Shirt"
by Kim Ae Sim and Ahn Sung Hoon)

91
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:45,265
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

92
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:51,672
<i>That quiet man</i>

93
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:56,710
<i>For some reason I like him</i>

94
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,081
<i>For some reason he appeals to me</i>

95
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,686
<i>Although he's not good-looking</i>

96
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:11,792
<i>He looks strong</i>

97
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,662
<i>I like him</i>

98
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:21,235
<i>For some reason he makes my heart flutter</i>

99
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,406
- Emily...
- Emily...

100
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,510
You go first.

101
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,981
Do you know her?

102
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,384
I thought I already said no.

103
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,820
You were surprised to see her
when you first met her.

104
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:41,922
And even today.

105
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,393
She resembles someone...

106
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,737
I used to know.

107
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:48,464
A lot.

108
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,531
You used to know?

109
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,999
She still...

110
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,302
surprises me.

111
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,204
And she gives me the chills.

112
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,607
I wonder who that is.

113
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,311
Who could possibly give you the chills...

114
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,780
when nothing can shock you or fluster you?

115
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,683
Let's listen to the radio.

116
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,187
How would she feel when she sees you?

117
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,722
Was she happy to see you or...

118
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,890
She fell apart.

119
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,498
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

120
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,536
<i>That quiet man</i>

121
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,942
<i>For some reason I like him</i>

122
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,545
<i>For some reason</i>

123
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,049
<i>He appeals to me</i>

124
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,220
I can't let my enemy ruin my dream
of 50 years.

125
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,060
I barely retrieved my spring.

126
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,096
I can never lose it again.

127
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,234
A dream is a must.

128
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,639
And revenge...

129
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,076
can be taken at any time.

130
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,394
Are you here?

131
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,202
What? Move out?

132
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,138
Yes, let's start looking for a house.

133
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,477
How can you talk about moving out
when Mother hasn't returned yet?

134
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,813
I thought you'd be happy to hear it. No?

135
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:51,318
No man in the world would find it easy
to live with his mother-in-law.

136
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,154
- Still, this is wrong.
- We've lived here for long enough.

137
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,924
And I don't feel confident
about facing Mom...

138
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,625
as if nothing happened.

139
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,729
Ji Sook always kept her mouth shut...

140
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,165
if she didn't like something
ever since she was young.

141
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,335
Ji Sook.

142
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,873
Did something happen to you
that I'm not aware of?

143
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,977
Don't ask me anything for now.

144
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,914
I'll tell you when Mom's back.

145
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:22,950
Everything.

146
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,357
One, two, three, four, five. Poke.

147
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,792
Come back.

148
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,695
Wipe, stretch, go down.

149
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,796
<i>Feeling me</i>

150
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,465
Okay. The next step.

151
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,970
Did you practice last night?

152
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,671
Not bad.

153
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,441
Until now, it was an eyesore, you know?

154
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,642
A total eyesore.

155
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,278
If you're going to compliment,
just stick to compliment.

156
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,613
Why talk so much?

157
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,348
Don't go overboard.

158
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,651
You barely look like a human now.

159
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,761
If I improved that much overnight,

160
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,063
I can outdo you by tomorrow.

161
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,374
So much stress!

162
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:24,311
<i>I got you in my head</i>
<i>My head is</i>

163
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:28,282
<i>Filled with you all day long</i>

164
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:29,149
Wait.

165
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,753
If you breathe too much, it sounds weak.

166
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,922
Remove breathing and try to sound firm.

167
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,860
What's so picky about singing?

168
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,562
Besides, my granddaughter...

169
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,599
No, my friend said...

170
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,435
the trend now is half air and half sound.

171
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,170
No?

172
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,172
You're talking too much.

173
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,708
You could shoot a laser from your eyes.

174
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,643
- What?
- All right. I'll try again.

175
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,514
<i>I got you in my head</i>
<i>My head is</i>

176
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,415
No air.

177
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:05,052
<i>Filled with you all day long</i>

178
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,887
<i>What am I going to do now baby</i>

179
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,676
The time has come.

180
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,544
Come on.

181
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,950
What is this about?
You're making me nervous.

182
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,253
Get rid of your accent.

183
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,521
Overthrow your granny vibe.

184
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,724
An urgent intensive lesson is required.

185
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:45,626
So what if you can dance, sing,
and have the looks?

186
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,094
You sound like a granny.

187
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,764
What more does a singer need
aside from singing?

188
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,300
Do you know what other people call you?

189
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,735
A senior center.

190
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,070
Did you know they mimic you
and gossip about you?

191
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,605
I already have enough on my plate.

192
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,142
I don't care about what brats say.

193
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,213
Do they do that to you too?

194
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,018
Do they hit you or bully you?

195
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,221
What if they bully me?
Do you think I'd let them do that to me?

196
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,992
Ma'am, this is no time to worry about me.

197
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,460
That's all that matters.

198
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,429
Forget it.

199
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,565
Remember what I'm about to tell you.

200
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,101
When you want to emphasize something,

201
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,304
just say "darn" in front. Darn.

202
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,176
That's a curse.

203
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,046
Are you trying to get me
into a darn fight?

204
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:41,715
No.

205
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,484
That's darn upsetting.

206
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,520
Darn sad.

207
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,422
Darn pretty.

208
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,489
Darn happy.

209
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,457
Darn absurd.

210
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,826
See? Just say "darn" in front,
and it emphasizes the word.

211
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,497
I see.

212
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,836
When they called me Damily,

213
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,138
it meant I was awesome.

214
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,209
I knew those girls were prickly,
but they had an eye for it.

215
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,945
No, they were cursing at you.

216
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,747
Those pricks...

217
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,116
You said it was awesome,
and now it's a curse?

218
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,151
Why are you so inconsistent?

219
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,520
This isn't good.

220
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,755
From now on, pull yourself together
and memorize it.

221
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,594
"Butt out" meaning "upset."

222
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,764
"PNE" meaning
you "prefer a natural encounter."

223
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,700
"Effortless look" meaning you "dressed up
as if you didn't dress up."

224
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,601
And

225
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,738
if anyone bombards brutal truth at you,

226
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,175
say, "Are you a T?"

227
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,644
That ends the situation.

228
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:45,879
A "T?"

229
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,983
I don't know what you're saying.

230
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,119
"Gosh. Goodness. My goodness."

231
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,487
They're banned. No questions asked.

232
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,589
Every time you speak in an accent,
you have to pay me a dollar.

233
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,690
You think I can't do it?

234
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,696
Let me ask you a question.

235
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,601
Why are you so nice to me?

236
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,572
No, why are you nice to me?

237
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:12,472
There you go.

238
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,642
Because...

239
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,145
you remind me of my grandma.

240
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:20,480
What?

241
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,650
Has she noticed?

242
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,057
I wonder if it's your Chungcheong-do vibe.

243
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,326
It's hard to explain.

244
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,528
Anyway, I don't want to hear people
gossiping about you.

245
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:38,398
So memorize it like it's a song lyric.

246
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,012

the best you can do for me.

How can you do that?

367
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,693
and she was even aware
of their flight reservations...

368
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:54,795
that she chased them to hotels
when they went abroad.

369
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:55,629
My goodness.

370
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,232
That's not a fan. That's a stalker.

371
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,333
Bingo.

372
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:03,170
So they reported her for stalking.

373
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:04,872
And?

374
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,008
There was an unexpected twist.

375
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:12,246
It turned out that the stalker
and Daniel...

376
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,181
were in a relationship.

377
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,050
He later confessed it.

378
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,486
Things went viral.

379
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,624
If you think about it, it's no big deal,

380
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:24,925
but he retired after that.

381
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,661
His fans cried and went nuts.

382
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,663
Then he suddenly returned as a producer.

383
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:32,799
Daniel.

384
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,270
Daniel.

385
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,876
She got married,

386
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,379
and she'd never come back to Korea.

387
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,882
That's what I heard.

388
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,053
What happened?

389
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,388
She got divorced recently.

390
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:58,725
Her husband dropped her beloved dog
from the balcony.

391
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,060
From the tenth floor.

392
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:04,198
Still, I didn't expect her
to reach you immediately.

393
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:06,400
Are you okay?

394
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,069
Should I get you bodyguards?

395
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,229
What are you doing?

396
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,567
You scared me even more.

397
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:45,639
Wait.

398
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:48,575
What?

399
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:52,479
Did you have dinner?

400
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:10,230
You were the one who wanted to go eat,
but why are you picking at your food?

401
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,032
Why are you looking at me like that
when I'm eating?

402
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:13,500
Sorry.

403
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,104
It's my first time
to watch an eating show in person.

404
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,909
For your information,
food brings you luck,

405
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,677
and a dog doesn't bark when it's full.

406
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:25,679
Here.

407
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:32,352
You must eat to cheer up.

408
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:34,955
One more serving of sundae, please.

409
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,857
You've had five servings already.

410
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,625
What? Are you trying to save money?

411
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:42,496
No, you have the weight check tomorrow.
Aren't you worried?

412
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,364
Not sure. I have no tomorrow.

413
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:47,067
I'm not surprised.

414
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,781
Is everything okay?

415
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,250
It's not just the look on your face.

416
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,986
Your eyes are shaking like a pendulum.

417
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,555
You look nervous.

418
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,595
It's true.

419
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:24,004
I got this from an oriental clinic,

420
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,305
but I'll give it to you for free.

421
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:34,114
Don't just swallow it.
You must chew it for better effect.

422
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,755
Take one when you're nervous to death.

423
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,267
Don't look at me with those eyes.
You're not my type.

424
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:58,672
Then what's your type? Tell me.

425
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:05,479
They say the current trend is young men,

426
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:08,982
but I don't like young men.

427
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:12,186
They don't appeal to me
unless they're at least 60 years old.

428
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,294
Wait. You're already looking better.

429
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:27,534

430
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,004
Call me if you're hungry.

431
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:33,307
You.

432
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,743
You know what happens if
you lose control and cause trouble again.

433
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:38,879
Okay.

434
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,082
Bye now.

435
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,199
No one ever cared...

436
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,070
about whether I was hungry or not before.

437
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,538
That's new.

443
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,544
That place was in big trouble recently.

444
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:55,182
Someone posted on the internet
that they added cream to the soup.

445
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,551
They haven't had customers since then.

446
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,785
Add cream?

447
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:01,755
The restaurant owner argues it's not true,

448
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,725
but indeed, the soup
doesn't taste the same.

449
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:06,293
Even I don't go there anymore.

450
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,564
I told them repeatedly.

451
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:15,169
Anyway, I wonder where Ms. O is.

452
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,006
She's picky when it comes to food.
I'm worried if she's eating well.

453
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:23,043
I can't even sleep at night.

It looks good. Eat.

463
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:52,472
This looks good.

464
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,246
This is really good. You should try.

465
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,214
It's too hot.

466
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:02,983
- Baby, is it too hot?
- Yes.

467
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:07,187
You can't eat spicy food, can you?

468
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:23,170

469
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,339
- Come here.
- What is wrong with her?

470
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:29,743
End it with him before it's too late.

471
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,546
What are you saying?

472
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,414
Break up with him before things get ugly.

473

474
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,919
What do you know about him?

475
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:39,920
Whatever.

476
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:44,591
I can read faces
because it runs in my family.

477
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,994
That old man.

478
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:52,165
He'll be beaten to death
for flirting with every woman he sees.

479
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,638
Don't eat anything because you're hungry.

480
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,306
Don't just date anyone
because you're lonely.

481
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,842
I'm saying this all for you,
so keep it in mind.

482

Honey.

483
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,188
I'm okay.

She couldn't be sharper
when she was judging other people,

485

in the real estate?

491
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,672
So hot.

492
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,546
That was hot. Let's sit here.

493
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:15,916

Have you heard about Ms. O yet?

500
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,967

- And she was looking for an apartment.
- What?

505
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:01,855
She said she was keeping that house.

506
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,858
It's obvious that they're getting a place
only for their own.

00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:50,150
She should've given me a call at least.

547
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:58,825
Wait.

548
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:01,361
Her phone is on.

549
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:11,505
She answered.

550
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,874
Hello?

551
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:17,544
Ms. O, where are you?

552
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:18,946
Ms. O, can you hear me?

553
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,049
Hello?

554
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,754
Yes, Ms. O.

555
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,490
Where have you been?

556
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:33,193
Are you all right?

557
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:38,665
Ms. O.

558
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:39,533
Ms. O.

559
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,602
Mr. Park.

560
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:43,537
It's me.

561
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:47,040
Yes, Ms. O.

562
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:57,751
Mr. Park. It's me.

563
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,860
Wait. Why do you...

564
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:09,630
have her phone?

565
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,500
It's me.

566
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:15,903
Do you recognize me?

567
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:32,119
If you say that out of nowhere,
what do you expect me to do?

568
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:33,954
Who are you?

569
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:36,356
And why do you have...

570
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:38,258
Ms. O's phone?

571
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,495
I'm disappointed.

572
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:44,565
Don't you recognize me?

573
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,405
Let me ask you again.

574
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,508
Do you recognize me?

575
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,751
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are.

576
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,754
So tell me.

577
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:16,697
It was exactly 54 years ago.

578
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:22,102
On the day of Chungcheongbuk-do
ssireum championship...

579
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:25,672
Here come the players.

580
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:32,813
Park Gap Yong from Chungye-ri
and Kang Soo Chang from Galgok-ri.

581
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,517
It was two rivals' match for their pride.

582
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:41,121
Gap Yong was expected to win.

583
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,891
He couldn't be more confident.

584
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:58,639
On the sand ring,
you had two things in your hands.

585
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:00,174
The satba...

586
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,976
and my heart.

587
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:11,785
However,

588
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,790
was it the lamb the neighbors got you
the day before...

589
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,692
for you to cheer up?

590
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,996
As soon as your stomach felt cold,

591
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,099
an indescribable pressure
on your anus began...

592
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,503
that could burst any minute.

593
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:31,638
And in the end...

594
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:46,787
Stop!

595
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:50,891
Okay.

596
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:55,195
Ms. O. I heard you. You can stop.

597
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,406
Here.

598
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:07,508
What?

599
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,543
Thanks.

600
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:27,628
Could it be real?

601
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:34,234
She might be reciting a story
she picked up somewhere.

602
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:40,641
That hurts, you old man.

603
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:43,043
You know I hate it
when people touch my face.

604
00:45:44,678 --> 00:45:46,380
Yes, that's her temper.

605
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:52,052
Mom, she hit the old man.

606
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:52,886
Let's go.

607
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:55,122
No. Wait.

608
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:56,390
Baby.

609
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,961
I was only patting him.

610
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:03,897
What a world.

611
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:06,233
- I know.
- This is driving me crazy.

612
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,341
Let's get going.

613
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:16,043
Sure.

614
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,215
What?

615
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,084
You'll go back home in that body?

616
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:26,420
Lower your voice.

617
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:29,189
But how?

618
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:30,557
You think they would believe you?

619
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:34,595
No, I'm not going to tell them it's me.

620
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:35,796
What?

621
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:38,065
Just for a few days.

622
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,834
I'll check what's on their hearts...

623
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:43,170
and go on my way.

624
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,339
So,

625
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,442
help me out, Mr. Park.

626
00:46:57,017 --> 00:46:58,118
She's fast...

627
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,988
at learning and acquiring.

628
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,257
She's improving,

629
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,092
but I'm not sure about the team.

630
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:09,062
Did she lose her brain
when she lost her memories?

631
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:13,433
You know she's been having
an attitude problem lately.

632
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,336
And it's ruining teamwork.

633
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,906
Right. It's true that she's stubborn.

634
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:21,575
The girls say she's on drugs.

635
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:23,744
For female hormone.

636
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:28,315
What? She's not just a brat, but a junkie?

637
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:30,851
- What are we going to do?
- Hold on.

638
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,187
What are you pulling?

639
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,524
This unnecessary gossiping is not
a manner.

640
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:40,260
I thought it's something
we should all know...

641
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,628
Why do we?

642
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:43,263
Is it a drug? Is it illegal?

643
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:46,266
And how can you call
your student a junkie?

644
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,635
Daniel.

645
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:50,437
I knew you were careless,

646
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,506
but I didn't know you were frivolous.

647
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,278
Frivolous?

648
00:47:58,278 --> 00:47:59,313
CEO Han.

649
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,354
To be honest,

650
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:10,257
I get that you found her,

651
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:12,826
but putting the last one
to join in the center is...

652
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,530
causing issues in the team.
For favoring Emily.

653
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,533
And it's your job to make them overcome
any issues with their skills.

654
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:21,401
Okay.

655
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,205
If I'm favoring her,
is what you're doing discrimination?

656
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,409
Especially Ho Yi. Why is he so sensitive
when it comes to Emily?

657
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:33,280
I got a call from F Music.

658
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,450
To share their schedules
before their debut.

659
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:43,056
It's not in the contract. Ignore it.

660
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:48,228
If they feel anxious,
you should help them relax.

661
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:51,965
Let's evaluate them with the debut song.

662
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,369
The chairwoman also wants to see
how much Emily's improved.

663
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:35,375
Choi Ha Na.

664
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:38,879
You can stop with basic training
and join the debut song practice tomorrow.

665
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:40,848
Really?

666
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:47,154
You'll get a part in a debut song
including Ha Na.

667
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,723
And that's how we're going
to evaluate you.

668
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:50,724
Evaluate us?

669
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:54,127
Emily's back, and Ha Na newly joined us.

670
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:56,196
And the company's agreed...

671
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:58,665
that we need to evaluate
the existing members.

672
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,836
And those who don't meet our standards...

673
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:05,939
won't make the debut team.

674
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:12,079
Good luck.

675
00:50:18,652 --> 00:50:20,821
Evaluation already?

676
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:36,770
(Spring)

677
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,907
A man who drives a taxi
with the license plate number 333.

678
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,710
And a photo studio where the photographer
looks exactly the same.

679
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,114
And this stamp.

680
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:49,683
I have three clues.

681
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:52,386
How I became young,

682
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,988
and how much time I have left
with this face.

683
00:50:54,988 --> 00:50:55,889
Or...

684
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:58,559
when I'll become old again.

685
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,261
While I'm at home,

686
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:04,431
you must find the secret
of that photo studio.

687
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:09,436
"Spring."

688
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,176
Spring?

689
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,252
That's ridiculous.

690
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,589
How can we let a complete stranger
live in our house?

691
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:32,326
Well, she's not a complete stranger.

692
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:36,463
Both your mom and I know her grandma.

693
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,165
We're very close.

694
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:42,769
As you know, my place is fully booked.

695
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,471
Can you let her stay only for a week?

696
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:46,406
Have you talked to Mom?

697
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:48,375
Of course.

698
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,811
She never answered our calls.

699
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,013
How can she do that?

700
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,282
You become childish when you get old.

701
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:59,386
She must be sullen big time.

702
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,021
Where's she now?

703
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,457
- What?
- So I can visit her.

704
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,691
And I have something to tell her.

705
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:08,562
You can tell me.

706
00:52:08,562 --> 00:52:11,265
No, I can't do that.

707
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,701
I don't know where she is.

708
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,637
She didn't even let me ask her.

709
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,172
That's strange.

710
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,074
Did she get a boyfriend or something?

711
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,648
If we accept her,

712
00:52:27,848 --> 00:52:29,216
will she come home?

713
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,018
What?

714
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:39,693
Yes.

715
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:41,962
Okay.

716
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:45,332
Bye.

717
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:05,479
Ji Sook was so tenacious.

718
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:07,648
I had a hard time persuading her.

719
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,219
Since when did she miss me so much?

720
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,555
She's probably waiting to tell me
about moving out.

721
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,392
I must secure the safe first.

722
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:21,195
It has the house deed, bankbooks,
and cash.

723
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:24,064
This is yours.

724
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:29,903
Say you've lost your phone.

725
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:32,172
Don't get caught for taking it with you.

726
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:34,308
I'm still paying it off.

727
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:37,811
Don't let them suspect you.

728
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:41,381
You must become a completely new person.

729
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,184
How?

730
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:46,720
Your mouth.

731
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,424
Especially the curses.

732
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,259
No cursing.

733
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:55,329
And no nagging or being nosy.

734
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:58,265
I'm actually working
to get the granny vibe in me.

735
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:02,369
I'm even getting lessons.
You don't need to worry.

736
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:05,572
Lessons?

737
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:10,210
Anyway, what if Ji Sook recognizes me?

738
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:15,482
Even if I hate her, she's my blood.

739
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:18,418
If she loved you enough to recognize you,

740
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:21,421
she wouldn't have made you leave
in the first place.

741
00:55:22,256 --> 00:55:23,957
Let's be honest.

742
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:28,061
She doesn't know how to love anyone.

743
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:30,597
They say a single daughter is better
than ten sons.

744
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:34,234
She may be a girl,
but she's not any friendly...

745
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:38,805
Summer's over.
But why are there so many fruit flies?

746
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:48,682
Anyway, I've noticed
that Ja Yeong drinks even more now.

747
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,285
He's drinking even when the sun's up high.

748
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:56,256
No wonder. You were known for drinking
when you were young.

749
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:58,025
You reap what you sow.

750
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:01,828
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

751
00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:03,330
Look who's talking.

752
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:07,134
Don't blame Ji Sook
for not understanding you.

753
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:11,171
Who do you think she got her heartless
and indifferent attitude from?

754
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,109
Do you really want to do this?

755
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:23,483
Anyway, don't forget the reason
you're going back home.

756
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:27,120
Focus on your goal

757
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,722
and be strategic.

758
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:31,258
Understand?

759
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:33,660
Come on.

760
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:35,996
- Put that smile away.
- Come on.

761
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:42,302
Grandma.

762
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:45,806
Seriously.

763
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:50,244
I thought you went home the other day.
Where have you been?

764
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,545
Why didn't you answer your phone?

765
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:54,314
- Stop.
- My goodness.

766
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:02,055
I became a trainee.

767
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:04,424
I wanted to tell you first.

768
00:57:05,692 --> 00:57:08,061
By the way, who are you?

769
00:57:09,396 --> 00:57:10,397
Grandma.

770
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,035
Grandma, what are you doing here?

771
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:17,638
- Grandma?
- I was worried about you.

772
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,509
Grandma.

773
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,848
Do I resemble your grandma that much?

774
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,887
Seriously, cut it out.

775
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,557
You're scaring me.

776
00:57:36,557 --> 00:57:37,858
That's enough.

777
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:43,764
O Mal Soon?

778
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:46,934
I can't let you go like this today.

779
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,869
I'll get you a cab.

780
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,571
Stop wandering around and go home.

781
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:51,772
But...

782
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:54,775
Sir, please drop her off
in front of the house.

783
00:57:57,177 --> 00:57:58,579
Ms. O, see you at home.

784
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:07,891
(Park's)

785
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:43,857
Can you do it?

786
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:46,326
Don't worry.

787
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:49,897
Who are you again?

788
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,836
<i>O Du Ri, 21, from Buyeo, job seeker</i>

789
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,805
<i>My grandma is Kim Haeng Sook
O Mal Soon's best friend</i>

790
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,775
That's a piece of cake.

791
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,111
You don't need to worry.

792
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:07,080
Good.

793
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:19,560
- Hello.
- Hi.

794
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:34,575
She's your mother's friend's granddaughter
I told you about yesterday.

795
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:39,646
Hello.

796
00:59:40,347 --> 00:59:41,982
I'm O Du Ri.

797
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,284
Nice to meet you.

798
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:52,426
Look.

799
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,823
Ms...

800
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:23,824
Ms. O.

801
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:25,859
Mom.

802
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:27,528
Mother?

803
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:33,033
How...

804
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:35,669
You...

805
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,474
(Who Is She!)

806
01:01:14,474 --> 01:01:16,677
Who are you to pretending to be me
in my house?

807
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,544
Are you...

808
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:20,080
Who's that man that got you money?

809
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,948
You're the best.

810
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:22,149
Emily!

811
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:23,250
I shouldn't have taken it personally.

812
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,852
Why did you take it personally?

813
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:26,453
Stop following me.

814
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:27,487
What?

815
01:01:27,487 --> 01:01:29,056
We have something to talk about.

816
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:30,023
Here?

817
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:33,360
Your fan has returned.
Are you happy to see her again?

818
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,229
Until the debut song evaluation,

819
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,797
you're excluded from all training.

820
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:38,765
If I show them how hard I try,

821
01:01:38,765 --> 01:01:40,300
would that change their minds?

822
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,002
I should at least practice hardcore.

823
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:42,936
That girl...

824
01:01:42,936 --> 01:01:44,338
I told you it was your last chance.

825
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:46,273
What do you take me for?
