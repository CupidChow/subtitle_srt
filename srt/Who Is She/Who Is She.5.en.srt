5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,854
Enjoy.

6
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,834
There you are.

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,437
I've been looking for you everywhere.

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,206
And you are?

9
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:45,412
Don't be like that.
Please help me one more time.

10
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,447
I want to choose again.

11
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,419
Enjoy.

12
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,828
By the way, what's the title of this song?

13
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,964
It sounds retro but it's also really hip.

14
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,966
It's "Don't Turn Back."

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,104
The lyrics say you can't undo your choice,
so live each moment to the fullest.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,209
What fashionable clothes.

17
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,644
You look great in them...

18
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,049
with black hair and white hair as well.

19
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,362
(Episode 5, Don't Turn Back)

20
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,906
Ms. O.

21
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,107
Mom.

22
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,575
Mother?

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,577
How...

24
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,113
You...

25
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,386
You?

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,455
Is she seeing things?

27
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,058
Sorry.

28
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,861
My words keep coming out wrong lately.

29
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,738
O Mal...

30
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,274
O Mal...

31
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,613
We have to talk.

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,082
We have a lot to talk about
including this lady here.

33
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,517
But...

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,620
Before you talk with her, we have to talk.

35
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,893
What's going on?

36
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,733
(Emily 2)

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,240
A vacation?

38
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,410
And you even want to leave the dorm?

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,578
I'll have one day off.

40
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,247
And I won't leave the dorm for good.

41
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,883
But just ten days.

42
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,551
It's the evaluation soon.

43
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,787
I have to settle my affairs.

44
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,757
Is there something still left to settle?

45
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,327
Did you take out a private loan
or something?

46
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,331
I wasn't going to ask you
about your personal life,

47
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,398
but who are you?

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,934
You don't want to know.

49
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,772
Anyway, I promise
this won't affect the evaluation.

50
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,674
I can't cover for you forever.

51
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,110
Don't talk like you can't.

52
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,247
You should do your best on your side,

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,116
and I'll do what I have to do.

54
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,117
Okay. Done.

55
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,389
The person you are calling
is not available.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,291
Please leave a message after...

57
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,396
Guys.

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,465
I uploaded the files
in the group chatroom.

59
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,567
Check your parts that have changed.

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,236
Practice will start in ten minutes.

61
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,105
Move it.

62
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,039
- Okay.
- Okay.

63
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,220
The solo dance is still mine.

64
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,989
I'm jealous.

65
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,226
My part was too short already,

66
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,627
but it got even shorter.

67
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,263
How about you?

68
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,532
Did your part get shorter, too?

69
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,536
Yes, thanks to someone.

70
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,548
But who are you?

71
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,517
Grandma.

72
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,086
Do I resemble your grandmother that much?

73
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,557
What if she has dementia?

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,827
What's this?

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,966
Why the long face when you've got
a part in the debut song?

76
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,635
I don't expect tears of joy,

77
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,871
but determination and resolution.

78
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,706
You should at least show these two
in your face.

79
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,474
Actually...

80
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,644
I'm deeply moved.

81
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,647
I'll practice even harder.

82
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,115
- You should.
- Okay.

83
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,250
But...

84
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,386
where's Emily?

85
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,955
She wasn't even in the dorm yesterday.

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Here she goes again.

87
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:29,630
Did she really skip practice
without telling where she was going?

88
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,173
We've met before, right?

89
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,375
Who are you?

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,644
Who do you think you are
to pretend to be me in my house?

91
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,413
You and I.
We had to meet at some point.

92
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:47,981
What?

93
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,185
Same face, same voice.

94
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,056
Don't tell me you're...

95
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,125
Yes.

96
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,460
I'm her.

97
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,500
Is it really you?

98
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,040
But...

99
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,445
this doesn't make sense.

100
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:51,979
No.

101
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,115
You've always been a nobody to me.

102
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,518
You're dead to me.

103
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,854
What do you expect from me now?

104
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,424
I can't even enter my own house now.

105
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,661
So why did you come here
pretending to be me?

106
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,096
Nobody is glad to see you.

107
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,931
Please.

108
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,735
I have to tell you something.

109
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,711
Excuses and pretexts.

110
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,081
I don't want to hear any of them, so go.

111
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,253
It's too much for me already
to live looking like this.

112
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,023
But...

113
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,293
how did you recognize me?

114
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,963
How did you know I grew young again?

115
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,002
I...

116
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,409
(Taxi Driver)

117
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,816
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,419
What's absolutely forbidden.

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,055
Do I have to tell you again?

120
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,594
I have to go.

121
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,128
Sorry.

122
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,140
No way.

123
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,279
I can't believe this
even though I've seen it with my own eyes.

124
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,115
She looks completely different now
from head to toe.

125
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,252
I can't even.

126
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:43,056
But now that she's spruced up,
she looks like a wealthy lady, right?

127
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,260
She should've always spruced up like that.

128
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,564
I have a reasonable doubt now...

129
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,932
that she may have a boyfriend.

130
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,133
Don't be ridiculous.

131
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,571
"Min Seok, young man,
look how messy the house is."

132
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,274
She would've checked the refrigerator
and everything in the house...

133
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,176
and nagged about every single thing.

134
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,111
But she just left.

135
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,813
This says enough, doesn't it?

136
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,081
Really.

137
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,484
Mother is so...

138
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,891
Ji Sook.

139
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:19,927
What if...

140
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,663
she has dementia?

141
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,731
- What?
- "You."

142
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,667
"You."

143
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,804
She said "you" to someone she's just met.

144
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,774
When I heard that,
I got goosebumps in my...

145
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,976
She said her words came out wrong.

146
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,144
Don't make things complicated.

147
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,048
She's probably left
because she was at a disadvantage.

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,885
What do you mean?

149
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,820
Nothing.

150
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,627
I'm curious about that "nothing."

151
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,831
You two were never friendly
toward each other,

152
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,067
but you've been acting strange
for some time when you were with her.

153
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,403
Even today,
you had seen her after a long time...

154
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,471
but you said, "We have to talk."

155
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,807
"We have a lot to talk about." Seriously?

156
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,342
I'm glad Ha Na took after me.

157
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,711
Just imagining Ha Na being like you
gives me a headache.

158
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,279
I said it's nothing.

159
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,452
Hello?

160
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,021
- Is Grandma back?
- Yes.

161
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,557
But she left again.

162
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,593
You shouldn't have let her leave.

163
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,995
What are you saying?

164
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,162
Grandma seemed a little...

165
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,599
I mean, quite strange.

166
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,067
What?

167
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,570
Be more specific.

168
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,840
You should get back inside.
Practice will start.

169
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,707
Okay.

170
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,378
Mom, I have to go. I'll call you later.

171
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:45,779
Ha Na.

172
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,914
Choi Ha Na.

173
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,152
She probably means it's nothing.

174
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,860
You cannot change the final decision.

175
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,665
You must never divulge
any information related to it.

176
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,970
If you were going to be this hard on me,
you shouldn't have given me my youth back.

177
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,906
You gave it and took it again.

178
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,008
You don't even let me undo my choice.

179
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,045
Don't you think this is too much?

180
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:22,482
You are the one who chose to go back.

181
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,519
Nobody forced you.

182
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,054
Fine.

183
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,723
I regret it.

184
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,425
That's why...

185
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,429
I don't want her to regret.

186
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,042
She never even showed herself
for over 60 years.

187
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,345
So what does she expect now?

188
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,084
Practice.

189
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,887
I'm in trouble.

190
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:00,854
Taxi!

191
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,524
I can't even.

192
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,902
Excuse me.

193
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,873
That brat.

194
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,210
Do you think UNIS is a pushover?

195
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,245
Do you think debuting is a joke?

196
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,681
No, I don't.

197
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,551
You said
it wouldn't affect the evaluation.

198
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,586
But you're late on the first day.

199
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,222
I told you it was your last chance.

200
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,930
Individual departure, unreported leave.

201
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,700
You've violated codes number three, five,
and six of the Trainees' Code of Conduct.

202
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,204
For a week starting today...

203
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,840
until the debut song evaluation,

204
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,943
you're excluded from all training.

205
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,385
Every single one of you here
in the debut group...

206
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,655
will be evaluated to see
whether you really deserve to debut.

207
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:10,958
Therefore,

208
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,127
if you're eliminated,
it's entirely your fault.

209
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,302
Why? Do you think this is unjust?

210
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:24,338
Do you think it's unfair?

211
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,642
I have no excuse whatsoever.

212
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,982
My goodness. Look at her.

213
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,816
That's a big one.

214
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,718
She's scary.

215
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,364
I've taken care of it myself.

216
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:51,565
Don't you think you've been too harsh?

217
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,502
Say one more word...

218
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,172
and I'll report your abuse of power
and overstepping, and resign.

219
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,278
Do you think I'm glad to do this?

220
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,781
Me being like this to stop her is...

221
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,517
actually good for you, me, and everyone.
That's all you have to know.

222
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,396
One, two, three, four. Keep the formation.

223
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,965
Min A, yes.

224
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,533
One, two, three, four.

225
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,870
All together.
One, two, three, four, two, two.

226
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,573
Stretch your arms. Keep the formation.

227
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,507
You!

228
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,409
Sorry.

229
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,079
Don't you know
you're excluded from training?

230
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,516
Don't be too heartless like that.

231
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,818
I'm not banned from the practice room.

232
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,990
Girls, focus.

233
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,160
It's okay. Stand in formation again.

234
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,394
Daniel.

235
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,929
- Hello.
- Hello.

236
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,906
You're uncontrollable.

237
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,743
This is not the time to pick an argument.

238
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,381
Girls, let's go and eat dinner.

239
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,050
The chairwoman wants to eat
with all of you.

240
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,318
Get ready soon.

241
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,854
- Okay.
- Okay. Practice is over.

242
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,389
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,891
Daniel, wait for me.

244
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,528
It's a company dinner. Cool.
We'll be eating meat.

245
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,129
I don't think so.

246
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,632
Everyone's leaving. Aren't you coming?

247
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,868
What's with that face?

248
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,004
I thought you said you craved meat.

249
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:40,073
Thanks to someone
who made me lose my appetite,

250
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,909
I won't be having a nutritious meal today.

251
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,713
Excuse me.
Please give me a bottle of soju and beer.

252
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,282
Are you crazy?

253
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,450
Look at her.
She plans to act recklessly now.

254
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,554
She will be crowded out anyway,
so self-destruction is not a bad idea.

255
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,730
Girls, stand up.

256
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,798
The chairwoman is here.

257
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,800
Bow to her.

258
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,502
One, two.

259
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:09,970
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

260
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,905
Good evening. Did I keep you waiting?

261
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,674
You can all sit down.

262
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,275
Please sit down.

263
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:16,977
Unbelievable.

264
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,980
Don't eat rice. Eat a lot of meat.

265
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,815
I won't check your weight this week.

266
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,119
Good.

267
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,156
The meat is nicely cooked. Please enjoy.

268
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,392
When I look at you guys
going through trouble away from home,

269
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,961
it makes my heart break.

270
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,731
It reminds me
of my tough days when I was young.

271
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,802
They say you shouldn't make a speech
when there's food on the table.

272
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,450
So stop the chat and eat...

273
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,352
before the meat burns.

274
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,722
Okay. I'll eat.

275
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,565
My goodness.

276
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,735
Chairwoman Kim, you have such clear skin.

277
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:18,405
You seem to be getting younger every year.

278
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,941
You flatter me.

279
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,912
I'll pour you a drink.

280
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,550
He's flattering her too much.

281
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,019
If she grows younger as he says,
she'll be wearing diapers again.

282
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,224
Don't say that. What if she hears you?

283
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:38,592
Are you drunk?

284
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:44,798
I've been drunk
and I've cried my eyes out before,

285
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,202
but nothing could relieve the resentment.

286
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,003
Here you go again.

287
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,048
Okay.

288
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,952
Before the evaluation,

289
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,388
may I put in a word?

290
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,158
- Don't.
- Let go.

291
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,795
Sure. Go on.

292
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,233
Years of living...

293
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,303
made me encounter people...

294
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,772
who got on other people's backs
to get higher.

295
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:28,108
But one should put in their own effort
to succeed.

296
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,577
If one sponges off of others to succeed,
you cannot call that success.

297
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,213
It's a shameful medal.

298
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,051
What I'm saying is...

299
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,923
that we should fight fair and square
in the evaluation.

300
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:43,924
Understand?

301
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,194
Let's go.

302
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,831
Understood. Let's go.

303
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,770
That was a nice speech.

304
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,977
That was a nice speech,
although expressed in harsh words.

305
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,079
I hope everyone bears that in mind.

306
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:08,949
Let's eat.

307
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,152
Chairwoman Kim.

308
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,589
May I pour you a drink?

309
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,861
Sure.

310
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,465
Stop.

311
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,619
Are you happy living like that?

312
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:49,923
What?

313
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,661
What I want to know is...

314
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,932
how it feels to live high on the hog
as a famous singer like yourself.

315
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,501
I'm curious.

316
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,274
You're quite something.

317
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,010
I see.

318
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,380
I hope you do well on the evaluation...

319
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,315
and experience it yourself...

320
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,152
how I feel to live like this.

321
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,387
I certainly will.

322
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,591
Follow me.

323
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,931
I'm sorry, Chairwoman Kim.
You must be startled.

324
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,132
She has a unique personality.

325
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,367
That brat.

326
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,835
I'll pour you a drink.

327
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:38,038
I wasn't sure she was Emily at first.

328
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,341
But that brat does not know
how to respect the elderly.

329
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,477
So I'm sure now.

330
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,679
That brat is unbelievable.

331
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,516
What's wrong with you?

332
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,724
What did I do this time?

333
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,427
You're unusual, strange,
and self-centered.

334
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,129
That's fine.

335
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,499
But I thought you knew the basics.

336
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,135
I just...

337
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,204
wanted to get close.

338
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:14,074
So I tried to act cute.
Don't be like that.

339
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:14,908
Cute?

340
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,946
Your words and actions showed you didn't
care about how the other person felt.

341
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:19,980
Do you call that cute?

342
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:22,983
I thought you were a good person,
but I was completely wrong.

343
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,853
You never thought of me as a good person.

344
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:26,920
Emily!

345
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,123
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,160
I crossed the line today
because I was drunk.

347
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,798
I'll be more careful next time,
so don't be distressed.

348
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,199
Distressed?

349
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,371
Where are you going?

350
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:46,974
To study.

351
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,510
I don't know the basics, and I'm a brat.

352
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,579
I should at least practice hardcore
if I don't want to be kicked out.

353
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,719
That girl. I can't even.

354
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,295
You know she was provoking me
on purpose, right?

355
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:11,965
Her eyes showed she was.

356
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,568
How interesting.

357
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,539
She must've been like that
because she was drunk. I'll make sure...

358
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,174
No, don't do anything.

359
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,377
Don't get close to her.
Don't get involved.

360
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,846
If she walks out on her own, even better.

361
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,054
There are things that happen in the world
that you cannot explain,

362
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,291
and things you feel
that you cannot explain.

363
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,061
Just do as I say.

364
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:50,504
<i>You know</i>

365
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:51,839
<i>You</i>

366
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,808
<i>You know my lips don't</i>

367
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,844
<i>You know</i>

368
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:32,913
(You are our power, Chairwoman Kim.
Thank you for everything.)

369
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:39,353
Young ladies who remind me
of the days when I was 20.

370
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:41,622
Your passion will make
your dream come true.

371
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,411
You've broken so many already.

372
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,880
If you're going to keep gaping,

373
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,882
just quit working here.

374
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,150
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,985
I'm frustrated already
because we lost regulars,

376
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,387
and you're making it worse.

377
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,264
Jung Soo.

378
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,667
Don't wait.

379
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,603
Ae Sim is never coming back.

380
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,575
Ae Sim will be on television today.

381
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,146
After today, it will become Ae Sim's song.

382
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,315
I'm sorry I couldn't stop her.

383
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:46,453
She's on television.

384
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,055
I'm so nervous.

385
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,427
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

386
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,463
<i>That quiet man</i>

387
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:58,465
She's so good.

388
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,735
The star from Royal Salon, Kim Ae Sim.

389
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,136
I'm so proud of her.

390
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:04,438
She's so good.

391
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,775
- She's a great singer.
- She's beautiful.

392
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,077
Ae Sim, let's go.

393
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,512
I told you she'll become a star.

394
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,114
- I'm the one who said that.
- No, it was me.

395
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,215
I said it first.

396
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,593
(Everything starts now.)

397
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,623
(Home camera - Disconnected)

398
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,596
(No name)

399
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,165
Your fan has returned.
Are you happy to see her again?

400
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,986
I told you your mother said yes.

401
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,856
She said if the room loses human touch,
it will become abandoned.

402
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,225
So she said I should clean it and use it.

403
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,494
How can I believe you?

404
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:44,164
And my mom doesn't like it
when other people touch her things.

405
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,266
Go upstairs.

406
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,777
Fine. You should at least eat breakfast.

407
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:58,912
You need to eat breakfast
to have some strength.

408
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:02,749
You should eat more.

409
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,685
You need breakfast to have some strength.

410
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:16,163
Miss, what do you think you're doing?

411
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,433
Mom and Mr. Park kept asking me,
so I accepted you.

412
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,134
But to be honest, I don't like you.

413
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:24,571
The way you talk and behave.
All of them get on my nerves.

414
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,741
Why is your face so worn?

415
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,178
You became a director, but it seems
nobody bought you a meal to celebrate.

416
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,349
You're really strange.

417
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,117
Also,

418
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:41,855
rumor has it...

419
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,993
that you're visiting the real estate
quite often.

420
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,962
Are you moving?

421
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:49,830
What?

422
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:52,599
Do I have to tell you about that?

423
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,567
If you're not, okay.

424
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,508
She could've just said yes if it was true.

425
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,178
I'm sure she's up to something.

426
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,783
That fierce lady.

427
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:24,031
Why does he also look worn?

428
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:54,695
Don't just swallow it.
You must chew it for better effect.

429
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,967
Take one when you're nervous to death.

430
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,087
Come in.

431
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:27,261
Are you busy?

432
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,195
What is it?

433
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,902
I came to see what tasty snack
you were secretly enjoying.

434
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,450
Water boiled with jujubes.

435
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,953
I brought that to drink myself...

436
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:55,355
but I've worried you a lot
the past few days...

437
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:56,823
so I'll give it to you today.

438
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:57,724
Jujubes?

439
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,263
This works the best
when you can't sleep at night.

440
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,668
You make me worried
and you comfort me as well.

441
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,920
Here's your rice soup.

442
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,590
The chef saw you guys...

443
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,960
and added a bunch of beef head meat.

444
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,661
So there's no profit for us.

445
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,230
I hope you enjoy.

446
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,398
Look how friendly he is.

447
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,401
The old woman is gone...

448
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,072
and young people are working hard now.
Isn't that great?

449
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,673
Even so, the taste is what matters.

450
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:50,344
Right. Guess who I saw yesterday.

451
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:51,211
Who?

452
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,547
The previous owner of this restaurant,
Ms. O Mal Soon.

453
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:57,985
Do you mean Ji Sook's mom?

454
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:58,852
Yes.

455
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:02,856
I heard she was kicked out of the house.
She must be back now.

456
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:04,458
How did she look?

457
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,759
Was she dispirited?

458
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,327
Not at all.

459
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:10,430
She returned looking completely different,
like a wealthy lady.

460
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,698
What?

461
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:14,535
I was really surprised.

462
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:17,604
She used to look absent-minded
like she had lost the world.

463
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,439
I wonder what happened.

464
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,476
Mister.

465
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:26,647
You mentioned before
that Ms. O seemed strange, didn't you?

466
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,515
You said she seemed to forget things.

467
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:29,349
Me?

468
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,251
Well...

469
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:35,756
she's well advanced in years now...

470
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:40,427
so she may be forgetful.
That's what I meant.

471
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:45,399
To be honest, she often
got confused about the ingredients...

472
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,368
and almost burned the cauldron
several times.

473
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,570
My goodness.

474
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,738
To cover for her mistakes,

475
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:55,342
my brother here
went through so much trouble.

476
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,944
Well...

477
00:32:56,944 --> 00:33:01,481
So you two saved this restaurant
when it was about to fail.

478
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:06,887
What's the point of being so tough
and determined to raise her girl...

479
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:10,891
when she's not even treated nicely
just because she's slowed up?

480
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:14,161
She was so proud of her daughter
as if she had become a president.

481
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,462
What a pity.

482
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,967
There's nobody like Ji Sook's mom.

483
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,392
She raised her girl all alone

484
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:24,438
and made her an executive
in a major company.

485
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:27,741
She made a restaurant without a sign
into the best rice soup restaurant.

486
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,410
Although she's small,

487
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,212
she's the owner of a building.

488
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,848
Don't talk her down like that.

489
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,484
Just eat.

490
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:45,259
I was just saying the facts.
I wasn't talking her down.

491
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,137
I'm so full.

492
00:33:58,305 --> 00:33:59,673
- Bye now.
- Bye.

493
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:02,976
My goodness.

494
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:07,514
(Soon Ae's Supermarket)

495
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,251
Drink this.

496
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:14,721
You always drank something sweet
when you were upset.

497
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:21,361
I'm in trouble.

498
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,900
I don't remember anything.

499
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,436
What?

500
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,572
You don't remember anything at all?

501
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,577
You and I...

502
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:46,520
There.

503
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,456
That was the story
of our 20-year friendship.

504
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,993
By the way,
how did you get in an accident?

505
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:54,528
- Are you okay?
- Well...

506
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:59,967
There was a loud bang,
and when I opened my eyes,

507
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,603
everything went blank.

508
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,304
I barely found my way home.

509
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:08,442
Anyway,
I had been forgetting things recently.

510
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,212
Now that I've heard your story,
I think I remember some things.

511
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:19,019
- You're here.
- Min Seok.

512
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,221
Mi Jin, I'll drive.

513
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,189
Hold on.

514
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,196
Ms. O.

515
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,130
Mother?

516
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:33,433
- There.
- I was too busy, that's why.

517
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,104
And he's...

518
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:40,073
Ha Na's dad.

519
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,544
My gosh.

520
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,062
Are you suffering from insomnia again?

521
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:06,166
Taking medicine didn't cure this.

522
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,802
So it's even worse
when there's an audience.

523
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:09,903
What are you saying?

524
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,707
- Don't tell me...
- Right.

525
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,276
Do you have an empty room at your place?

526
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,646
I don't want to go home.
Let me sleep there.

527
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:23,283
What?

528
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,455
What's with that serious look?

529
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,523
It was a joke.

530
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,442
Soo Jin.

531
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:53,447
You're in charge of the practice today.

532
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:55,249
Me?

533
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:56,517
You're always next when I'm gone.

534
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,418
Okay.

535
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,187
Right.

536
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:03,490
Don't forget to tell the girls
that the interim check changed to 2 p.m.

537
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,758
Especially that brat.

538
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:07,327
I don't want her to blame me
for not hearing about it.

539
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:08,428
Thanks.

540
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:10,764
- Leave it to me.
- Okay.

541
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,209
You.

542
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,084
You know it's the interim check
tomorrow, right?

543
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,220
Is it tomorrow already?

544
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,122
Time flies like an arrow.

545
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,790
Come to the group practice room by 3 p.m.

546
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:43,897
Okay.

547
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:49,536
That girl.

548
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,641
Who is it again?

549
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:01,949
Come to the recording booth
after practice.

550
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,687
You did great.

551
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,166
This was hard.

552
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,667
Isn't this okay?

553
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,402
Guys, the dance tomorrow...

554
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:24,905
You have to emphasize this move.

555
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:30,544
This was really hard.

556
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:37,017
Are you eating a salad?
I haven't had any meals today.

557
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,423
You left a whole bowl.

558
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,695
Why do I suddenly have a stomachache?

559
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,230
Bathroom.

560
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:58,739
Soo Jin.

561
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:10,984
(Mom)

562
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:16,657
Hello?

563
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:19,760
You're where?

564
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,134
Seriously?

565
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:32,539
Here.

566
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,443
What brought you here?

567
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,346
Did you come because you were worried?

568
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,951
You're a wiry lady who left the house
saying you won't enter university.

569
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,619
Why would I worry?

570
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,797
But why aren't you eating much?
This is your favorite.

571
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:59,266
There's a weight...

572
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:04,471
I'm on a diet these days.

573
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,407
You still have time to quit all this.

574
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,409
Don't trouble the other girls.

575
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,744
I'm not.

576
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,879
I'm not you, Mom.

577
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,616
I'm super close with the girls.

578
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,217
The music instructor
even complimented me today.

579
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,286
It's just your words,
so I don't believe them.

580
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:21,955
I can't stop thinking about your grades.

581
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,891
You would've easily entered
a nice university after repeating.

582
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,830
My age, birthday, height,
SAT score, and GPA.

583
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,866
You only know the numbers about me,
don't you, Mom?

584
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,803
It's our first time seeing each other
after I left home.

585
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,006
"Is everything okay? It must be tough."

586
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:40,641
You should at least say
something like this.

587
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:43,906
I'm doing more than enough already
to pretend nothing happened.

588
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:48,749
You're right. That's you.

589
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:54,254
Just take care of Ms. O for me.

590
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:57,724
She's been saying strange things lately.
This doesn't feel good.

591
00:40:57,724 --> 00:40:58,959
I'm worried.

592
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,627
I'll take care of everything.

593
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,697
Don't mind the business of grown-ups.
Just do what you're supposed to do.

594
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:05,766
I'm a grown-up too.

595
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,770
You don't even let me worry.

596
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:11,672
How annoying.

597
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,455
Take care.

598
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:30,490
Ha Na.

599
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:35,596
Never mind.

600
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,898
Don't skip meals.

601
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:57,150
Bye.

602
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,104
Why did you suddenly call me here?

603
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:20,908
I'm too worried not to check anything.

604
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:22,643
Get inside.

605
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:25,279
What should I sing?

606
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:21,602
<i>I'll become a forest</i>

607
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:26,206
<i>So can you please
walk up the small hill</i>

608
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:34,114
<i>and look at me?</i>

609
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:38,585
<i>It can be in the corner of my heart</i>

610
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:46,560
<i>I will break a path</i>

611
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,663
<i>You can cut me down</i>

612
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:52,900
<i>Don't walk past me</i>

613
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,668
<i>Look at me</i>

614
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:59,206
<i>I'll listen to you</i>

615
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:02,309
<i>You can tell me now</i>

616
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,180
<i>Look at me</i>

617
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:13,520
<i>Was it the sea, not a forest?</i>

618
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:20,093
<i>But there were tall trees around</i>

619
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:27,501
<i>I want to do at least one thing right</i>

620
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:32,539
<i>Will I drown now?</i>

621
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:11,144
I sang for you. Now say something.

622
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,748
Well,

623
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,084
it wasn't bad.

624
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,721
But...

625
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:25,325
what was that harmony in the chorus?

626
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:27,861
Did you play something?

627
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,831
No, you heard it in your head.

628
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:32,599
No. I'm sure I heard it.

629
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,302
It was a voice
completely different from yours.

630
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:47,514
It must've been a ghost.

631
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:54,321
They say there's a ghost
in the recording booth.

632
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:55,489
Everyone knows this.

633
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,758
Didn't you know?

634
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,097
What?

635
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,099
What's this?

636
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:16,410
A woman.

637
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,078
A woman?

638
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:21,715
Behind you.

639
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,451
Me?

640
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,355
She's on your back.

641
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,305
Is she gone?

642
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,974
Not yet.

643
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:49,409
Not yet?

644
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,187
There's no such thing as a ghost.

645
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:05,993
You're such a scaredy cat.

646
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,899
Seriously.

647
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,867
That was hilarious.

648
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:16,303
You're so funny.

649
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:22,342
One, two.

650
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:25,679
One, two.

651
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,814
One, two.

652
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:37,558
He was always so full of himself.

653
00:47:58,512 --> 00:47:59,446
Mr. Park.

654
00:48:08,655 --> 00:48:10,390
It's nice to see you eat up.

655
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:16,029
Please give us two more portions
of ribeye.

656
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,064
Okay.

657
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:20,767
They say when you're young,
you can even chew on rocks. That's true.

658
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,103
In the past,
even when I ate a tiny amount,

659
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,872
I suffered from indigestion.

660
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:28,008
But now, I can digest everything.

661
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,776
I keep wanting more to eat.

662
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,250
Here.

663
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,087
Eat.

664
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,255
One left.

665
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,193
You can eat all you want.

666
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,431
Why do young ladies not know...

667
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,566
that men who buy ribeye for them...

668
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:55,169
are better than men who buy flowers?

669
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,571
Fine. You're amazing, Mr. Park.

670
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,106
You're the best. Happy now?

671
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:04,978
Yes.

672
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:07,481
Please hurry and give us the ribeye.

673
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:15,122
Are the girls still mean to you?

674
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,025
You said they were
always trying to bite your head off.

675
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:18,892
Yes.

676
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:22,129
Vegetables are all they eat.

677
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:25,866
They're tired and hungry.

678
00:49:25,866 --> 00:49:27,668
That's why they've become edgy.

679
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,637
But you shouldn't be so soft on them.

680
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:33,874
You have no idea how manipulative
and scary young kids are these days.

681
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:35,776
No.

682
00:49:35,776 --> 00:49:38,879
Young kids these days, including Ha Na.

683
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,181
I thought they were thoughtless
and always whining.

684
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:44,284
But they're smart and firm inside.
I'm actually learning from them.

685
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:49,022
Right. You're a true grown-up.

686
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:57,331
About Kkeut Soon.

687
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,201
What?

688
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,839
I wonder how she's doing.

689
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,309
She left for the States
when she was so little...

690
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:12,579
and she's never called.
Why do you suddenly ask?

691
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:18,318
We fought a lot when we were young.

692
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,622
She crossed my mind. That's all.

693
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,625
But...

694
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:27,427
How pretty.

695
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:35,068
You used to ignore flowers saying
they were inedible but expensive trash.

696
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:36,170
How unexpected.

697
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,539
You can't eat these with your mouth,
but with your eyes.

698
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:49,183
Do you want me to buy you one?

699
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,454
If you're going to, buy me a bundle.

700
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:55,822
Will you buy me?

701
00:50:55,822 --> 00:50:58,158
Buy me a bundle. Yes?

702
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,060
Okay. I will.

703
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,436
Should I call her and...

704
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,607
I'm checking how patient I can be.

705
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,441
So leave her be.

706
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:57,451
I didn't expect everyone to be here.

707
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,891
Brat.

708
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:06,393
Come here.

709
00:52:11,598 --> 00:52:12,833
What time is it?

710
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,208
It's 2:16 p.m.

711
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,844
No, it's 2:17 p.m. now.

712
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,914
You're a staggering 17 minutes late...

713
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,515
and you're so confident.

714
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:31,752
Are you out of your mind?

715
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,356
Go to your place.

716
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,059
Go to your place this instant!

717
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:53,373
If it meets the conditions,
I'll pay whatever the price is.

718
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:56,276
The quicker I can move, the better.

719
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:57,845
Okay.

720
00:52:58,478 --> 00:52:59,880
I'll be waiting. Thanks.

721
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:09,156
Okay. Good job, everyone.

722
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:10,090
Take a rest.

723
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:14,695
You two. Keep practicing.

724
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:16,096
Okay.

725
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:19,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

726
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,736
Let's go and eat something tasty.

727
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,645
What?

728
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:36,984
You can hate me, despise me,
bother me, or whatever you want.

729
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:38,785
But you should still play fair.

730
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,056
What do you get
for lying and preying on me?

731
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,424
How could you act so cheap...

732
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:46,793
and lie about a mere interim check?

733
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:48,395
A mere interim check?

734
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,298
When you went off the grid
and enjoyed yourself,

735
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:53,066
I practiced without even a rest.

736
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,902
Although this seems to be
a mere interim check for you.

737
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:57,070
The interim check, debut song evaluation,

738
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,006
and debut showcase.

739
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,408
Even when you're done
with all of them, you're 20.

740
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:04,945
You will encounter crises like these
thousands of times in the days ahead.

741
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:07,247
Are you going to act ugly like that
each time?

742
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,316
You're talking
like you've lived for several decades.

743
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:12,920
Are you saying you're dignified
and unashamed of your life?

744
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:16,890
What do you mean?

745
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,629
You were actually worse than I thought.

746
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:26,266
I knew I saw it in you.

747
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:28,802
Anyway,

748
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:31,705
I'm never letting someone like you
take the center.

749
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,755
She definitely crossed the line.

750
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,528
You must be upset.

751
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:59,032
It's not the deceiver's fault.
It's my fault for being fooled.

752
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:02,936
It's okay. That woke me up.

753
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:04,404
I feel refreshed.

754
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:06,373
Let's do this.

755
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,047
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

756
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:20,654
Yes.

757
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:24,124
Okay. Understood.

758
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:26,193
Daniel.

759
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:43,510
Yes?

760
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:52,953
You're here.

761
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,355
You haven't eaten dinner, have you?

762
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,591
Cockles are in season,
so they served seasoned cockles.

763
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:58,692
Let's eat.

764
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,962
I asked to edit out
all the parts about me...

765
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:03,664
in your interview.

766
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:11,505
Why are you acting like an adolescent boy?

767
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:17,277
This is what you like the most,
and what you're the best at.

768
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:19,580
Why do you want to leave?

769
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,581
I know.

770
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:24,718
This is what I like the most,
and what I'm the best at.

771
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,421
But why is it giving me a hard time?

772
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:31,592
You look quite worn. Are you tired?

773
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:33,427
Aunt.

774
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:36,096
It's because of her, isn't it?

775
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:08,128
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

776
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:11,064
Let's go now.

777
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:15,736
Do you want me to buy you one?

778
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:19,072
If you're going to, buy me a bundle.

779
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:21,675
Another trainee spotted that
and took a picture.

780
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,811
She doubted it at first...

781
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:27,881
but later thought it was serious,
so she reported it to the company.

782
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:32,886
I'll look into it.

783
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,756
You know how bad a scandal is for an idol.

784
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,357
You know best, CEO Han.

785
00:57:38,325 --> 00:57:41,128
She has no manners, she's rude,

786
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,729
and she's even disloyal.

787
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:46,400
I heard she was late for practice today
but so confident.

788
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,101
The trainers were astonished.

789
00:57:49,536 --> 00:57:51,471
You can't defend her like...

790
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,472
I said I'll look into it.

791
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,252
What is it?

792
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,928
You've prepared what?

793
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:51,031
I know you can't withdraw money
for some time.

794
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:54,968
So I've withdrawn some cash
for you to use for now.

795
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:56,703
Drop by later to check.

796
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:01,875
You're the only man who thinks of me.

797
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:05,279
Okay, I'll drop by before I...

798
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:06,613
You scared me.

799
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:13,921
Why are you here at this time?

800
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:17,257
Who is that man who thinks of you
and even withdraws money for you to use?

801
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:18,759
He doesn't seem like family.

802
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:23,063
That's...

803
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:26,967
Actually...

804
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:32,606
I'm not sure if you know,

805
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,075
but I'm the boss of this company.

806
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,079
From the trainees
who are only longing for a debut...

807
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,848
to singers, trainers,

808
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:43,283
employers, partner companies,
and the family of all of them.

809
00:59:44,484 --> 00:59:47,087
There are hundreds of people
I'm responsible for providing.

810
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:50,724
Do you not want this that much?

811
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,927
Is it that bad?

812
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:58,398
I don't understand what you're saying.

813
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:01,935
Fine.

814
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:04,972
This is it.

815
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,175
What do you mean?

816
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:11,078
What are you saying?

817
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,246
Emily.

818
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:14,948
You're...

819
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,584
out.

820
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,216
(Who Is She!)

821
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:52,319
How long do you expect me
to cut you some slack and cover for you?

822
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,788
They probably took their own course
to stand out.

823
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:57,057
Violations of the rules.

824
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:59,760
What if they kick Ha Na out too?

825
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,696
Ji Sook may know something about it.

826
01:01:02,696 --> 01:01:04,798
What you want to hide.

827
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:07,401
Look at this mess in the house.

828
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:09,169
Are you talking to me?

829
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,470
I shouldn't have taken it personally.

830
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,972
Why did you take it personally?

831
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,106
I'm sorry, sir.

832
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:15,642
That brat is somewhat arrogant.

833
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:17,544
I don't know what you're up to,
but you should leave.

834
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:19,346
How will you make me?
