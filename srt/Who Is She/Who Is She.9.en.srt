(Miryang Pork Rice Soup)

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,102
Hello.

5
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,715
What would you like?

6
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,985
One rice soup, please.

7
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,058
One rice soup.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
Yes.

9
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,315
Why do you still play that song?

10
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,920
It's discouraging.

11
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,491
You're always like that
to Kim Ae Sim's song.

12
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,104
Enjoy.

13
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,808
Admit it. You're jealous.

14
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,111
How dare you become jealous of Kim Ae Sim?

15
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,713
What?

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,350
You got the wrong person.
Who's jealous of whom?

17
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,619
Mom.

18
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,357
I told you to go straight
to the learning center.

19
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,626
Why are you here again?

20
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,794
Stop it.

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,264
She's here to see her mom. What else?

22
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,934
To show you this.

23
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,768
(Award)

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,811
Did you?

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,548
Good job.

26
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,220
Take this and go home.

27
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,888
This isn't a place for you.

28
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,191
Go on. Hurry.

29
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,593
Go. Watch out for cars.

30
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,597
You have a daughter like Ji Sook.

31
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,999
What else would you ask for?

32
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,801
I have nothing to be jealous of.

33
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,484
(Episode 9, Time)

34
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,621
If you can't stand her, too bad.

35
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,524
Why don't you also...

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,561
kick me out?

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,000
What did you just say?

38
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,237
Are you leaving the company...

39
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,707
No, you seriously want to split up with me
because of that wench?

40
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,375
Are you saying...

41
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,280
you're buying her not me?

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,816
She's not a wench.
She's my family to protect.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,521
Since when did you lack
a sense of responsibility?

44
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,122
How many times do I need to tell you?

45
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,724
She's fake.

46
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,060
She's here to bring us down.

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,829
I don't know what you heard,

48
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,164
but you crossed the line.

49
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,667
Don't act like this.

50
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,170
- What?
- We'll talk about it again tomorrow.

51
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,571
Let's go.

52
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,277
Jun Hyuk.

53
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,765
Chairwoman Kim...

54
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,935
No, your aunt looked upset.

55
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,404
Will you be okay?

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,173
You said it was a misunderstanding.

57
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,311
That's coming from me.

58
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,455
How do you trust me?

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,662
If you lie to me with those eyes...

60
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,966
Well, I can't help but fall for it.

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,269
How can you be joking?

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,971
I mean,

63
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,740
don't you want to know...

64
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,209
who I am even after hearing that?

65
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,778
If I do, are you going to tell me?

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,186
Don't worry.

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,323
I'll wait until you want to tell me.

68
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,561
So don't let that distract you,

69
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,464
and focus on what you need to do
as always.

70
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,137
What's wrong?

71
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,342
I'm just thankful.

72
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,032
Don't be touched so easily.

73
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,068
I haven't even started yet.

74
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,096
Hello?

75
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,366
Hey, soon-to-be universal star.
Can you make yourself available for me?

76
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,213
How many zeros are there?

77
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,781
What do you have...

78
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,517
to deserve this much money for a contract?

79
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,052
According to the boss,

80
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,088
I'm getting more and more fans every day.

81
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,125
That's nice.

82
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,997
Something wrong?

83
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,100
I think Kim Ae Sim recognized me.

84
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,035
What?

85
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,337
But how?

86
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,741
She didn't realize that I'd become young.

87
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,910
I'll have to keep my eye on her.

88
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,281
That's actually great.

89
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,918
From the aunt to her nephew,
I didn't like any of them.

90
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,253
Take this chance to leave them.

91
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,688
I'll help you produce an album.

92
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,189
Don't be stupid.

93
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,991
You think money is all it takes
to be a singer?

94
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,261
These days, it's all about the system.

95
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,896
Show-off.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,503
How are you going to survive
in Kim Ae Sim's company?

97
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,506
You'll have a hard time again.

98
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,041
It's okay. He said he'd take care of me.

99
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,476
Who's he?

100
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,480
The CEO? Did he say he'd take care of you?

101
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,718
No, the contract.
The contract will take care of me.

102
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,720
You can never rely on the contract.

103
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,121
It's all good stuff in front,

104
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,690
but all unfavorable stuff in the back.

105
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,960
Anyway, you can't trust anyone but me.

106
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,266
I'm not going to lose what's mine anymore.

107
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,339
No matter how much
Kim Ae Sim gets in my way,

108
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,542
that'll only make me practice harder.

109
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,382
Nice attitude.

110
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,555
Sure. Do everything you want, Ms. O.

111
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,591
But promise me you won't get hurt.

112
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,896
I don't want to see you heartbroken
or in sorrow anymore.

113
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,983
He is definitely hiding something.

114
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,402
No, right?
You only found out recently, right?

115
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:04,805
Yes.

116
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,643
You wouldn't hide something like that
from your husband, right?

117
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,120
(Your Highness)

118
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,591
I'm going to be late. Don't wait for me.

119
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,777
What's gotten into you?
Why are you up so early?

120
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,146
What's gotten into your face?

121
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,752
You look ten years older lately.

122
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,387
Something bothering you?

123
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,424
I had rough days lately.

124
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,227
Still, ten years is too much.

125
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,597
Let's go on a date.

126
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,332
I'll meet you at work later.

127
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,445
What?

128
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,913
You were home late last night.

129
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,115
What kind of work exploits
its executive like that?

130
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,852
- Not all executives are the same.
- Wait.

131
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,557
Ordinary hair.

132
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,228
Neat achromatic suit.

133
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,597
Well, it's not bad.

134
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,703
What are you...

135
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,304
Just wait.

136
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,040
You need a highlight.

137
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:55,482
Yes.
This is the authentic executive outfit.

138
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,486
I don't like wearing anything on my neck.

139
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,122
When you feel down,
you should give it a change.

140
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,326
Like trying a new style,
makeup, or high heels.

141
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,863
Sometimes that gives you
groundless confidence.

142
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,468
Sorry for keeping you.
Anyway, have a good day.

143
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,702
Ha Na, come and eat.

144
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,237
I'm on my way.

145
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,638
Hi, sweetie.

146
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,573
Good morning.

147
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,374
Here you are.

148
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,210
Thank you.

149
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,878
- Hot.
- It's hot.

150
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,615
Aren't you staying for breakfast?

151
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,650
I don't feel like it.

152
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,153
But I cooked for you.
Have a bite at least before you go.

153
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,488
No, thank you. Bye.

154
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,627
She's been busy lately.

155
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,931
It's not like she's the only one
who makes money in the world.

156
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,101
She needs to eat well,
especially when she's busy.

157
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,239
She never listens to her mom.

158
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,999
Excuse me.

159
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,400
Do you recognize me?

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,736
We're staying here all night long.

161
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,705
- Do you want to join us?
- Join us.

162
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,974
("The Man in the Yellow Shirt")

163
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,045
I have a piano at home.

164
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,915
I'll play this and record it on a tape.

165
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,551
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:15,189
<i>The man in the yellow shirt</i>

167
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,827
<i>That quiet man</i>

168
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,903
It's creepy no matter
how much I think about it.

169
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,840
How can she do such a thing
with that innocent face?

170
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,075
Don't judge a book by its cover.

171
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,476
I told you repeatedly.

172
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,349
There they go again.

173
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,822
How's your YouTube preparation going?

174
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,557
Not yet.

175
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,894
What do you mean not yet?
We memorized the debut song already.

176
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,598
Do your job, outsiders.

177
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,766
What? Outsiders?

178
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,904
You need to keep up
since people recognize you...

179
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,306
for us insiders to cheer up.

180
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,109
Do your best.

181
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,919
They're telling us to raise awareness...

182
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,288
while they reinforce the debut song.

183
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,757
They're emphasizing that we're a team.

184
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,697
Those girls.
I was afraid of them getting jealous.

185
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,232
That's unexpected.

186
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,334
Don't judge a book by its cover.

187
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,504
Emily.

188
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,507
Chairwoman Kim wants to see you.

189
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,988
I've thought about it,

190
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,791
and I was mean to you.

191
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,462
I was flustered,
and all kinds of thoughts occurred to me.

192
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,366
Anyway, you must've been startled.

193
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,404
This is more startling.

194
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,274
Now it makes sense...

195
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,312
why I was surprised to see you at first.

196
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,251
You resemble her so much.

197
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,956
Just as how I remember your grandma.

198
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,864
Well, I get that a lot.

199
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,767
I heard she had a granddaughter,

200
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,403
but I never expected that to be you.

201
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,351
Did you background check me?

202
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,521
I'll be honest with you.

203
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,759
Your grandma and I had
a misunderstanding in the past.

204
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,264
And it's my fault...

205
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,598
that I haven't resolved it yet.

206
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,600
A misunderstanding?

207
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,369
I know the shirt is nearer than the coat,

208
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,971
but you've only heard
your grandma's stance.

209
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,873
No wonder you didn't like me.

210
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,710
But don't let your grandma's past...

211
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,748
tie you down.

212
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,984
Let's...

213
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,121
reconcile.

214
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,095
I'm a human too.
When I think about what you did to me,

215
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,332
this isn't easy for me either.

216
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:50,804
So let's work it out together.

217
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,839
Okay?

218
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,950
Everything's back to its place.

219
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,353
Don't be so sad about a mere song.

220
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,487
Live your life.

221
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,489
And don't come back to me again.

222
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,299
I was always the one crying and sad.

223
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,538
You were always proud and peaceful
as if nothing ever happened.

224
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,515
Yes, Chairwoman Kim.

225
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:37,417
I'll let it go and do my best.

226
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,420
I know I've been making you
feel uncomfortable.

227
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,023
Thank you for reaching out to me first.

228
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,962
Thank you.

229
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,765
Bye now.

230
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,335
Bye.

231
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,263
You should've told me
where you were going.

232
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,633
Is that why you stopped me?

233
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,304
I came out early in the morning
to practice.

234
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,439
Why is everyone making me tired?

235
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,144
Thank you.

236
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,814
Did you meet Chairwoman Kim?

237
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,083
What did she say?

238
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,054
We talked over.

239
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,089
What else can I do?

240
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,825
Since I'm younger, I should give in.

241
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:56,163
Anyway, we resolved it. So you don't
need to worry about me anymore.

242
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,832
You're enough of a worrywart already.

243
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,572
It's sweet.

244
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,743
I knew one should have no enemy.

245
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,681
What do you want from me?

246
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,550
Right.

247
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,186
Well,

248
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:24,191
have you chosen the cover singer?

249
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:25,659
Right.

250
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,628
How about IGNIS?

251
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,831
I played it for you in the car.

252
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,233
Yes?

253
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,636
No.

254
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,671
It's not my style.

255
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,808
What's wrong with IGNIS?

256
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,478
You know I'm busy.
Yet I'll go out of my way to...

257
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:47,814
No need to
because I've already made up my mind.

258
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,851
That's ridiculous.

259
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,153
Who's it going to be then?

260
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,661
That little...

261
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,742
The broadcasting station sent us
the schedule.

262
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,544
We need to rush with the challenge clip.

263
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,012
Okay.

264
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,380
(Police Report Check)

265
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,119
I asked the detective I know.

266
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,490
You should've done this before.

267
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,328
I'm talking about Yoo Ji An.

268
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:36,897
If you just made up your mind,
you could've sent her to prison.

269
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,699
Then she would've never
approached you again.

270
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,568
At the time, I would've lost more...

271
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,604
than gained.

272
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:46,874
What do you mean?
You lost everything you had at the time.

273
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,880
You're not going to tell me the reason,
are you?

274
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:56,884
Anyway, I'm not going to
run away from it again.

275
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,653
Is it about Emily?

276
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,091
You were out of your mind yesterday.

277
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,727
You were worried about Emily. To me...

278
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:09,696
No, everyone noticed you were weird.

279
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,632
I see.

280
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,200
What?

281
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,470
I didn't realize it...

282
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:18,739
when everyone else did.

283
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:21,608
- Daniel.
- I don't know why or I can't explain it.

284
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,711
And I have no idea...

285
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,648
what I'm going to do.

286
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,120
I feel comfortable with her,

287
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,689
yet it's exciting.

288
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:38,959
She makes me laugh over nothing,

289
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,695
and time flies when I'm with her.

290
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,534
I can't stop thinking about her,
and I wonder what she might be doing.

291
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:52,606
I can't stop worrying about her.

292
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,787
You know love is an extravagant emotion
for people like us.

293
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,227
Like how I have maintained peace
for all these years next to you,

294
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,867
you must brace yourself too.

295
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,384
(Mr. Know-it-all)

296
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:38,919
(O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup)

297
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,922
Just as always,

298
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:45,659
I'm here to find
a truly delicious restaurant.

299
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:46,760
Let's find out.

300
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,328
That looks familiar.

301
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,965
This old rice soup place...

302
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,801
has been thriving
for a long time in secret.

303
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,671
This isn't a product placement
or sponsored...

304
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,673
or a franchise.

305
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,674
Then what is it?

306
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,576
The old lady's stubbornness.

307
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:05,812
She protected this place
with her cooking skills.

308
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,848
See that?

309
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,516
However,

310
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,451
ever since the old lady handed it over,

311
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,388
word has it that the soup doesn't taste
the same anymore.

312
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:15,656
So?

313
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,592
I decided to visit it myself.

314
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,426
And...

315
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:21,728
when I sneaked into the kitchen,

316
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:24,631
I spotted something very suspicious.

317
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,098
(Sneaked into the kitchen)

318
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:30,170
What? What's he talking about?

319
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,606
That's not what he promised.

320
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,609
Is he out of his mind?

321
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:38,378
What on earth did he spot in the kitchen?

322
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:39,780
We have...

323
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,049
nothing to hide.

324
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:43,984
Min Seok.

325
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:46,887
- Yes?
- Hurry.

326
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,956
- What is it?
- This is bad.

327
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:53,694
I'm only revealing this...

328
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,696
in the interest of the public.

329
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,464
(Undercover recording)

330
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,499
That's all soup.

331
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,736
- Move aside.
- Sure.

332
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,405
Let me see.

333
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,115
They're all sauces.

334
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:18,785
Wait.

335
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:26,727
Okay.

336
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,663
This is our secret.

337
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:32,099
Is that something that's passed down
to generations?

338
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,902
Yes, this is the secret
that costs millions of dollars.

339
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:39,006
Because the owner stopped me,
I missed the crucial evidence,

340
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:40,841
but that savory scent.

341
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,411
The reminiscent sweet scent...

342
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:46,647
- That darn...
- I gobbled without my parents knowing.

343
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,649
Seriously, those pricks.

344
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:52,152
They're about to bring down the restaurant
Mother dedicated her life to.

345
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,354
I knew they'd do this.

346
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,190
If you knew, you should've stopped them.

347
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,426
What have you been doing until
total strangers took over the restaurant?

348
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,230
You only listened to those brothers...

349
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,766
and ignored me.

350
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,402
When I went to your restaurant
to learn how to make the soup,

351
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:11,171
you have no idea
how mean those brothers treated me.

352
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:14,241
Every time I made the soup,
they turned off the fire and added water.

353
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,845
I only fell for it because I couldn't
catch the physical evidence.

354
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,714
Don't be proud of it.

355
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,851
Calm down, guys.

356
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:26,153
You can talk about
who's right and wrong later.

357
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:29,456
This darn Mr. Know-it-all...

358
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:30,824
gave those brothers a chance
to get rid of the evidence...

359
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,827
without any evidence.

360
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:35,963
What are you going to do now?

361
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:45,372
Right.

362
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,073
(Restaurant Contract)

363
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,742
I made a copy just in case.

364
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:53,881
If you go over the clauses...

365
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:00,687
(Contract Requirement,
Quality Maintenance)

366
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,489
(If any problem occurs regarding
the quality in less than a year,)

367
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:03,339
(the contract will be terminated)

368
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,525
(for violating
the quality maintenance issue.)

369
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,529
Contract Clause 13 Special Agreement.

370
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,632
Read it out loud.

371
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,035
Since school, I always liked to read...

372
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,170
Read it!

373
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,875
"Contract requirement."

374
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,578
"Quality maintenance."

375
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:28,348
"If any problem occurs regarding
the quality in less than a year,

376
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:31,084
the contract will be terminated...

377
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,589
for violating
the quality maintenance issue."

378
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:36,924
What does...

379
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:38,392
Terminate the contract?

380
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,296
If I was doing this for money, I would've
handed it over to someone else long ago.

381
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,599
If you disappoint the customers,

382
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,234
you're going to regret it.

383
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:49,503
Yes.

384
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,604
Bravo.

385
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,640
Ma'am. I'm so proud of you.

386
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,909
- I knew I could rely on you.
- Whatever.

387
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:59,246
So? How are you going
to secure the evidence?

388
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,666
You go first.

389
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,471
The unfavorable one reveals
her card first.

390
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:25,973
What are you saying?

391
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,645
Do you want to go at the same time?

392
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:43,290
Gosh, whose granddaughter is
that stubborn?

393
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:46,226
Let's go with the singer I have in mind.

394
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,930
You know
"The Man in the Yellow Shirt" went viral.

395
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,932
What? Have you forgotten already?

396
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:54,635
It was my idea to arrange
my grandma's favorite song.

397
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:58,305
Anyway, I'm never giving in.

398
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,007
Never.

399
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,811
Fine. Who is this great singer?

400
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:05,979
Tell me at least.

401
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,348
Well...

402
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,951
It's Taesaja.

403
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,192
(3 years ago)

404
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,437
Nice.

405
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,342
(Field Trip Request Form)

406
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,014
Thank you, Mom.

407
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:56,830
Taesaja?

408
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,532
(To Ji Sook, thank you for supporting us.)

409
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,342
Hurry up.

410
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,277
I'm going.

411
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,320
What's the point of setting an alarm
for every minute?

412
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,722
You can't get up anyway.

413
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,925
Did you listen to music until late again?

414
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,235
I'm going to sleep.

415
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:45,712
<i>I can see you</i>

416
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,416
<i>Now you feel like</i>

417
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:52,853
<i>A very old movie</i>

418
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:56,456
<i>But for you</i>

419
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:58,859
<i>I still have something in my heart</i>

420
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:03,330
It was my first time to see Mom singing.

421
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:09,002
No, my first time to see her ever humming.

422
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,439
Did she like them that much?

423
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,108
I agree.

424
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,316
I've never seen your mom like someone
that much.

425
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,651
But...

426
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,820
(27 years ago)

427
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,641
Mom.

428
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:52,145
I made rice soup all day long
to pay for your study.

429
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:55,315
And look at you wasting your time.

430
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:57,217
Don't you ruin this exam.

431
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:10,397
I made up my mind big time
to make a concession.

432
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:11,899
Don't forget my gratitude.

433
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,801
I knew you were generous.

434
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,303
I'll return your favor
with the amazing arrangement.

435
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:18,939
Get home safe.

436
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:21,208
Don't take anything from a stranger.

437
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,910
Okay, fine.

438
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:26,780
By the way,

439
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:31,251
the Teddy Bear. She wasn't after us.

440
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,319
What do you mean?

441
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:35,656
Do you remember?

442
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,225
The stalker who ruined
CEO Daniel's career as a singer?

443
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,594
That wicked leech?

444
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:41,428
Hush.

445
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:45,332
I overheard the instructors talking.

446
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,134
She's back.

447
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,336
That's why he moved.

448
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:51,705
They said...

449
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,775
it's a piece of cake
for her to unlock the door.

450
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:58,212
Right. She even put
a GPS camera on his car.

451
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,581
He couldn't even sleep in peace at home.

452
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,051
Maybe that's why he's all prickly?

453
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:10,791
(Emily 2)

454
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:19,533
You know love is an extravagant emotion
for people like us.

455
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,604
Like how I have maintained peace
for all these years next to you,

456
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,206
you must brace yourself too.

457
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,085
You told me to stay right next to you.

458
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,125
Hurry.

459
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,430
I'm afraid of taking public transit.

460
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,099
I only rode it as a kid.

461
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:55,169
You know what icky hyenas are
most scared of?

462
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,570
Bright crowded places.

463
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,007
If she feels so confident,
tell her to reveal herself...

464
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,842
and follow us.

465
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,046
It's here.

466
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,033
So much for being afraid.

467
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,470
You're sleeping in peace.

468
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:35,742
He couldn't even sleep in peace at home.

469
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,644
Maybe that's why he's all prickly?

470
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:11,271
(Closed)

471
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,181
Hey.

472
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,717
What were you thinking?

473
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,719
The meat price went up.

474
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,888
If we do as the granny says,
we won't make any money.

475
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,791
What now?

476
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,026
What are we going to do?

477
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,929
(O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup)

478
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:50,244
So? How are you going to
secure the evidence?

479
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,748
They'd get rid of the creamer first
and play safe.

480
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:01,655
Hey, Ja Yeong.

481
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,758
Life's treating you nicely lately, right?
Nothing bothering you?

482
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,862
Well, yes.

483
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:10,097
Yes.

484
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,533
That's because your life's going downhill.

485
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:13,433
Excuse me?

486
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:18,772
Would you like to change
your life with me?

487
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,755
Didn't you see the sign? We're closed.

488
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:59,179
I'm hungry, brother.

489
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:02,816
Give me food.

490
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,088
Please.

491
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:22,169
(Ms. O)

492
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:30,944
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave a message...

493
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,547
Why won't she answer her phone?

494
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,316
I wonder if she had dinner yet.

495
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,120
My bad.

496
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:44,024
You're soaked. I'm sorry.

497
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,025
It's okay.

498
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,694
What do you mean?

499
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:49,062
I really don't mind.

500
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,565
Stay still.

501
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,301
You're wet.

502
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:55,669
I'm okay.

503
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,571
- Stay still.
- Stop.

504
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,177
What are you doing?

505
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:08,849
Show some respect, young man.

506
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,853
Can't you see? I was only wiping
the water I spilled.

507
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:13,854
Exactly.

508
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:17,758
If you got her clothes dirty,
just pay for the laundry.

509
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,727
Why would you touch her body?

510
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,835
Because she reminds me of my daughter.
I felt bad for her.

511
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:29,736
What? Something wrong with that?

512
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:34,241
What the? What are you doing?

513
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:35,576
Your daughter?

514
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,012
I'm worried because
she reminds me of my son.

515
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:43,183
What kind of father looks at his daughter
like that?

516
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:44,151
What are you? A dog?

517
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,822
What? A dog?

518
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:49,957
You little...

519
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,658
Calling a dog a dog isn't a curse.

520
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:54,895
Say sorry.

521
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:01,568
My goodness.

522
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:06,273
Nice.

523
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,115
Are you okay?

524
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,852
Jerks like him aren't customers.

525
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,624
You're already having a hard time
working here.

526
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,093
Your parents would be upset to find out.

527
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,996
Thank you.

528
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:31,765
Thank you.

529
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:36,970
This is the first time to walk here.

530
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,707
I know. You had a long day today.

531
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:42,543
It's nothing.

532
00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:55,255
Give me the hat.

533
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:56,823
Right.

534
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:07,000
You depend on your hair a lot.

535
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,068
What? Do I look weird?

536
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,070
Yes.

537
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,972
It's a waste to see it alone.

538
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:18,645
Right. I already told Taesaja.

539
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,681
We're going to film it in our building.

540
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:23,283
That's not necessary.

541
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:24,918
I didn't do it for you.

542
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,522
Make sure to bring Ha Na's mother.

543
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,259
So she can see her favorite singers...

544
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,862
and how good her daughter is.
It's a great chance.

545
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:40,934
Bye. See you tomorrow.

546
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:42,369
But...

547
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,535
You scared me.

548
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,671
You looked close. Boyfriend?

549
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:22,609
Don't be ridiculous.

550
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:25,345
Why not? You looked great together.

551
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:28,649
Whether it's about dating
or becoming a singer,

552
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:31,985
you became young
to try everything you want.

553
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,191
Watch your mouth.

554
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:05,185
That's right.

555
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:08,322
Yes. This is who I am.

556
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:32,579
(O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup)

557
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,515
These uselessly meticulous pricks.

558
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:22,663
Wait.

559
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:25,432
(Vending machine coffee,
Vending machine creamer)

560
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,502
For vending machine coffee,
the ratio of coffee and creamer is 2 to 1.

561
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:29,469
But...

562
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,673
4kg of coffee and 10kg of creamer?

563
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:34,708
(Creamer)

564
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,610
(Where did 8kg go?)

565
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,479
I got you.

566
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:43,750
Bye.

567
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,152
- Bye.
- Bye.

568
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,454
Ji Sook, over here.

569
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,593
Why did you come all the way to my work?

570
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:54,161
I told you I'd come this morning.

571
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,130
Were you playing in the sewer?

572
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:12,646
The smell's gone now. I'm cold.

573
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,583
What was the rush?
You should've at least taken a shower.

574
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,051
It was urgent for me.

575
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:26,093
Do you want to go outside the city?
It's been a while.

576
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,794
I have something to tell you.

577
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:30,097
And...

578
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:33,000
That place we used to go to
when we were dating would be good.

579
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,304
So we can have a good time.

580
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,776
Do you really want to do that
with your mother-in-law's daughter?

581
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:45,679
Right. You shouldn't do that
with your mother-in-law's son.

582
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:46,680
Not.

583
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,916
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

584
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,484
We can't be like this already.

585
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:52,653
I've been tired lately.

586
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:54,054
Mom, Ha Na,

587
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:55,889
and work. I have so much on my plate.

588
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:59,259
I know. That's why I'm doing my best.

589
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:01,762
I'll get rid of the burden on you, soon.

590
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:06,133
That doesn't sound so helpful,
but whatever.

591
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,102
Do you have anything to say?

592
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,671
What?

593
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:14,041
Anything about your past
that you haven't told me yet...

594
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,443
or a secret you suddenly discovered.

595
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:17,311
Anything is fine.

596
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:22,416
Ji Sook.

597
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,354
There should be no secret between us.

598
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:30,023
What are you talking about?

599
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,331
Are you okay?

600
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:39,533
Gosh.

601
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:46,440
Let's just go home.

602
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:01,788
Find anything you can.

603
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:05,359
And chase her more meticulously than now.

604
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,929
If it weren't for the pictures
you sent me,

605
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,831
I almost fell for it.

606
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,966
Pictures? From me?

607
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,067
The place Daniel's living in...

608
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,171
and those two together.
You sent them to me.

609
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,921
Who are you?

610
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:41,261
You must've received my gift.

611
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:43,297
I'm glad.

612
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,671
It's you again?

613
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,709
That reminds me
of what a brilliant psycho...

614
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:57,711
you were.

615
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:02,149
Jun Hyuk had a hard time back then.

616
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,652
Do you think that was my fault?

617
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:11,391
He could've reported me for stalking
and pretended to be a victim.

618
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,360
Why do you think he didn't?

619
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,363
Cut to the chase.

620
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:20,167
What? Are you saying you don't know?

621
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:21,902
Really?

622
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:24,838
No way.

623
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,041
What a man you are, Han Jun Hyuk.

624
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:34,047
This is why I can't give up on him.

625
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,053
If you have nothing more to say, leave.

626
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:43,290
Before I call the guards.

627
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:45,859
Sit down, old lady.

628
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:50,998
What?

629
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,402
I broke him, but I couldn't move him.

630
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,804
But Emily seems different.

631
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:03,977
I didn't want to go this far,

632
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:08,348
but when I saw him going crazy about her,
it drove me crazy.

633
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:11,919
I want to get rid of her.

634
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,654
Away from Jun Hyuk.

635
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,422
As far as possible.

636
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:35,709
Look at them.

637
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,549
<i>I'm watching you leaving me</i>

638
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,752
<i>But it doesn't break my heart</i>

639
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:46,753
Whose song is that?

640
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,255
Your debut song?

641
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:52,326
It's Taesaja.

642
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,065
Right. Aren't you a fan of Taesaja?

643
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:01,401
You told me before.

644
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:03,337
I did?

645
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,077
You're right. I did.

646
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:12,646
She was a big fan of Taesaja.

647
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,916
I was a fan of them.

648
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,751
Then I stopped being a fan
because of someone.

649
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,788
At the time, I was treated like a criminal
if I liked any celebrities.

650
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,268
So you fell for me, who looked like...

651
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,910
It was meant to be filmed
at the broadcasting station,

652
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,646
but my boss invited them
to our agency on purpose.

653
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:48,849
It's a great chance to see
your favorite singers. Why do you say no?

654
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:51,418
I'm no longer that young high school girl.

655
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,320
I need to act like my age.

656
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,289
Anyway, thank you for your offer.

657
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:56,990
Don't you want to see your daughter?

658
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:01,728

659
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:04,831

662
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,658
When did you prepare all this?

663
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,460
It's way better than I expected.

664
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,394
Really?

665
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,330
I'm glad to hear that.

666
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,968
Then let me try that part again.

667
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:41,869
Okay.

00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,212

671
00:51:53,514 --> 00:51:55,415
Yes, Ms. Choi.

672
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,519
You're working so hard.

673
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,620
I'm impressed.

674
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:04,057
If my mom gets to see it,
at least in the future,

675
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,261
she might approve me of a little.

676
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:09,763
It's my small wish.

00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:57,925
<i>I'd become speechless</i>

727
00:55:57,925 --> 00:56:00,227
<i>I like it as it is to miss you</i>

728
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:03,297
- <i>I like it as it is</i>
- <i>One, two, three, hit it</i>

729
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:06,834
<i>With a tiny look</i>

730
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,937
<i>I'm getting over you</i>

731
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:12,940
<i>As I watch myself</i>

732
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,443
<i>But that doesn't mean I can see you</i>

733
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,915
<i>Now you feel like a very old movie</i>

734
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,183
- <i>But</i>
- <i>But</i>

735
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:24,384
- <i>For you</i>
- <i>For you</i>

736
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,787
<i>I still have something in my heart</i>

737
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:31,024
<i>To show you</i>

738
00:56:31,592 --> 00:56:33,961
<i>But now</i>

739
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:37,531
<i>I talked about you</i>

740
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:41,401
<i>To other people</i>

741
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,938
<i>I'm watching you leaving me</i>

742
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:48,642
<i>But it doesn't break my heart</i>

743
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:54,515
<i>One day you will come back to me</i>

744
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:58,185
<i>Or at least that's what I wanted
to believe</i>

745
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:03,991
<i>Because I still have</i>

746
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:07,561
<i>Feelings left for you</i>

747
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,930
<i>I hate to see myself like this</i>

748
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,833
<i>But what can I do I can't get over you</i>

749
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,768
<i>My friends are going to laugh at me</i>

750
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,171
<i>But that doesn't bother me</i>

751
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,405
- <i>But</i>
- <i>But</i>

752
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:19,606
- <i>For you</i>
- <i>For you</i>

753
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:21,909
<i>I still have something in my heart</i>

754
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:26,313
<i>To show you</i>

755
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,149
<i>But now</i>

756
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:32,719
<i>I talked about you</i>

757
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,523
<i>To other people</i>

758
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:40,127
<i>I'm watching you leaving me</i>

759
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:43,797
<i>But it doesn't break my heart</i>

760
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:49,770
<i>One day you will come back to me</i>

761
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:53,440
<i>Or at least that's what I wanted
to believe</i>

762
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,112
<i>Because I still have</i>

763
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:02,850
<i>Feelings left for you</i>

764
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,653
- <i>I'm watching you leaving me</i>
- <i>You're leaving me</i>

765
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,290
<i>But it doesn't break my heart</i>

766
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,526
<i>One day you will</i>

767
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:16,129
- <i>Come back to me</i>
- <i>Come back to me</i>

768
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:19,766
<i>Or at least that's what I wanted
to believe</i>

769
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:25,572
<i>Because I still have</i>

770
00:58:25,572 --> 00:58:29,710
- <i>Feelings left for you</i>
- <i>Left for you</i>

771
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,084
Good job.

772
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,258
Good job.

773
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,325
Good job. That was great.

774
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:48,362
- Good job.
- Good job.

775
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:50,998
I loved it.

776
00:58:50,998 --> 00:58:52,966
It was awesome, right?

777
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:54,601
Mom.

778
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:00,607
The SAT repeater academy.

779
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:06,880
I won't sign you up for it.

780
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,616
We can save money.

781
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:13,487
Mom.

782
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,033
Your singers are about to leave.

783
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,175
Excuse me.

784
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:36,376
Yes?

785
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:38,412
Can I get your autograph?

786
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:39,847
Sure.

787
00:59:46,954 --> 00:59:47,855
Your name?

788
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,724
Ji Sook.

789
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:56,964
(Ji Sook)

790
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:03,770
I can't believe
I get to be free at this hour.

791
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:05,806
It's so good to have you here.

792
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:10,010
You're not leaving without treating us,
are you?

793
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,845
I got the rest of the day off.

794
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:13,914
What do you want to eat?
Just say it. It's on me.

795
01:00:14,548 --> 01:00:15,883
Is that really you, Mom?

796
01:00:15,883 --> 01:00:17,484
This feels surreal.

797
01:00:17,484 --> 01:00:18,385
You're silly.

798
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:22,623
It's Dad. Tell him to join us.

799
01:00:25,492 --> 01:00:26,527
Hello?

800
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:28,829
Ji Sook.

801
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:31,665
Don't be surprised.

802
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:35,602
What?

803
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,065
(Who Is She!)

804
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:08,468
Poor Ji Sook.

805
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:12,806
I'm sorry, but you have to come with me.

806
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:15,042
I was finally about to do something
with Mom.

807
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,077
What a timing.

808
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,478
Who are you?

809
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,948
Because I was upset and furious,
I was reborn, you wench.

810
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,784
A scandal upon the debut?

811
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:24,952
Because I love her.

812
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:27,754
Are you saying that you're going
to get in your artist's way?

813
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:29,122
Let's run away.

814
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:32,359
A scandal would bring both of us down.

815
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:34,895
I'll wait for you.
If you feel the same way.
