I didn't tell you in case you'd complain.

39

But I can't handle this fuss anymore.

40
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,720
He's not a stalker or my boyfriend.

No, I'm just...

187
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,064
I heard using both hands helps
with dementia.

188
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,132
Dementia?

189
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,435
Do you really have dementia?

190
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,671
No, I'm...

191
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,772
Prevention in advance.

192
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,109
She's preventing it in advance.

193
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,446
Yes. That's it.

194
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,421
Du Ri, did you make all this?

195
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,658
When did you teach her how to cook?

196
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,728
No, I didn't. This is...

197
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:51,932
Well, should I say this is the taste
of Chungcheong-do?

198
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,267
Yes.

199
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,435
Yes. Right.

200
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,381
We're moving out.

201
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,125
What do you mean?

202
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,461
I thought about it a lot after you left.

203
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,299
It's best to keep a distance for everyone.

204
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:28,669
Ha Na is old enough now.

205
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,371
Fortunately, my company offers a loan.

206
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,940
Okay. That's it.

207
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,445
You mean you don't need
your old mother anymore?

208
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,880
No need to make it sound so fancy.

209
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:41,982
You made me spend...

210
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,619
my good old days to support you,

211
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,487
and now that I'm old, ill,

212
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,257
and handful,

213
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,593
you don't want to live with me?

214
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,868
I have nothing to do with this, Mother.

215
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,670
That is not my opinion.

216
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,806
Mom, you're not that old.

217
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,843
It's about time to live free
from your children.

218
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,012
Besides,

219
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,818
just because we live together,
it doesn't mean we're a family.

220
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,639
I should step out.

221
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,309
I'll let you talk.

222
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,028
Hey.

223
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,332
What? Are you enjoying this?

224
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,735
Or you think I deserve it?

225
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,606
If not, just pretend you didn't see it
and go on your way.

226
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,909
Your temper is still the same.

227
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,283
Don't just listen
to what your daughter says.

228
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,952
And look her in the eyes.

229
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,054
She has so much to say.

230
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,991
She has sorrow. Can't you see?

231
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,802
What's this?

In person?

237
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,788
You still don't need my help?

238
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,689
Then...

239
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,426
can I take off with that money?

240
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,663
Or should I give it to your children...

241
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,533
and beg them not to move out?

242
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,001
Are you crazy?

243
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,715
I never drink coffee on an empty stomach.

244
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,552
The doctor told me not to
because of my stomach issue.

245
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,621
Besides, you still haven't stopped
using your left hand?

246
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,557
Despite all that scolding from Dad?

247
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:40,494
If you're going to pretend to be me,
do it right.

248
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,629
If you're going to be her mom,
do it right.

249
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,601
Dos and don'ts.
Things to remember and watch.

250
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,803
I'll tell you only for ten minutes.
So listen carefully.

251
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:02,816
Don't you think that was selfish?

252
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,986
Besides, what was that attitude?

253
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,828
I agree with what Mother said
about exceeding her mother's love...

254
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,396
completely.

255
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:20,000
She must've been so frustrated to make her
son-in-law dig dirt on her own daughter.

256
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,071
What? What did you just say?

257
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,010
She wants to know what's on your mind.

258
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:33,180
Look who's talking.

259
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,982
Ever since I was young,
every time I asked her anything,

260
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,084
she told me, "Just focus on studying."

261
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:38,685
"It's none of your business."

262
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:40,487
"Don't get involved."

263
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:43,323
She kept everything to herself
and shut me out.

264
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:46,660
Do you know how jealous I was
to see my friends...

265
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,428
who could open up to their moms?

266
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,730
You know how to do it.

267
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,866
- What?
- Do what you just did.

268
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,235
Say you're sad, disappointed,
and you want to know.

269
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,337
Tell her that you want to stay close.

270
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,072
It's simple.

271
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,736
We're moving out.

272
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,105
Just because we live together,
it doesn't mean we're a family.

273
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,107
Don't just listen
to what your daughter says.

274
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,376
And look her in the eyes.

275
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:38,779
She has so much to say.

276
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:43,817
She has sorrow. Can't you see?

277
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,257
Are you not feeling well?

278
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:56,396
I guess I practiced too much.

("You" by Daniel, IGNIS)

280
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:25,325
Isn't this your voice?

281
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:29,229
My girl fans...

282
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:32,599
used to call this song
a tranquilizer or a sleeping pill.

283
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,936
You know how sweet my voice is.

284
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:39,106
What do you mean?

285
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,309
It wakes me up.

286
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,878
You have no good taste.

287
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,792
You said you were tired.

288
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,279
The faster, the better.

289
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,216
If we make self-produced content,

290
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,617
the broadcasting station agreed
to promote...

291
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,720
No, they're willing
to produce it together.

292
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,156
We need to style them
according to the theme...

293
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,725
and film as well. We don't have much time.

294
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,094
Speaking of which,

295
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:35,929
CEO Han?

296
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,633
Don't even think about it.
I'm not doing it.

297
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:43,904
What's more effective than Daniel Han?

298
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,140
Producer Daniel's day.

299
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,244
You'll get to show how humane you are.
It's nice.

300
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,445
That works.

301
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,847
IGNIS' hardcore fans will love it.

302
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,818
Yes, let's take this chance to change
your reputation for spiteful remarks.

303
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,286
It'll improve your impression.

304
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:02,923
You think people will like it...

305
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:05,692
if I adore my trainees
when I bombarded others' trainees?

306
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,529
Stop being so clingy.
I'm already over the hill.

307
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,931
Any other opinions?

308
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,588
He's flirting with me.

309
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:38,759
Sorry.

313
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:15,362
Soo Jin.

314
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,407
Soo Jin.

315
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,911
Don't just take the migraine pills.
You should go see a doctor.

316
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,453
Your body is icy cold.

317
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:43,991
What are you doing?

318
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,158
Stay still.

319
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,661
Even your ears are cold.

320
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,897
She's been practicing
since early in the morning.

321
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,231
Are you sure you're not pushing yourself
too hard?

322
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,703
That hurts.

323
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:03,277
Your stomach isn't functioning.
You have an indigestion.

324
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:05,112
- What?
- My daughter, no...

325
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,882
My sister often had an indigestion
because she had a weak stomach.

326
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,486
The migraine pills won't help.

327
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,987
Let's go see a doctor.

328
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:14,922
Whatever.

329
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,191
What a quack.

330
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,964
- Soo Jin!
- No!

331
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:26,233
Soo Jin, are you okay?

332
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,735
Can you get up?

333
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:31,305
- This is bad. Ha Na, put her on my back.
- Okay.

334
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,306
What's wrong?

335
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,641
Take her to the hospital. Now.

336
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,178
Stupid wench.

337
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,081
You have acute gastritis and dehydration.

338
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:44,885
You should've told me if you were sick.

339
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,220
Whatever.

340
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,790
Anyway, you have to rest for a while.

341
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,757
Okay?

342
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:51,925
Promise me.

343
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,394
I'm okay.

344
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:58,432
- I want to go practice.
- Hey.

345
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,901
What can you do in that condition?

346
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:03,670
Hi.

347
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,641
I'm okay. It's nothing serious.

348
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,909
It's a long-term battle.

349
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,011
You're supposed to maintain good condition
until you debut.

350
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:12,513
What if I don't get to debut...

351
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,781
for missing the practice?

352
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:19,486
No more evaluations until the debut.

353
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,054
Don't think about anything and just rest.

354
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:21,955
What?

355
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:25,225
This is white porridge for her first meal.

356
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:30,097
And this is pollack porridge
for her next meal.

357
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:34,401
And this is plum tea
to soothe her stomach.

358
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,773
Tell her to eat everything. Please.

359
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:41,808
We'll give her meals.

360
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,110
Who should I say it's from?

361
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:48,315
A friend. Just say it's from a friend.

362
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,216
A friend.

363
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:53,320
Tell her that it's from her friend Emily.

364
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,322
Emily.

365
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:56,757
Okay.

366
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,565
It's been a while since I had it.

367
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,834
A cup of warm plum tea.

368
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:21,048
<i>When I entered the cafe</i>

369
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,221
<i>My heart was already pounding</i>

370
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:31,892
It's a masterpiece.

371
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:36,296
What kind of life did you live...

372
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,732
to have that pitiful and tacky sentiment?

373
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:39,566
It's mysterious.

374
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,874
You have a mysterious talent too.

375
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:50,744
A talent to say every truth
and compliment awful.

376
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:51,712
It's mysterious.

377
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,588
You look feeble today.

378
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,957
Something happened?

379
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,663
Have you ever had a nightmare before?

380
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:11,732
Of course.

381
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,370
What if the nightmare
you have every day...

382
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,141
becomes real?

383
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,311
What would you do then?

384
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,186
I wouldn't miss my chance to nail it down.

385
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,488
If something that got on my nerves...

386
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:37,257
suddenly appears in front of me,
I couldn't be more thankful.

387
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:40,294
I'd make sure
it never gets anywhere near me again.

388
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,933
Nail it down,
so it won't come near me again.

389
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,371
It's relieving just to think about it.

390
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:55,409
What? Is the recording studio ghost
appearing in your nightmares?

391
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,848
You can hide behind me like the last time.

392
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,216
Stop talking about it.

393
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,287
Anyway, thanks for making me laugh.

394
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,756
If you're done, let's go.

395
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,058
Stop avoiding it.

396
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,394
If you keep avoiding it,
you'll end up falling.

397
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:19,333
You'll get hurt once...

398
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,736
either from avoiding it or fighting it.

399
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,572
Then you shouldn't have any regrets
at least.

400
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,278
Gosh.

401
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,814
You suddenly worry me.

402
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:39,486
This is why men who appeal
to my protective instinct are dangerous.

403
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:51,498
Hey.

404
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,004
Is it okay to call you bro?

405
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,041
What?

406
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,410
Sometimes...

407
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,481
I can learn from you.

408
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:13,587
It's a compliment.

409
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,278
What is wrong with me these days?

410
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,727
Are you okay?
Are you out of the hospital now?

411
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,162
Yes.

412
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,331
There's not much they can do.
I should rest at home.

413
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:58,899
I'm glad to hear that.

414
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,037
Hey.

415
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,240
Me?

416
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:08,475
I like your T-shirt.

417
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:10,444
What?

418
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:17,417
Thanks.

419
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:22,990
We decided not to practice
until you can practice again.

420
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,192
You're slacking off...

421
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,994
when I already have enough on my plate?

422
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:28,161
No,

423
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:32,099
it feels like cheating to practice
when you're sick.

424
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,700
No.

425
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,770
You should fill in my gap.

426
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,341
You said we're a team.

427
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,082
Right.

428
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:53,554
When you meet Emily,
ask her where she got the porridge from.

429
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:12,706
(Park's Guesthouse Reservation List)

430
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:29,790
What?

431
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,360
Some slim and good-looking man
put it in the mailbox just now.

432
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,261
What?

433
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,302
Dear my only son Ja Yeong.

434
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:44,404
This is my daddy's writing.

435
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:46,907
No fingerprint scanning is necessary.

436
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,576
I'm busy. I'm off.

437
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:51,111
Thank you.

438
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:55,082
Ja Yeong, it's your father.

439
00:36:55,649 --> 00:37:00,420
I heard you're doing well without me.

440
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,555
Daddy.

441
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:05,292
I know I've lived long enough,

442
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,862
but I am still touched
to see you getting mature...

443
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:10,797
before I die.

444
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,601
I met...

445
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:18,772
a good friend
who changed my life by chance.

446
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,807
So I am enjoying...

447
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,277
every moment...

448
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,245
without any worries.

449
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,514
I hope my absence...

450
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:31,518
gives you a chance to grow up.

451
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,855
You have my full trust.

452
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,724
I am always cheering for you.

453
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,567
"A good friend who changed his life?"

454
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:50,270
Is he saying he's having a good time
with his girlfriend?

455
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,110
Gosh!

456
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,514
I'm angry.

457
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,516
My head is open.

458
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,651
I'm enraged.

459
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:07,421
When I'm working my butt off?

460
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:09,189
Hello.

461
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:15,629
("You" by Daniel, IGNIS)

462
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,173
Isn't this your voice?

463
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:28,575
My girl fans...

464
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:32,045
used to call this song
a tranquilizer or a sleeping pill.

465
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:34,815
You know how sweet my voice is.

466
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,363
If you keep avoiding it,
you'll end up falling.

467
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:53,066
You'll get hurt once...

468
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,803
either from avoiding it or fighting it.

469
00:38:57,471 --> 00:38:59,640
Then you shouldn't have any regrets
at least.

470
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,809
That little...

471
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,049
I should hold back.

472
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:52,192
This is going to be fun.

473
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:03,003
What?

474
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,440
Hello?

475
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,011
That's so cold.

476
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,822
(Main hall)

477
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:34,935
What is wrong with this?

478
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:39,106
Spider!

479
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:55,522
(The hot water is unstable.
Please fix it.)

480
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:09,303
Excuse me.

481
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:12,439
Me?

482
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:22,916
O Du Ri.

483
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:27,487
What's going on?

484
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:29,423
What else?

485
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,226
People are finally falling for me.

486
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:35,929
What?

487
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:38,465
Hey.

488
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,702
Are you okay?

489
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,570
Thanks to you.

490
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,608
Well, that's not the point.

491
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,309
- What?
- Our...

492
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:52,513
new debut song is ready.

493
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,315
- Really?
- Really?

494
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,350
Is that true?

495
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,718
Everyone to the rehearsal studio.

496
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,987
- One second.
- Okay.

497
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,392
This is awesome.

498
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,227
It's our lucky day.

499
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,929
Ta-da. Aren't they cute?

500
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,063
We got a fan.

501
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,065
A fan?

502
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:13,433
Are you coming?

503
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:14,468
- Yes.
- Yes.

504
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,811
What's with the reaction?

505
00:43:01,114 --> 00:43:04,451
You can be honest with me.
Share your opinions.

506
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,921
Say something, will you?

507
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,590
There's nothing to change.

508
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:16,797
I like it.

509
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,667
It was worth taking the risk.

510
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,236
First of all, it's very catchy.

511
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,006
It'll match their voices better.

512
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,542
The theme is clear. It's easier
to come up with the choreography.

513
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:32,312
What do you think?

514
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:34,181
Honestly,

515
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,784
it's better than the last song.

516
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,921
I can memorize it already after one play.

517
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,356
It'll be crazy addictive.

518
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,561
Then let's begin practicing
as soon as the choreography is ready.

519
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,029
And one more thing.

520
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,232
Emily and Ha Na will be
appearing in a content.

521
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,035
It'll be streamed on YouTube
before your debut.

522
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,105
Only the two of them?

523
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:01,408
Because their faces have been revealed.

524
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,377
Let's take advantage of it
as much as we can,

525
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:05,546
and the rest of you will continue
to remain mysterious.

526
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:06,713
Let's go with two strategies.

527
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:08,682
What's the theme?

528
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:11,718
Since you're the retro deities,

529
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:14,087
a collaboration with legendary singers.

530
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:23,096
No. You can't catch me.
I avoided everything. I dare you.

531
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,001
What are you doing?

532
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:33,740
Clean the street before they're here
or something.

533
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,876
YouTubers don't care.

534
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:38,078
Do you know how hard it was to invite him?

535
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:39,112
Gosh.

536
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,618
By the way,

537
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:48,455
are you sure this is effective?

538
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:51,758
Bro.

539
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:54,862
Mal Soon's been thorough,

540
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:59,032
but broadcasting stations and YouTubers
are dying to film this place.

541
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,968
So it works for us.

542
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,538
I'm not sure about this.

543
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,642
They're here.

544
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,311
Hello.

545
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:52,619
Excuse me.

546
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:56,723
So? How is it?

547
00:45:56,723 --> 00:45:57,858
Do you like it?

548
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,928
Why wouldn't he?

549
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:04,431
We spent a fortune...

550
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,733
to learn how to make this soup
and boil the meat.

551
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:14,575
I knew it.

552
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,744
It's very unique and shocking.

553
00:46:18,712 --> 00:46:20,948
It's good enough to be on my show.

554
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,359
Is it okay...

555
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:35,395
to check your kitchen?

556
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:39,600
No. I didn't have a chance
to clean it. It's embarrassing.

557
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,602
It's messy.

558
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,680
Bukbu University Hospital ICU
on the fifth floor.

559
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,182
I'll visit you after work.

560
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:57,117
She should be here by now.

561
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:31,151
You're here.

562
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:38,926
How's his condition?

563
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,143
We stopped the treatment.

564
00:47:58,278 --> 00:47:59,179
What?

565
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:03,584
They said there's nothing they can do.

566
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,986
They told me to look for a hospice.

567
00:48:07,788 --> 00:48:10,958
Your father.
He doesn't have much time left.

568
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,832
How can they say that?

569
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:20,133
Last time,

570
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:22,302
they said they'll begin the chemo
once he recovers.

571
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,204
But he couldn't recover.

572
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:28,742
Now that this happened, go tell your mom.

573
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:32,145
She kept him a secret for over 40 years.

574
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:33,714
What more is there to hide?

575
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,451
How can she be so spiteful?

576
00:48:51,698 --> 00:48:53,100
You don't look well,

577
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:55,602
and your muscles are stiff.

578
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,971
You must've been tired.

579
00:48:58,705 --> 00:48:59,673
You think so?

580
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:03,210
I have a lot on my plate.

581
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:04,878
(Manager Park)

582
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:09,449
You got a call.

583
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,056
Yes, Manager Park?

584
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:20,527
The girl O Du Ri.
I can't find anything about her.

585
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:21,728
It's like she's a ghost.

586
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:24,031
What?

587
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:28,836
The broadcasting station went nuts
after seeing the preliminary round.

588
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:31,271
Producer Park urged me...

589
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,774
to sign the contract before it's too late.

590
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:39,847
Anyway, this isn't permanent.
I'll be helping you just for a while.

591
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:42,616
Feel free to sign it.

592
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:44,117
- Wait.
- What?

593
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,319
Article 2 Clause 5.

594
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,989
Manage income from show business
and all the matters.

595
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,926
I run a small accommodation business
for a side job.

596
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,662
Are you going to comment
on the income from that too?

597
00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:58,999
No. Never.

598
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,334
Only from the show business.

599
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,103
And only for six months as you said.

600
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:05,606
It's all written here.

601
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,276
Here.

602
00:50:10,611 --> 00:50:11,445
Wait.

603
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:18,151
You don't stop people
from going on dates, do you?

604
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:22,022
Nothing's more fatal than a scandal...

605
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,492
to a rookie.

606
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:31,398
Keep your love life quiet...

607
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:34,301
and secret.

608
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:39,006
Okay.

609
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:40,641
Okay.

610
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:43,210
Here.

611
00:50:43,644 --> 00:50:44,645
Okay.

612
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:53,020
(Park Jun)

613
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:57,958
I'll return the favor with my best.

614
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:04,798
(My own profile)

615
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:06,633
(Name Emily, 21, nickname Damily)

616
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:09,703
(Being simple is my advantage
as well as a weakness.)

617
00:51:09,703 --> 00:51:11,772
Silly girl.

618
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:15,742
CEO Han.

619
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:19,346
This is bad.

620
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,117
What? A candid camera?

621
00:51:30,657 --> 00:51:31,725
Where did you get this doll from?

622
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:36,530
I ran into a girl in front of the dorm.

623
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,465
She said she was a fan
of the Strange Sisters.

624
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,970
I didn't take it seriously.

625
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,039
I noticed the eye was shiny.

626
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,509
I thought it was strange.

627
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:51,478
Don't you think
it's too early to get a stalker?

628
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:56,842
Report it to the police...

629
00:51:56,843 --> 00:51:58,886
and check all the surveillance cameras
near the dorm.

630
00:51:58,886 --> 00:51:59,820
My goodness.

631
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:02,890
There are surveillance cameras everywhere
except for that spot.

632
00:52:03,991 --> 00:52:05,692
This is premeditated.

633
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,295
Let's do our best to find her.

634
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:13,767
Can I go now?

635
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:14,801
Emily!

636
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:20,107
You're staying with me
everywhere you go for now.

637
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:26,146
She might have done it out of curiosity.

638
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,481
Just do as I say.

639
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:30,751
- Aren't you going to the police station?
- What?

640
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:33,487
No. I'll go myself.

641
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,490
Tell the security
and make sure to block all strangers.

642
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,992
Increase the guards to secure the dorm.

643
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:39,927
Okay.

644
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:42,162
What are you doing?

645
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:47,568
Okay.

646
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,842
No need to be so shocked.
Make sure to take the relaxing pill.

647
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:07,287
Now that this happened, go tell your mom.

648
00:53:07,988 --> 00:53:10,457
She kept him a secret for over 40 years.

649
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:12,092
What more is there to hide?

650
00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:16,163
How can she be so spiteful?

651
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,707
(Mother's new phone)

652
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,618
Sorry for making you wait.

653
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:43,524
The meeting went well. It was a hit.

654
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,626
Well done. I'll start the car.

655
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,095
One second.

656
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:49,963
(Transfer)

657
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,309
(Deposit 10,000 dollars
from V Plus Media Group)

658
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:08,882
What's this for?

659
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:10,184
I took your advice...

660
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:13,353
and inspected abnormal budgets.

661
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:15,355
It turns out to be
the accounting team manager.

662
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:17,057
I saved over six figures...

663
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:19,459
just by replacing him
and adjusting everything.

664
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,161
Please accept it.

665
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:26,099
It was a mere piece of advice.
This isn't right.

666
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,901
I can't take this money.

667
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:29,203
You're the only person
who has knowledge of this...

668
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:32,973
and give me earnest advice.

669
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,108
But still...

670
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:38,612
I'm so tired. Min Seok, I had a long day.

671
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:39,980
Let's go.

672
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,691
The girl O Du Ri.
I can't find anything about her.

673
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:52,759
It's like she's a ghost.

674
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,272
(No name)

675
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:17,818
What? Do they even commute together
from the same neighborhood now?

676
00:55:27,294 --> 00:55:30,831
(O Mal Soon)

677
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:45,846
O Mal Soon?

678
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,289
Is your name Emily?

679
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:58,358
Does that make you happy?

680
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,259
What?

681
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:18,278
(Banwol Police Station)

682
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,090
Don't worry. It won't be a big deal.

683
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:35,562
You turned all pale and freaked out.

684
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,264
Bothering the police over nothing.

685
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,901
Were you always that coward?

686
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,303
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

687
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:45,372
You know...

688
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,408
I'm obsessed with stalkers.

689
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:56,350
She ruined a fine man.

690
00:56:57,484 --> 00:57:00,787
Just wait until I catch her.

691
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:04,591
I'll pull her hair out.

692
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:07,294
Are you protecting me?

693
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,063
I feel reliable.

694
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:30,484
You acted like something serious happened.
Why didn't you answer my phone?

695
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:34,288
I'm sorry.

696
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:38,659
Look. I found something interesting today.

697
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,561
- Who should go first?
- Mother.

698
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:46,934
Can I talk to my wife first?

699
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:54,141
Okay. Sure.

700
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:55,876
Thank you.

701
00:58:08,722 --> 00:58:10,757
- Your homework.
- Okay.

702
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:16,129
Right. Give me one of those.

703
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:17,264
What?

704
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:20,067
You know the medicine you carry.

705
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:20,968
Sure.

706
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,738
You're quite a handful.

707
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:28,075
- Thank you.
- Make sure to chew it.

708
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:41,522
This is good.

709
00:58:43,223 --> 00:58:44,424
You're all here.

710
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:46,159
Chairwoman Kim.

711
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:48,929
What brings you here?

712
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,631
You got on my nerves from the start.

713
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:53,400
You were ominous and unpleasant.

714
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:56,703
Did you have fun making a fool of us?

715
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:59,473
- What are you talking about?
- Too bad.

716
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:02,142
I can come up with hundreds of reasons...

717
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,946
to kick you out.

718
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:10,584
Tell me at least.

719
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,689
Let me make it short.

720
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,127
Get out of my company.

721
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,030
You can't do that.

722
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,398
How can you tell her to leave?

723
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:26,867
I'm disappointed in you.

724
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,870
You trained someone so wicked like her
as your trainee?

725
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,308
Her name and identity are all fake.

726
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:38,145
She's here to bring you and me down.

727
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:44,117
Elements will do just fine without her.

728
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,386
So end it here.

729
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:51,225
I'll see you later.

730
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:52,926
No.

731
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,004
I don't know what's going on,
but from what I know,

732
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:07,174
she's not someone
to plan on bringing people down.

733
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,143
What?

734
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,980
Come to your senses.

735
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,516
If you can't stand her, too bad.

736
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:18,352
Why don't you also...

737
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:21,054
kick me out?

738
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:57,424
(Who Is She!)

739
01:00:57,424 --> 01:01:00,160
You seriously want to split up
because of that wench?

740
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,929
Whether it's love or singing,

741
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,498
didn't you become young
to try everything you'd missed?

742
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,768
The restaurant my mother worked hard on
is about to shut down.

743
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:09,703
How are you going to find evidence?

744
01:01:09,703 --> 01:01:11,705
I want to get rid of her.

745
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:14,508
Away from Jun Hyuk. As far as possible.

746
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:15,809
Find anything you can.

747
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:18,812
And chase her more meticulously than now.

748
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,214
Now it makes sense...

749
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:23,884
why I was surprised to see you at first.

750
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,652
I didn't realize that was you.
