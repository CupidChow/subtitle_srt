1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,739
(This drama series is fictional,
and the places, persons, organizations,)

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,307
(settings, and events depicted
have been fictionally created.)

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,779
Composer Gil Ok Yun wrote it
for his daughter Jung A.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,648
Then it was sung by his wife Patti Kim.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:18,185
The song "1990" was requested.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,388
Although the couple was divorced
in the end,

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,125
their love for their daughter is
well reflected in the song.

8
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,028
It is tonight's last song.

9
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:31,070
This is Young Ok.

10
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,584
Enjoy.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,655
More side dishes, please.

12
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,123
Yes.

13
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,059
Thank you.

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,376
(Meet me at the bakery
at the intersection at 7 p.m.)

15
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,318
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,995
- So cute.
- Ready.

17
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,931
One, two, three.

18
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:07,127
(Episode 10, 1990)

19
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,631
What?

20
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,368
How did you know?

21
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,171
Okay. I'll be right there.

22
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,009
What's wrong?

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,044
Why are you startled?

24
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,215
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

25
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,850
You two go ahead without me.

26
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,717
What?

27
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,628
You two were amazing today.

28
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,532
I'm relieved to see you together.

29
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,303
Thank you for everything.

30
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,105
What's going on?

31
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,675
I'll tell you later.

32
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,109
Bye.

33
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,985
- Wait here.
- What?

34
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,593
- Hello?
- It's me.

35
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,797
Make a call to Min Seok. Right now.

36
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,166
What?

37
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,468
(Late Ban Seong Moon)

38
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,470
(Spouse Ha Yoon Seol, Daughter Ban Ji Woo)

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,839
What? Is that it?

40
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,715
Mom.

41
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,694
My daughter is only in Grade 12.

42
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,533
She realized she was born out of wedlock
at a sensitive age.

43
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,202
Ma'am. No. Ms. O.

44
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,771
I'm begging you.

45
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,973
Please set him free.

46
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:05,812
I thought you were just pretty,
but you were also shameless.

47
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,815
You stole a father from my daughter.

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,985
What's the big deal about not seeing
a father on the family registration paper?

49
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,222
My husband is...

50
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,158
dead to your daughter anyway.

51
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,232
And whose fault is that?

52
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,803
She's making a fuss every day
to see her dad.

53
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,004
What am I supposed to tell her?

54
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,309
That he started a new life
with a young wench and had another child?

55
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,177
Because he was so busy spoiling her,

56
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,548
even when his own daughter was
on the verge of dying...

57
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,952
or even when I begged him to come
to her school entrance ceremony,

58
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,754
he said it was none of his business.

59
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,958
That son of a gun...

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,026
is who her father is.
How can I tell her that?

61
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,664
If he's dead, she'd miss him at least.

62
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,567
I can never see her suffering in pain...

63
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,871
for being abandoned.

64
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,841
Ji Sook.

65
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,443
Where is it?

66
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,512
- Ji Sook.
- Yes.

67
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,481
How can this be?

68
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,618
You said he was fine just a few days ago.

69
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,053
Who are you?

70
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,826
What's wrong with you?
I told you I called Ji Sook.

71
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,693
Ms. Ban.

72
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,196
You can't do this to me.

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,331
You know...

74
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,801
what my daughter and I went through...

75
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,070
because of them.

76
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,741
Don't be like this.

77
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,810
Ji Woo received so much love
and support...

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,779
from her father.

79
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,181
But she's...

80
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,958
We can talk later.

81
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,060
Let me show my respect to my father.

82
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,862
I don't get it.

83
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,366
He was dead to you all these years.

84
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,971
For what reason
did you come to his funeral?

85
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,506
Yoon Seol.

86
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,142
If you're here for his inheritance,

87
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,545
leave now before you're disappointed.

88
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,913
Are you done talking?

89
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,688
Du Ri.

90
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,796
Who are you?

91
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,507
Who the heck are you?

92
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,544
I'd be the only one who never
pulled out her husband's affair's hair...

93
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,945
or slapped her in the face.

94
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,782
You must slap her in the face...

95
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,052
for me.

96
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,057
Says Ms. O Mal Soon.

97
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,395
What? Affair?

98
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,432
What are you doing?

99
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,935
Go see your dad.

100
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:20,908
Let's go.

101
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,592
Say anything stupid to Ji Sook.

102
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,426
Then...

103
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,863
it won't be over with a slap.

104
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,366
You...

105
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:48,936
Who are you?

106
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,704
Who else?

107
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,111
Because I was upset and furious,
I was reborn, you wench.

108
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,614
Mom.

109
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,684
We have to decide on something.

110
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,727
(Spouse Ha Yoon Seol, Daughter Ban Ji Woo)

111
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,141
Ji Sook, are you sure about leaving?

112
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,012
I showed my respect.
What more do I have left?

113
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,081
Ji Sook...

114
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,430
What's going on?

115
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,200
Was Ji Sook's dad alive until now?

116
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,870
Let me ask you a favor.

117
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,244
You're not guilty of anything.

118
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,480
When you think about it,

119
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,384
you did it for Ji Sook.

120
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,319
No.

121
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,490
I was too selfish.

122
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,324
No.

123
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,360
You always put others before yourself.
That's your problem.

124
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,931
You were always like that
even when you were a kid.

125
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,034
You seriously need to stop doing that.

126
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,969
Don't look at anything.

127
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,471
Don't think about anyone.

128
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,242
Just do as your heart says.

129
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,044
Especially...

130
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,413
for your last decision.

131
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,416
My last choice?

132
00:09:58,866 --> 00:09:59,900
Mother.

133
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,435
Are you okay?

134
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,242
You must've been shocked.

135
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,476
I'll tell you everything.

136
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:10,844
No.

137
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,248
Later.

138
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,086
She's kind of drunk.

139
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,692
Why are you so serious
about other people's business?

140
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,296
Don't do that again or you'll be hurt.

141
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,835
What are you doing? It's cold.

142
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,015
Ji Sook's dad is dead.

143
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,017
And...

144
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,221
it seems Ji Sook...

145
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,123
knew all along.

146
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,697
My poor Ji Sook.

147
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,570
My poor little girl.

148
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,541
My Ji Sook.

149
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,503
The person you have reached is
not available...

150
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,478
(Detective Park)

151
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,315
Yes, Detective Park.

152
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,408
Pour me a glass.

153
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,021
What are you doing?

154
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,791
I can't stay sober.

155
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,993
You know you've been acting weird?

156
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:17,197
It's none of your business.
Why do you care?

157
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,098
Your mother.

158
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,336
She fell asleep from crying until now.

159
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,440
She felt so bad for you.

160
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,543
She said she was too foolish.

161
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,914
It's none of your business.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

162
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,015
For once...

163
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:41,255
Can you listen to your mother's story?

164
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,096
Still, she should've told me.

165
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,198
Whether I hate him or blame him,

166
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,699
it's up to me.

167
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,268
Still,

168
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,472
she wanted to stop it
as much as she could.

169
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,375
She wanted to end...

170
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,379
any tough and dirty matters with her.

171
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,313
No.

172
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,715
She should've left me to hate him.

173
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,986
She made me miss him for my life.

174
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,692
She made me turn that hatred...

175
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,162
toward her.

176
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,001
Do I hate Mom?

177
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,904
Of course, I do.

178
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:34,641
But...

179
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,212
I pity her at the same time.

180
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:44,117
She endured everything all alone.

181
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,325
The more I think about it,

182
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,464
her life is so sad.

183
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,173
Sorry.

184
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,543
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,249
I'm...

186
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,419
uneducated and ignorant for a reason.

187
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,290
I should've known better.

188
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,596
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:32,900
About everything.

190
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,702
I didn't...

191
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,007
get to hear anything from Dad.

192
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,345
That he was sorry...

193
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,681
or that he missed me.

194
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,653
I wanted to hear either one from him.

195
00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:00,160
But since the day we first met,
he only blinked.

196
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,464
And his eyes were so sad.

197
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,504
They didn't let me ask him or yell at him.

198
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,210
And he didn't have much time left.

199
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:23,317
What could I possibly ask the dying man?

200
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,887
All those days I've spent...

201
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:31,024
without knowing him is a shame.

202
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,095
And the more I think about it,
the more I hate you.

203
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,801
It must've been painful
with all that hate in your heart.

204
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,405
You should've just said it.

205
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,008
You should've just got upset.

206
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,845
I wanted to give you a chance.

207
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,283
But you pretended not to know anything
to the end.

208
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:02,322
You looked so spiteful and heartless.

209
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,225
But then,

210
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,996
I would've done the same.

211
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,801
I wouldn't have been able to say it
to Ha Na.

212
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,339
It's not that he can't come,
but he wouldn't come.

213
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,077
No matter how much you miss him...

214
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,814
or long for him, he'd never find you.

215
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,954
Even if you miss him,
he'd only break your heart.

216
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,356
No.

217
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,595
Although our relationship
didn't last long, your father...

218
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,899
loved you and cared about you so much.

219
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:52,639
He gave up on you
because he knew what I was like.

220
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,844
I'm sure he missed you...

221
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,348
and wanted to see you for his whole life.

222
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,418
That's a lie.

223
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,722
If he did, he would've come to see me.

224
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:12,159
Instead of looking for me as if it was
some unfinished homework before dying.

225
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,535
Whether you're nice or not...

226
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,604
Whether I like you or not...

227
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,907
My only parent is...

228
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,546
you, Mom.

229
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,773
Ha Na, that wench.
She never listens to me.

230
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,341
I wasn't like that at all.

231
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,177
No.

232
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,546
You were exactly the same.

233
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,715
What are you talking about?

234
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,818
Everyone said
I was an easy child to raise.

235
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,489
Hey, what's the point
of looking quiet on the outside?

236
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,925
You were stubborn as a bull.

237
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,761
Whether it was clothes or shoes,

238
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,930
if you didn't like it,

239
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,998
you wouldn't budge.

240
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,067
Whether it was a teacher or anyone,

241
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,637
if you thought they were wrong,
you never yielded.

242
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,772
I even...

243
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:35,008
had to beg them on my knees
because of you.

244
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,245
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

245
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,115
And you were full of curiosity.

246
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,551
You almost set our room on rent on fire...

247
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,255
over a science experiment.

248
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:52,292
Then one time, after you watched
the apocalypse movie,

249
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,695
you argued there was no point in studying
when the apocalypse was coming...

250
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:58,699
and skipped school for three days.

251
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,034
You weren't such an easy kid to raise.

252
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,636
Ha Na's craziness?

253
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:06,006
She's only as half crazy as you were.

254
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,944
You think so?

255
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:16,683
Then she'll soon come to her senses.

256
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,019
Just...

257
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,089
trust her.

258
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,458
She's doing great.

259
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,027
I don't know.

260
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,697
I'm tired.

261
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,268
I have to go to work tomorrow.

262
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,934
(Yoo Ji An)

263
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:36,790
When did you make the soup?

264
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,262
She drank a lot.
Make sure she has a sip at least.

265
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,066
You look good.

266
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,602
What are you saying?

267
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,373
I'm off. Make sure she eats it.

268
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,785
Seriously, pick up your phone at once.

269
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,555
I had so much going on yesterday.

270
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,457
It was hectic.

271
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,992
It was hectic for me too.

272
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,494
And I had tons of work.

273
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,431
Why did you call me so much
if you were that busy?

274
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,238
"What are you doing?
Where are you? Did you eat?"

275
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,739
It was nothing important anyway.

276
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,674
I can still message you
even if it's about nothing important.

277
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:36,950
Let me ask you a question,
and this is nothing personal.

278
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,888
- Who were you with...
- None of your business.

279
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,857
Don't. You look pitiful.

280
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:49,863
Right. I look pitiful.

281
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,734
Whose fault is that?

282
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,203
Gosh.

283
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:58,705
Whatever.

284
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,013
(Lim Ri Na)

285
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,650
It's an emergency. Where are you?

286
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,319
A meeting is summoned.
Get here as fast as you can.

287
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,708
No.

288
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,677
Never.

289
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:39,746
This isn't what you think it is.

290
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,048
No.

291
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,956
Anything wrong? Why the long face?

292
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,494
This.

293
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,765
What do you think is going to happen
once this gets out?

294
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,602
This isn't something we can overlook.

295
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:04,438
A scandal upon the debut.

296
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,675
Either sell my stocks
or get her out of the team.

297
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,844
Something has to be done.

298
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,947
Someone as good as Emily's voice,
emotion, and talents.

299
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,616
If you can bring her now, remove her.

300
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:18,952
I'm not sure if that's possible though.

301
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,991
I saw the collaboration clip.

302
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,893
She's irreplaceable.

303
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,328
We need to talk to Emily first.

304
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:29,396
- No.
- No.

305
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,400
Let me say this first.

306
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:35,936
You don't need to worry.

307
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:39,907
There's nothing between them.

308
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,542
How do you know?

309
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,409
Of course, I do.

310
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,447
Because we're in love.

311
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,388
My goodness.

312
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:58,325
No need for a joke...

313
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,660
like that now.

314
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,328
Yes.

315
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:04,464
I love Emily too.

316
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:08,302
Everyone here adores her, right?

317
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:12,573
That guy Park Jun in the picture.
He's from her hometown.

318
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,740
Just another male friend.

319
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,544
You all know Emily's from the States.

320
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:19,513
A hug means nothing more than a greeting.

321
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,882
Park Jun isn't the problem.

322
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,884
CEO Han, what are you pulling here?

323
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:26,753
What was that? In love?

324
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,190
Are you trying to get in the way
of your own artist?

325
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,225
I'm protecting her.

326
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,062
Stalking, internal criticism,
and fake scandals.

327
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:40,100
If I don't step out, there's no other way.

328
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,936
- Han Jun Hyuk...
- A malicious photograph like this.

329
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,872
That's privacy invasion and violence.

330
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,941
Stop trying to kick her out.

331
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,277
Find a way to protect her.

332
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:08,629
A good dancer even makes her hair dance.

333
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,530
Watch.

334
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,600
Like this.

335
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:17,771
It looks smooth
even when they spin their heads.

336
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:18,672
Try.

337
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:22,910
What?

338
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,578
- What?
- What?

339
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:27,214
No, relax your neck.

340
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,719
Imagine your hair is your brush,
and you're drawing with it.

341
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,355
Make each strand move to the rhythm.

342
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:36,323
Try again.

343
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:38,525
Each strand...

344
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,001
Still, you memorized the choreography
when you barely had enough time.

345
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,304
I memorized it all night long last night
after the shoot.

346
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:53,807
Well...

347
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:57,277
Something very emotional came up
yesterday.

348
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:02,015
I felt like bursting into tears
even if someone touched me.

349
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,984
Then right on time, Mr. Park... I mean,

350
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,220
Jun appeared.

351
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:12,726
But there's nothing between us, really.

352
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,027
Trust me.

353
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,396
Stop. That's enough.

354
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,667
Thank you.

355
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,272
That you're not going out with him.

356
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,842
- Hey.
- Yes?

357
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,146
Sorry. I'll memorize it by tomorrow.

358
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:34,781
No, that's not what I said.

359
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,017
Are you okay?

360
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,152
You look weird today.

361
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,154
It's nothing.

362
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:43,690
Hey.

363
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,227
Can I ask you something?

364
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:48,529
Yes?

365
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,035
What if a man thanks a woman...

366
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:59,940
for not going out with some other man?

367
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:02,009
What does that mean?

368
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,345
What else? It means he likes you.

369
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:08,982
What? Why didn't I know?

370
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,684
My goodness. When did...

371
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:12,686
that happen?

372
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,489
It's not about me.
It's about my friend's friend.

373
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,291
That's ridiculous. You have no friends.

374
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,561
If you're going to date anyone,
keep it a secret.

375
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:21,895
Until we debut...

376
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,765
No, even after we debut,
don't let it affect the team.

377
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,303
Date? No way.
I told you it's not about me.

378
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,438
It's about my friend's friend.

379
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,606
Stop following me.

380
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:33,974
Hey, this is upsetting.

381
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:38,545
My goodness. It is about her, right?

382
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:39,446
Yeah.

383
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,252
How do you spin it?

384
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:48,121
- Just spin your head.
- Okay.

385
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,891
- From left to right?
- Yes. Spin.

386
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,260
Why can't I do it?

387
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,382
Remember what I said
after the audition in LA?

388
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,986
I said I would take care of you
no matter what.

389
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,830
Come to your senses, O Du Ri.

390
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,299
You did just fine for 40 years
without a man.

391
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,336
But you regretted for your whole life
that you didn't become a singer.

392
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,141
No time to be distracted.

393
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,618
So?

394
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:55,822
The person you like.

395
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,925
How are you going to protect her?

396
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:02,462
Help me.

397
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,772
Calculate the cost and send me
the report as soon as possible.

398
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:13,841
Thanks.

399
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,817
Give up on bidding?

400
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,254
Our bidding price has more chance,

401
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,890
and we're the first to include
the safety device for free.

402
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:31,725
The chance of winning is high...

403
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,995
No, we basically won this project.
It makes no sense to give up on it.

404
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:37,030
How much is
the Ojin Apartment Project worth?

405
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,233
It's worth 236 million dollars.

406
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,667
We're reconstructing Sangmoo...

407
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,336
right next to it for 620 million dollars.

408
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:46,707
Junha Construction tried for years
and gave up due to a budget issue.

409
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:49,810
Then Director Kang Young Eun
quickly snatched it.

410
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,911
Director Kang?

411
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:55,349
You didn't know?

412
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,653
Seeing your devoted project
going to pieces...

413
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,121
and your subordinate rising...

414
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:04,057
probably worries you, of course.

415
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,927
But that's your perspective.

416
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,496
It's an unavoidable choice
for the company.

417
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,499
Good luck working together
with Director Kang.

Sorry, I didn't give you a heads-up.

00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,371

Ms. Shin.

424
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,653
It's me. Ja Yeong.

425
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,089
- What? Ja Yeong?
- Ja Yeong.

426

Gosh, you eyesore.

427
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,862
Ms. Shin. Have you heard
or seen anything...

428
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,763
about the rice soup restaurant brothers?

429
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,067
Even a minor pattern or movement.

430
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,169
I'm not sure.

431
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:23,937
For example,

432
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:26,507
like buying creamer.

433
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,442
That's right.

434
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,377
- The younger one.
- Yes.

435
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:32,646
Last time he was here to buy snacks,

436
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,948
and he seemed to be negotiating
the imported car price.

437
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,250
- An imported car?
- Yes.

438
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,319
He said he was getting a large sum
of money soon.

439
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,822
He was inquiring about a cash discount.

440
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,858
A cash discount. Hold on.

441
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,060
- Ja Yeong.
- Yes?

442
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,331
Who carries that these days?
That's so old-fashioned.

443
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,301
A cellphone is all you need.

444
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,004
Sorry for calling you.

445
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:57,938
Sit down.

446
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,442
You said it was urgent,
so I left in the middle of my work.

447
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:03,310
Give it to me.

448
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,547
Yes. Here.

449
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,682
It's soup.

450
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:11,051
How long is it going to take
to analyze the ingredients?

451
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:14,254
Well, it doesn't take that long,

452
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,857
but I have many on the list.

453
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:18,258
Right. You're busy.

454
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,563
Buddy, my family business depends on this.

455
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:25,532
No, my family depends on this.

456
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:27,067
That's how important this is.

457
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,837
I'm begging you, buddy.

I don't know.

00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:50,951
You crossed the line.

470
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:56,390
One must make the last decision
on their own.

471
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,393
Do you remember?

472
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,064
I'm sorry,

473
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:07,401
but you have to come with me.

474
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,053
Okay. Stop.

475
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,289
I'm proud of you.

476
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:33,460
I hope this continues without any trouble.

00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,030
Especially the troublemaker.

00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,215
It's a long story.

483
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,884

Is everything okay?

492
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,624
How do I explain this feeling?

493
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,461
That I miss Mom?

494
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:51,498
Or that I'm glad to have Mom?

495
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,246
Where did she go?

496
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:17,791
I'm going on a trip.

497
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,027
I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,078
What kind of jerk...

508
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,782
It seems it's not the first time
this guy's spying on her.

509
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,918
You know what a scandal means...

510
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,319
to an idol who's about to debut.

511
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:54,855
Whatever.

512
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,823
I'll find this jerk
and beg for forgiveness.

513
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,592
So if there's any problem,
say it's not true.

514
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:02,396
No. Just say I'm the stalker.

515
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,298
Say I went to see her and threatened her.

516
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,066
I forced Du Ri to...

517
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,467
Enough with your nonsense.

518
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,069
Aren't you worried about your future?

519
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,275
There's no time to think about it.

520

Do you know how desperately Du Ri
wanted to become a singer?

521
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:22,549
No.

522
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:24,818
Do you even know anything?

523
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,888
The kind of person she is
or the life she had.

524
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:31,191
Even the minor things like
if she likes roses or chrysanthemums.

525
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,596
I spent more than half
of my life watching her.

526
00:41:38,298 --> 00:41:39,299
You know what I mean?

527
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:44,538
Yet your heart didn't move her.

528
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,074
That says it all.

529
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:55,048
I'm going to help Emily debut quietly.

530
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,252
And I hope you do the same.

00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,068
What a timing.

00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,239
Whether we reconcile
or I make it up to her,

533
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:22,109
I was just planning to do something
with Mom.

534
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:26,914
I can't believe it.

535
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,201
This is starting to get boring.

You did.

540
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:23,504
Hop in first.

541
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,673
Hurry up.

542
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,647
So cold.

543
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:43,857
If you guess how long I waited here,

544
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:45,058
I'll forgive you.

What were you doing here? It's cold.

00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:52,900
A cold.

00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:58,872
If I catch a cold,
will you get me medicine?

548
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:01,275
I'm going back to the dorm.

549
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,577
It's a waste of time,

550
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:06,513
and I can't stay focused.

551
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,149
Look at my eyes and say it.

552
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:13,787
Why do you keep swaying me?

553
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:17,357
If a scandal breaks, we'll both go down.

554
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:23,163
I don't know about me,

555
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,601
but that'll never happen to you.
Because I won't let that happen.

556
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,304
Until you debut,

557
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,506
show what you got,

558
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,575
and you're safe enough to date anyone,

559
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:36,810
I'm going to wait.

560
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:42,115
As long as you feel...

561
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:45,919
the same way about me.

562
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,292
Let's run away first.

563
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:55,028
What do you mean? Run away?

564
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,931
Let's lose the stalker and find a way.

565
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,636
We're in the same boat now.

566
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:04,872
What?

567
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,560
You're so bright for someone
who's running away.

568
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:31,231
We need to come up with a plan.

569
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,099
A plan?

570
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,334
You told me already.

571
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:36,904
You said I'd only regret it
if I avoided it. So I must confront it.

572
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:39,773
What?

573
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:43,377
Is this how you confront?

574
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:45,879
Look at the view.

575
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,081
The air feels different already.

576
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:11,238
(Ms. O)

577
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:16,043
I'm going to help Emily debut quietly.

578
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,179
And I hope you do the same.

579
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,204
Where are we?

580
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:47,040
A place to clear our minds.

581
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:51,612
When you debut,
it'll be hectic for a while.

582
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:54,381
Enjoy the fresh air and nice view
while you can.

583
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,217
- Hop off.
- Okay.

584
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,459
I didn't expect a place like this
in the mountains.

585
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:06,960
Cool.

586
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:08,595
Don't be so tacky.

587
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,564
Never been to a place like this
for a date before?

588
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:14,835
What date? I was busy making ends meet.

589
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,138
To be honest, this is my first time.

590
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,176
Wait up.

591
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:42,496
Stand there. I'll take a picture of you.

592
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,899
One, two, three.

593
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,202
Three.

594
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,837
Do you have any other poses?

595
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:51,972
One, two, three.

596
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:53,740
- I'll take a picture of you.
- Let's take it together.

597
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,609
- Sure.
- Pose.

598
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:00,614
You're not a good photographer.

599
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:02,482
Done.

600
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,119
Come here.

601
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:08,922
That's funny.

602
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,691
Dance. It's fun.

603
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,693
Good.
You can form a group of four with them.

604
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:31,645
Pose.

605
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,681
One, two, three.

606
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,051
Wait. One more.

607
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:40,687
One, two, three.

608
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:41,855
Nice.

609
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:44,124
One, two, three.

610
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:45,893
Good?

611
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:46,894
Look.

612
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:48,328
How is it?

613
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:55,435
Excuse me.

614
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,703
Can I get a picture?

615
00:48:57,337 --> 00:49:00,407
I'm sorry, but no pictures.

616
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:04,311
What? Just one, please.

617
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:07,481
We can't...

618
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,882
get our pictures taken.

619
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:11,985
I didn't mean you.

620
00:49:11,985 --> 00:49:13,787
A picture of us.

621
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,289
What?

622
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,356
Us.

623
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,167
- Here. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

624
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,069
Move.

625
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:31,605
All right.

626
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,975
One, two, three.

627
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,412
One, two, three.

628
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,417
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

629
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,320
Do you want me to take a picture
of you two?

630
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:49,489
We're good.

631
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,425
What? Aren't you going out?

632
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:52,726
You look great together.

633
00:49:54,528 --> 00:49:57,464
No, we're not...

634
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:58,599
Can you?

635
00:49:58,599 --> 00:49:59,566
Sure.

636
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:08,709
When you're ready.

637
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,445
One, two, three.

638
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,347
One more.

639
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:15,449
Smile, will you?

640
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,385
It's not like I kidnapped you here.

641
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:19,686
Okay.

642
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:23,690
One, two, three.

643
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,604
Where is this place?

644
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,572
Hop off.

645
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:45,879
(Small Cinema)

646
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:10,003
The actor is very handsome.

647
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:43,704
It's over.

648
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:48,342
Okay.

649
00:52:03,757 --> 00:52:05,926
If they were going to break up,

650
00:52:05,926 --> 00:52:07,861
they shouldn't have met
in the first place.

651
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,003
They were still happy
while they were dating.

652
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,873
You say that because you never broke up
with anyone before.

653
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:34,988
- Thank you.
- Yes.

654
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,156
Enjoy.

655
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:40,093
Eat up. Dumplings aren't fattening.

656
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:43,430
Because they're flattened dumplings.

657
00:52:48,135 --> 00:52:49,570
You started it.

658
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:57,644
What's the past participle for "sprout?"

659
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:58,545
What?

660
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,781
Have "bean" sprouted.

661
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:05,853
What's the opposite of hot pepper?

662
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,188
Chili pepper.

663
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:11,592
Watch what you say around the egg whites.

664
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:13,393
No. I'm sorry. Don't...

665
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,863
They can't take a yolk.

666
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,170
I told you not to act up.

667
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,073
Are you trying to make me hate you?

668
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:29,877
Don't say something so scary.

669
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:34,047
You know what's the hardest and most cruel
in the world? It's hating someone.

670
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:37,351
If you're physically hurt,
there's a cure for it.

671
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:38,785
But to stop loving someone...

672
00:53:46,193 --> 00:53:49,296
Have you ever broken up
with someone like that before?

673
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:50,230
Of course.

674
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,701
I mean,

675
00:53:56,036 --> 00:53:57,604
that's what people said.

676
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:03,377
I'm becoming more and more curious...

677
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:05,846
about who you are.

678
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:09,883
Why do you say that? You see me every day.

679
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,320
Not from what I see.

680
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:14,855
Who you really are at heart.

681
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,794
I know you're not Emily.

682
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:26,700
You didn't lose your memory.
You're someone else.

683
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:34,107
It's good.

684
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:35,843
Eat up.

685
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,893
(I love you, Grandma.)

686
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:56,763
(Thank you, Grandma. From Ha Na)

687
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,785
Mother really knows
how to play hard to get.

688
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:23,090
It won't take long, right?

689
00:55:24,057 --> 00:55:25,058
Of course not.

690
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:29,029
Besides, we have Du Ri.

691
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:33,534
You seem very close to Du Ri now.

692
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,436
Not that much.

693
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:38,639
Don't deny it.

694
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,074
The day your father passed away,

695
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:44,311
what did you talk about with Du Ri?

696
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,347
You were crying and laughing.

697
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:50,083
Then you went to bed
just before the sun came up.

698
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:52,019
Me? With Du Ri?

699
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,189
No.

700
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:57,824
I talked to Mom all night...

701
00:55:57,824 --> 00:56:00,227
I peeped at you many times
through the door.

702
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:04,331
Right.

703
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:07,134
When you were drunk,

704
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:11,805
you called Du Ri Mom.

705
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:17,211
So why did you drink so much?
You know you can't take alcohol.

706
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,012
A smack on your back.

707
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:34,728
What I want to say is that...

708
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:38,899
you don't need to be pretentious
when you're with me.

709
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:41,602
I mean,

710
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:45,072
you shouldn't.

711
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:49,510
What does it mean to be the real me?

712
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,147
Who should I live as?

713
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,317
I don't see the answer to that either.

714
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,555
When I think about it,

715
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,259
I only thought about how I should live,

716
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,030
but I never thought about
how I wanted to live.

717
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:12,699
Perhaps that's why.

718
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:17,504
Even though I fought every day to survive,
I'm full of regrets.

719
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,241
Even now.

720
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:24,511
I'm overflowing with joy,

721
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:26,513
but at the same time,

722
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:30,784
I'm not sure if I deserve it.

723
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,753
I'm afraid and cautious.

724
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:34,321
What if...

725
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,457
you end up regretting it again?

726
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:43,297
It's not too late yet.

727
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:46,934
Live as your heart says from now on.

728
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:51,004
Listen to your heart and follow it.

729
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,241
That's the answer.

730
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:58,378
Should I?

731
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,448
Would that be okay?

732
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:16,096
Okay. I admit it. I lost this time.

733
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:19,233
But I have one last gift for Jun Hyuk.

734
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:21,301
One second.

735
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:29,543
What do you mean?

736
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,579
You agreed to discuss
whatever you do with me.

737
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:35,282
Torture him one more time.

738
00:58:36,116 --> 00:58:38,418
And I'll do anything to put you in prison.

739
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,623
Jun Hyuk can never do that.

740
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,359
Ask him yourself if you're curious.

741
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:07,247
When you were drunk,

742
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:11,552
you called Du Ri Mom.

743
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:17,991
It must've been painful
with all that hate in your heart.

744
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:22,196
You should've just said it.

745
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,866
You should've just got upset.

746
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,912
<i>The way you look at me</i>

747
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:41,014
<i>They like to set me free</i>

748
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:44,952
By the way,

749
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:47,387
are you sure it's safe here?

750
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,992
That stalker wouldn't follow us here,
right?

751
00:59:53,627 --> 00:59:56,563
The car that followed us
everywhere we went just until now.

752
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:57,531
Didn't you see it?

753
00:59:58,866 --> 00:59:59,733
What?

754
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:04,204
Are you saying you knew all along?

755
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,206
This is crazy.

756
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:09,343
Finally, it's time to end it.

757
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,013
Don't worry.

758
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:15,716
I will never...

759
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:18,785
get you hurt.

760
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:52,753
(Who Is She!)

761
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,987
Have you seen this?

762
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:56,123
It's all over the social media.

763
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:58,559
What on earth have you been doing?

764
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,227
A new female singer's double scandal.

765
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:01,862
And one is with her agency boss.

766
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:03,730
How are you going to explain it?

767
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,666
I'm worried about him.

768
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,935
You're not in love with that boy, are you?

769
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:10,604
I can't fool myself.

770
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:12,773
Am I getting old again?

771
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:14,641
No. It can't be.

772
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:16,743
Don't think about anyone.

773
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:18,645
Just follow your heart.

774
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:20,681
Especially for your last decision.

775
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:22,216
What?
