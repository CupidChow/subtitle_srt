(This drama series is fictional,
and the places, persons, organizations,)

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,474
(settings, and events depicted
have been fictionally created.)

3
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,325
All rise.

4
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,094
Here come the judges.

5
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,664
For the honorable judge.

6
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,611
Now,

7
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,880
we will begin...

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,250
the case number 2124GD815...

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,821
the defendant O Mal Soon's trial...

10
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,291
on unlawful acquisition of youth,
fraud, and deception.

11
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,096
Will the prosecutor explain...

12
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,631
why the defendant stand on trial today?

13
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,906
On August 26, 2024,

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,042
around 9:20 p.m.,

15
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,345
the defendant ran out of her house
after a fight with her daughter Ji Sook...

16
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,113
and unlawfully acquired youth.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,217
As the former owner of
O Mal Soon Beef Head Meat and Rice Soup...

18
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,852
and a member of a family,

19
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,721
O Mal Soon was
an ordinary 73-year-old woman.

20
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,724
Then she changed her identity
to 21-year-old O Du Ri,

21
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,726
and she is currently living a new life...

22
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,962
after acquiring youth.

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,968
The defendant abandoned her family...

24
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,205
just to achieve her unaccomplished dream
of becoming a singer.

25
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,975
And she deceived a young man...

26
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,611
and shook up his life.

27
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,748
For that reason,

28
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,683
I hereby prosecute her...

29
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,921
for unlawful acquisition of youth,

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,089
identity fraud, and negligence of family.

31
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,529
Defendant,
any objection to the prosecutor's claim?

32
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,236
Your Honor, the prosecutor's
prosecution is unjustifiable.

33
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,672
The defendant became young...

34
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,141
purely by chance.

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,510
It is indisputably false...

36
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,946
to say she abandoned her family.

37
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,847
Your Honor.

38
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,550
For someone who acquired it by chance,

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,852
her movement was
meticulous and premeditated.

40
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:35,022
She joined my agency for her revenge...

41
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,456
and seduced my nephew.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,025
At the same time,

43
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,427
she was afraid of her children
selling her fortune...

44
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,429
that she entered her house
with her fake identity...

45
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,331
to check on her family.

46
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,666
Especially...

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,368
when I think about the pain and shock
Daniel has to deal with,

48
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,508
I strongly request you...

49
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,246
to bring her back to her original form...

50
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,783
to stop her inhumane and reckless dash...

51
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,520
immediately.

52
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,932
For evidence one,

53
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,171
I submit the defendant's
old and broken reading glasses.

54
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,919
You were very cheap on yourself.

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,258
Whether it's money, time, or emotion.

56
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,429
You didn't know
how to use them for yourself.

57
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,334
The hopeful, joyful,

58
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,604
and shining girl I used to know is gone.

59
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,908
After her husband abandoned her,

60
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,412
she had to raise her daughter alone.

61
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,982
And to inherit no deficit or wound,

62
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,385
she lived like a general...

63
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,021
who was standing alone on the battlefield.

64
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,193
Her mother, twin sister,

65
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,196
her husband,

66
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,964
and...

67
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,438
a friend who became a successful singer...

68
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,607
by stealing her song.

69
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,648
Her life has been a series
of betrayal and frustration,

70
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,383
but never for once,

71
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,421
the defendant harmed anyone
or took her revenge.

72
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,601
Your Honor.

73
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,102
Please clear...

74
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,471
the cruel false charges on her,

75
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,241
and instead of stealing her youth,

76
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,409
I beg you...

77
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,478
to respect her last choice.

78
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,187
I will ask the defendant
before the final verdict.

79
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,525
What is your stance?

80
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,596
Do you want to go back?

81
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,404
Or...

82
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,909
First,

83
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,847
I want to ask.

84
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,018
Is there...

85
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,024
a country for the old?

86
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,963
If I go back,

87
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,135
is there a place for me?

88
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,247
So...

89
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,217
I...

90
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:33,527
(Episode 12, A Flower That Didn't Bloom)

91
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,501
Wait.

92
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,736
Are you okay?

93
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,271
Are you awake?

94
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,415
Yes.

95
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,519
Maybe I felt dizzy.

96
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,688
Sorry.

97
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,559
We don't have time.
Sorry for causing everyone trouble.

98
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,627
No.

99
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,528
Let's go see a doctor.

100
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,098
We have a shoot. I can't go anywhere.

101
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,367
Are you stupid?
How can you worry about the shoot...

102
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,002
when you're not well?

103
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,337
I know my body the best.

104
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,406
I starved lately to lose weight.

105
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,241
Maybe I was tired.

106
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,910
Don't worry about me.

107
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,345
Let me take a short break.

108
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,881
- Du Ri.
- But...

109
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,050
Are you okay?

110
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,494
Even if I black out,

111
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,729
I must complete the shoot.

112
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,499
You can't do anything in that condition.

113
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,701
Mom.

114
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,903
You have to go see a doctor...

115
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,039
and get checked up in that condition.

116
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,440
Forget about the shoot.

117
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,411
What have you been doing
when her condition got this bad?

118
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,680
I did my best to look after her...

119
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,382
Why are you blaming her?

120
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,686
Let's go. I'll drive you to the hospital.

121
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm okay.

122
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,322
Even if I'm not okay,

123
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,390
I'm still going to complete the shoot.

124
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,326
Don't worry about me or try to stop me.

125
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,563
Emily, are you okay?

126
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,066
I'm fine.

127
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,735
Seriously.

128
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,438
Mom, what are you doing here?

129
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,807
What?

130
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,810
<i>Brighter than the sun</i>

131
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,948
<i>I want to be in love</i>

132
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,823
<i>That's the way I love</i>

133
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,394
<i>I won't give it up</i>

134
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,897
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

135
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,698
<i>The way you look at me</i>

136
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,767
<i>The lights set me free</i>

137
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,303
<i>I can't miss my dream that's already here</i>

138
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,373
<i>Now I, I</i>

139
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,407
<i>I'm gonna say</i>

140
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,742
<i>I won't give it up</i>

141
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,411
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

142
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,783
Cut.

143
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,984
Good job.

144
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,489
- Thank you.
- Good job.

145
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,393
Good job, girls.

146
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,895
Thank you.

147
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,436
Anyway, please focus on editing.

148
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,738
Yes. Don't worry.

149
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,307
They were great.

150
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,644
- Do you want to grab a meal after this?
- Sure.

151
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,146
- Do you have time for it?
- Yes.

152
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,987
(Boss 1)

153
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,509
What?

154
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,014
(Find your youth again.)

155
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,189
Did you enjoy the spring?

156
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,344
(Find your youth again.)

157
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,847
This is your last one.

158
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,118
I'm not going to the US.

159
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,086
I don't have much time left anyway.

160
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,924
I'd rather stay...

161
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,795
next to my poor sister
than my ungrateful children...

162
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,931
who abandoned me in a nursing home...

163
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,701
as soon as I became sick.

164
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,070
(O Mal Soon)

165
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,140
Please answer your phone.
I have a question.

166
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,252
Tell me.

167
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,622
What's happening?

168
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:34,862
Ji Sook.

169
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,205
You're not my mom.

170
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,480
I have to choose?

171
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,815
Yes.

172
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,651
Either go back to your old body...

173
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,855
or spend six months in that body...

174
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,157
and annihilate.

175
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,397
What was that again?

176
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,468
Are you telling me to go back
to a granny...

177
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,104
or live in this body
for half a year and die?

178
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:22,442
I didn't take anything from you.

179
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,978
I'm only giving you choices.

180
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,150
You have three days.

181
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:32,920
You.

182
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,154
Wait.

183
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't like flowers.

184
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,396
A blooming flower means...

185
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,798
withering.

186
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,336
A moment of happiness gets ditched
in the trash bin soon.

187
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,340
If a flower could talk, it'd say,

188
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,010
"Those who praise my beauty."

189
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,179
"How detestable."

190
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,982
I am a driver.

191
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,219
Driving with a few principles.

192
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,388
Where to?

193
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,691
I don't know.

194
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,929
I don't drive anyone with a destination.

195
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,766
A flower that withers...

196
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,569
even before blooming...

197
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,340
gets a chance to go for its dream again.

198
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,510
But the gift is not everlasting.

199
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,678
And a choice is its fate.

200
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:35,382
If you were going to be this strict,
you shouldn't have made me young again.

201
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,850
Taking back what you gave me.

202
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,819
Once I make a choice, I can't retrieve it.

203
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,456
Taking back what was given is bad.

204
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,223
However,

205
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,994
having no chance to bloom at all...

206
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,795
is more cruel.

207
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,500
Therefore, I leave behind
all the thoughts...

208
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,637
and take the wheel again.

209
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:02,009
To find a footstep of a sad old man...

210
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,179
who lost his body, soul, and destination.

211
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,583
To help his flower yet to bloom.

212
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,463
What's wrong?

213
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,849
Why... How...

214
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,183
Emily...

215
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,452
was Janet.

216
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,454
What?

217
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,857
The trainee who looked just like me...

218
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,426
and disappeared.

219
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,761
Janet.

220
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,700
She was my sister Kkeut Soon.

221
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,038
Is that why...

222
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,509
Now everything makes sense.

223
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,882
It's the one you left me to keep.

224
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,687
And this is mine.

225
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,529
The stamp knew it already.

226
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,498
That time has come.

227
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,201
My time is up.

228
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:43,410
She's up.

229
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,479
- Hurry.
- What?

230
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,250
Sit down.

231
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,124
What is all this?

232
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,526
I showed off my skills after a while.

233
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,495
Finish that first and take this.

234
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,165
Eat this and don't black out again.

235
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,467
We're now one.

236
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,070
We share a soul together.

237
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,307
If you're sick, I'm sick too.

238
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,278
Eat up.

239
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,415
Hurry.

240
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,016
- Try.
- Hurry.

241
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,351
Try.

242
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,420
She ate it.

243
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,089
- It's good.
- I made it.

244
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,191
- It's yummy.
- Do you like it?

245
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,171
("Park Jun, Winner
of 2024 Ssireum Idol Championship")

246
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,205
Here.

247
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,443
This is a party to celebrate the reopening
of our rice soup restaurant. Dig in.

248
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,011
- Thank you.
- So...

249
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,647
to celebrate Jun's victory...

250
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,350
and the reopening of the restaurant.

251
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,118
All right.

252
00:16:58,552 --> 00:16:59,620
Congratulations.

253
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,888
You were better than I thought.

254
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,763
- My goodness.
- He's asking for it.

255
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,367
That's love.

256
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,935
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

257
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,873
Nice.

258
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,346
Gosh.

259
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,249
It's not easy to gather
these handsome faces...

260
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,052
in one place.

261
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:32,986
Thank you, Min Seok.

262
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:33,954
Gosh.

263
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,491
Good days.

264
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,793
So? Do you have girlfriends?

265
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:45,866
As the only married man here,

266
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,902
let me give you a piece of advice.

267
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,638
When you date a girl, you suddenly feel,

268
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,676
"I want to live with this woman."

269
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,245
"I want to marry her."

270
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,214
You confront that crisis.

271
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,616
- Crisis?
- Yes, it's a crisis.

272
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:03,884
I'm telling you. It's a crisis.

273
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,521
You must overcome that crisis.

274
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,424
That fragile deer before marriage...

275
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,427
turns into a lioness after marriage.

276
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,264
Her deep and clear big eyes disappear.

277
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,234
Have you ever been bitten
with eyes before?

278
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:21,435
That sounds painful.

279
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,905
A deer into a lioness.
And a lioness into a Grim Reaper.

280
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,540
That tragedy...

281
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,441
Wait.

282
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,143
Why do you blame it on women?

283
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:34,081
Whether that beauty becomes
a deer or a lioness,

284
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,383
it's all the man's fault.

285
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:37,718
What?

286
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:38,986
Bravo.

287
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,355
Yes, you're right.

288
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,123
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Yes.

289
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,024
Here.

290
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,960
No. We're out.

291
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,963
Min Seok, we're all out.
Let's go buy more.

292
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,832
Sure.

293
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,867
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

294
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,504
I'll buy a few ice cream.
I don't have much money.

295
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,173
How old is he?

296
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,707
He's younger than me.

297
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,676
But I'm calling him brother
because he's rich.

298
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,829
Take good care of Du Ri.

299
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,201
She may look daring,
but she couldn't be more tender inside.

300
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,770
She's fragile and naive.

301
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,775
If you cheat on her or break her heart,

302
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,510
you know it.

303
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,601
If you wish to return, be ready...

304
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,768
to be in vain.

305
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:05,105
If you wish not to return, be ready...

306
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,173
for a farewell.

307
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,544
If I go back,

308
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,913
what about my dream of becoming a singer?

309
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,481
No.

310
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:17,451
What about their debut?

311
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,720
And...

312
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,724
(Medical Check Result)

313
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,103
Ji Sook.

314
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,883
(Ji Sook)

315
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,653
How are you feeling?

316
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,656
Better.

317
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,625
I was born healthy as a horse.

318
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,398
Is that why you're here?

319
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,203
Why the long face?

320
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,939
Is everything okay?

321
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,310
Nothing.

322
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,413
I just miss my mom.

323
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,282
Du Ri.

324
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,185
Is my mom well?

325
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,026
Your mom...

326
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,397
Don't wait for her.

327
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,000
What?

328
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,270
Your mom...

329
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,140
can't come back.

330
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,408
No.

331
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,811
She's not coming back.

332
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,249
She's busy...

333
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:58,752
enjoying her spring.

334
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:02,523
She doesn't care about her daugther.

335
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,859
And she has no plan to come back. So...

336
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,793
Sure.

337
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:08,962
I won't wait for her.

338
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,466
I won't wait for you anymore,

339
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,437
so don't come back, Mom.

340
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,412
If you can,

341
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:29,016
shine brightly...

342
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,319
in that beautiful look.

343
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,857
You look beautiful, Mom.

344
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,198
Why didn't I realize it...

345
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,501
until now?

346
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:53,106
Ji Sook.

347
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,678
Don't look back.

348
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:00,113
Don't think about anything.

349
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,417
Live for yourself now.

350
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,721
All that time you wasted...

351
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,958
just to raise me.

352
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,629
It was such a shame to waste it.

353
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,834
I feel so bad.

354
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:22,803
No.

355
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,806
No. Don't say that.

356
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:28,942
Just to see you growing up...

357
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,579
Just to see you eating,

358
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,348
I was so happy.

359
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:36,984
No. Don't come back.

360
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,988
Don't ever live as my mom again.

361
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,458
Don't meet someone like Dad.

362
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,159
Meet someone nice.

363
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,861
Go on a date and get married.

364
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:51,765
Give birth to a naive and cute daughter...

365
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,635
who understands you.

366
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,607
No.

367
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,809
Why bother getting married?

368
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:07,481
Just do everything you want...

369
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,954
and enjoy your life.

370
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,789
Will you?

371
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,065
There's a timing for everything.

372
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,501
To get mad.

373
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,536
To hear an excuse.

374
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,137
Now I finally feel relieved.

375
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,507
Let's not shake up each other's life...

376
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,875
and root for each other with respect...

377
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,676
like now.

378
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,063
I know you're her granddaughter,
but you resemble her too much.

379
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:33,033
Your face, the way you speak,

380
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,035
and even the way you sing.

381
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,173
I think Jun Hyuk...

382
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:44,478
likes you more than I thought.

383
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:47,080
Maybe it's in the blood.

384
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,650
Because I was the same.

385
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,986
Mal Soon.

386
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,356
I hated her, yet I liked her.

387
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,427
No, maybe I liked her so much...

388
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,429
that...

389
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,732
I blamed her.

390
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,272
And Jun Hyuk.

391
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,743
He's not my nephew.

392
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,747
What?

393
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:23,684
He's...

394
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,055
my son.

395
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,763
What do you mean?

396
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,665
The king has donkey ears.

397
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,935
I always wanted to tell someone.

398
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:45,873
I didn't expect it to be you.

399
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,278
How...

400
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,914
He appears...

401
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,051
to be perfect,

402
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,889
but he has a lot of wounds.

403
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,394
I knew it was late,
but I still wanted to mend it.

404
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,933
But I guess I'll never get that chance.

405
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,985
Please take good care of Jun Hyuk.

406
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,060
And if your grandma wants,

407
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,298
I'll apologize to her.

408
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,868
If she wants her song back,

409
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,805
I will do it.

410
00:27:58,478 --> 00:27:59,379
No.

411
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:10,123
Actually my grandma asked me
to deliver this message.

412
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:13,594
That song is...

413
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,464
your song now.

414
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,870
It was made for me,

415
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:27,674
but it was your voice
that introduced the song to the world...

416
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:29,977
and made people fall in love with it.

417
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:35,449
The one who lost it is worse
than the one who stole it.

418
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,021
Du Ri.

419
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:42,256
And CEO Han...

420
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,224
No, your son.

421
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:46,693
I can't protect him.

422
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:50,297
Don't put your burden on me.

423
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,500
Protect him yourself.

424
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:16,857
You're here?

425
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:24,031
I thought you wanted to go on a date.
It was a rice soup restaurant?

426
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:25,799
What do you mean?

427
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,936
I rented the whole place for you.

428
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:29,837
What?

429
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,573
Why? To propose to me?

430
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,043
Take a seat and wait.

431
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,919
What is all this?

432
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,021
Did you make everything?

433
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:50,557
Who else is in here?

434
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,860
Eat before it gets cold.

435
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,760
Here.

436
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,365
It's touching,

437
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,069
but it's weird.

438
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,136
What's so weird?

439
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,108
Let me try.

440
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,553
You can sing. You're pretty.

441
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:20,988
And you can cook.

442
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,456
Is there anything you can't do?

443
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,759
Stop buttering me up.

444
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:30,364
I always wanted to cook for you.

445
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:32,199
You're talking like a granny again.

446
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,934
You caught me off guard.

447
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,812
No matter how busy you are,
don't skip your meals.

448
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:51,018
Even if you're not tired,
keep your eyes closed.

449
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,087
And you're already so wonderful.

450
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,924
So don't force yourself to be better.

451
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:04,097
Stop pretending to be strong and okay.

452
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,400
Ask for help when you need it.

453
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,402
Okay?

454
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,138
Why are you saying that?

455
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,240
Are you going to go off the grid again?

456
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,078
You never know.

457
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:21,114
I mean, look at us.

458
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,317
Who would've known...

459
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:25,219
I might be doing this with a perv
who tried to steal my pads?

460
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,790
Right. We've come a long way.

461
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,727
It happened only recently,
but why does it feel like an old story?

462
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,796
Do you finally see it?

463
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:39,933
Nothing is impossible in this world.

464
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,637
Especially when it comes to relationships.

465
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,406
Strange.

466
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,808
You're acting so strange.

467
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,917
Don't forget me.

468
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,087
Even if it hurts, keep me in your heart.

469
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,923
For you to think about me...

470
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:06,260
while drinking from time to time.

471
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,462
Or...

472
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,532
I will be really sad.

475
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,007
Are you threatening me...

476
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,876
that you'll quit?

477
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,511
No.

478
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,047
Then what is this?

479
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:30,083
The leadership you showed Director Kang...

480
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,386
is gaining you favor among the executives.

481
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,289
You're resigning
after freshening up the mood?

482
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,791
I just wanted to finish it up...

483
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,528
as who I am in the organization
I worked for over 20 years.

484
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,598
My daughter said...

485
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,702
I didn't look happy.

486
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:55,008

489

Why are you so stubborn?
I said I'll give you a ride.

490
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:04,618
Thank you for the food.

491
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:08,021
I'll have to take digestive medicine...

492
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,523
for someone who said strange things
after feeding me.

493
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,427
Will you give me a hug?

494
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:18,432
Just one hug. No words.

495
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:28,275
Thank you.

496
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:31,678
Me too.

497
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:35,782
Right.

Here.

499
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,053
It's for the meal.

500
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:43,557
Check.

Don't let anyone listen to it.

503

I made that song only for you.

504
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,881
- Get home safely.
- Bye.

505
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,160
What's that look?

506
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,297
As if you can't see him again.

Do you know how much I looked for you?

510
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:40,214
I'll keep it short.
It's not like I can tell you much anyway.

511
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,563
I'm always on your side.

512
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,366

For accepting me again. And...

516
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:15,616
for letting me live as your family

00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,306
I'm off...

560
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,343
to bloom the flower not yet bloomed.

561
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:39,980
Thank you for everything.

562
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:50,090
(Element)

563
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,191
Cool.

564
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,926
Purple? Pink?

565
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,127
- Pink.
- Pink.

566
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:57,331
Gosh, it's crowded, right?

567
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:23,824
I love you, Element.

568
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:57,758
<i>I just wanna love me like you do</i>

569
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,995
<i>The days that made me cry</i>

570
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:05,499
<i>The nights that scared me</i>

571
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,873
<i>Ever since you got me feeling new</i>

572
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:16,376
<i>Questions on my mind</i>

573
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:20,280
<i>How can I get better</i>

574
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,884
<i>My worries are growing</i>

575
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:27,788
<i>When I'm scared, I want to hide</i>

576
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:31,692
<i>But you'll be my side
If you do that for me</i>

577
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:32,960
<i>I won't give it up</i>

578
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,629
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

579
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,703
<i>That's the way I love</i>

580
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,341
<i>I won't give it up</i>

581
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,877
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

582
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:51,612
<i>The way you look at me</i>

583
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,680
<i>The lights set me free</i>

584
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,250
<i>I can't miss my dream that's already here</i>

585
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,286
<i>Now I, I</i>

586
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:00,320
<i>I'm gonna say</i>

587
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,755
<i>I won't give it up</i>

588
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:04,424
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

589
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:06,226
<i>I ain't got wrong direction</i>

590
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,961
<i>I need no more dissuasion</i>

591
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:11,365
<i>I'm nervous, but this feeling</i>

592
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,633
<i>Doesn't bother me like before</i>

593
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,635
<i>You make me wanna be better</i>

594
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:17,638
<i>Just trust myself
I like it</i>

595
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:21,241
<i>When the past nights tie me down</i>

596
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:25,045
<i>I want to lock myself up</i>

597
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,982
<i>But you'll be my side
If you do that for me</i>

598
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:30,384
<i>I won't give it up</i>

599
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,819
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

600
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,127
<i>That's the way I love</i>

601
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,631
<i>I won't give it up</i>

602
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,167
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

603
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,936
<i>The way you look at me</i>

604
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:51,004
<i>The lights set me free</i>

605
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:53,607
<i>I can't miss my dream that's already here</i>

606
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:56,610
<i>Now I, I</i>

607
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,711
<i>I'm gonna say</i>

608
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:01,515
<i>I won't give it up
Baby that's the way I love</i>

609
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,755
<i>That's the way I love</i>

610
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:12,693
<i>That's the way I love</i>

611
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:15,462
<i>Brighter than the sun</i>

612
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:20,868
<i>I want to be in love</i>

613
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:28,509
<i>That's the way I love</i>

614
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,046
<i>I won't give it up</i>

615
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:35,549
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

616
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,317
<i>The way you look at me</i>

617
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:39,386
<i>The lights set me free</i>

618
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,955
<i>I can't miss my dream that's already here</i>

619
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,958
<i>Now I, I</i>

620
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,026
<i>I'm gonna say</i>

621
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,394
<i>I won't give it up</i>

622
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,897
<i>Baby that's the way I love</i>

623
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:15,322
Go, O Du Ri.

624
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,690
I'm Ha Na's dad.

625
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,624
Stop it.

626
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:19,259
I'm her dad.

627
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:50,157
- Thank you.
- It's here.

628
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:51,124
Thank you.

629
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:56,496
Thank you for celebrating our debut.

630
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:58,932
It's on me and Du Ri today.

631
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:01,101
What? It's on you?

632
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:04,004
I couldn't be more grateful.

633
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,340
You have no money.

634
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,108
It's an honor...

635
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:10,611
just to be here with the busy celebs.

636
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,315
It's not like you have any money.

637
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:17,451
I heard you quit your job...

638
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,786
and study to be an architect.

639
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:23,023
It turns out idling at home is my thing.

640
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,859
I finally found my potential.

641
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:31,532
Keep that cute little salary to yourself.

642
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:35,302
From now on, use my credit card
all you want.

643
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:36,470
Just swipe, swipe, swipe.

644
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,771
What?

645
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,776
I'm happy to see you all smiling.

646
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:45,045
Especially you, Ha Na.

647
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:48,815
I always knew you were
good and extraordinary.

648
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:50,651
But you're really something.

649
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:54,454
You're never discouraged
even among those proud girls...

650
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:57,090
or let their attitude bring you down.

651
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:00,360
Seeing you coming this far,

652
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,728
it must be in your blood.

653
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,798
She looked after her grandma.

654
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,634
I'm her mother.

655
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:10,604
Come on. Half of her genes are from me.

656
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:11,872
- What?
- What?

657
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:15,409
You blamed each other...

658
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:18,679
when I quit studying.

659
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:20,214
That's ridiculous.

660
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,715
Says who? Who did that?

661
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:27,688
This must be what you call happiness.

662
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,489
Now I wouldn't ask for more.

663
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,825
There you go again.
You need to fix the way you speak.

664
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:33,660
That will make us...

665
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,696
granny idols.

666
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,501
If Ms. O was here,

667
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,069
it would've been perfect, right?

668
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:43,937
Yes.

669
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:46,740
This is so nice.

670
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,643
We should've done this earlier.
Why didn't we?

671
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:53,580
We should enjoy this from now on.

672
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:54,915
Yes.

673
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:57,150
Sounds good. Let's do that.

674
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,452
Yes.

675
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:02,122
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

676
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,960
It feels like Mother is always with us.

677
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,362
Me too.

678
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,197
- Right?
- It wasn't just me?

679
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,399
I can always feel her.

680
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:18,572
(Chun Bun, Soon Ae, Mr. Park, Soo Jin)

681
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,674
To my daughter Ji Sook.

682
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:03,584
Since the moment I had you,

683
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,853
I was happy to live...

684
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,056
as your mother.

685
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:13,794
You call yourself a bad daughter,

686
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,898
but you're a precious daughter
who saved my life.

687
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,969
I wasn't lonely because I had you.

688
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:26,340
I wasn't jealous of anyone
because I had you.

689
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:30,010
If I meet you again in my next life,

690
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:31,712
then...

691
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:34,915
instead of worrying
about how to raise you,

692
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,452
I'd make eye contact
with my lovely daughter...

693
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,722
more often.

694
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:46,026
My spring...

695
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:49,329
brought the flower in full bloom.

696
00:48:50,397 --> 00:48:53,033
My second spring...

697
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:57,905
arrived dazzling
when it was cold and dark.

698
00:48:57,905 --> 00:48:59,606
That's why I wanted to seize more.

699
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:04,244
Young people
who looked immature taught me...

700
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:08,081
what I hadn't learned
in the past 70 years.

701
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,985
I just opened up a bit,

702
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,488
and the whole world turned out
to be my teacher.

703
00:49:15,522 --> 00:49:17,391
And my life that felt like homework...

704
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:19,626
became a festival.

705
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:22,563
Now I finally realized it.

706
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:26,567
Spring isn't given by someone,

707
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:30,504
but it's a gift
that only I can give myself.

708
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:33,941
Dazzling youth.

709
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:39,246
Spring is in everyone.

710
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:47,588
Why am I so sleepy?

711
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:17,718
(A year later)

712
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:22,322
(First World Tour Sold Out!)

713
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:25,092
Jay, did I do this right?

714
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:25,993
Yes.

715
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:31,398
If a trainee was a boot camp,

716
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:33,433
this is an inferno.

717
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,269
I can't believe how busy we are.

718
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,870
I prefer sleeping in the car...

719
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,306
than placing first on a music show.

720
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:40,707
Is that strange?

721
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:41,608
Hey.

722
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:43,911
That's the third already.

723
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,115
If Emily was here,

724
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,184
she would've nagged at you.

725
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:51,552
Stop slacking off.

726
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,854
How ungrateful. Come to your senses.

727
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,258
O Du Ri.

728
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,128
I miss her.

729
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,698
I'm nervous to death.

730
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:06,633
Should I take a pill? What do I do?

731
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:13,140
I've never seen anyone dead from tension.

732
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,474
Don't worry.

733
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:18,045
Thanks. I feel better.

734
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,914
Your existence alone is my sedative.

735
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:24,585
O Du Ri, I can't live without you now.

736
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:27,020
No.

737
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:28,288
You will...

738
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:31,592
do well without anyone's help.

739
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:36,163
Choi Ha Na, always keep this in mind.

740

742
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:52,312
Okay.

Hello.

He's my dad.

751

Yes.

762
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:58,412
Yes, the interest
on the investment is very high.

763
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:04,351
If the interest is high,
it means the interest rate is high...

764
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:07,888
He's sloppy.

765

the way Mr. Park looks at you.
It's not the same as before.

00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:49,356
Yes, that's me.

788

We called you...

789
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:54,328
regarding O Mal Soon's regular treatment.

Treatment?

791
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:58,699
We already told O Mal Soon...

792
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,534
on her last visit.

(Suspicion: Alzheimer's)

795
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:05,305
It's still an early stage.

796
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,841
She should start her treatment
as soon as possible.

797
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:12,212
But we weren't able to contact her
for over a year after that.

804
00:55:30,697 --> 00:55:33,800
No. She's not coming back.

Darkness...

812
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,434
only depresses your body and soul.

813
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:14,041
You're edgy and sensitive...

814
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,777

That's my question.

How do you feel
to be the CEO of a new label?

828
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:07,160
- Not easy?
- Not at all.

829
