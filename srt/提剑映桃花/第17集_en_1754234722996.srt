1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Later, someone else put the knife in Jin Qunv's mouth

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
And Yepi and Jin Quan took their lives

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
They werearchs

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,840
Who knows about thisating

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,560
Forces of Eight

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a death sentence.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm the same as you.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I saw Young Master's body as soon as I came in.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
After I checked,

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yunyang's death was at least an hour.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And half an hour ago,

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was still in prison asking about Yan Shiyi.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you don't believe me,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the family members there can prove it to me.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why should I believe you?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You are the murderer who killed my brother.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you still don't believe me,

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you can ask the young lady to check the body in person.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not going to let you go.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sister, look.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Take a good look.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Lord Han Dao is right.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My brother's body temperature is low.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The death time is more than an hour.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My Lord,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
my sister, my father, and my brother's death are all strange.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I hope you can give them justice.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Lord also said that

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
in two days,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the court will be quick to report the truth.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In less than two days,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the murderer will be exposed.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bai Hu Xuan Wu.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Everyone leave the crime scene.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Search the body until the truth is found.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lord.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Brother.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Lord.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Brother.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Brother.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Young Hero Yan.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lord wants to see you.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
See me?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm still a suspect.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm ordered to take the suspect to the crime scene.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lord.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm here to see you.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm here to see you.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm here to see you.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm here to see you.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sit down.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you feeling better?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's just a skin wound.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't worry about me.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We just found out that Yun Yang is suspected.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He was murdered.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm afraid the murderer has other people.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And he always makes us happy.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He's a good man.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He knows our movements.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He wants to frame me.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yun Xiu and Yun Yang have been murdered.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How many bad guys are there in the Peach Blossom Manor?

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The murderer may not be a bad guy.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think a good guy is forced to be a bad guy.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We must have neglected something.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been thinking about a question these days.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How did the murderer poison the dead?

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The peach blossom powder Yun Yang gave me

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
has always been my own.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It will cause people to suffer, but not to die.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So how did people get poisoned without knowing it?

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Unless

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it's absorbed.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How?

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If the peach blossom powder

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
has always been in our breathing environment.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's the smell of peach blossom powder.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Peach blossom powder has always been hidden in the red candle.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You made these red candles, right?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you know that there's peach blossom powder in the red candle?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What peach blossom powder? I don't know.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You made it.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How can you not know?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
These red candles

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
were all made by the shop run by the Young Mistress.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Red embroidery?

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did she look for you before the Young Mistress was killed?

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
These are all my jewelry.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You have to help me no matter what.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You still want to go?

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I must go.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But not only me.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who else?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You don't have to ask.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Go.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Brother.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I deserve to die.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I also have my share of the past.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Brother, wait for me.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll come to you after I do what I have to do.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
atone together.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yu Ming.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you talking about?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You promise to go with me?

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This way.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This way.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This way.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This way.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yu Ming.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yu Ming.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Master.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Master, stop the car.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Where is Yu Ming?

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Where is Yu Ming?

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He is not here.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Ah!

138
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,440
Mr. Cheng,

139
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,120
where's Hong Xiu?

140
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
Why are you looking for her?

141
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
Hong Xiu is my wife.

142
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm the same.

143
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
We have evidence to prove that Hong Xiu killed Yunyang.

144
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
Now Hong Xiu is a criminal.

145
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
If you want to protect her,

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
you have a responsibility.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Mr. Cheng,

148
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
where did you hide Hong Xiu?

149
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
Since you used the word hide,

150
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,120
I won't tell you.

151
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,040
Mr. Cheng,

152
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
think it over.

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
If you can't find Hong Xiu,

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,440
you'll die.

155
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
She's just a criminal.

156
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,000
She's not a murderer.

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,920
If she's really a murderer,

158
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
I should consider her

159
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,200
for the sake of the living.

160
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
If you want to go back and investigate,

161
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,920
I'll take the responsibility for the murder.

162
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,040
Xuan Wu, Bai Hu.

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,880
Yes.

164
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,800
Pass my order.

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,960
Arrest Hong Xiu.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
I dare not move.

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Go.

168
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,200
I told you.

169
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
I'll take all the blame.

170
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Why didn't you let me go?

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,360
Yan Ming,

172
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,880
this involves many lives.

173
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm afraid

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,080
you can't take the responsibility alone.

175
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Mr. Cheng,

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
you have a duty.

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,840
Please don't stop me.

178
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,520
Don't come over.

179
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,280
Don't let me die here.

180
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,280
Mr. Han Dao,

181
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,400
so many people died in the Peach Blossom Hill.

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,800
If I die,

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
how can you go back and investigate?

184
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Yan Ming.

185
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,920
Yan Ming.

186
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
You said it yourself.

187
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
She's just a criminal.

188
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,200
If she's really a murderer,

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
she'll be suspected.

190
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,560
She wanted to escape from the Peach Blossom Hill.

191
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,440
She did a lot of silly things

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
to get out of here.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm glad

194
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,080
I helped her.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
I should help the one

196
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,520
who I love the most

197
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,960
in my life.

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,360
Mr. Cheng.

199
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
Why did you do this?

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,240
I didn't do much.

201
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,600
Because I'm a man now.

202
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
At first,

203
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
I didn't marry Hong Xiu

204
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
because of my father's power.

205
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
I did it for the sake of Qian Luo.

206
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,840
Hong Xiu.

207
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,240
Hong Xiu married my brother

208
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
and became my sister-in-law.

209
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm not the only one who's in trouble.

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
My sister-in-law and I

211
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
are in a bad situation.

212
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,920
I failed to protect my brother.

213
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
I failed to protect him.

214
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,360
And those...

215
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
And those four girls.

216
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,120
I didn't do it myself,

217
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,400
but I didn't stop them.

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,680
Four girls?

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,400
Tell me clearly.

220
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm sorry to you.

222
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,000
My father and my brother are dead.

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,200
You can take revenge.

224
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Nian Nian.

225
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,120
Nian Nian.

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,120
Nian Nian.

227
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
Let me go.

228
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,360
Hong Xiu.

229
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,520
Don't stop her.

230
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,600
Nian Nian.

231
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Nian Nian.

232
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,440
Nian Nian.

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,240
Hong Xiu.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,400
Hong Xiu.

235
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,880
Nian Nian.

236
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Why are you back?

237
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
Why are you back?

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,280
Nian Nian.

239
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,320
Why are you back?

240
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,320
Nian Nian.

241
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,480
You gave me this.

242
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
I've been keeping it.

243
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,840
I made it for you.

244
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,760
Does it look good?

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes.

246
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,520
Yueming.

247
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,160
Thank you.

248
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,840
Then I'll help you to collect the chicken.

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Okay?

250
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,000
Collect the chicken?

251
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,960
Okay.

252
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,160
Yueming.

253
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,560
Yueming, believe me.

254
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
Yueming.

255
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,440
Hong Xiu.

256
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Thank you.

257
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
Thank you for your help.

258
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,720
Please help Yueming.

259
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,480
Yueming.

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,520
Yueming.

261
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Yueming, it's okay.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Yueming.

263
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,960
Please help me.

264
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,680
Please help Yueming.

265
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
Please help her.

266
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,080
Hong Xiu.

267
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,960
Listen to me.

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,320
Leave here.

269
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Live on.

270
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
You've always wanted to leave.

271
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
I wanted to leave here.

272
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,840
I wanted to leave here every day.

273
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
But now it's changed.

274
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,360
Yueming even gave up on me.

275
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Since I can't leave,

276
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
I'll go with her.

277
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
Hong Xiu.

278
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,640
Yueming.

279
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,760
Yueming.

280
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,400
Yueming.

281
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,760
You killed Yun Yang and Yun Xiu, right?

282
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes.

283
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,080
If it wasn't for Yun Xiu,

284
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,360
I would have been Yun Ming's wife.

285
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,240
After he forced me to marry Yun Yang,

286
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,840
I've been training his internal organs every day.

287
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
He's so cruel.

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
He even wanted to live forever.

289
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
He didn't want to exchange blood with his new son.

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,440
How could he

291
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,600
live forever?

292
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,400
He's just dreaming.

293
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,160
How did you kill Yun Xiu in the single room?

294
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,800
I took the antidote in advance.

295
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,080
I wanted to watch him get poisoned quietly.

296
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
Let's see how he dies.

297
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,680
Take off your clothes and lie down.

298
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,040
Fine.

299
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:45,000
P besló

300
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Where did you hear it from?

301
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I found Lin Jiangxian's letter.

302
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
I heard it secretly.

303
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Yun Lang,

304
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
after the farewell,

305
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
the two brothers met.

306
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
It was said that it was three or four months,

307
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
but who knows five or six years.

308
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
The seven strings of zither are not in the mood to play.

309
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Only the peach blossom umbrella is left.

310
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
To show their love.

311
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
This Lin Jiangxian,

312
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
the prescription is like the summer,

313
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
one string of zither,

314
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
two strings of zither,

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
one string of peach blossom,

316
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
two strings of zither.

317
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
So,

318
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
it's the peach blossom umbrella made by Yun Yang.

319
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
That's right.

320
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
He found this medicine by accident.

321
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
It can make him...

322
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
This medicine is so magical,

323
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
but it makes you and me feel dizzy.

324
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
It's much smarter than my father's medicine.

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Yun Yang

326
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
The person who wanted to use the peach blossom umbrella to kill Yun Xiu

327
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
was Yun Yang.

328
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Later, he wanted to use my master's letter

329
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
to frame Yan Shiyi for murder.

330
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
In this way, Yun Yang could be acquitted.

331
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
You can still laugh.

332
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Yun Yang is so cunning.

333
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
He didn't think I would do it.

334
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,660
I knew he was going to the

335
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,040
Jixiantang that night.

336
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
So I went there in advance.

337
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I changed the red candle on the candle stand

338
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
into a poisonous candle.

339
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Go away.

340
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Go away.

341
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
And now,

342
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Go away.

343
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm going with Yun Ming.

344
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Go away.

345
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I have evidence that he is not there.

346
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
It's a good way.

347
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
But my master used to use the peach blossom umbrella.

348
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
His purpose

349
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
is just to solve the problem of love.

350
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
But you

351
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
use this peach blossom umbrella

352
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
to kill him.

353
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Yun Xiu failed Lin Jiangxian.

354
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
He died under Lin Jiangxian's peach blossom umbrella.

355
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
He deserves it.

356
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I think your master has a chance.

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
He will also thank me.

358
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
So,

359
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
the Princess and the Princess Consort

360
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
both died under the peach blossom umbrella.

361
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
You killed them both.

362
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
I only admit that I killed them.

363
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Don't blame me for the people I didn't kill.

364
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Yun Ming and I have had enough.

365
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
I know how Yuanfu died.

366
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Yuanfu died?

367
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yun Yang killed him.

368
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
But

369
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
it was the master's birthday.

370
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Who are you?

371
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm telling you.

372
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I'm going to kill you.

373
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
So,

374
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Yuanfu wanted to go back to the capital to report the news.

375
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Yun Xiu was in a hurry.

376
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
So,

377
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
he went to the capital to report the news.

378
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
But he didn't go back.

379
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
So,

380
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
he went to the capital to report the news.

381
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
So,

382
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
he went to the capital to report the news.

383
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm glad I didn't kill him.

384
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
If you didn't kill Yun Yang and the Princess Consort,

385
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
it could only be Yun Yang.

386
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
After all, only you two have the peach blossom umbrella.

387
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Where did you hide the peach blossom umbrella?

388
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
The Seven Stars Donggui in the medicine room.

389
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
There's something you're looking for.

390
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Seven Stars Donggui?

391
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Yun Ming.

392
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
The past is over.

393
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm here to accompany you.

394
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Stop!

395
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Hong Xiao!

396
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Yun Ming.

397
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
People always blame us for being together.

398
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
But I'm not convinced.

399
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I just want to be with you forever.

400
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Today is a good day.

401
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
We haven't been married yet.

402
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Why don't we just be married here?

403
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Okay?

404
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Yun Ming.

405
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Yun Ming.

406
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Yun Ming.

407
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Yun Ming.

408
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
The sword is sharp and the heart is painful.

409
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Time flies and the love is heavy.

410
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
The wind and frost are cold and the snow are cold.

411
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,040
We stand side by side in this world.

412
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I hear the dream and the heart is not old.

413
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
The peach blossom is clear.

414
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,040
The grudge is like a dream.

415
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Only true love can't win.
