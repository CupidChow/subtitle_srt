Sir,

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,580
I heard you kidnapped a guest of mine.

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,680
It's the suspect, right?

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I will kill him.

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Wu Er.

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Poor thing.

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Master.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
The Princess was killed in this Taohua Mountain Village.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Besides the suspect who was caught,

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
do you suspect anyone?

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Master.

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
What do you mean?

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,680
The Princess's family was killed in Taohua Mountain Village.

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Even if they were killed,

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
they wouldn't be able to escape.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
They were all the Princess's family.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Even the servants,

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
many of them watched the Princess grow up.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
How could they hurt her?

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm just asking.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Master.

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I'd like to remind you.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Don't make a mistake

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
by using the grass and wood to frame the loyal.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Seven days later,

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
the Princess will return to the city.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
You can only find out the real murderer in seven days.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Maybe it won't take seven days.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Kneel.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Master.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
The suspect, Ye Shiyi, is here.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
The Princess's family was killed in Taohua Mountain Village.

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Biniang.

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
The person who appeared in the bamboo forest last night,

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
is it him?

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Who are you?

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Come on, let's drink.

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
How about it?

52
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Drink.

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Drink yourself.

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
You smelly drunkard.

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
It's him. It's him.

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Go down.

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Follow me.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Why did you appear in Taohua Mountain Village?

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Master Yun especially appreciates the swordsmanship of our Qingshan Sect.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,680
He asked me to practice swordsmanship with Young Master.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Then why did you appear in the bamboo forest last night?

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I was drunk.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
You were drunk and you wandered around.

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Who knows where you wandered to?

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Why did you kill the Princess?

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Princess?

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Shouldn't the Princess be in the palace?

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Why should I kill her?

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Young Master, shouldn't you be in the palace too?

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
It's been three years.

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
How are you?

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
It's been a few years.

73
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
You've lost weight.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
It's been a few years.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Are you fat, Young Master?

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't call me Young Master.

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
We are enemies now.

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
The enemy is very red.

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Your eyes are not red.

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
They are very red.

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
I've been looking for you for three years.

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
I didn't expect you to be hiding here.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Looking for me?

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
You've been hunting me for three years.

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
But I don't blame you.

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,680
After all, I'm a big bastard who is a bully and a murderer.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
But I came to Taohua Mountain Village.

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm not that bad, right?

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Young Master Yan always kills people with swords.

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
A sword of Qingshan, three phoenix heads.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
The Princess is not injured.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,680
So you didn't kill her.

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Young Master, you know me so well.

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I believe you.

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
But others may not believe you.

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
You're right.

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
How about this?

98
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,680
You can frame me as a murderer.

99
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,680
You can also go back to hand over the order.

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Isn't that a great joy?

101
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
You think I dare not?

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I dream of dying under your sword.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Do it.

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Let's see if it's my neck or your sword.

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I have a thousand reasons to kill you.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
But I won't wrong you.

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
You've never wronged me.

108
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,600
purifying well

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Nana.

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Go. I'll wait for you at the peach tree.

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Sir.

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Bring me the words.

113
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
The murderer killed Liu Ci,

114
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
that's too arrogant.

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
The murderer left the words after he killed,

116
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
obviously he wanted to mislead us.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Someone killed Yu Niang on purpose,

118
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
then hung the body on the tree,

119
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
and left a letter on purpose.

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Yu Niang died of selfishness.

121
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Selfishness?

122
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
I can see that.

123
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Yu Niang took care of the Princess's life.

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
She is a person who can play the flute.

125
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
The flute on this rope

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
is the same as the one on her belt and sachet.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
It should be her habit.

128
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
People's hands are memory.

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Yes.

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
If someone killed her,

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
she wouldn't have to make such a mistake.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
And here.

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
There is mud on Yu Niang's shoe.

134
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
She must have walked on mud before she died.

135
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
And here.

136
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
There is a woman's shoe print on the railing.

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
It should be Yu Niang who climbed the railing before she died,

138
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
then put her head into the red bell,

139
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,680
and hung her body on the railing.

140
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Then she killed herself.

141
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
But I have another question.

142
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
If Yu Niang committed suicide,

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
why did she leave this letter?

144
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,680
It should be another person who left the letter after Yu Niang died.

145
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
It should be someone from Peach Blossom Manor.

146
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
My lord.

147
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Yu Tingxuan, the hero of Peach Blossom Manor,

148
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
wanted to check the body of the Princess

149
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
and asked us to stop her.

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
But

151
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
she said she could check the body.

152
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
She wanted to help?

153
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Is there a trap?

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
It's cloudy here.

155
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Since we can't see clearly from outside,

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
why don't we borrow our eyes?

157
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You two keep the body.

158
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
It's very dangerous here

159
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
if we let go of our eyes.

160
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
The murderer left this sentence,

161
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
the seven years of Peach Blossom Manor,

162
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm afraid it's for us to hear.

163
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Yes.

164
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I heard that the Princess was in the dark.

165
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I also asked the Princess to help

166
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
check the body of the Princess.

167
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Your Highness is a noble person.

168
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
We can't be too rude when we check the body.

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Peach Blossom Manor is a place of early-born birth.

170
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,740
If Yu Niang died because of the

171
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,680
birth of the child,

172
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
there must be some early-born remains in her mouth.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
But there is no impurities in her mouth.

174
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
If Yu Niang died because of the birth of the child,

175
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
the Princess's arm should be

176
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,680
clean and strong.

177
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Her skin is pale and swollen.

178
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
And the Princess's arm is smooth.

179
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It also shows that the Princess didn't die because of the birth of the child.

180
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
You are right.

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Your Highness, look here.

182
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
The skin is fragile.

183
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
The Princess is really beautiful.

184
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
You have already found out?

185
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
The dead body can speak.

186
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
So,

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
when Xiao Ying was murdered,

188
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
she caught the murderer.

189
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Of course she didn't.

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,680
His Majesty ordered us to come to see the Princess.

191
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
But the Princess died in the Peach Blossom Manor

192
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
in just a day.

193
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Many people are still wondering about this case.

194
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
The Princess's personal maid Yu Niang

195
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
died here.

196
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I came here without any other means.

197
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
I need to hurry up

198
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
and tell His Majesty everything.

199
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
It will take seven days

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
to return to the capital.

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
I need to be with the Princess

202
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
for seven days.

203
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I will be back in seven days.

204
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,680
I will be with the Princess for seven days.

205
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
In seven days,

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
the Peach Blossom Manor will give an explanation.

207
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Otherwise,

208
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
you will be

209
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
close to the end of the world.

210
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Your Highness,

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
you are right.

212
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
In seven days,

213
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I must find the murderer

214
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
and punish him.

215
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Lord Han Dao,

216
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
you only have seven days.

217
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
I advise you to hurry up.

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
If you can't solve this case in seven days,

219
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
you and I will die.

220
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
I am not talented,

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
but I can do it.

222
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
But you...

223
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Eunuch,

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
this is a serious matter.

225
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Please stay and be our witness.

226
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
This is a serious matter.

227
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
We can't handle it.

228
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I need to go back to the capital immediately.

229
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Lord Han Dao is alone.

230
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
He is just a big knife.

231
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
He is not a big deal.

232
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,680
But you have to think for your brothers.

233
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,680
They are all from the Jiuzu family.

234
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Please do it yourself.

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Come in.

236
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Next.

237
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Uncle He,

238
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
you are here.

239
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Don't go.

240
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
What are you doing?

241
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
You are not going to investigate the murderer

242
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
after the death of the Princess.

243
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
You are just watching the body in our manor.

244
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
You are so impulsive.

245
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
You don't want to cooperate with us.

246
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Do you have any objection?

247
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Nonsense.

248
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Or you are the murderer?

249
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Who are you talking about?

250
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Stop talking nonsense.

251
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Then please.

252
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Please what?

253
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I am just watching.

254
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Lord Han Dao has ordered

255
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
everyone in the manor has to investigate.

256
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
There is no exception.

257
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Lord Han Dao has ordered?

258
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
You are mistaken.

259
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
This is the Chaohua Manor.

260
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I am in charge here.

261
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
I am in charge.

262
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
What?

263
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay, okay, okay.

264
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Calm down.

265
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Please calm down.

266
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
It's just to make it easier to investigate.

267
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
You can't do this.

268
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Okay, okay, okay.

269
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
No, no, no.

270
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
The owner said

271
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
everyone in the manor has to cooperate.

272
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Go, go, go.

273
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Go.

274
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
We will go first.

275
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
We will go first.

276
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Go, go, go.

277
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Please.

278
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
I am telling you.

279
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,680
I will give Lord Han Dao a good time.

280
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Go.

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Please don't blame me.

282
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Don't blame me.

283
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Take off.

284
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
No, Junior Brother.

285
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Do you really think

286
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
that I have an affair with the Princess Consort?

287
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
The four seasons have been full of pain.

288
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Now it's piled up in the wall.

289
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,680
The sky is still clear.

290
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,680
The peach blossoms are hard to bloom.

291
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,680
The grudge is like a cloud.

292
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Only true love can't be destroyed.

293
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
The five seasons have been full of pain.

294
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Now it's piled up in the wall.

295
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
The sky is still clear.

296
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,680
The peach blossoms are hard to bloom.

297
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
The grudge is like a cloud.

298
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Only true love can't be destroyed.

299
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,680
The peach blossoms are hard to bloom.

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
The grudge is like a cloud.

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Only true love can't be destroyed.
