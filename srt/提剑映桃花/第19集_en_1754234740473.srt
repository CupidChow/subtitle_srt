1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
He's the only one left.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,200
Why did he do that?

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,080
What if I say

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,000
Yun Qingxuan is not from the Yun family?

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
I checked the account just now.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,240
Yun Qingxuan and Yun Qiaoying

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,160
might have been bought into Taohua Villa.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,000
When?

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,320
Seven years ago.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Seven years ago?

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,440
Taohua Villa?

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Are the four women who were alive

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
still alive?

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,400
What if it's not four, but six?

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
I saw a list of names

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,880
on the old account book seven years ago.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
Six of them were alive,

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,440
and one thousand and two hundred taels of silver.

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,200
What kind of living beings are they?

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
They're so valuable.

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,120
If two of them were alive,

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,960
it would be Yun Qiaoying and Yun Qingxuan.

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
If Yun Qiaoying died,

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
would Yun Qingxuan have no motive to kill?

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,040
If that's the case,

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,920
the Taohua Festival in Taohua Villa

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,240
is a revenge of a meticulous plan.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,620
Yes.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,600
My Lady.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,160
My Lady.

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,680
My Lady.

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,700
My...

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Huh?

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
It's the Peach Blossom Umbrella.

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
It's the Peach Blossom Festival again.

53
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
The King of Gu told us that the four women

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
who were alive and dead

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,880
were the only ones who hid Yun Qing Xuan and Yun Xiao Ying.

56
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Sir, Uncle He wants to see you.

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
He framed you for killing Yun Xiu,

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
and framed me for killing Yun Yang.

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Why is he here?

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
He's very cunning.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Let's meet him.

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Let him in.

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Yes.

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Young Master,

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
congratulations to Young Master Yan.

66
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
You've got rid of the suspicion.

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Let me ask you.

68
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Did you steal my nine-tongued deer?

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,880
I should say that I was the one who stole it before Young Master was born.

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Are you still an adult?

71
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Now that Young Master is dead,

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I don't have to work for him anymore.

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Why did you frame me for killing Yun Yang?

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Sir,

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
you're wrong.

76
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
When Young Master was dead,

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
I arrived at the crime scene,

78
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
and there was only you standing there.

79
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
I thought you were suspicious.

80
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
This is reasonable suspicion.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Why are you slandering me?

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
You're sharp-tongued.

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Tell me.

84
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
What do you want?

85
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I came here to apologize to you.

86
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
You have a grudge against Yun Xiu.

87
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I understand that you're against Yun Yang.

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
But the masters of Peach Blossom Manor

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
are all dead.

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Only you're left.

91
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
What do you want now?

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Sir,

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
what you said is a little strange.

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
The masters are all dead.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,880
What does it have to do with us servants?

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
If it has to do with me,

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
it means that I shouldn't have died.

98
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
I should have survived.

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
But I think

100
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
if you survive,

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,880
it's a suspicion.

102
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
I can live until now.

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
It's a mistake.

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
It doesn't mean I'm a bad person.

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Then tell me.

106
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Who do you think

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
the Princess Consort and the Lady of the First Rank killed?

108
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
How would I know?

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Sir,

110
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
to be honest,

111
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,880
I didn't understand one thing.

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Look at Hong Xiu.

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
He's with Yun Ming.

114
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Why did he kill Yun Yang?

115
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
He was a little tough

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
when he was alive.

117
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
But in my heart,

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
he's a good man.

119
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
In your eyes,

120
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Yun Yang is a good man.

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
You're here

122
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
not just to tell us

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
that Yun Yang is a good man in your heart, right?

124
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm here

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,880
to give you a clue.

126
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
These two people

127
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
are one person.

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
I'm here.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Sir,

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
something's wrong with Gu Weng.

131
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
This is the account book

132
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
he made himself.

133
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Three years ago,

134
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
he came to the manor

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
and started from the accountant.

136
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
He was a high-ranking man

137
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
until this year.

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Three years ago?

139
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
When exactly?

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Spring.

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
What's wrong?

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Check it out.

143
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Was it before the Princess came to the palace

144
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
or after?

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
It was after the Princess came to the palace.

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
She came here a year ago.

147
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
I remember that Gu Weng told me.

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
The Princess treated me well.

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I don't want her to die.

150
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
But if she came after she came to the palace,

151
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
the Princess hasn't been back for years.

152
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
How can she be treated well?

153
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Unless Gu Weng came to the manor three years ago.

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
The records on it are all fake.

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Maybe

156
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Gu Weng

157
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
is pretending to be a man.

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Jiang Wu,

159
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,880
what's the real name of Gu Weng?

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Jiang Ji.

161
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Jiang Ji?

162
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
It's Gu Hongyi.

163
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
That's right.

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
So...

165
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Look.

166
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,880
The word Hong in Gu Hongyi

167
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
means deep and wide.

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
It's the same as the word Jiang.

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,880
And Ji can be broken into Gu Hongyi.

170
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
So Jiang Ji is Gu Hongyi.

171
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Why did you kill Yun Qingxuan?

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
He's not dead.

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
It's not the time to kill him.

174
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm going to go in.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
The life has ended.

176
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
You are safe.

177
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
The palace chose the girl

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
and gave her the place of the Peach Blossom Manor.

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Don't worry.

180
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
The Zhuangzhu has promised to raise you.

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Three years later,

182
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
they will let you go to the girl.

183
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
That means you are safe these years.

184
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
to join the Xiu Nu.

185
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,380
That means you'll be safe for the next few years.

186
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,080
Who are you?

187
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm the master of this manor.

188
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll teach you to play the zither and calligraphy in the future.

189
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,880
Remember,

190
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
the one who dies will be the one who lives.

191
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
The one who dies will be the one who lives.

192
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,880
There's no need for words.

193
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
You've been studying since you were a kid.

194
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,880
Why did you make mistakes in calligraphy?

195
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,380
I made a mistake

196
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,380
and lost my love for the moonlight.

197
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,380
That's why I was punished by you.

198
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,380
The sun is shining, the flowers are blooming.

199
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,380
The flowers are floating, the water is flowing.

200
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
One kind of love is like two kinds of hatred.

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
This love is irreplaceable.

202
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,880
The love is so beautiful, but it's so sad.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
What's your favorite line?

204
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,880
There's a line.

205
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Eight words

206
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
mean happiness in the world.

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I can't fully understand it.

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
But I think

209
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,880
this is the best love in the world.

210
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,880
Then teach me.

211
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
The night is smiling, the flowers are blooming.

212
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,880
What a beautiful line.

213
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,880
The moon is full of the west building.

214
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
This line should be written on the lantern.

215
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,380
I'm so happy to see it every day.

216
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Okay, I'll make one for you.

217
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,380
Thank you.

218
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,380
Why don't you look at me?

219
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,380
Miss, you're a noble lady now.

220
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
You'll be a concubine in the future.

221
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm just a teacher.

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
I don't dare to beat you.

223
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,880
I don't want to be a concubine.

224
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
I just want to...

225
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
When the moon is full of the west building,

226
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,880
I'll be waiting for you.

227
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
If you don't come, I'll wait.

228
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I can't forget you.

229
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

230
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Where did Mr. Zhang go?

231
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Miss, what did you say you were waiting for?

232
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I said

233
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I said I waited for you to wake up.

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
It's because of you

235
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
that Mr. Zhang left.

236
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I can't forget you.

237
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

238
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

239
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

240
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

241
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

242
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

243
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

244
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

245
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

246
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

247
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

248
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

250
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

251
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

252
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

253
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
You can hold me.

254
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

255
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I'll hold you in my heart.

256
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,380
I'll hold you in my heart.

257
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
I'll hold you in my heart.
