Episode 16

2
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Ye Xunyi!

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
You're from Yunyang?

4
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800
What did Yunyang give you?

5
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,240
I can't stand you anymore!

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Tell me, who are you?

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
It's you.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
Your master and I are in love.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,840
I treat you like my own disciple.

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Stay.

11
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,160
I can cure your illness.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,400
If you didn't

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
kill my master,

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,800
my master wouldn't have died!

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Deity,

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
you killed your master yourself.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Do you remember?

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
It was me.

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,800
I killed my master myself.

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,080
I killed my master.

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
You're really my good disciple.

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Master.

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Master, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Master.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,640
No one said you killed my master.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,480
You're a traitor.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,360
You're a traitor of Qingshan Sect.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,240
You're still a dog in Yunyang.

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
You lied to me.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,160
I'll kill you today!

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,560
You hate me the most in my life!

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
If you die under my blade,

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,640
I'll call you Master!

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,920
You won't die today!

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Deity,

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240

Sorry.

93
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Sir. Sir. Sir.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Save him. Save him.

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Sir.

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Han Dao, are you feeling better?

97
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Sir. Sir. Sir.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Sir, it's me.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Sir, wake up. Sir.

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
It's Bai Huo. Sir.

101
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
It's Bai Huo. Sir.

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It's Bai Huo. Sir.

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
It's Bai Huo. Sir.

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
It's Bai Huo. Sir.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Sir. Sir.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Sir, are you alright?

107
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Where's Yan Shiyi?

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
It's Young Master Yan who hurt you.

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Yan Shiyi is now a criminal.

110
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
He broke my order

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
to arrest Yan Shiyi.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Is he a prisoner?

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
No matter what.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Yes. Yes.

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
You saved me.

116
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I can only save you for a moment.

117
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Life and death are predestined.

118
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
It would be great if I could die

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
under the knife of my junior brother.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
But I just saw your pulse.

121
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
You obviously have a desire to live.

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm not done yet.

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Then your heart

124
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
is related to Han Dao.

125
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
The truth is not known yet.

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I can't die yet.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
But what do you want,

128
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
what do you want?

129
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I can't see it clearly.

130
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
What I want is the same as you.

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
It's also a truth.

132
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I want to know who killed my sister.

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I also want to know

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
what is your relationship

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
with my elder brother.

136
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Did you see it clearly?

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
No.

138
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
So today

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I took your junior brother

140
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
to see it together.

141
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
My brother is good at the art of meeting people.

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I secretly investigated you

143
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
to know if you are his dog.

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Since you think I'm from Yunyang,

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
why did you save me?

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I don't understand

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
why you, a dying person,

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
would do that.

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Maybe

150
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
you have your own purpose.

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Because I want to live.

152
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
At first,

153
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Master Yun tried all kinds of methods

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
but failed to save me.

155
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Then Yunyang wanted to control me.

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
He wanted me to be an enemy of Master Yun.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
He told me that he had a medicine

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
that could cure my spleen and spleen.

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you know

160
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
what medicine he gave you?

161
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I tried to take a shot.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
At first,

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
my body and condition were getting better.

164
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
But then I had a hallucination.

165
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I don't know if it's because of my body

166
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
or because of the medicine.

167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
You said you were here to ask for medicine.

168
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I think the death of these people

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
is related to the medicine of Yunyang.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
So

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
you tried the medicine yourself?

172
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Anyway,

173
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm also a dying person.

174
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
But after I took the medicine,

175
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm sure

176
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
that the medicine will make people hallucinate.

177
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I almost died

178
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
and almost killed Han Dao.

179
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
What are you going to do next?

180
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I have to tell the truth to Junior Brother.

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Do you think he will still be alive?

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Believe me?

183
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
He won't believe me.

184
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
But he will believe you.

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Why?

186
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Come in.

187
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Miss.

188
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Lord Han Dao.

189
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Do you need me to treat you?

190
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
No need.

191
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I can't die.

192
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,240
When you were fighting with the doctor,

193
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
did you find anything suspicious?

194
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
He seems to have fallen into a kind of hallucination.

195
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
He was poisoned.

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Poisoned?

197
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Did Yunyang poison him?

198
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
To be precise,

199
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
he poisoned himself.

200
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
He told you all this?

201
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
The poison that Yan Shiyi was poisoned with

202
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
was the same as my sister,

203
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Yunyang, and my father.

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
It seems to be the same.

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
But maybe he took too little

206
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
and it's not enough to kill him.

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Lord,

208
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
why did Yan Shiyi do this?

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
And for whom?

210
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Maybe you can think about it.

211
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Did you save him?

212
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
I've brought the painting.

213
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
As for what to do,

214
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
you can decide by yourself.

215
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Young Master Yan,

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
are you okay?

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
What did he say?

218
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
I told him everything I should.

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
But it's his business whether he believes it or not.

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Don't worry.

221
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Sit down.

222
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Thank you, Miss.

223
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Eat this.

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
It can relieve your pain.

225
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
At least you'll feel better.

226
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
But

227
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
death

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
may not be the worst ending.

229
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
It's a kind of relief.

230
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
To live

231
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
is a punishment

232
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
for someone.

233
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Many years ago,

234
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
someone told me

235
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
to live

236
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
until the next life.

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
But after so many years,

238
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,240
I found something different.

239
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
It seems to be

240
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,240
the person you hate.

241
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Maybe he died before you

242
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
before the next life.

243
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
He doesn't even need you.

244
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,240
The things you want,

245
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,240
even the things you want to sacrifice,

246
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
may be the same.

247
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,240
The most important thing in life

248
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
is not to fight with fate.

249
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
It's what you want.

250
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Since you've made your own destiny,

251
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
what else do you want?

252
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
I

253
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
want to escape from Lord Yan.

254
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I want to live.

255
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
I

256
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
can live for days.

257
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
You want to live,

258
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
but you want to live.

259
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
You want to escape from Lord Yan.

260
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Now,

261
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
even if the gods of the land come,

262
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
they can't save you.

263
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
But you

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
have a way,

265
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
right?

266
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
I have a way

267
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
to let you live for days.

268
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
But the process is very painful.

269
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I don't care.

270
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Please save me.

271
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Lord Yan,

272
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
what are you doing?

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I need to investigate.

274
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
I need your cooperation.

275
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
What if I don't cooperate?

276
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Then don't blame me for being polite.

277
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Lord Han Dao,

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm here to help you.

279
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm here to help you.

280
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I'm here to help you.

281
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Lord Han Dao,

282
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
why are you in such a hurry?

283
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I know what you're looking for.

284
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
You must know the handwriting on it.

285
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Lin Jiangxian is your master and Yan Shiyi's master.

286
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
So it's Lin Jiangxian.

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,240
This is the letter Lin Jiangxian and my father wrote.

288
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,240
It mentioned a peach blossom umbrella that could make people's hearts flutter.

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
It was made by your master Lin Jiangxian.

290
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Young Master,

291
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
don't try to kill me.

292
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Yan Shiyi's slander is caused by my father.

293
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,240
So I came to Peach Blossom Villa to avenge my master.

294
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
How?

295
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
By using Lin Jiangxian's poison,

296
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,240
the peach blossom umbrella killed my sister and my father.

297
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
It's you who poisoned Yan Shiyi.

298
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
You're wrong.

299
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I gave him the medicine of Peach Blossom Villa.

300
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
It's for his life.

301
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Yan Shiyi is my dog.

302
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm good to dogs.

303
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
But he bit me.

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Now he's trying to frame me by eating peach blossom umbrella.

305
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Lord Han Dao,

306
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
don't you understand?

307
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
The murderer you've been investigating is your senior brother, Yan Shiyi.

308
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I'd like to see if you'll do justice to him.

309
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
If Yan Shiyi is the murderer,

310
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I won't let him go.

311
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
But if someone wants to frame Zhongliang,

312
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
I won't let him go.

313
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Okay, let's wait and see.

314
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
I think you should have the answer in this letter.

315
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
The heart is in pain in the middle of the road.

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Time is passing by.

317
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,240
The wind, frost and rain are all gone.

318
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
We stand side by side in the battlefield.

319
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
I dream of the old days.

320
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,240
The peach blossoms are in full bloom.

321
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,240
The grudge is like a dream.

322
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Only true love can't win.
