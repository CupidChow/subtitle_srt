Episode 16

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,000
Before the case is cleared,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,200
everyone in Peach Blossom Manor

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,160
has a secret.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,120
Including you, Miss.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,000
Until today,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,160
I think

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,000
you're capable of finding out

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,560
the murderer who killed my sister.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,600
Only by being confused by these appearances

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,760
can you see the Peach Blossom Manor clearly.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,400
And everyone in the manor

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
is not as simple as it looks.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,800
Including

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,520
Mr. Yan.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,720
If you know anything,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
just tell me.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,400
That day, Yan Shiyi and I

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,440
were in the Peach Blossom Manor

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,680
to restore the truth of the case.

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,840
I found that his blood

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
was poisoned.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,280
And this poison...

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,400
Many years ago,

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,880
I had seen it on a man.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
The moon is so beautiful today.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
Why do you light a lamp?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
There are fireflies.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,520
I'll send them home.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,000
They're fireflies.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Do you need to light a lamp?

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,120
The grass is covered in mud and flies into the fireflies.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I don't want to make the grass

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,160
the last contribution.

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
To be honest,

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
the people in Peach Blossom Manor are really strange.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
I've never seen anyone

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
who is as good as you.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm so happy

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,360
that everyone is playing with me today.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Mr. Yan,

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
I have another secret.

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
You must want to solve it.

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,600
Okay.

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Tell me.

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,520
I went to the bamboo forest

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
that night when the Princess was killed.

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,440
This is the elixir

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
made by His Majesty.

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,320
It's rare.

52
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,960
I stole it from you.

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
If I let it go,

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,920
I don't know how to explain it.

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,160
You're the Princess.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
Even if something happens,

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,480
His Majesty won't blame you.

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Xiaoying,

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
don't forget.

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,160
If it weren't for me,

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,560
you would have died seven years ago.

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
You can still live to this day

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,640
and still be a phoenix.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Isn't that the blessing I gave you?

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
You can't forget it.

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I dare not forget it.

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
It's good that you know.

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,600
But...

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
It's not just that.

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't forget

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,080
your sister is still in Peach Blossom Hill.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,520
Many years ago,

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,720
a beautiful girl was selected from the palace.

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
The one who was chosen was the First Miss,

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,600
Yun Qingxuan.

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,320
But the First Miss already had a new lover.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
That was the Second Master

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
who invited the two young ladies to hand over the book,

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,360
Gu Hongyi.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,880
The First Miss and Gu Hongyi

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,920
were in love and had a secret relationship.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
After the Master found out,

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
he was very angry

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,400
and locked Gu Hongyi up.

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,520
Young Master

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,600
tortured Gu Hongyi for many times.

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
The First Miss forced him to die and refused to enter the palace.

88
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,400
At that time, Gu Hongyi

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,520
wasn't as fierce as the First Miss.

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,040
She didn't keep her feelings from them.

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
Later,

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,000
I went to the dungeon of Peach Blossom Hill.

93
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
But he...

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,640
Sir! Sir!

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,800
Sir!

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,840
I didn't see you there recently,

97
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,440
but you're really handsome.

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Eat it.

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,920
You mean

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
this poison can control people's mind?

101
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes.

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
And this poison

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,880
was made by my brother.

104
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,560
I don't know why

105
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,000
Yan Shaoxia was poisoned.

106
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
I don't know if it's related to my brother.

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,680
But I'm sure that

108
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,520
the person who was poisoned

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,120
will not be controlled by himself

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,440
by his behavior and consciousness.

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
If it's true,

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,720
Yan Shi will die under my knife.

113
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,960
Goodbye.

114
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
After the First Miss found out, she was sad

115
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
and wanted to kill herself.

116
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
The Second Miss came to her

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
and said she was willing to help her.

118
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
So

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
Yun Xiu found out that they were sisters.

120
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,400
So she used the name of Yun Qingxuan

121
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
to make the Princess take the elixir from the palace

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,840
and use it.

123
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,040
The Princess and Yun Xiu

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
met and then they were in love.

125
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,560
There must be something wrong with it.

126
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
But there's one thing I don't understand.

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
Yun Xiu is your master.

128
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Why did you betray her?

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,080
The Princess treated me badly.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
I don't want her to die.

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
Then why don't you

132
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,320
tell Han Dao directly about these clues?

133
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
I don't trust her.

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Then you trust me?

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,240
I trust you.

136
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,080
Why?

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Because you are the one who will die.

138
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,560
People know that

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,280
death is good for their words and deeds.

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,040
Heaven's Instead

141
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,320
Ma Has the God of War

142
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Junior Brother Zi final,

143
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
I hope you will help me.

144
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,320
You remember

145
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
how much Master taught you?

146
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,880
Of course I remember

147
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
what Master taught me.

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Then I don't need to stay.

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:08:13,180
Hide the darts from the

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,440
other sea spirits.

151
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
I told you.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
My life is yours.

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
But you're too impatient.

154
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,760
You can't wait until the truth comes out.

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,200
Why don't you use this sword

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,280
to dig out my heart and see

157
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,280
if it's true or not?

158
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
Can I believe

159
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
what you said?

160
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,440
I've said it many times.

161
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,120
What you see

162
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,560
and hear

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
may not be true.

164
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,640
Only with this feeling,

165
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,720
you can't fool me.

166
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,960
I hid your heart

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,960
and you still believed me.

168
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,880
You're a person

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,240
who thinks he's the best.

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
You never understand

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
what you're saying.

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
Junior,

173
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
in this world,

174
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,960
in this crowd,

175
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
many words

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
are not clear.

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,440
If you want to say it,

178
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,960
what words are not clear for three years?

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
You don't believe me.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,560
What's the point of saying it?

181
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,880
If I don't believe you,

182
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,400
I won't keep this.

183
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,240
The fire of life

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,600
has been on for a lifetime.

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
The fire of life has been on for a lifetime.

186
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
The fire of life has been on for a lifetime.

187
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,960
The fire of life has been on for a lifetime.

188
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,360
The fire of life has been on for a lifetime.

189
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,160
Give me the prescription of Qingshan Sect

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,560
and I'll let you go.

191
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
The things of Qingshan Sect

192
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,080
can't be given to you,

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
you pigs.

194
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
You're tough.

195
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't blame us for being mean.

196
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,800
Go.

197
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't want to be hurt by this love.

198
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
My love

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:35,700
is beyond

200
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,460
Go!

201
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,540
Go!

202
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,820
Junior.

203
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,700
Junior.

204
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,700
Wake up.

205
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
You can't sleep if you want to.

206
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,100
It won't hurt later.

207
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,020
Senior.

208
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,140
Senior.

209
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,100
Senior.

210
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,780
It's cold.

211
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,220
Senior.

212
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Will I die here?

213
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,460
No.

214
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,300
No.

215
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,420
Trust me.

216
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,180
Trust me.

217
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,740
Even if I die,

218
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
I won't let you die here.

219
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,460
Then I'll die with you.

220
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,980
Junior.

221
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,180
Don't talk.

222
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,700
It's not that easy.

223
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,100
Junior.

224
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,220
Junior!

225
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,660
It's okay.

226
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,220
It's okay.

227
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,500
It's okay.

228
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
I just want to ask you one thing.

229
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,340
Did you kill Master?

230
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,180
Yes.

231
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,820
Master wants to kill you.

232
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,100
If I don't do it,

233
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
you'll die.

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,020
Junior.

235
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,100
I only told you this for the last time.

236
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,220
If you don't believe me,

237
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,060
I have nothing to say to you.

238
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,540
Don't move.

239
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,540
Have a seat.

240
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,100
All you have to do

241
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,740
is to see that

242
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,620
I will never hurt you.

243
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,300
Put this away.

244
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,180
Gao Qiang,

245
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,540
go to another place.
