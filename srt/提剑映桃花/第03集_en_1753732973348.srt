1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
The Agriculture hairs

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Take off this cloth

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,240
No bro

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,180
Would you really think

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
that important ัะต William and Mrs. Huang met

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,300
Didn't you teach me

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
if you have dignity when you declare what you have function

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,680
what good have I done

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,680
Did you wrap it clearly

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,320
Go on.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,680
Go on.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,480
You're going too far.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,320
You're taking advantage of the plant mutation.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Should I take it off or not?

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Take it off.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,800
How could I not take it off?

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
You've seen it before.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,400
What?

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,520
Are you scared?

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
Who's scared?

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
People are born with their own fears.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,880
What's there to be scared of?

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,800
I...

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm scared.

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,920
Turn around.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,800
Look carefully, Junior.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Come on.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,120
Look.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
Did I take off your shoes?

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,440
Take a good look.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Are you done?

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
You're so hasty in your judgment.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,160
Now you can tell I'm not the murderer?

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,120
Junior,

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,800
sometimes people

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,520
don't see what's real.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,800
What do you want to say?

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,840
I told you before

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,400
that vision isn't always real.

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,600
And hearing isn't always true.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,760
You have to feel it

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,040
with your ears.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Think about it.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,480
You...

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Are you sick?

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
You're the one who's sick.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Junior,

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
what are you doing?

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Shut up.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,960
What disease do I have?

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,000
My heart is so damaged.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Why don't you go to the doctor?

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,760
Life and death are predestined.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,800
I've seen it before.

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,520
Life?

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,200
I don't believe in life.

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,160
Junior,

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,120
you haven't changed at all.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,840
There aren't many people who haven't changed in this world.

60
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
I came to this Peach Blossom Manor earlier than you.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,680
For the plants and trees here,

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
the mountains and rocks,

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
and even the people here,

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm more familiar with them than you.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,160
I can help you.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,360
How about it?

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
You only have seven days.

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
One day is almost over.

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll take it as a yes if you don't talk.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,440
Then we can have a good time together.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
But before that,

72
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
we have to have a drink.

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,600
You haven't changed much either.

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,560
You only care about what's in front of you.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
You haven't changed.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,400
I don't dare to change.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Open it.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,240
Zuo Lian can't trap you, can he?

79
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Oh, no.

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,360
My Lord,

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,920
everyone in the manor has checked.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,840
No one has been caught.

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
But some people are not easy to check.

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
I'll figure out the rest.

85
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,040
The Master's Yard

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,760
What is this again?

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,600
Looking at the deserts, we have to go to the west.

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,960
You're right.

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,800
My Lady...

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
You did find the right direction.

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,120
But you didn't find the formation of the bamboo forest.

93
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,440
I was right.

94
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,720
The bamboo forest is a bit strange.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Every bamboo in the bamboo forest

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,560
is centered in the direction of the shield of the Qi Gate.

97
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,440
If you don't find the formation,

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,200
you'll be trapped.

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
The only one who can find the formation

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,720
is the Yun family of the Peach Blossom Manor.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,560
So,

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
you're going to take me in?

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes.

104
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
So, the reason you came

105
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,120
must be to investigate the death of the Princess.

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
I won't let my sister die.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,520
I have to do something.

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,520
But Mr. Yan has been taken in.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,360
But he's here now.

110
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,040
It seems that Mr. Yan and Mr. Han Dao

111
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,760
are close friends.

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
Mr. Han Dao is my junior.

113
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Besides, he always wants to kill me,

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
we're really lucky.

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,800
Your grudges have nothing to do with me.

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Since we have the same goal,

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,960
follow me.

118
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
I just walked this way.

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,160
Young Master Yan, follow me.

120
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,440
Ying was killed here.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,800
He was afraid of the Peach Blossom Manor since he was a child.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Why did he appear in the water?

123
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
He was afraid of the Peach Blossom Manor.

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Why did he appear in the water?

125
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,600
Unless someone forced him.

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,560
He has no wounds on his body.

127
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
And look here.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,960
There are no signs of struggle.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,400
There may be one way to force him.

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
What do you mean?

131
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,080
Think about it.

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
Is there any way

133
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,200
to get rid of his fear of the water?

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Dream or poison?

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Yu Niang died of selfishness.

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,120
I think she must have been poisoned by the poison.

137
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,640
But...

138
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,120
Miss, think about it.

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
The murderer poisoned her.

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
The poison of the Princess was strong.

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
She caught the murderer in the struggle.

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Young Master Yan,

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
you are in a hurry.

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
It seems that you are in a bad mood.

145
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
You are very skilled.

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
I didn't expect you to use the bridge

147
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
to beat the little brother who has used half of his pulse.

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm not a good person.

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm not a good person.

150
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,120
You have used half of your pulse.

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Young Master Yan.

152
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Young Master Yan.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Are you all right, Young Master Yan?

154
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Young Master Yan, do you find anything?

155
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
No.

156
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
There are no water plants or squid in the water.

157
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Young Master Yan.

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
You are not afraid of the peach blossom knot?

159
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Really, Yan Yan?

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
It's all a game of chance.

161
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
How can you risk the lives of the living

162
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
with the death of a few dead people?

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
This is my world.

164
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
You don't have to fear anything.

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,120
What kind of world is a small peach blossom mountain villa?

166
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I didn't expect your eyes to be so sharp.

167
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Yan Yan.

169
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
What are you doing in my room?

170
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Are you going to investigate the case

171
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
or to play in the water?

172
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Of course I'm going to play in the water.

173
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
You...

174
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
You are a leisurely man.

175
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm in the peach blossom village.

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm going to play in the water.

177
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
You...

178
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
You are a leisurely man.

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm in the peach blossom village.

180
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I found an important clue at the bottom of the lake.

181
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Do you want to know?

182
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
What clue?

183
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Go get some clean clothes.

184
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Okay.

185
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Young Master Yan, you are so good.

186
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
There are scratches on Yunyang's back.

187
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
He is suspicious.

188
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
But scratches are not an iron evidence.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
He can totally deduce that it was Hong Xiu who scratched him.

190
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I found it at the bottom of the lake.

191
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't know if it's a pendant or an ornament.

192
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
It looks like a girl's dance.

193
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,120
You took the clue I finally got?

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Give or not give.

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Call Senior Brother to listen.

196
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Don't force me to kill you now.

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
It's boring.

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
It's not fun when you are young.

199
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Boring.

200
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Here.

201
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
What is this?

202
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
The medicine for heart protection.

203
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Then...

204
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
You didn't poison me, right?

205
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I don't need to poison you.

206
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't worry.

207
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,120
We will settle this after this is solved.

208
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Okay.

209
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Tell me.

210
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
What did you find?

211
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
The medicine for heart protection.

212
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
This was found when we were testing the body.

213
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
From the mouth of the Princess.

214
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
The white hair.

215
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Yunxiu's.

216
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
So,

217
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
the suspect is not only Yunyang.

218
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
There are also Yunxiu and the owner of this pendant.

219
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
It seems that the night before the death of the Princess,

220
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
the one who saw her was not only Yunyang.

221
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
But also Yunyang.

222
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Yunyang.

223
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Yunyang.

224
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Yunyang.

225
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Yunyang.

226
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Yunyang.

227
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Yunyang.

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Yunyang.

229
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Yunyang.

230
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Yunyang.

231
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Yunyang.

232
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Yunyang.

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Yunyang.

234
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Yunyang.

235
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Yunyang.

236
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Yunyang.

237
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Yunyang.

238
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Yunyang.

239
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Yunyang.

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Yunyang.

241
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Yunyang.

242
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Yunyang.

243
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Yunyang.

244
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Yunyang.

245
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Yunyang.

246
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Yunyang.

247
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Yunyang.

248
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Yunyang.

249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Yunyang.

250
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Yunyang.

251
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Yunyang.

252
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Yunyang.

253
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Yunyang.

254
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Cheng resisted in MIKE'S god-sister,

255
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,620
The Zhuge Ling.

256
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Mo Akizaki,

257
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Martial rages,

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
and the declared moons of Yunyang.
