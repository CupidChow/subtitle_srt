1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Councillor of glorious

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,200
Are you ready?

3
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,560
Go to the back!

4
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,260
Take him away!

5
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,500
Playing the talker!

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,300
You

7
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,940
Oh

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Father.

9
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Wu Er has recovered.

10
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Father's health has improved.

11
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,300
He looks much younger than before.

12
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,300
No wonder His Majesty always praises Your Highness.

13
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
She is a lady of grace,

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,300
and she is as beautiful as a fairy.

15
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Father.

16
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Father.

17
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Your Highness.

18
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,300
What are you doing with your sad face?

19
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
I'm testing the medicine for the master.

20
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
It's your good fortune.

21
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Look.

22
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
Don't move.

23
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
That's beautiful.

24
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Come on.

25
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
So pretty.

26
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
Let me see.

27
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Go inside.

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
No.

29
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Let me go.

30
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Let me go.

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
No.

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Let me out.

33
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Let me out.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Let me out.

35
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
No.

36
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Xiao Yang.

37
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Brother.

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Why are you here?

39
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm waiting for you to come back.

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
It's me.

41
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Get up.

49
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Get up.

50
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
You deserve to be punished.

51
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Kneel.

52
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Kneel.

55
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Yuan Fu.

56
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm here.

57
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
What time is it?

58
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Your Highness.

59
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
It's time to kill.

60
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Yun Ning.

61
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes.

62
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
You may leave.

63
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
You don't need to serve us tonight.

64
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm tired.

65
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I want to stay here tonight.

66
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Yes.

67
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
It's not safe outside.

68
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Yes.

69
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Yes.

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
You don't need to serve us.

78
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Yuan Fu, let them all go.

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

80
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Your Highness.

81
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
I'm here.

82
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm here.

83
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Your Highness.

84
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,360
Women, watch out.

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,500
ì•¼?!

86
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,820
Who's the princess?

87
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,340
Where is she now?

88
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,640
The princess.

89
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,880
Where is she?!

90
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,260
Over there.

91
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,540
Your Highness.

92
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,340
Your Highness.

93
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,500
What happened?

94
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Your Highness.

95
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,260
We're doomed.

96
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,980
We're doomed.

97
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,220
Your Highness.

98
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,420
Xuan Wu, Bai Hu.

99
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,140
Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,540
The Princess Consort is being killed.

101
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,900
Lock her up immediately.

102
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,540
No one is to leave the palace.

103
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,660
Yes, Your Highness.

104
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,820
Your Highness.

105
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,060
Your Highness.

106
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,660
Your Highness.

107
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,500
Your Highness.

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,660
Your Highness.

109
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,900
Please, Your Highness.

110
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,500
What's going on?

111
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,220
Your Highness.

112
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,420
Why is the Princess Consort here?

113
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Your Excellency, I don't know.

114
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,260
The Princess Consort

115
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,220
needed us to leave early yesterday.

116
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,420
She said she wanted to rest early.

117
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,580
Your Highness.

118
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,460
Last night...

119
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Last night, I saw Her Highness

120
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,940
coming out alone.

121
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,300
I was worried about her safety.

122
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,060
I followed her to the bamboo forest.

123
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,100
But I got lost.

124
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,980
Then why did you

125
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,300
appear outside the bamboo forest?

126
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,260
I saw the silver man

127
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,780
coming out of the forest.

128
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,180
I don't know how I fainted.

129
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,540
Who was it?

130
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,340
A drunkard.

131
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,340
Your Highness.

132
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,340
How can I live without you?

133
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,140
reet.

134
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:58,420
meet me?

135
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,100
He seems familiar.

136
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,220
Check who it is.

137
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Ye Shiyi.

138
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Who called me?

139
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
What's up?

140
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Are you here, Haohua Village?

141
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Take them all!

142
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Ye Shiyi.

143
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
Ye Shiyi.

144
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Ye Shiyi.
