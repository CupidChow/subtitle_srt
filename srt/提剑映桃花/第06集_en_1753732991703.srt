1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You just wouldn't listen to me.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I told you

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that I'm the only one who truly loves you.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You wouldn't dare leave me.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Staying in Peach Blossom Manor

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is better than staying in the palace.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's wrong with the Peach Blossom Manor?

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To you,

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Peach Blossom Manor is the world.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But to us women,

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it's the old man's house.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You said it's the old man's house.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Look at her.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She did leave the Peach Blossom Manor, but what happened after?

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She died.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She was lying here in a cold place.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Her body would rot if she died.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What could she do after she died?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can't escape from this fate.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I left something

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that could make you leave the Peach Blossom Manor for the time being.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can go wherever you want.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can go wherever you want.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What did you give me?

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What do you think?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What did Yun Yang give Hong Xiu?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It should be a medicine for the He Huan San.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is the medicine I found at the scene.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's for He Huan San.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't believe my eyes.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Two people in front of the body of the Princess Consort...

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why did Yun Yang do that?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't understand.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Before he came in, I made a thousand orders to tell him not to touch the body of the Princess Consort.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Although he didn't touch it,

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the emotion he showed was greatly affected.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He was very sad.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sad?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yun Yang's reaction was a bit strange.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you okay, Second Young Master?

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Look at you.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Young Master, you mean

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you need to take some medicine to nourish your blood.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me do it.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me do it.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're awake.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I was just...

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You fainted yesterday.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I brought you back.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you, Brother.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You don't have to say that.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you take medicine on time?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's the same for me.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you don't take medicine on time,

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
your body won't be able to stand it.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I know.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Father's life is on us.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Father?

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When did he take us as his sons?

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Since we were little,

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
he raised us as his sons.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He also treated us as his medicine cans.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now we have a chance.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Xiao Ying's death

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
will make father lose his hard currency.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We have no worries.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But he...

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He raised our father.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What if he's not our father?

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How did he treat us?

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do I need to repeat it?

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Brother, what do you want to do?

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't you think I'm going to kill father?

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Between father and me,

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you can only choose one.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Who will you choose?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Brother.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Brother.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Brother.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is Xiao Ying's death because of the Peach Blossom Festival?

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The dead are dead.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The living should live well.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Am I right?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have a rest.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Didn't I tell you?

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't follow me.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you follow me one more step,

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you'll be punished by 30.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sister-in-law.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know,

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
what brother did to you is wrong.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can't resist him.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You shouldn't join him.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You should be as violent as him.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're not like this.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What should I do?

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Leave here.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's impossible.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No woman

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
can leave the Peach Blossom Village in a good way.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then run away.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why do you have to be like him?

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Young Hero Yan,

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
can I ask you a question?

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Please.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Young Master asked me to get some medicine for Young Hero Yan.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I came here

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to be a kind person.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Kind person?

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tell me.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Since the Princess came to the palace,

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
our Young Master has been kneeling.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The Princess used to be a good person.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Everyone in the village liked her.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But,

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
except one person,

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Who?

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hong Xiu.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
After the Princess was killed,

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
our village head

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
couldn't escape.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hong Xiu's husband

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
was our young village head, Yun Yang.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He managed our village well.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Isn't Hong Xiu

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the most powerful woman

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in our village?

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Just because of this,

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you want to say that Hong Xiu is the murderer.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You are too hasty.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Of course not.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The day the Princess was killed,

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
my informant told me

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hong Xiu

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
met the Princess.

142
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I finally got you back.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He still treats you like this.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You promised me

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that you would send me to the capital.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I've been waiting for you.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why did you lie to me?

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I live in the palace.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I didn't get His Majesty's favor.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I really can't help you.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm afraid you forgot about me.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You are so rich and glorious.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How can you remember our agreement?

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't worry.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I remember our promise.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When I come back,

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will ask my father and brother

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to take you away from the village.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They let me go?

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If they let me go,

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I have to wait until now?

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Remember,

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you owe me.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't have much.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I won't let anyone owe me again.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Your Highness,

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I have something to tell you.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Go ahead.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
According to you,

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yu Niang is your man.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Her death has nothing to do with me.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So Hong Xiu was jealous of the Princess

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and killed her?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Young Hero,

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you should tell me the truth.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Young Hero,

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
don't forget

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the mark on Yu Niang's back.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's possible that

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hong Xiu left it on purpose.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
She wanted to leave here long ago.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let me ask you.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Who else is your man

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
in the Peach Blossom Manor?

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can ask me.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I can also

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
not answer.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I just want to remind you, Young Hero.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When you were discussing

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the mark on the back of the sword,

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you didn't consider

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the sound of the sword?

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What a sound of the sword!

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You are so clever.

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You are so clever.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then can I also

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
reasonably suspect

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that you are the murderer of the Princess?

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are joking.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If I kill the Princess,

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
it will be of no benefit to me.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I will not do anything unreasonable.

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then I will ask you a question.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Who are you?

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can be anyone.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can also be myself.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Young Hero,

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I invited you here today

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to make a good friend.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Since we are good friends,

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
we can't come empty-handed.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Then I will

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
give you a life-saving talisman.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Tell me.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Before you entered the House,

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you had a tail

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
at the back of your ass.

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Your junior

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
didn't trust you that much.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's late.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Goodbye.

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Young Hero Yan

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Lord Han Dao.

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What brings you here so late at night?

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
About the death of the Princess,

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I have some doubts.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I want to ask you a question.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Please sit.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss,

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
how long has Yan Shiyi

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
been in Taohua Villa?

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Young Hero Yan

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
came here a few months ago.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He was ill and had a bad breath.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
His father prescribed the medicine

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to cure him.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's how he recovered.

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So,

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yan Shiyi

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is very close to the Master.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I only know

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that Father admires

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Young Hero Yan's swordplay.

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And Young Hero Yan's illness

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
also requires Father's prescription.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why don't you

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
ask Young Hero Yan about it?

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yan Shiyi

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is an important suspect.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So,

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you don't trust Yan Shiyi at all?

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of course.

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Before we find out the truth,

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
everyone in Taohua Villa

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is suspected.

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Including Miss.

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Miss.

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The End
