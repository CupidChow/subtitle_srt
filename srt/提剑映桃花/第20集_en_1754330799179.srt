00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Father.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Qingxuan.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm glad

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you passed the order of the Xiu Nu.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You will serve His Majesty in the palace.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Father, I...

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't want to go to the palace.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How dare you!

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I already have someone in my heart.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't want to go to the palace.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Father!

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't go to the palace.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is a prison.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The palace is another prison.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If I go in, I will be a dog.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will be trapped in there for the rest of my life.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Take me away.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Go?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Where are you going?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I invited you to teach me.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You put the idea on my sister.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are bold.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I chose her myself.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are a member of the Yun family.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even your life is a member of the Yun family.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How did you choose it yourself?

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Come and get it for me.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let her go.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let me go.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where are you taking her?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let me go.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Go.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tell me.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How did you seduce my sister?

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We were...

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in love.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When the Peach Blossom Pool was in its prime,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you persuaded my father to adopt my two sisters.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Did you take their ideas at that time?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You planned to seduce Qing Xuan first,

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
then seduce Xiaoying.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I love Miss.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Everyone says I love her.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But your love...

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can you really endure such a thing?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have something.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The origin of this thing is perfect.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It is made by a woman with a negative heart.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We can test the value of your true heart.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Qing Xuan.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Qing Xuan, come up.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't come over.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you don't let Mr. Gu go,

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll show you right now.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, I let him go.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You come down first.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really?

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You didn't lie to me, did you?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are the queen now.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't have to lie to you.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Where is he?

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to see him.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Xiaomei,

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
look carefully.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You should know that

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
your beloved is such a cowardly animal.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why did you go against father?

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Young Master,

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
didn't you promise me

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to let me go after eating this?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I did promise to let you go.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But I didn't say that I would live or die.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother,

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you let him do it.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He did it.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let him go.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I dare not.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are going to be the queen.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was wrong.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Brother, I was wrong.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please let him go.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Brother, I was wrong.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Brother, I was wrong.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was wrong.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Brother,

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
let him go.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your Majesty.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The poison in your body

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has been cleared.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I read the story of the assassin of the war country,

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yu Rang,

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
who was so powerful

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that he could kill the enemy

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and swallow the poison.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are a great doctor.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Can you help me change my face

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and make a change?

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a great pain

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to swallow the poison

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when you are so powerful.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Only the common people can bear it.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have died once.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's so scary?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to revenge.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In that case,

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
let's try it.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I will revenge for you.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So,

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you changed your face

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and went back to the Peach Blossom Manor.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are going to revenge.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Exactly.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The hidden house of the Peach Blossom Manor

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is not the capital at all.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then why did you help Hong Xiu?

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If I go back to the manor again,

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will not be able to revenge.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You are not going to revenge.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You are going to revenge.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hong Xiu.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If I go back to the manor again

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and find out that

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
if I were to live in the heat of the water,

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't want to see a woman

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
being treated as a toy.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So I want to help her.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hong Xiu hates the Yuns.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Our goal is the same.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So,

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you are also responsible for the death of Yun Xiu and Yun Yang.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If it weren't for the Yuns,

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I wouldn't be living like this today.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to kill them myself

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and avenge them for me.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But I didn't expect that

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hong Xiu would take a step forward

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and start the plan.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I might as well take the advantage of the Yuns

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and kill them with a knife.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So the Peach Blossom Manor they planted

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
was all planted by you to help Hong Xiu.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Exactly.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yun Yang used the Peach Blossom Manor

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to destroy my mind.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want him to taste

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the taste of it.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So you are responsible

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
for the death of the Princess Consort.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yun Xiaoyun's life was mine.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If it weren't for me,

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
she would have been pushed to the Peach Blossom Manor

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and died.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How could she live until she entered the palace?

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If I didn't kill her,

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
how could I mess up the Peach Blossom Manor

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and use the Peach Blossom Festival

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to kill Yun Xiu and Yun Yang?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You told me that

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the Princess Consort was murdered that night.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You saw Yun Xiu and the Princess Consort

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
fighting for revenge.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The person the Princess Consort wanted to see that night

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
was me.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I am here to see you.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Xiaoying,

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
how was your homework?

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You are...

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You really forget a lot of things.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You forgot.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You have to protect yourself

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and wait for the next life.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You are Mr. Gu?

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You are finally back.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait for me?

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You forgot.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You owe me a life.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Today,

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you should return it to me.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So,

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you killed Yun Yang.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then,

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you asked her to point out Yan Shiyi

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and confuse the public.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are smart.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Young Master,

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I pointed out Yan Shiyi.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you hear that?

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am sorry.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I am sorry.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
After you pointed out Yan Shiyi,

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you lost your value.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You kept her from me.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, she must die.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Moreover,

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
she can do anything for money.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She is the spy of Master Yun

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and the pawn of Yun Yang.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can't keep her.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I am sorry.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
