00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 15

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So you're with me

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
just for the medicine of Mount Qing?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The medicine should belong to the people.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You should not think about it.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Isn't it good for you to go back to the past days with me?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Go back with me.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is my home.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have my wife and children here.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Where can I go back?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you don't go with me,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will die here.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do as you wish.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The so-called one needle, one flower.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
With these medicine,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you can definitely go back to the past.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can definitely go back.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yun Lang.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yun Lang, you're here.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yun Lang,

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I miss you so much.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yesterday, I ate this medicine.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I saw Yun Lang.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why is he gone today?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Master, it's dangerous.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Master.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Master.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Master, what's wrong with you?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yun Lang.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yun Lang, you're here.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, master.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You finally come.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Master, I'm a knife.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Master.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Master.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Master.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Master.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Master.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Master.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A knife.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Shiyi.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's wrong with me?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You've eaten too much medicine.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You can't eat anymore.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I didn't expect that

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the master of Qingshan Sect

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
could be so humble

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
for the sake of the owner of Peach Blossom Manor.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Peach Blossom Umbrella

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is to make people immerse themselves in the illusion.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you can't escape,

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you'll keep this emotion

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
until the end of your life.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How do I know if this letter is a fake?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is the truth so hard to accept for you?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yan Shiyi came to Peach Blossom Manor

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to seek revenge from my father.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He thought your master was

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
being influenced by my father.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So he killed the Princess Consort

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to destroy my father's position

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and his support.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then he killed my father

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to avenge your master.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yan Shiyi is the murderer.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Not only him,

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
you're also suspicious.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You two brothers

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
came to Peach Blossom Manor

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to avenge your master

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and kill my father

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in the name of the Princess Consort.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Does it make sense?

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Young Master,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
do you investigate the case with all your heart?

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you have any evidence

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
except this letter?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Lord Han,

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
look here.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is the evidence.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why did Yan Shiyi's nine-tongued deer

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
appear in my father's room?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yan Shiyi was there when the case was committed.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
A nine-tongued deer?

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How do I know

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you didn't steal it from Yan Shiyi?

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You want to cover up the suspect?

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You say that too.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's just a suspect.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In my opinion,

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
he's not the only suspect.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're also suspicious.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Me?

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hong Xiu's thorn is poisonous.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You want to poison Hong Xiu

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to kill the master

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:44,120
and get the

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yan Shiyi?

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I had a fight with Yan Shiyi.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He escaped from me.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Really?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You must have investigated it.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know that Yan Shiyi and I are enemies.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've been after him for three years.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You've been after him?

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you think I'm blind

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
by sticking together every day?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You want to cover up the killer Yan Shiyi.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Young Master,

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you decide who the killer is.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's been four days.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's too late.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then I'll wait for you for three more days.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to get your blood pressure

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and the steam into your body.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It will be very painful.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bear with it.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you, Young Master.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Gui, you're very strong.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I didn't expect you to have a lot of rules.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm hungry.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to eat.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go with you.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll go with you.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll go with you.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll go with you.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll go with you.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll go with you.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll go with you.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm hungry.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll take one.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is it delicious?

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is Wangji's steamed bun.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You take it.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll help you push the cart.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you know what this bamboo is for?

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's good for the body.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Doctor,

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
what's wrong with that man?

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
His name is Yan Shiyi.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He loved to fight injustice since he was a child.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Last night,

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
he was in an unfair situation again

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and was stabbed to death.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In the end,

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
he was not saved.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He was killed by a man

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
who was trying to kill him.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He was not saved.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He was beaten to death by a man.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it's not a long road.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Please save him.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Han,

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I really want to save him.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go and have a look.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How is it?

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
can't live anymore.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Doctor, please save him.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll find a way

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to make money for you.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Han Dou,

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
there are people dying every day in this city.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you're a Bodhisattva,

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
how many people can you save?

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Life and death are predestined.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's see what happens.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's go.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Doctor, please save him.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What other ways can he use?

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you see that high mountain ahead?

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There are Qing Shan Sects on the mountain.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Qing Shan Sect has three thousand medicinal recipes.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It can cure hundreds of diseases.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you can take him there now,

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
maybe you can survive.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Please

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
save my brother.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Qing Shan Sect has so many people every day.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How can we save him?

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Please go back, young master.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My brother is seriously ill.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He won't be able to stay long.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If he goes down the mountain and goes up the mountain,

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
he might die.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please save my brother.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you don't go, I won't go.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Bring them in.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is...

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is a needle and thread of medicine.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a way to keep you alive.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But it can only last for five days.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
These days, don't think too much.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't use your inner power.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You have to pay attention to this red thread.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When the red thread disappears,

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
it's the time when you're crying.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You don't have to look at me like that.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You don't want to marry me.

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The one I want to marry is not you.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So you don't have to show a cold face.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now that you're here,

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
there's a reason why you can't leave.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Likewise,

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm the same.

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Come on.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The time has come.

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The time has come.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The time has come.

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Lingling,

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
why are you angry at midnight?

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Brother, I want to marry.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Marry?

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Who?

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Him.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Brother,

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
why are you standing here?

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Come on.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Say hello to my brother.

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is my brother.

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We grew up together.

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He will help me in everything.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't worry.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Even if father doesn't agree to our marriage,

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
my brother will speak for me.

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Right, brother?

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Shiming.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hurry up and kowtow to my brother.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Brother Hong, kowtow to my brother.

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Come on.

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Run.

252
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please help me.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Please convince father to let me marry Hong Xiu.

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yueming.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is my brother like my father?

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He was born with a red sleeve.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yueming.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Your brother has married me for you.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Have you forgotten?

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Nonsense.

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You don't believe me?

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Brother,

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is he telling the truth?

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yueming.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yueming.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's wrong, Yueming?

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yueming.

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I remember now.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not only my brother who married me.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's okay.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's okay, brother.

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's okay.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Calm down.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yueming.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Brother,

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
even if we get married, it's okay.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

278
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I've thought about it.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You just have to write a divorce letter.

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And the rest of the brothers will do it.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You divorce Hong Xiu.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I marry Hong Xiu.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Two days of happiness.

284
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Brother will be my personal gift.

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yueming.

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yueming, look at me.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yueming.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Calm down.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Brother,

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
didn't you say you would convince me and Hong Xiu?

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Then write a divorce letter.

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Write it now.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Calm down.

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yueming.

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yueming.

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yueming.

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I know, brother.

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No pen, no paper.

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's okay.

300
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I have.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I have.

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I have.

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Brother, write a divorce letter.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Write a divorce letter.

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Write a divorce letter.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Brother.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yueming.

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Calm down.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Father is in danger.

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How can I let you marry your sister-in-law now?

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why not?

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hong Xiu is my wife.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am Hong Xiu's husband.

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I understand.

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Only one smile is hard to get.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not a small thing.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Brother, I was bitten by a snake.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You are the grace that I look for in the mirror.

319
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You are the dream that I look for in the mirror.

320
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I am willing to shine for you.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's go home.

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I have a solution.

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can save you.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Brother.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You gave me my life.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
My life is given by brother.

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yueming.

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yueming, what do you want?

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The letter from Yueming.

330
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Brother saved my life.

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I return it to you now.

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I will go to brother's body to change blood for my father.

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I return my blood to you.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yueming, what do you want?

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I write the letter now.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Write it now.

337
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Return Hong Xiu to me.

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yueming.

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I am willing to shine for you.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Even if I can only meet you in my dream.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Forget it.

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I will fulfill your wish.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I am willing to shine for you.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I am willing to shine for you.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You are the flower that I look for in the mirror.

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We are a couple.

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We were meant to be.

348
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We are meant to be.

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If we are not meant to be,

350
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
we are enemies.

351
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So we come to meet each other.

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We have different minds.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We share the same path.

354
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We are different.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We are different.

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We are different.

357
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We are different.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We share the same path.

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's go.

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's go.
