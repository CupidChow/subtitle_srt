The King's Avatar

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Do you know whose blood this is?

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yunming's.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Clean it.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He left this blood for you.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
His blood is sweet.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you know that I had a baby?

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then I used a bowl of medicine to get rid of it.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I won't let my baby be born in a place like a grave.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Look, how easy it is to kill someone.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A bowl of medicine is enough.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You hurt me, you tortured me,

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it's just because you have guts.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You don't even want to resist.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are a coward.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm a coward.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm a coward.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are a coward.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are no match for the flower in front of the grass.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are just a coward.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are just a passer-by.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To be a man, you have to use your strength to turn into an weapon.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
To use your strength to kill a woman who has no husband,

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it means that she has no other choice.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She is unhappy with everything in this world.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She is fighting for her own power.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She can only be triggered by her weak father.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Look, how pitiful.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you done?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I got it right.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are a coward.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are a coward.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you know why every time you come back from the room of the fishmen,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have to leave a tattoo on your body?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because the love is the hand of the ancient five elements,

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
compared to the fish, the heart, the body,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the love is the lightest,

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and the most terrible.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think you know better than anyone else.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Dad!

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Use the knife as a pen, and the dagger as a window.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The wound will not hurt for a long time.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And the god will not remember.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So the love is the lightest,

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and the most terrible.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But the ink turns into a window.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Get up.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Unless the blood is not yellow,

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it is scattered in the light.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Otherwise,

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the traces of the ink will be with you forever.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I want you to see these four stars every time and remember,

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you are just a toy in the Peach Blossom Mountain.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No one can focus on that.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Get stuck in the cage!

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Episode 15

58
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,440
It bit.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,720
Look.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What kind of fish is this?

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,920
A fish from the Net.

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you think

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
they will act?

64
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes.

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
But Master,

66
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,360
if they really do it,

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
will you be sad?

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
I don't care about

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
the gifts of the military officials and the father and son.

70
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
I feel very relieved.

71
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
To fight and to take,

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
is our family.

73
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
So I can be Yunxiu's son.

74
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,280
I have to let them do it.

75
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,400
Then they will know

76
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,800
who will be the master of this Peach Blossom Manor forever.

77
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Don't ask.

78
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,280
Come with me.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
But I have another place to go.

80
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
I don't think you need to go.

81
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,200
You know where I'm going.

82
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,040
You're going to find Master Yubo, right?

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,080
Master Yubo and Young Master are brothers.

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Do you think Young Master can let you go?

85
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
Do you think

86
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,040
Master Yubo will abandon his brother for you?

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
If you don't go now,

88
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
it will be too late.

89
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,880
It's me.

90
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Come with me.

91
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
Yubo

92
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,120
Thank you for helping me.

93
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,240
You're so pretty.

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,920
Sometimes you're still too simple.

95
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,080
Many things are not as simple as you think.

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Just like I said,

97
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
when I arrive in the capital,

98
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
my property will be yours.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,840
Young Mistress,

100
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
it's so late.

101
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
Where are you going?

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,000
Today is the day you give the order.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
Don't forget.

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,920
In this Peach Blossom Manor,

105
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,920
who is the real master?

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
It's not you.

107
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You're just a dog

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
who barks for the master.

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,560
You're right.

110
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm just a dog of the master.

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,880
So you don't have to be so mean to me.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,880
The master wants to see you.

113
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,280
Let's go.

114
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
Let me go.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Take her away.

116
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,160
Go.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Let me go.

118
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Young Master.

119
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,560
I have something to ask you.

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,520
Not now.

121
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
It's about the death of the Princess Consort.

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
Please cooperate.

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
I said no.

124
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
Is it true that your brothers

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
are exchanging blood for Yunxiu?

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
It's my family business.

127
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,560
It has nothing to do with others.

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,480
Family business?

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
So the death of the Princess Consort is also family business?

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,240
What do you mean?

131
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
I suspect that the death of the Princess Consort

132
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
has something to do with Yunxiu.

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
No.

134
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,360
It's not, Father.

135
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,920
Then what is it?

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,120
Yunyang.

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't talk nonsense.

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Xiao Yin is our sister.

139
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,760
We won't harm her.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
Does the Peach Blossom Festival have anything to do with you?

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
It has nothing to do with me.

142
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
Then who does it have to do with?

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
I don't know.

144
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
Don't stop me. I have something to do.

145
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
The Peach Blossom Festival

146
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
The Peach Blossom Festival

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
The Peach Blossom Festival

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Yueming.

149
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
What does it mean?

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,280
It means that you have to comb your hair

151
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
and put it on your hair.

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,840
It's called the ceremony of the auspicious day.

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
In general,

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,920
elders or relatives will help you with your hair.

155
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,160
My mother passed away early.

156
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
My father is not good to me.

157
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,920
I have no family.

158
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll protect you.

159
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
I'll be your family.

160
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Really?

161
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,200
Really.

162
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,840
Look.

163
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Is it beautiful?

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,880
Yes.

165
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
The world is a knife.

166
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,800
We are all flesh and blood.

167
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't worry.

168
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,080
I won't let you get in the way.

169
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Everything is like chess.

170
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
We shouldn't be just chess pieces.

171
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
What's wrong with getting into the game?

172
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
On this chessboard,

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
we are all chess pieces.

174
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
We are all chess pieces.

175
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,360
We are all chess pieces.

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
We are all chess pieces.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,560
We are all chess pieces.

178
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
What do you think

179
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,880
will happen

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,640
to the game tonight?

181
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,800
The game has not been decided yet.

182
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Everyone is just getting excited.

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,000
The soldiers are fighting with swords.

184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,320
They are all fighting with swords.

185
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
They are all fighting with swords.

186
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Father, Qing Xuan wants to see you.

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Come in.

188
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
What's the matter?

189
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
I want you to let Sister-in-law go.

190
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,480
It's none of your business.

191
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Take out the internal energy.

192
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
If you don't treat her,

193
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
she will die.

194
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
I'll go to the hospital.

195
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I'll go to the hospital.

196
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
Sister-in-law is out of energy.

197
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
She will die.

198
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,360
I have a way.

199
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Maybe I can try.

200
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,960
You really have a way?

201
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Thank you, Father.

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,760
Father, Sister-in-law is very weak now.

203
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Can I help her go back to her room and rest?

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,560
No.

205
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
She has to stay.

206
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Be a witness.

207
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,960
Yes.

208
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
You still want to be a fairy?

209
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Xian Er, you're still alive.

210
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,360
After many years of separation,

211
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,160
why didn't you come to me?

212
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,360
Did you forget me?

213
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
No.

214
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,160
Never.

215
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I've been thinking about you.

216
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,160
You're lying.

217
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
You're with me

218
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,960
just for the sake of the three thousand women of the Mount Qing Sect.

219
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,760
No.

220
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
The medicine room doesn't belong to the Mount Qing Sect.

221
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It doesn't belong to you either.

222
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
The medicine room is the heaven's secret.

223
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Anyone who sees the heaven's secret can get it.

224
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
After getting it,

225
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
he can become a fairy.

226
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,160
I've done so much

227
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
just to wait for this day.

228
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
You hurt people for your own vain purpose.

229
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
It's a pity that

230
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,960
it's a bad omen to hurt people.

231
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,760
You also hurt people.

232
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,160
You also hurt me.

233
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
But I'm not wrong.

235
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
I'm not mortal.

236
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
I want to get out of this shell.

237
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,760
I want to abandon my mortal body.

238
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,560
I want to become a fairy.

239
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
No one

240
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,160
can stop me from becoming a fairy.

241
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Since you want to be a fairy,

242
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll help you.

243
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,160
Come with me.

244
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
Father.

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Xiao Ying.

246
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
You've been treating us

247
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
as your daughters for so many years.

248
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
What are you talking about?

249
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
If it weren't for me,

250
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,360
how could you be the queen?

251
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
We're just a fish in your sea.

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Nonsense.

253
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,360
Give me back my life.

254
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,360
Who?

255
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Give me back my life.

256
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,160
Give me back my life.

257
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
It's you guys.

258
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Why am I here?

259
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Anyone?

260
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Didn't you want to be a fairy?

261
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Yes.

262
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I want to be a fairy.

263
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
You want to abandon your mortal body.

264
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,760
Why are you still struggling?

265
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,160
I understand.

266
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,360
I want to be a fairy.

267
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,360
I want to be a fairy.

268
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Fairy.

269
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Fairy.

270
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Father.

271
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Father.

272
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Father.

273
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Father.

274
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Father.

275
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Wind, frost, rain, snow, and river

276
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,960
are all together in this world

277
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,560
I meet you in my dreams

278
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,960
and drink your peach blossom wine

279
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,360
I have a lot of grudges

280
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,560
but I can't win you over
