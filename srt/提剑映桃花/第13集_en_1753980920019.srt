00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From now on, the Peach Blossom Manor belongs to you and me.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Brother, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go ahead.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Why do you think it's important to live?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Of course, it's to get what you want.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't think so.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In my opinion, what you want is to be empty.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't it important to live happily and happily?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The world is so big.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In fact, this little Peach Blossom Manor is no more than

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
no desire, no desire, no desire, no desire, no desire.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Brother, I suddenly found that what I was afraid of was not scary.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Brother, I'll give you another word.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why do you have to put your life in this little Peach Blossom Manor?

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And turn the ground into a prison?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ha ha ha ha

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Father is dead, you are safe.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's more dangerous.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You just have to be obedient.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will protect your safety.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And you occasionally have a little temper.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are really a good brother.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yujin, you are also a good son.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As long as it's for the Yun family,

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
sometimes it's no big deal to make a sacrifice.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I want to advise you.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's still the idea of running away early in the morning.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You and Yunming will always stay here.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stay with me.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You want to kill me too.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't have the ability.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
At least I have tried.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's worth a try.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sometimes I admire your courage.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And your perseverance.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But it's a pity that it's all for nothing.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Pick it up.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Rub it here.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can die right in front of you in a moment.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Pick it up.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I told you to pick it up.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't you want to run away from here?

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You want to leave with Yunming.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I said, even if you die,

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you have to die in the Peach Blossom Manor.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I won't let you die.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My Yunyang woman,

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
no matter what she went through,

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
she still had the fruit of heaven.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She was so beautiful that she couldn't help herself.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She was in love with Lianxi.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shiyi.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Shiyi.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What did you call me?

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Nothing.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Look at your expression.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You didn't know that I was going to die.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Shut up. Drink the medicine.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're good at drinking medicine.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Drink it all.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Brother.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I remember that after I drank the tea you gave me,

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I fainted.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Did you poison me?

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I did poison you.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I should have killed you while you fainted.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why didn't you do it?

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You even held me up.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you heartbroken?

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't believe you're joking.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't believe you're joking.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now you can tell me what's wrong with you.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't mention it.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
God is on our side.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yunyang is causing trouble for us.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If we don't find out the truth as soon as possible,

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
we'll be shot.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a pity that we're just speculating.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think the Peach Blossom Manor is like a maze.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Everyone is like a murderer.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, my God.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sir, someone is here.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Han.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is this how you invited me here?

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did you kill Yun Xiu?

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sir, I don't dare to say that.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There must be evidence to prove the case.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The dead people in the manor are obviously the victims of the Peach Blossom Festival.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We should be united and united.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We'll find the real murderer of the Peach Blossom Festival.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Murder?

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think you're the murderer.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Tell me.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where are you, the one who killed Yun Xiu?

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sir, you...

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I got it.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Take a look.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's take a look.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Account book.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's written in detail that the orphan was involved in the business of the Golden Lion and the Young Mistress.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The orphan and the Young Mistress are also involved.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The night the Young Mistress was killed, the Young Mistress wanted to run away.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The orphan stopped her.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It seems that they met me in the middle of the night.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They were actually...

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You've been wearing it for a long time.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you ready?

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm ready.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The truth of life and death is tonight.

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm looking forward to it.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We'll meet in person.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll be back.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There's only one way ahead.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Protect yourself.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't worry.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll wait for this day.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Young Mistress.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Young Mistress.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Today is your big day.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Uncle He.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You scared me.

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you here?

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The owner does not allow anyone to enter.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why don't we play a game?

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Please.

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What do you think the result of tonight's game will be?

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The game of the unknown.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Everyone is stupid and excited.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Stupid and excited.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Stupid and excited.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So you mean...

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I confused you and then entered the single room.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Lord Han.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're so smart.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So...

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Among the people who entered the single room that day,

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
there was an orphan.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think this thing should be like this.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I have something to talk to the Zhuang.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't mind.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm a fairy.

155
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You fell asleep?

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
How long have I been sleeping?

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just a while.

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Come on.

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Continue playing.

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Come on.

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You mean...

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The orphan confused you that day.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And made an unknown evidence.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Lord Han.

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're so smart.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So the person who entered the room should be the orphan.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He shouldn't be me.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh.

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not a criminal now.

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
At least you're a suspect.

171
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm not a suspect.

172
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What do you think of the hatred and hatred in this world?

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Murderer's parents.

174
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The woman who killed the man.

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right.

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But there's another kind of blood feud in this world.

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's the one who turns into a man.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When I knew something happened in your house,

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I sent someone to find you.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
From now on,

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
you can treat the Peach Blossom Manor as your own home.

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're like your father.

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're too young.

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But this hometown will only cause harm.

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now you're a criminal.

187
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Staying in the Peach Blossom Manor

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
is a new identity for you.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
People become vulgar because they have desires.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you want to escape,

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
you have to be free.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No.

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Actually, the night you were killed,

197
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the one who really disappeared

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
was Uncle He.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I fell asleep.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
How long did you sleep?

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just a little while.

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's your turn.

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's go.

205
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Uncle He was grateful to the owner for saving his life.

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He also hates the owner

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
for turning him into a eunuch.

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So he has time and motivation.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The one you really want to investigate is Uncle He.

210
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Sir, can I go now?

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Please.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sir, someone just sent this.

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please continue.

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What are you looking for me for?

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I want to show you the real identity of someone.

216
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Who?

217
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Who?

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If I tell you directly,

219
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
you won't believe me and doubt me.

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Only when you see it with your own eyes

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
can you see the real identity of someone.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Or his true heart.

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Young Master, we've made a deal.

224
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You will give me my medicine on time.

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Young Master.

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Please.

227
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Have you done what I told you to do?

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've done it.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Please.

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Please.

231
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Please.

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I've done it.

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Young Master.

234
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Young Master.

235
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Young Master.
