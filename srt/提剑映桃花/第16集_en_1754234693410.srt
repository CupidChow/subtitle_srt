00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 15

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Who is it?

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Young Master Yan.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
I want you to take me to find a medicine.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
What medicine?

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
The medicine Yunyang gave me.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Young Master Yan, you're really joking.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
This medicine

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,400
is the root of the Peach Blossom Manor.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,400
How could Young Master Yan tell me about a servant?

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,800
If you don't know,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
it won't work.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,800
It works.

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,600
It works.

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Young Master Yan,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,200
the medicine of the Peach Blossom Manor is here.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
Where is the medicine of the Peach Blossom Manor?

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Young Master Yan,

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
you can't tell the Master.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
My life is...

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It depends on your cooperation.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Cooperation?

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
I will cooperate.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
The Peach Blossom Manor

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Young Master Yan, look.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,200
This is the unique formula of the Peach Blossom Manor.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
When you use it,

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
you must pay attention to its quantity.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Otherwise, it's dangerous.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Look at its color.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
The Peach Blossom Manor

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm not there yet.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
You want to torture me?

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
How dare you!

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Young Master,

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
are you guilty?

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Don't talk nonsense.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
The suspect Yan Shiyi kidnapped He Bu

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
and tried to sneak into the pharmacy and put the Peach Blossom Manor

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
in danger.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I broke it on the spot.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
I invited you here

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
to interrogate you.

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Please.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,800
The suspect Yan Shiyi.

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
I want to ask you

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
why Young Master wanted to give you the medicine.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Yunyang found out about my old friend with Master Yun.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
He wants to bribe me.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Young Master,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
what are you doing?

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
This is the cure for life.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
But I have no credit for it.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
My father doesn't need you as his servant,

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
but I'm a good master.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
What's the benefit of

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
giving up on Young Master?

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
I can save your life.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
How do I know

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
you didn't poison me with this medicine?

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
You're a disciple of Qingshan Sect.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Qingshan Sect is known for its medicine.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
You'll know if you're giving the medicine right or wrong.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
What do you want me to do?

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I haven't decided yet.

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
You haven't decided yet?

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
You're a talent.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
It's useful to my father,

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
and even more useful to me.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
You'll know when I've decided.

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
This medicine can relieve your pain.

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
As long as you're my man,

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
I won't lack your medicine.

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Young Master,

76
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,000
tell me,

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
what's the medicine you're giving to the Doctor?

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,000
It's the Yannian Yi Shou Sai.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Nonsense!

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
The medicine you gave me

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
will make me hallucinate!

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
You're kidding.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,600
This is the medicine of my Peach Blossom Manor.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,400
You can ask around

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
how many people have taken it.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,400
But you never said it would make you hallucinate.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
You're lying!

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,600
You...

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,000
You really want to destroy me.

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
Guards, search the room.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Wait!

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll do it.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Please.

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Junior Brother.

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Keep it.

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
You're still alive.

97
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm lucky.

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll keep this dog's life

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
so that you can kill it again.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
When will you stop?

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
You still say that?

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I always say that

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
when I have to.

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
Is this yours?

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
I don't have it.

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Han Tao!

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
My lord.

108
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
My lord.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
My lord.

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Li Xiu.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
My lord!

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
My lord.

113
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Are you okay?

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
So this is the peach blossom umbrella.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
The poison that Yan Shiyi carried with him.

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
You're lying to me!

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
It was found on you.

118
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
How could I frame you?

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Here.

120
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
It seems that

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
you won't tell the truth

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
if I don't frame you.

123
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Yun Lang.

124
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Why did you lie to me?

125
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Since we can't have a child,

126
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
we should die together!

127
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Master!

128
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
You!

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Are you going to be a courtier?

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
What's your identity?

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Even if you want to be a courtier,

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I'll do it.

133
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Of course.

134
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Then I'll see

135
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
how you'll be interrogated.

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Yan Shiyi, the suspect.

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Is this poison yours?

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Someone wants to frame you.

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Yes.

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Do you have evidence?

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
My lord.

142
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
The iron is getting cold.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What?

144
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't you want to

145
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
torture the suspect?

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
You're lying!

147
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
You!

148
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
If you still don't believe me,

149
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
just use me.

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm fine.

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Don't be so hard on me.

152
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm the best at torturing people.

153
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm the best at using salt water

154
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
to make the poison.

155
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
You're so good at

156
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
using salt water to apply it on the wound.

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Enough!

158
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Yan Shiyi is ill.

159
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
If you kill him,

160
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
he'll be killed.

161
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
It's been five days.

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Two days left.

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll find out who the murderer is in two days.

164
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
In two days,

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
who dares to torture Yan Shiyi?

166
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
You're so stubborn.

167
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Your prison is now used for investigation.

168
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Do you have any objection?

169
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Of course I have.

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
But if it's for your brothers,

171
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I can only report to the capital

172
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
and punish you.

173
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Of course.

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
If I can't find the murderer in two days,

175
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I'll be punished.

176
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's go.

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Shiyi.

178
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
You can leave now.

179
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Yes.

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Shiyi.

181
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Shiyi.

182
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Shiyi.

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I've wronged you.

185
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Yunyang.

186
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Investigate Yunyang.

187
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
But

188
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
you came to Taohua Villa

189
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
to investigate Yunxiu.

190
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Yunxiu is dead.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Your mission is over.

192
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Why do you still hold Yunyang?

193
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
It's not your business.

194
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Can't you think about your own life?

195
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm

196
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
your last family in this world.

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I have to help you.

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Shiyi.

199
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Yunxi.

200
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Yunxi.

201
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Yunxi.

202
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
After all,

203
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
you are not sure

204
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
whether you can find the way.

205
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
What do you mean?

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
People

207
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
are always

208
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
in the dark.

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
You have achieved your goal.

210
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
You don't have to kill yourself.

211
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Xiao Ying died.

212
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Yunming was sealed.

213
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
The two people I care about the most in this world

214
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
have become like this.

215
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
The price of achieving your goal

216
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
is indeed high.

217
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Zi Fei Yu,

218
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Yanzhi Yu Zhi Le.

219
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Now you

220
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
have lived

221
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
the life you want.

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
The living

223
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
may not be as free

224
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
as the dead.

225
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
The awake

226
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
may not be as free

227
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
as the crazy.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
You can see it.

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm a cripple.

230
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I've been thinking about something.

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
The world is not complete.

232
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
What about people?

233
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I used to look down on you.

234
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
It's not too late to look up now.

235
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Congratulations, Master.

236
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Congratulations, Master.

237
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
The End

238
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
The Han Empire is falling apart.

239
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
The Yuan family is dying.

240
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
What you want

241
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
is the false king.

242
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Father.

243
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
You are my most proud son.

244
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
This position will be yours sooner or later.

245
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Why are you so anxious?

246
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Impossible.

247
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
You are dead.

248
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
You can't lie to me.

249
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Brother.

250
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Brother.

251
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Did he use your blood again?

252
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Brother.

253
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
You don't recognize me anymore?

254
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm Xiaoying.

255
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Xiaoying.

256
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
You're still alive.

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Brother.

258
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
What's wrong with you?

259
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Did you lose too much blood?

260
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Xiaoying.

261
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I miss you so much.

262
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
When you entered the palace with Qingxue,

263
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I was against it.

264
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
It's not your fault.

265
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It's just that

266
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
my life is not good.

267
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Now I'm the one who's against the Peach Blossom Manor.

268
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Don't go back.

269
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Stay with me.

270
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I have a way.

271
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
It's too late.

272
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
It's not late.

273
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I have a way.

274
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
You stay with me.

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
But I'm dead.

276
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Xiaoying.

277
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Xiaoying.

278
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Don't joke with me.

279
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Xiaoying.

280
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Wake up.

281
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
It's all fake.

282
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Xiaoying, wake up.

283
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
The peach blossom is blooming.

284
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
The flowers are crying.

285
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
It's all fake.

286
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
The peach blossom is blooming.

287
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
It's gone.

288
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
It's gone.

289
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
What are you looking at?

290
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Look at me.

291
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I'll dig your eyes out.

292
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
And then I'll dig your tongue out.

293
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Who are you?

294
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
It's gone.

295
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm the owner of the Peach Blossom Manor.

296
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I'll kill you if you don't believe me.

297
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Go away.

298
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Go away.

299
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Brother.

300
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Brother.

301
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
You don't love me at all.

302
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm doing this for your own good.

303
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Why don't you understand?

304
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Then why did you steal my monkey's laugh?

305
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm doing this for your own good.

306
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Go to hell.

307
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm doing this for your own good.

308
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Go to hell.

309
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
My lord.

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
It's gone.

311
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Go away.

312
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Go away.

313
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Go away.

314
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Go away.
