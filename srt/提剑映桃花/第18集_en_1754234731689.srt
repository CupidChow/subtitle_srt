1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Junior Brother,

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
do you remember?

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Master told us about the seven-star Dou Gui

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the importance of placing it in the medicine cabinet.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I was thirsty at that time.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Seven-star Dou Gui,

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
seven-side Dou,

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is about raising your hand,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
raising your head,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and holding half of the medicine cabinet.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The medicine cabinet in Seven-star Dou Gui

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is determined by the Dou Po.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Each doctor has different habits.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The order of the medicine cabinet will also be different.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the common medicine should be put together.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Look,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
just like this four-leaf clover,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
white tree,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
ginseng,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
dried grass and fuling,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in theory, they should be put together.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not common.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Look at the Dou Gui,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tian Ma,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ma Huang,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ma Huang Gen,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
why is there a fuling here?

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Four-leaf clover.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey!

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Be careful.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the three thousand medicine cabinet

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that Master made with his life.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Actually, Yunxiu and Master were in love at that time.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
These medicine cabinets were for her.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Master

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
tried to kill everything

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
with the peach blossom powder,

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but eventually became a demon.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Senior,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was wrong.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I hate the wrong person.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you have been more painful

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
than me these years.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If it were you, what would you do?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I mean

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the day when Master was in the fire,

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if the sword was in my chest,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
what would you do?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I would be like you.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The sword

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is used to protect the weak and the weak.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not used to help the weak.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not used to help the weak and the weak.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In that case,

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
let us go.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Miss.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Young Master Yan,

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Lord Han Dao.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Miss,

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
how did you get in?

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My father brought me here.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
These are all

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the prescription for treating disease and saving people,

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
cooling down the heat and removing the plague.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The medicine of many famous people in the Peach Blossom Manor

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
are all from here.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your father

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
tried hard to please my master.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
These are the prescription for treating disease and saving people.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I didn't expect

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
he would give his heart

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and get a good husband.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I didn't expect

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
he locked himself in the room

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and didn't die.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He betrayed his father.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My father stole these prescription,

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but left the Peach Blossom Manor.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He died in the Peach Blossom Manor.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He died in the Peach Blossom Manor.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He died in Britain.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
In order to escape the Peach Blossom Manor,

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
my master avenged him.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everything

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
in Britain is in the Peach Blossom Manor.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Miss,

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
why are you here?

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to see

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
what the Peach Blossom Manor

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
that killed my sister,

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
my father

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and my brother

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is it?

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go and find it together.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I've checked here.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Peach Blossom Manor is definitely not here.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Could it be

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that Hong Xiu is hiding something?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go back.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The Peach Blossom Manor

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Miss,

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
If Lord Han Dao agrees to the case,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
these bodies will be taken away.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Otherwise,

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
the bodies will be destroyed.

115
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
Do these things

116
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
on your own.

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,760
Yes.

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll go and ask Lord Han Dao now.

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Uncle.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,920
Miss.

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
Do you think Hong Xiu

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,480
has achieved his dream?

123
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,120
Young Mistress

124
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
and my wife want to marry Young Master.

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
Now they are both in the imperial family.

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
Although it's tragic,

127
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
it's still a good thing.

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Is there really

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
a good thing in this world?

130
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,360
It's a good thing.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,240
But it's not useless.

132
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,240
I think it's really a good thing

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,920
that the broken mirror can be restored.

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
The broken mirror can be restored.

135
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
I didn't find the case file.

136
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,720
I still don't understand

137
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,800
who killed the Princess Consort.

138
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,040
If the Princess Consort was not killed by Hong Xiu,

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,800
then our guess

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
must go back to the origin.

141
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,320
Yunyang

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
can only be the murderer.

143
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
Who has the greatest profit

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
after Hong Xiu's death?

145
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
The King of Gu.

146
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,360
That's right.

147
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,760
The reason why we can

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
find Hong Xiu so smoothly this time

149
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,240
is not only because of the peach blossom umbrella in the red candle,

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
but also because of the King of Gu's confession.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
The King of Gu has been helping Hong Xiu

152
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,520
manage his business outside the manor.

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Once Hong Xiu died,

154
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,520
then these industries

155
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,760
are naturally the King of Gu's.

156
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
The King of Gu can help Hong Xiu

157
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
manage his business.

158
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
Can he also help him kill people?

159
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Hong Xiu wanted to take advantage of the King of Gu

160
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,280
and didn't expect the King of Gu to be so arrogant.

161
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
After Hong Xiu died,

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,040
he put all the blame on Hong Xiu alone.

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,960
In this way,

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,400
he just wiped himself clean.

165
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,680
Did He Bo also tell us

166
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,720
that the King of Gu and Hong Xiu had a private affair?

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
If this is true,

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,200
then the King of Gu

169
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,720
has a great suspicion.

170
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,400
Senior,

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
do you remember

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
the line from the death of Yu Niang?

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Seven years, seven months, the peach blossom festival.

174
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,960
We still don't know

175
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
what the so-called peach blossom festival is.

176
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,800
Sir, the King of Gu wants to see you.

177
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,440
Sir,

178
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,200
I came to ask for permission under the order of Miss Da.

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,840
If you have no objection to this case,

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
I will order people

181
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,520
to put the bodies of the soldiers in the cage one by one

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
to prevent damage.

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,280
I have sent people to check the bodies

184
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,880
without any signs of corruption.

185
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,560
Besides, the case still needs to be investigated.

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,280
There is still something suspicious.

187
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,880
You have a business relationship with Hong Xiu.

188
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,280
Now Hong Xiu is dead,

189
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
you are also suspicious.

190
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I just don't know

191
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
if you can afford to investigate.

192
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,760
Sir,

193
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
I have said everything I can.

194
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,840
I didn't hide anything.

195
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,640
Really?

196
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Seven years ago,

197
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
seven years ago, the peach blossom festival.

198
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
What is the peach blossom festival?

199
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Now,

200
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,120
Yu Niang, Yun Xiu and the Princess Consort are all dead.

201
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,240
Do you still want to see more people die in the peach blossom festival?

202
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,040
What does Hong Xiu have to do with the peach blossom festival?

203
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
This peach blossom festival

204
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
is indeed a tragic event in the mountain village.

205
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,240
Seven years ago, the old village head got serious illness.

206
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
He hired many doctors who couldn't treat him well.

207
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
But the old village head didn't admit it.

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,040
He said that the Yun family came to Changshou on their own.

209
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Even if he got sick,

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,080
there was a way to cure him.

211
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,320
So he hired a fake Fang Shi.

212
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Fake Fang Shi.

213
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
How is it?

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,520
Village head, there is a mountain gate in the northwest.

215
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,560
Please lead me there.

216
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
Village head,

217
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,040
the mountain gate is right here.

218
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
It's dangerous.

220
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,360
I don't know if you want to try it.

221
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
As long as I can open the mountain gate,

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm willing to try everything.

223
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
Temple

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
restored

225
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,280
The festival…

226
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
Village head.

227
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,840
The fashion is so good.

228
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,560
Today,

229
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,560
the good men, Yunxiu,

230
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Xie Youzi,

231
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,920
Yunyang,

232
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
Yunming

233
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
are at the Peach Blossom Pool.

234
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
If we don't get the Peach Blossom Formation,

235
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,640
the Peach Blossom Pool

236
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
and the Miaoling Women

237
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
will be in the heaven and earth

238
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,560
to help the good men, Yunxiu,

239
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,600
to live forever.

240
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,280
Go.

241
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
You two,

242
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,400
go.

243
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,040
Ming,

244
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,040
you've seen it before.

245
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
How can you be my son?

246
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,120
Go.

247
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
Useless bastard.

248
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
Father, please calm down.

249
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,080
Let me do it.

250
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,360
Go.

251
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
That's my good son.

252
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,480
I'll kill you.

253
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,920
God bless you.

254
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll go to heaven

255
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,760
and curse the people of the Peach Blossom Pool

256
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,880
and all the other people.

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,440
When the Peach Blossom is in full bloom,

258
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,920
you will die from the Peach Blossom Formation.

259
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,240
Okay, I'll wait for you.

260
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
The Peach Blossom Pool

261
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,520
No one knows whether the Peach Blossom Festival is a good thing.

262
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
But Young Madam

263
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,280
must have used the rumour of the Peach Blossom Festival

264
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
to put the village in this panic

265
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,240
and entrust the death of the old and young masters

266
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,000
to the Peach Blossom Festival.

267
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,720
You knew it long ago.

268
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,720
Why did you tell us now?

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
I didn't experience it personally.

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,080
Besides,

271
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
the Peach Blossom Festival is a secret in the village.

272
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,640
I dare not reveal it.

273
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,400
Now that the old and young masters are dead,

274
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,680
the young lady is a good person.

275
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
I dare not tell anyone about it.

276
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,840
As for your suspicion of me,

277
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
please investigate it carefully.

278
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,280
I will follow your lead.

279
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,480
After the case is over,

280
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,080
I will let you know who is the dead.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,880
Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Young Master,

283
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,680
I'll go and confirm something.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Wait for me.

285
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,560
The Peach Blossom Festival is a good thing.

286
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,760
But Young Madam

287
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
is a good person.

288
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm sure you'll find someone who can help you.

289
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I'll go and confirm it.

290
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I'll go and confirm it.

291
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll go and confirm it.

292
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I'll go and confirm it.

293
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
I'll go and confirm it.

294
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
I'll go and confirm it.

295
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I'll go and confirm it.

296
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll go and confirm it.

297
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I'll go and confirm it.

298
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll go and confirm it.

299
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I'll go and confirm it.

300
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I'll go and confirm it.

301
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
I'll go and confirm it.

302
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
I'll go and confirm it.

303
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I'll go and confirm it.

304
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I'll go and confirm it.

305
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
I'll go and confirm it.

306
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
I'll go and confirm it.

307
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I'll go and confirm it.

308
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
I'll go and confirm it.

309
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,760
The years are passing by in the silence.

310
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,760
The frost and snow are gone.

311
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,760
We stand side by side in the battlefield.

312
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
I see the stars in the sky.

313
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,760
The peach blossoms are blooming.

314
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,760
The grudge is like a word.

315
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Only true love can't win.

316
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Only true love can't win.
