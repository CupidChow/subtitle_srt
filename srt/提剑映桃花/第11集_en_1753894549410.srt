00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
What happened after Miss left the elixir room?

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
After Miss left,

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
I told her to take the elixir.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's there.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The blood is thicker than the fire.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You watched the whole thing?

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't remember what medicine she gave me.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I woke up, but I couldn't move.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Miss, have you seen the elixir in Hong Xiu's belly?

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I saw it before.

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
There was something in her belly.

13
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
But I don't know if it was the elixir.

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
The so-called elixir has been swallowed by Yun Xiu.

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't be sure if the elixir is poisonous.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If the elixir is poisonous,

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
why am I not fine?

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where did you go after you left?

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
I went back to my own yard.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Did anyone testify for you?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mr. Yan can testify.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mr. Yan.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Miss.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are impatient.

26
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not good to ask for money.

27
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,000
That's what Junior Brother told me just now.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come with me.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where?

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
To treat the illness.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Since you know the medicine,

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
can you tell us if the so-called elixir will kill people?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If the elixir is poisonous,

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
the first person to be poisoned is the one with the elixir.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I saw sister-in-law last night.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
She was sweating all over.

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
She couldn't move at all.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
It was a poison.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
But is it the elixir that is poisonous?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Or did her father eat something else for her?

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't be sure.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sir.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Sister-in-law is very weak now.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Since you have asked,

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,000
can I take her away?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Let's go.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Slowly.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where are you?

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Where were you when the incident happened?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,500
We are the master's servants.

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
We should listen to the master.

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
The master ordered me to keep an eye on the young lady.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,000
I sent the young lady to the door of the single room and gave it to Uncle He.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then I left.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
I took the young lady to this place.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then I left.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Last night was the master's big event.

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
We are servants.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
We dare not disturb you.

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
After that,

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Uncle He and I went to the garden to discuss.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Until it happened.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sir.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
If you don't believe me,

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,500
you can ask around.

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
The guards and guards in our village

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
have seen us.

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Where is the young master?

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where were you when the incident happened?

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I was in the drugstore.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
The maid of the drugstore can testify.

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Okay.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I will interrogate the maid of the drugstore.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Before we find out the truth,

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you all have a suspicion.

78
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
The one who killed the Princess Consort

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
and the one who killed Yun Xiu

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
should be the same person.

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
The Princess Consort died.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
You haven't found the murderer yet.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Now my father is killed.

84
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you busy with recently?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Busy with the old story?

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Young master.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are joking.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
In your Peach Blossom Villa,

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
there are tigers and dragons.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Who knows what secrets

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
you all have hidden behind you?

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Three days left.

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
If you can't find the murderer,

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Mr. Han Dao,

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you will be dead.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Guards.

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Take the head of the village head.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Father.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Father.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
No.

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
My father is still in the drugstore.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He won't die.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,500
You all don't want to take him away.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Young master.

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
The head of the village is dead.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,500
Please rest in peace.

107
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Father.

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
He will come back.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They are the two people who killed each other.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Could it be

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
they were lost in the forest

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
like Yun Xiu?

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
You asked for Yun Qing Xuan's medical license.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I didn't want to be a burden to you.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He was the one who took the initiative to treat me.

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Didn't you think it was a coincidence

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
that you were treating me in the process?

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
You are suspecting me again.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Brother.

121
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Brother.

122
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother is very weak.

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Can you let him rest first?

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Brother.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Get up.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go to the bed.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Brother.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Our father and son

130
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,000
don't treat him as a tool to escape reality.

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
They treat him as a toy.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They treat him as a toy.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But we all forgot

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that he was also a living woman.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Brother.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brother.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
You have been protecting me since childhood.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have always respected you and feared you.

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
I have always respected you.

140
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,000
I always remember that you are my real father and mother.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So,

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't take what you want from me.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Including my father.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My brother.

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Including Hongxiu.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Brother.

147
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Do you remember

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,500
the first day Hongxiu came to the Peach Blossom Manor?

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is our house.

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
I usually read in this house.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ningning.

153
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Is this where you grew up?

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
It's much bigger than our Peach Blossom Village.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
The Peach Blossom Manor is my home.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can live here in the future.

157
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I don't want to come.

158
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm a small house.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't deserve to be the second son of the Peach Blossom Manor.

160
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Then I'll go to the Peach Blossom Village with you.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
We will have a boy and a girl.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
And have a baby.

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I don't want to have a baby with you.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think the Peach Blossom Manor is good.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't stand it.

166
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
I have my own place to go.

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Where do you want to go?

168
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
I want to go to the capital city.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Capital city?

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Capital city is much bigger than your Peach Blossom Manor.

172
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
That's where I want to go.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to open a shop in the capital city.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,500
Will your father let you go?

175
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
My father?

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He doesn't care about me.

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
He only cares about money.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then I'll go with you.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Can your father and your brother agree?

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They can't control me when I grow up.

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,000
People will always grow up.

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Really?

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Yes.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You said that?

185
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
What if you lie to me?

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I can't do it,

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
I can't live well.

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Don't say that.

189
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
This girl is my wife for you.

190
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Father, you must want her.

191
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Her fate and horoscope are the most suitable.

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
No other choice.

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
But father will be sad.

194
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
How can the children of the Yun family be deceived by the seven emotions and six desires of mortals?

195
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Don't forget what we are going to do.

196
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I'll write a poem for you.

197
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
That's good.

198
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
You have my blood.

199
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
The Yun family is not comparable to mortals.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But how can I tell father?

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll tell him.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He has no choice.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I never thought that

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
my beloved girl would be my sister-in-law.

205
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
My beloved girl became my sister-in-law.

206
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
She became my sister-in-law.

207
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
But father treats her as a tool for the family.

208
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
If it wasn't for Qin Xuan,

209
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
she would have died.

210
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
But this is her fate.

211
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Why?

212
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Why would she die?

213
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
The Yun family really treats themselves as immortals.

214
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Father is worried about the family's future.

215
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
He wants to be a god.

216
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
But he still treats himself as a pill.

217
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
He is killed in the drug.

218
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
They always say that flesh is weak.

219
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
He abandoned flesh.

220
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
He became a god.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He became a god.

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Father,

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
are you a god?

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you are, then explain it to me.

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you see?

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you see?

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No one responds.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No god or deity.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's all fake.

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The Yun family is a white man.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you remember

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the story we told in the past?

233
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
It's about the Yun family's great grandfather, Jin Shan.

234
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
He met a god.

235
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
The god gave him a pill.

236
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
After he took it,

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
he became as young as a leaf.

238
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
He lived to be 220 years old.

239
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
After he was 100 years old,

240
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
he tried everything

241
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
to learn the ancient medicine the god gave him.

242
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
He even took care of his own grandson,

243
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Yun family.

244
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
He met a god.

245
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
The Yun family almost became a god.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So the Yun family must become a god.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think it's all fake.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's all a lie.

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No one can live to be 200 years old.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you think so, brother?

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You also think it's all fake, right?

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Brother.

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You also think it's all fake.

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You are waiting.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are waiting for a chance.

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have waited.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is that right, brother?

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You killed father.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What do you think?

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I can't see you.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't see father.

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can't even see Hong Xiu.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't see you all.

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Brother.

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Now father is dead.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you like Hong Xiu,

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I will divorce him after this time.

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I will help you.

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's too late.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are my brother.

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Everything is yours.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't want anything.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I only want him to be fine.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Stay with him today.

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hong Xiu.

278
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Hong Xiu.

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Hong Xiu.

280
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Hong Xiu.

281
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,960
The

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
When Xiu died,

283
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
he was just like the Princess.

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
He was not injured at all.

285
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Xiu was poisoned too.

286
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
It seems Xiu was poisoned

287
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
by the same poison as the Princess.

288
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
People will hallucinate after being poisoned.

289
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Now the question is

290
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
who poisoned Xiu?

291
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
The most likely one is

292
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
the internal drug in Hong Xiu's body.

293
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Internal drug?

294
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
But if the internal drug is poisonous,

295
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
why is Hong Xiu fine?

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Could it be the poison?

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I heard from Yunming

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that brother often gives sister-in-law poison.

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Poison?

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Poison is the situation.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is the poison

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
penetrating through the skin?

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What about you?

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You also have a chance

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to poison Yun Xiu.

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Lord Han Dao is right.

307
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Father died.

308
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Everyone in Peach Blossom Manor is suspicious.

309
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
But the only one who can make people hallucinate

310
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
is brother.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Why are you laughing?

312
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I laugh at you two.

313
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Everyone is suspicious.

314
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I think

315
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
we should go and see Hong Xiu's tattoo.
