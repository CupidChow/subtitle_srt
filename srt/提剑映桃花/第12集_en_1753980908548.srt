1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,940
goal

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:51,460
Anglo

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:21,520
Now.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
Come.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Niannian! Niannian, help!

6
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,300
Xuanxuan, I'm so scared.

7
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
You've already died once.

8
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,100
There's nothing to be afraid of.

9
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,300
And Mr. Han Dao and Mr. Yan will help you.

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,300
What?

11
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,900
You still have something to ask me?

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,300
Young Mistress,

13
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm sorry to bother you.

14
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,100
But we need to check your personal information.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
That's too rude.

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Rude? It is.

17
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,900
Young Master insisted on checking it.

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,700
And he said he had to let go of the man and woman.

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
What do you want to see?

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
One by one?

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Or together?

22
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,900
That's what we need to ask Mr. Han Dao.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,900
I...

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,500
I think it's better to ask Young Mistress.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Second

26
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,780
lÃ 

27
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,300
yeah

28
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,300
ine

29
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,800
Mm.

30
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,300
Young Mistress.

31
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,700
Why did Young Master hurt you so much?

32
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,900
Why?

33
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,900
When I walked out of Yunxiu's room,

34
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,500
when I didn't speak to him,

35
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
when I looked at Yunming,

36
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,900
I didn't know why.

37
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,700
Maybe

38
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,700
he was unhappy today.

39
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,100
Or maybe

40
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,300
he was just looking for a reason

41
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,700
to get angry.

42
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
Or maybe

43
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
he wanted to torture someone.

44
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,500
Anyway,

45
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
he had his reasons.

46
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,700
He could do whatever he wanted.

47
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,700
What else do you think?

48
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,100
Did you notice anything strange

49
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
when you were giving him the tattoo?

50
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
The tattoo on Young Mistress's leg

51
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
is old and looks clearer.

52
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,300
But I feel something is wrong.

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Yes.

54
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Normally, the ink on the skin of a person

55
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
is light.

56
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,500
But the tattoo on Young Mistress's back

57
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,900
is a little pale.

58
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
This is...

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
It's a demon mantou.

60
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
Demon mantou has a whitening effect.

61
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,700
The ink should have been added to the demon mantou.

62
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
And I heard that

63
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
if you put this drug

64
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
into a person's body several times,

65
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,700
he won't die immediately.

66
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,700
He will be poisoned.

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,300
What if you mix the blood of this person

68
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
into other people's food?

69
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Will it be poisoned after taking it?

70
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Someone is poisoning someone.

71
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,700
Yes.

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,300
A person is a drug addict.

73
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,700
So,

74
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Young Mistress was poisoned.

75
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Then the internal organs in her body are also poisoned.

76
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,700
The tattoo on Hong Xiu's body

77
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,500
can't be a direct evidence to point out Yun Yang.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,300
Think about it.

79
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
If I were Yun Yang, I would say so.

80
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Look, he has a tattoo on him, too.

81
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
Why doesn't he die?

82
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
It must be Yun Yang.

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
As the person behind the peach blossom festival,

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
I think it's him.

85
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,100
No.

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Junior,

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I think we should think about it from the beginning.

88
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
I think

89
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Yun Qingxuan is a bit strange.

90
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
What's strange?

91
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Think about it.

92
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,900
The person who entered his room that night

93
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,100
when Yun Xiu was murdered,

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,300
except Hong Xiu,

95
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
who else?

96
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Yun Qingxuan.

97
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
If I met Yun Qingxuan,

98
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,900
and Yun Xiu was dead,

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,300
then things would be like this.

100
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
Let's do it in secret.

101
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Yun Qingxuan

102
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
If so,

103
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,700
Yun Qingxuan will definitely want us to turn our faces to Yun Yang.

104
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Because of this, he is safe.

105
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,700
That's right.

106
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,700
There is no good thing in the whole Yun family.

107
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,300
It's a pity that we just inferred it.

108
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,700
There is no evidence.

109
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,900
Everything has its roots.

110
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
As long as they did it,

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
we can find evidence.

112
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,100
But

113
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
why did Yun Qingxuan take such a big risk to help Hong Xiu?

114
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,500
I checked Hong Xiu.

115
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
Hong Xiu, he is in the capital.

116
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
He has a business.

117
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I think he wants to escape from Taohua Villa.

118
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
As for Yun Qingxuan,

119
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,700
he also wants to escape.

120
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,900
Think about it.

121
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
What if they are connected?

122
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,900
They all want to escape Taohua Villa.

123
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,700
If that's the case,

124
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,500
then they are not wrong.

125
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
If I were not a plant,

126
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
Yun Xiu would have died.

127
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,900
I just take it as revenge for Master.

128
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,900
Master's revenge is half of it.

129
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,500
It's a pity that you didn't kill Yun Xiu.

130
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
We don't know the past relationship between Master and Yun Xiu.

131
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,500
The most important thing now is to catch the murderer.

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,900
Maybe after finding the murderer,

133
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,300
the truth will be exposed.

134
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,300
Then it will be the past relationship between you and me.

135
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,500
Master.

136
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,300
Junior.

137
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm really afraid.

138
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
Before the truth is exposed,

139
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll die.

140
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,100
I won't let you die.

141
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
At least not a sick death.

142
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Your life is mine.

143
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,700
The

144
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
mushroom

145
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
at

146
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
elder

147
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
the

148
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
doctor

149
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
helpless

150
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
free

151
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
down

152
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
the

153
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
bubble

154
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,380
Now that the old master is gone,

156
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,540
we have no other choice.

157
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,060
I remember you wanted to choose Yunyang.

158
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
There are choices,

159
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,340
but there are no choices.

160
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,300
Now he's the only one.

161
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,340
What can we do?

162
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,020
I think

163
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,420
it's not a good thing.

164
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,220
I'm glad to hear that.

165
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Yunyang is a man of great character.

166
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,620
He's not a good master.

167
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,660
I remember you once said

168
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,420
good music is a man of great character.

169
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,220
So I think

170
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,300
we should think about the future.

171
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,860
What do you want to do?

172
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,420
I want to know

173
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,700
what you want to do.

174
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,140
What are you doing?

175
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,460
Dad,

176
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,940
are you possessed

177
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,700
now?

178
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,900
You shouldn't have done that to me.

179
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,140
You shouldn't have done that to Hong Xiu.

180
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,740
You're really a bastard,

181
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,340
I know you're obsessed with

182
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,740
I've been growing herbs, making elixirs, cultivating a few plants.

183
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,900
I've been seeing different kinds of women.

184
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,220
But I just want to fight with the heavens.

185
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,860
I want to have more women.

186
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,940
I was young and ignorant.

187
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,460
I would treat you

188
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,500
as if you were a doctor.

189
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,020
But now I'm not.

190
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,420
I understand everything.

191
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,860
You're a selfish person.

192
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,700
We're just the stepping stones

193
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
on your journey to become a fairy.

194
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,020
You used our love and trust

195
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,500
to point us out.

196
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,180
We wanted to throw away our lives

197
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,740
and enjoy them with you.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,500
But that's not enough.

199
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,860
You want to take away everything we have

200
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,140
and want.

201
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,300
You want us to lose everything we love

202
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,700
and to dream of becoming a fairy

203
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
in your dream

204
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,620
in the desert.

205
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,180
It's a pity.

206
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,940
No matter how hard you work the day after tomorrow,

207
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,380
you want to be a fairy forever.

208
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,780
But in the end,

209
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,100
you're just an old man who can't fight with the heavens.

210
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,900
You and I are father and son.

211
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Now we're two in the same boat.

212
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,620
I really want to ask you.

213
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
When you were lost,

214
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,100
did you see the fairyland

215
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,420
or did you find that the fairyland

216
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,220
was just a place of silence?

217
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,660
Now that you're dead, it's like a dream.

218
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,660
It's not good to die in the wild.

219
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,860
The sea is like the soil.

220
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,660
You'll live forever.

221
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,900
But where are the living?

222
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,020
I've figured it out.

223
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,260
I can't be like before.

224
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,340
I want to live for myself.

225
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,060
I want to live for us.

226
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,700
Yu Ming.

227
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,380
You...

228
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,060
Don't talk.

229
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,380
Your brother will be back soon.

230
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
What's wrong with you?

231
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,900
You're not my brother's wife.

232
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,820
You're Hong Xiu.

233
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,700
You're mine.
