1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
energies when there is no hunger or greed,

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and clanゲer hug forty times.

3
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,440
Even in death,

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,400
our machines

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,080
will respect homes很有意義

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,460
and be fallen in two times.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,560
medicines are находes in a heart

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,920
Like Guild deployments,

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:13,880
new

10
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,920
heroes

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
So you told us the clues

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
and even told us the origin of the Peach Blossom Festival

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
just to mislead us.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Even until you appointed He Bo

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
to confuse us.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,920
The Peach Blossom Festival was a tragic event in the mountain village.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Letting more people know

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
that it was for the sake of the dead women's grievances.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
What I want you to know is

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
a vicious person like Yun Yang and Yun Xiu

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
is not to be trusted.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
You're so ungrateful.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
You don't deserve to be trusted.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
You're so ungrateful.

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
You don't deserve to die.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
You don't deserve to die.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
What about Hong Xiu?

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Why did you use him?

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Hong Xiu is a poor person.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
But he's a man of his word.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
He always wanted to kill

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
and abuse his father Yun.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
He got what he wanted.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
He wanted to be with the one he loved.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Before he died, they became husband and wife.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Isn't that a kind of satisfaction?

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
You and I might not be better than him.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
You've been in the Peach Blossom Village for so long.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
But the First Miss didn't recognize you.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
She's very thoughtful.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm not sure if she recognized me.

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Miss.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,920
I always feel that I've seen your figure before.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Miss, you've got the wrong person.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I've never been here before.

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
I was wrong.

47
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
That person has long been dead.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
He's been dead for so long.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
How could he come back?

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
He's an old friend of Miss.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
He's my husband.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
And my lover.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Miss, you still remember him.

57
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
I believe he's satisfied.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,920
He taught me that I can kill and not be humiliated.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
But he didn't do it himself.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
He studied the book of life and death.

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
But he's a coward.

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,920
He should have forgotten about this person.

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Yes.

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
It's okay to forget about this person.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
But if I can see him again,

66
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I'd like to ask him.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
How would he choose to see me again?

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
He'd rather die with me

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
or live alone?

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Miss, you're joking.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
How could this happen again?

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
You think so.

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
I do.

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
But I just have a bad feeling.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
He wrote on the lantern.

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
The night is gone.

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
The moon is full of the west building.

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
The big night will come again.

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
If I can see him again,

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I'd like to tell him

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I regret it.

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
He doesn't deserve it.

83
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
I went back to the manor twice.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I wanted to revenge and see him again.

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
But he told me

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
he regretted it.

87
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
He blamed me for everything.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
But I didn't.

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
It was the Yun family.

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
I was just a scholar.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,920
I couldn't fight with Yun Xiu and Yun Yang.

92
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,920
And if I hadn't been there,

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Yun Qing Xuan wouldn't be here today.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,920
He would have been pushed into the Peach Blossom Pool.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
He owes me a life.

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
What's up?

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
What's up?

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I want to show you someone.

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Gu Hong Yi died here.

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
He deserved it.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
But he deserved more than that.

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Who are you?

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Qing Xuan, I'm back.

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Gu Hong Yi?

105
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
But your face...

106
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
There's no Gu Hong Yi in this world.

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I should have died in peace

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
after revenge.

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
But he has a wish.

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Xiao Yi, my brother and my father

111
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
were all made by you.

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Yes, it's me.

113
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
I avenged them.

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
But Gu Hong Yi promised you

115
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
that he would fulfill his wish.

116
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
He promised to be with you forever.

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I'll keep my promise.

118
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
You're so stubborn.

119
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Didn't you say you wanted to turn into a firefly after death?

120
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
The grass and the fireflies.

121
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Isn't it good to die here?

122
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
You go first.

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I'll be there when I'm done.

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I did it.

125
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Gu Hong Yi.

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I haven't used this name for a long time.

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You can kill your beloved

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
and you still keep your promise.

129
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
In my opinion,

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
it's just for your selfish desire.

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
There's no such thing as a wish in this world.

132
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
So what if I want to die for my selfish desire?

133
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
If you really have someone in your heart,

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
how can you let her die in front of you?

135
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
At least now,

136
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
no one can separate us again.

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Before I go back to the law,

138
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
I want to show you something.

139
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Sir,

140
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
before I go back to the capital,

141
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
I want to write all these lanterns.

142
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
It's one of my last wishes.

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Is that okay?

144
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Gu Hong Yi.

146
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Tell me.

147
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Why did you bring us here?

148
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
What do you want?

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I've said what I should say.

150
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I killed him.

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
But I don't admit my guilt.

152
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Everyone in Taohua Villa should die.

153
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
They deserve to die.

154
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
So I won't go with you.

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
I will never, ever.

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Taohua San, be careful.

157
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Go.

158
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Go.

159
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Gu Hong Yi

160
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You are...

161
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Gu Hong Yi?

162
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Yes.

163
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
You took this to expose me.

164
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
This is what I want to do most.

165
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I...

166
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I don't understand.

167
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
But I didn't expect

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
it was just a dream.

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
I can't be with him in this life.

171
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
But now,

172
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
I can keep an eye on him.

173
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
By the way,

174
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
after the death of the First Miss,

175
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
the Yun family died.

176
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
This villa belongs to you.

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
But have you really thought about

178
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
the rest of your life

179
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
to guard this miserable place?

180
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
The good things in the capital are not old.

181
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
The clouds are scattered.

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
The lily is broken.

183
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
This is a poem I read

184
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
when I was in the capital city

185
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
when I met a righteous scholar.

186
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
It was a poem written by a man who was a scholar.

187
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
But I didn't expect that when I saw him again after many years,

188
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
he didn't remember

189
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
the poem he said

190
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
and the life he experienced.

191
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
But I was so happy in this world.

192
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Mr. He,

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
why did you leave me?

194
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I remember that

195
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
I never talked about the past

196
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
with Gu Hongyi in this Peach Blossom Villa.

197
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
How did you know my surname was He?

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Have we met

199
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
in the capital city?

200
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Mr. He,

201
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I will die soon.

202
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
We have known each other for a long time.

203
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
I'm counting on you.

204
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
The sword is in the battlefield.

205
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I saw the dream of a beautiful star.

206
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
The peach blossoms are beautiful.

207
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
The grudge is like a dream.

208
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Only true love can't win.

209
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
The End
