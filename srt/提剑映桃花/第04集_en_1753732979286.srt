00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 15

2
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
Master, it's getting late.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,660
I'll send you back to your room.

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,780
No need.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,540
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
I'll go to the bamboo forest.

7
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Have an early rest.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay.

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,920
Why are you so suspicious?

10
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
It's just that at this time,

11
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,460
you found that Yu Niang is not familiar with the terrain here,

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,580
and lost her way.

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,420
That's right.

14
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,620
But I have one thing that I can't figure out.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,420
Why do we have to follow

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,420
the gossip in such a big bamboo forest?

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,920
And then?

18
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,500
Did you hear anything?

19
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,420
I think I heard the sound of the queen fighting with someone

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,660
in the deep of the bamboo forest.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
The one fighting with the queen

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,200
is Yunxiu?

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
I'm not sure.

24
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,840
I wanted to get close to you,

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
but I didn't expect that

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,300
Yu Niang came to me at this time.

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,040
I have no choice.

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,620
I can only jump like this.

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,200
Who are you?

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,460
Who are you?

31
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,280
I...

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,780
I...

33
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,280
I...

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Do you want to drink?

35
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,460
No?

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,960
Then I'll drink it myself.

37
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,780
Stinky drunkard.

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,120
I'm a drunkard.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
Why did you follow Yunxiu?

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,740
Why?

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
Why are you telling me now?

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,940
What do you want to hide?

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,240
Then I have to confirm

44
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,060
your attitude to the past.

45
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Little brother,

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
do you remember

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,820
Master has to go out for a trip

48
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,900
every year?

49
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,160
Every year when I went out,

50
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,320
the peach blossoms were blooming.

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,700
Just in time.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,360
And I also found out

53
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,160
that the places he went to

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,860
were always the same.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,900
Peach blossom manor.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
So this time,

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
you escorted the Princess to the manor

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,820
and came to the peach blossom manor.

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
I believe

60
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,900
that you came here for the same purpose.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,780
Find out what happened between Yunxiu and Master

62
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,480
back then.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,740
Yunxiu is now our common goal.

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Master's heart

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,240
is on Yunxiu.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,160
How could I tell someone

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,560
to come here

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
if you told me to?

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,480
So clever

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,320
is Master!

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Trust me.

72
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,560
Yunxiu.

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,440
On the other hand,

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,940
there is one thing

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,280
that isn'tją difficult for anyone.

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,200
That is

77
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,240
spreading μ- helmet arms.

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,140
A kind of

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,580
То privilege

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,660
appeared

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,020
holding back your breath.

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,980
You go ahead and watch.

83
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,580
No need to rush it.

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,460
First will beأ

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:05:05,860
river

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,540
Right side all sand

87
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,780
top of the wasteland

88
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,060
ah

89
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Yes.

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Come on.

91
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Let's go.

92
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Three joys, one joy.

93
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,660
The ancient weapon, the phoenix.

94
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Get off!

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Get off!

96
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
What are they doing?

97
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
What do you think?

98
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,660
These girls are for Yunxiu.

99
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Yes.

100
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,660
They are all the medicine girls who take her medicine.

101
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Good, good, good.

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
It's her.

103
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
It's her.

104
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Go.

105
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,660
Yunxiu wants to live a long life.

106
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
So she is obsessed with pills.

107
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
But pills are usually poisonous.

108
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,660
So every time, there must be a medicine girl who takes her medicine.

109
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,660
So what will happen after the medicine girl takes her medicine?

110
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
She will have a better luck.

111
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,660
She will get a reward if she lives.

112
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,660
If she is unlucky, she will be poisoned to death and buried in the bamboo forest.

113
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,660
How do you know about these things?

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,660
You and Yunxiu are very close.

115
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,660
I came to investigate why Master is obsessed with drugs.

116
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Of course, he wants to fight with his enemy.

117
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
You are just a friend.

118
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Junior.

119
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
There is no fish in the clear water.

120
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,660
There is no fish in the clear water.

121
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Is my father still healthy?

122
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Young master.

123
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Do you want him to be healthy or not?

124
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
I want him to live a long life.

125
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,660
No matter how long he lives, he will die one day.

126
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,660
If you can't wait, you can take advantage of the situation.

127
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,660
This may be a good opportunity to take your son.

128
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,660
How to take advantage of the situation?

129
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,660
In one word, wait.

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Wait for what?

131
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Wait for the peach blossom festival to happen again.

132
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,660
So you think the peach blossom festival is real?

133
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,660
The secret of the peach blossom festival may only be known by your family.

134
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,660
You don't think you are a member of the Yuan family?

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,660
No one knows about the peach blossom festival.

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,660
You are half of the master's son.

137
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Young master, you are joking.

138
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
I am just a servant.

139
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
I don't deserve it.

140
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,660
I need a master.

141
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,660
And I need the most powerful master.

142
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
What do you think?

143
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Yunyang is the most suspicious.

144
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Think about it.

145
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,660
When the princess died, Yunxiu lost her support.

146
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,660
And Yunyang wants to replace Yunxiu.

147
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,660
When the princess died, the most suspicious person is Yunyang.

148
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,660
But the evidence we have now is not enough to prove that the person we suspect is the murderer.

149
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,660
He said that the princess died because of Yunyang.

150
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,660
He said that the peach blossom festival would happen again.

151
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Will there be another victim?

152
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,660
The murderer killed Liu Zi and left the town.

153
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,660
I'm afraid more than one or two people want to kill.

154
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Who will be the next victim?

155
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Who do you think will be the biggest threat to Yunyang?

156
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Yunxiu.

157
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,660
If Yunxiu wants to die, will you stop her or not?

158
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
I will stop her.

159
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,660
After we find the murderer, Yunxiu will die in my hands.

160
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Ok, since you have figured it out, let's go.

161
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,660
We will go to Yunyang now.

162
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
How?

163
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
How?

164
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
We will go to see her.

165
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
You just go to see her.

166
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
That's it.

167
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
Mr. Handao, what's up?

168
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Young master, I want to ask you.

169
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
What are you doing?

170
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Yan Shiyi, if you want to check the young master,

171
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
just say it.

172
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Will the young master disagree?

173
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,660
And do something like this.

174
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I'm afraid he won't agree.

175
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I know what you are looking for.

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I will show you.

177
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Not necessarily.

178
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
I love you.

179
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I know you love me.

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,660
I'm afraid you will lose your temper.

181
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
What?

182
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,660
You haven't heard the sound of the bell in the room?

183
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Can I go now?

184
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Young master.

185
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Coming.

186
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
Young mistress.

187
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
I went to the pharmacy this morning.

188
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
And I brought some medicine for you.

189
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Thank you, young mistress.

190
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Let's talk inside.

191
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Young mistress, you are not just here to give me medicine.

192
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,660
I just came here for a reason.

193
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I envy you.

194
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,660
You have your own free world.

195
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,660
How can a human heart be trapped by a free world?

196
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,660
By the way, how is the business in my capital?

197
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
The pharmacy is good.

198
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
It's not just a pharmacy.

199
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
It's my way out.

200
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I heard that women in the military can ride horses.

201
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Not only can they ride horses,

202
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
they can also wear men's uniforms,

203
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
dance and practice swordsmanship.

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Why do they wear men's uniforms?

205
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
They are not mocking men.

206
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
They are free.

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Free?

208
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
They can wear whatever they want.

209
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,660
They can do whatever they want.

210
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
If they want,

211
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,660
they can not only go out to ride horses and practice swordsmanship,

212
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,660
but also be an official and do business.

213
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Aren't you here to make me happy

214
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660
and tell me the new stories?

215
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,660
There is no place in the world that is so interesting.

216
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
When you go there in person,

217
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
you will know if I am telling the story.

218
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I hope one day.

219
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
It's up to the person.

220
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Young Mistress, Young Master is looking for you.

221
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,660
He wants you to go there.

222
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Okay, I'll go there right away.

223
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Did you see that?

224
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,660
With him, I can't even enter the door.

225
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Unless...

226
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Unless the Peach Blossom Festival is real.

227
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Young Master,

228
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
without your order,

229
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
no one is allowed to enter.

230
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
This is Peach Blossom Manor.

231
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,660
Why can't I go to the festival to pay homage to my sister?

232
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
But Young Master, don't touch the corpse.

233
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
I'll go.

234
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Xiaoyao,

235
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
we have been apart for many years.

236
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,660
I never thought that we would be apart forever.

237
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
The door is full of thorns.

238
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Now it's piled up in the wall.

239
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,660
The sky is still clear.

240
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,660
The peach blossom is hard to bloom.

241
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I am willing to go to the dark night.

242
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Only true love can't be reached.

243
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
The door is full of thorns.

244
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Now it's piled up in the wall.

245
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,660
The sky is still clear.

246
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,660
The peach blossom is hard to bloom.

247
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,660
I am willing to go to the dark night.

248
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,660
The peach blossom is hard to bloom.

249
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
Only true love can't be reached.

250
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Only true love can't be reached.

251
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Only true love can't be reached.
