1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,060
Elf of peak

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Casablanca

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:52,860
this fill me up.

4
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,860
So, is Han Dao your little brother?

6
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Yes.

7
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
I recognized him as soon as he came to the manor.

8
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
I think

9
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,860
he's pretending to be a relative of Xiaoyin.

10
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm afraid he's really trying to kill me.

11
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
You know, Master.

12
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
Master treats him like his own child.

13
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
He also wants to find out the truth.

14
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,860
He wants to find out the truth of Master's incitement.

15
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Open it.

16
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
Open it.

17
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,860
Master brought us up by himself.

18
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,860
But I killed him.

19
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
Your master is a devil.

20
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
He can't blame you.

21
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
Let me ask you.

22
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
My master is a devil.

23
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,860
Does he have anything to do with you?

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
We have a mutual love.

25
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
I won't harm him.

26
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
But you don't believe it.

27
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Your little brother doesn't believe it either.

28
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
I know

29
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,860
you two came to my Peach Blossom Manor.

30
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Although you don't know the way,

31
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
you came for the same purpose.

32
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
I can guess

33
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,860
that you two killed the princess together

34
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,860
and wanted to frame me for killing the princess.

35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
I just want to tell you

36
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,860
that you two killed the princess together.

37
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,860
You don't have to wait until the seventh day.

38
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
You will die.

39
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Unless you listen to me.

40
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
You won't die.

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,860
But your little brother has a bright future.

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
I think

43
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
you don't mind

44
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
your little brother's life, right?

45
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
Water

46
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Do you know why Yunxiu is silver hair and copper eyes?

47
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Because

48
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,860
she used this to exchange blood with her two sons for her youth.

49
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
And water is blood.

50
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
How do you know such a private thing?

51
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
You doubt me.

52
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Because she threatened me with your life.

53
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,860
She threatened me to make me her blood vessel.

54
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,860
You don't believe it?

55
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Then she used my sword skills

56
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
to make me her guard dog.

57
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Do you believe it?

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Believe whatever you want.

59
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Anyway, even if I tell the truth,

60
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
you won't believe it.

61
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
Ha.

62
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Laugh.

63
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Louder.

64
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Lie down.

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
How's your pet training?

66
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Sir.

67
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Come.

68
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Taicang.

69
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Brother,

70
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
I beg you.

71
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Please let him go.

72
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
No hurry.

73
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Do you still love him?

74
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
I don't know.

75
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
I don't know.

76
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Do you still love him?

77
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
This dog said he doesn't love you.

78
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
What does this dog usually like to eat?

79
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
Bones.

80
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
But there's one thing

81
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
he likes to eat more.

82
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
Come.

83
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
No.

84
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Eat it.

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
I'll let you go.

86
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
Sir.

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Don't eat it.

88
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
We'll die together.

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
You

90
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
hate me?

91
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
No.

92
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
No.

93
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
You still come here often.

94
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Whenever I feel soft,

95
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I come here to see.

96
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
Think about what happened here.

97
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
I feel sad.

98
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
I know what you're thinking.

99
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Back then,

100
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
your lover

101
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
could have a happy ending.

102
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,860
It was over.

103
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
But I

104
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
didn't even have a chance to die.

105
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
My death is coming.

106
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
What did he say to you?

107
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
The bullet came out of my body.

108
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm afraid I can't live anymore.

109
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I'll beg him again.

110
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
It's useless.

111
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
He's very hardworking.

112
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
He won't listen to anyone.

113
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm afraid.

114
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I'll think of a way

115
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
to keep you alive.

116
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Yun Yang and Yun Ming can't stop him.

117
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Can you?

118
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
If it's really the time,

119
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
I'll think of a way to send you out.

120
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Why did you help me?

121
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
If you can get out alive,

122
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
I'll be happy for you.

123
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
Why are you here?

124
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
What?

125
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Don't you welcome me?

126
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
I'm here

127
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
to remind you

128
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
that dogs

129
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
should be like dogs.

130
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Don't underestimate

131
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
your owner's feelings.

132
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
Don't try to

133
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,860
defy your owner.

134
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I'm here to help you.

135
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
I'm here to help you.

136
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
You're your owner.

137
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
We're both dogs in this manor.

138
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,860
You're not more noble than me.

139
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
I have a chance

140
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
to make us human.

141
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
What do you mean?

142
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Are you going to be the owner

143
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,860
or the young owner?

144
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
Brother,

145
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
it's my fault

146
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
for what happened between me and sister-in-law.

147
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
Please punish me.

148
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Punish you?

149
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
Think carefully about

150
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
what I told you.

151
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm willing to do whatever you want.

152
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
But

153
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I have a condition.

154
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,860
Say it.

155
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
I hope you can let Hong Xiu go.

156
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Brother,

157
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm willing to stay by your side forever.

158
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm willing to die for you.

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Yu Ming,

160
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,860
are you asking me for a condition?

161
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Please, Brother.

162
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Please punish me.

163
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Brother Yu was killed by the fish.

164
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
After many trials,

165
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
he was soft and tough.

166
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,860
He was used to beat horses.

167
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
But if my family made a mistake,

168
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
they would be punished to death.

169
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I'm with Brother Yu

170
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
just to tell myself

171
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
I'm always a member of the family.

172
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Yu Ming,

173
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,860
which house did you break into?

174
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,860
I...

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm with sister-in-law.

176
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
When was the first time?

177
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Where?

178
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
The night before the wedding.

179
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
It was...

180
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
It was here.

181
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Yu Ming,

182
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
please let me go.

183
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
I'm begging you.

184
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Please,

185
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
let me go.

186
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Please.

187
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Please.

188
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Please.

189
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Please.

190
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Please.

191
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Please.

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
Please.

193
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Please.

194
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Please.

195
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Please.

196
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Please.

197
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
You promised me

198
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
you would protect me.

199
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
You're my sister-in-law now.

201
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,860
So what?

202
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Have you forgotten?

203
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
When we first met,

204
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
I wasn't engaged to your brother.

205
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
But...

206
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
But what?

207
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Yu Ming,

208
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
in this Peach Blossom Manor,

209
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
I only have you.

210
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
If I have to be pregnant with the Yun family's child,

211
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
I only have you.

212
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
No.

213
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Don't do it.

214
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
I can't let my brother down.

215
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
He thought he could control everything.

216
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
I have to tell him.

217
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
He can never control a girl's heart.

218
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Which family law did you break?

220
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
I...

221
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
I'm sorry, brother.

222
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Let me ask you.

223
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
What's the purpose of the family law?

224
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,860
The family law of the ancestors

225
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
is to make us remember our brother, Qin Shan.

226
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
It's good that you remember.

227
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Now the manor is in danger.

228
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,860
You and I have to fight against our common enemy.

229
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
You and I have to fight against our common enemy.

230
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
As for the matter between you and Hong Xiu,

231
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I can pretend I don't know.

232
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
You and I are brothers.

233
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
To me, a woman is nothing.

234
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Not to mention Hong Xiu.

235
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
If it's done,

236
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I can let Hong Xiu go.

237
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
But if she dares to escape before it's done,

238
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
and ruins my business,

239
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,860
I won't let the previous one go.

240
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
You know,

241
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
the whole Peach Blossom Manor is under my watch.

242
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
If I don't have my watch,

243
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
no one can escape.

244
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
Thank you, brother.

245
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
But the family law

246
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
still has to be accepted.

247
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
The blood I shed is all brother's.

248
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
My life is all brother's.

249
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
My life is all brother's.

252
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
I'll take care of everything.

253
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Only true love can't be defeated.
