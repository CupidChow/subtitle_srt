1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everything

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is always coincidentally integrated

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
through the harmony of life and death.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I am fire,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and Yunyang is gold.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Although gold and fire cannot be combined,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
gold and fire can form a golden elixir.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is also a kind of harmony.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And you are the most important.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am important.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are a pool of water.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Water is everything.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This mountain villa cannot live without you.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The elixir furnace is just a dead thing.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Only you are the best living elixir furnace.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
One day,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I will make your internal elixir burst.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If I make the elixir burst,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
will I die?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Life and death are your life.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It is your life that you should feel honored.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I will let you enjoy the wealth of the world,

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and let you suffer the pain of love.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Only in this way,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you can get rid of the popularity and the love.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Only in this way,

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you can make the best inner elixir.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Aren't you afraid that I will tell Yunyang?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He is my son.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I know him better than anyone.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone has what he wants.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know what he wants.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But what he wants is not you.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I can promise you that

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
when you make the elixir burst,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can bury your body

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
outside the Peach Blossom Villa.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know that

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you are the only one

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
who can have such a precious thing.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your inner elixir

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is about to be released.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ha ha ha.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why did this pillar offend you?

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Have you seen Hongxiu?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Maybe he went to talk to sister.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ha ha ha.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Father is addicted to the immortality.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He wants to ask for elixir.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In my opinion,

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it's all false.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Brother,

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
what do you want to do?

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of course,

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to do what I've been wanting to do.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't want to repeat my mother's mistakes.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She will only force us to die

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
if we keep the seal.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Have you thought it through?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I knew

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you would always be on my side.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If father asks you to go to his room again tomorrow,

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
just tell me.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll go for you.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Brother,

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's my turn now.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are weak.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Take good care of yourself.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But...

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's nothing.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Just listen to me.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It won't be too long.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing, Master Yan?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Shh.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Be quiet.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Be quiet.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The whole manor is their eyes.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We have to be quiet.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What did you say?

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I just said

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yun Yang, Yun Xiu, Hong Xiu,

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they all have an evil eye.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tell me.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who is the murderer?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have some ideas.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If I report to His Majesty,

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the Peach Blossom Manor will be taken as a flat land.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The golden silkworm I raised

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
has grown up

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and become the eagle in the eyes of the master.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you let go of sister,

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll shut my mouth.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh my god.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh my god.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh my god.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh my god.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh my god.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh my god.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Maybe

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
it's like this.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you let go of my sister,

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,220
puis pasa Ã  nous.

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,400
Then time will come trying to stop us.

113
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,340
Glad to hear my message.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:39,240
and

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,420
Yes.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,240
Release my sword.

117
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,920
Your Empire is too strong to simply depend on others.

118
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,900
So,

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,480
Mr? He took turns

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,720
animating the people of Yunxiu and Yunyang.

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
But he opens the institute with lots of crew.

123
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,560
They are all free- blanket hundreds.

124
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
You go.

125
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Okay.

126
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Anyway, I came to the mountain villa to investigate Yunxiu.

127
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Brother.

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Go back.

129
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Listen to me.

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Go.

131
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Don't peek.

132
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Come here.

133
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Ming'er.

134
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
You've grown up.

135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
There are some things

136
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
you should know.

137
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I've been sick since I was a child.

138
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
I can't stand it.

139
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Father, how can you...

140
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
As my son,

141
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
you should be more strict.

142
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Ming'er.

143
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Yunbin.

144
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Are you okay?

145
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Let's go.

146
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Yunbin.

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Yunmin.

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
I took the wrong pill.

149
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
I can't see.

150
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I'll take you in.

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Go back.

152
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Brother.

153
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Father.

154
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Why are you here?

155
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
You should call Yunmin.

156
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Yunmin is ill.

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
I'll take care of him.

158
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
You haven't recovered yet.

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Can you take care of him?

160
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Don't worry, father.

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
I was stronger than Yunmin when I was a child.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
If so,

163
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
let's get started.

164
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Yunmin.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Yunmin.

166
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Yunmin.

167
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Yunmin.

168
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Yunmin.

169
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Yunmin.

170
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Yunmin.

171
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Yunmin.

172
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Yunmin.

173
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Yunmin.

174
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Yunmin.

175
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Yunmin.

176
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Yunmin.

177
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Yunmin.

178
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Yunmin.

179
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Yunmin.

180
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Yunmin.

181
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Yunmin.

182
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Yunmin.

183
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Yunmin.

184
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Yunmin.

185
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Yunmin.

186
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Yunmin.

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Yunmin.

188
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Yunmin.

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Yunmin.

190
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Yunmin.

191
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Yunmin.

192
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Yunmin.

193
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Yunmin.

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Yunmin.

195
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Yunmin.

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
