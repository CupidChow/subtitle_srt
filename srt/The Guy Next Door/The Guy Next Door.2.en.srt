1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:15,473
If you make a fuss again, I'll write your story and kill you

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,225
Like the main character in my novel

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,230
Wow, it's scary, as expected from a novelist

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,029
But to my eyes, you look like a murderer too

5
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,452
Even those eyes that shine in the darkness

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,497
This is crazy

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,916
You too

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,422
Otherwise, you wouldn't have thought of pushing me in this situation

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,662
It's noisy

10
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:34,803
After midnight, I will only play the guitar with earphones

11
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:40,517
Instead, Mr. Ossian brings me an iced Americano from the convenience store

12
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,686
once every two days

13
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,481
Why me?

14
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,067
It's your noise, so why should I buy it?

15
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,238
We have to be fair

16
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,493
You keep your night safe,

17
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,205
and I take my inspiration from it

18
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,960
Besides, don't forget that I can interrupt

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,462
Mr. Osian night at any time

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,216
Isn't this a pretty good deal?

21
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,096
Why do I have to suffer from insomnia because of you?

22
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,473
What do I get?

23
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,977
Instead of getting my noise,

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,146
you'll also get my presence

25
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,235
My song will be the background music in your novel,

26
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,822
and my face will be the main character

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,287
You can't get away from me anymore

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,040
That's your opinion

29
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,420
You will soon find out that I am not alone

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,338
in my thoughts

31
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,719
Like the protagonist in your novel,

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,930
I am your rule-breaker

33
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,227
Besides, the fact that I can disturb you at any time

34
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
That's the crux of this deal

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,279
The characters in my novels believe I can control them

36
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,780
You too

37
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,783
You are nothing to me

38
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,995
You are just a noisy guy next door

39
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,207
That needs to be proven

40
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,629
Whether my existence is noise to you or not

41
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,009
If you don't want to listen to my music, take this deal

42
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,556
Do you hate proving that you won so much?

43
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,133
Crazy

44
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,845
I was 25 years old and still falling apart

45
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:08,182
without having accomplished anything

46
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:14,147
But strangely enough, the noise from the next room seemed to mask my collapse

47
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,608
Perhaps he and I are each trying to find a glimmer of light

48
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,904
in our own ruins
