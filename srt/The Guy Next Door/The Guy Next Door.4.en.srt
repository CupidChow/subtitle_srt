1
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,806
Give it a try

2
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,144
I can express your novel with my song

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,940
Maybe you can express my song in a novel too?

4
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,405
great

5
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:43,918
My night is your noise?

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,467
Hmm... not bad?

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,970
Then I'll try it this time

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,931
Super absorbent

9
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,186
Some of you who even lock up your murderous

10
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,187
Stop it

11
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,990
Hearing you talk reminded me of a fun game

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,410
game?

13
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,789
Improvised Advertising Copy Competition

14
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,958
Is there such a game?

15
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,668
Then I'll go first

16
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:33,426
Super-strong absorption, now even capable of absorbing murder

17
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,978
Now it's the writer's turn

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,196
One drop and tonight is a frictionless night

19
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:23,351
Tonight will be a friction-free night

20
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:56,176
The murderer in your novel kisses even in situations like this

21
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,433
But I wrote that murderer dead on the third day, you know

22
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,439
I enjoy taking risks

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,086
Next time, would you mind knocking on the door to my heart with this hand?

24
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:40,094
Thus you shall know what my inner voice is

25
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,768
Next time

26
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,022
please

27
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,910
We&#39;re roommates now, you know

28
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,287
we should have at least some emergency contact information

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,957
One team?

30
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,417
If you have any complaints, complain to me

31
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,796
This is my number, save it

32
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,118
Next time, please give me a better ending in your story

33
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,624
At the very least, one must write a good line of dialogue

34
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,551
I found a scene to use as dialogue
