1
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,481
I can't sleep... I want to hear your voice...

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,984
what are you doing?

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,364
Sian, your hands are really quite icy

4
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,328
Here, take the drink I brought for you. I hope you can hear what`s in my heart

5
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,040
Let go of my hand

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,046
When you find yourself unable to write, I shall be here at any time, ready to listen to you

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,191
Shall we do a test of courage?

8
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,571
I won't fall for your tricks anymore

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,118
I'm not kidding, seriously

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,123
Close your eyes and look back once

11
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,251
I'll catch you before my heart beats seven times

12
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,630
Why seven heartbeats?

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,051
l risk my life for every beat of your heart, I must know why this game is set up this way

14
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,350
I love you， Oh Sian

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,686
It takes Oh Sian seven seconds to say “I love you”

16
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,316
You made the rules

17
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,861
Your heart is your heart, why risk my life there?

18
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,574
That's what love is all about

19
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,247
Regardless of your will, as I please

20
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,104
Here, promise

21
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,480
Seven times

22
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,943
one

23
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,320
two

24
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,531
three

25
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,741
four

26
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,120
five

27
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,205
six

28
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,065
ah

29
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,070
Are you... are you okay?

30
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,160
I’m fine

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,497
Your hair smells so good

32
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,500
Just let me hug you like this

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,753
until my heart calms down

34
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,787
Well now it's my turn

35
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,381
one

36
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,509
two

37
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,928
three

38
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,264
Four

39
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,974
five

40
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,726
six

41
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,478
seven

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,910
Oh, that's a breach of contract

43
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,292
Villains in novels always talk a lot of nonsense

44
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,808
So you're using me as a villain?
