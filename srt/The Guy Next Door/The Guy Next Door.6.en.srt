1
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:40,248
How did you spend the night alone with such a cold body?

2
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,793
what are you doing?

3
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,942
You`ve torn my clothes to shreds

4
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,696
Then I shall punish you

5
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,182
I really can't run away now

6
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:54,364
Actually, insomnia is something I got because I was scared

7
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:02,288
So you rely on me every night, don`t you?

8
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:13,216
I rather like the fact that, though separated by walls, we can still hear each other's presence

9
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,468
I love it so much

10
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,764
Whenever I hear you

11
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,142
Osian typing, I felt like

12
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,687
I wasn't alone

13
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,611
That voice made me feel safe

14
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:41,035
Shall we use music to soothe?

15
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,500
Then shall we give it a try?

16
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:10,773
This song is so sad

17
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,780
That's because you're tired

18
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,622
Because my insomnia and your insomnia overlapped

19
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,635
But whenever I feel uneasy, I can always hear the sound of your typing

20
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,809
That's my mind,

21
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,647
noisy and anxious

22
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:56,694
But whenever I feel uneasy, I can always hear the sound of your typing

23
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,403
Next time, I don't want to bite the thread; I want to bite your lips

24
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,032
If you fancy biting my lips, you`d best be careful, you know

25
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,702
Because I adore being captured by you
