1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,214
<i>At twenty-five,</i>

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>I was a person without dreams</i>

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,721
<i>No, I didn't even feel worthy of dreaming</i>

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,474
<i>Life in Seoul was tough, and even my night shift at a convenience store</i>

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>brought in bills that I couldn't afford every month</i>

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>The manuscript keeps getting rejected</i>

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,401
<i>My name is nowhere to be found</i>

8
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>Writing at night was my only escape</i>

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:40,665
<i>But even that was being consumed by unfamiliar noises</i>

10
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>It's very noisy late at night. Please be quiet</i>

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,301
Hey, you're on the verge of a murder right now?

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,304
Let's focus

13
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,527
There's a reason why serial killers in novels are created

14
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,322
Things that interfere with my work

15
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,033
All are subject to removal

16
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,329
You dare touch my coffee?

17
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:14,634
<i>At eighteen, I stayed up all night dreaming of success</i>

18
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,933
<i>That night was an opportunity and excitement for me</i>

19
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:31,151
<i>But the night of my twenty-fifth year only brought me a mountain of debt and apathy</i>

20
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>Now I'm afraid of the night coming</i>

21
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:41,411
<i>Sleepless nights are eating away at me</i>

22
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,375
It's past midnight

23
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,711
Who plays guitar at this hour?

24
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,298
The person who lives in the room next door?

25
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,968
Sorry, I just moved here

26
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,638
I have trouble sleeping in unfamiliar places

27
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,059
I thought this neighborhood would be quiet at night

28
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,355
Because of that noise,

29
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,525
all the characters in my novel died

30
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,985
because of the noise

31
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,529
Oh, you’re a novelist?

32
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,489
What genre is it?

33
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,079
I was wondering if I could be the subject of a novel

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,626
There are no such insignificant characters in my novels

35
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,714
And it's better to live with such curiosity

36
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,301
but

37
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,891
I didn't know the person living next door to me was this sensitive

38
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,315
I wonder if I'll collapse from stress from the sound of my guitar?

39
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,947
I can't concentrate anyway

40
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,742
My writing and my life

41
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,329
Compared to the noise in my head

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,082
Your noise is nothing

43
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,338
Actually, I also have a habit of playing the guitar

44
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,927
If I don't hit it, I can't sleep anymore

45
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,517
So if my practice is not background noise to you but suffering

46
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,310
sorry

47
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,577
Are you trying to stop me?

48
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,421
The tips of my fingers are black

49
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,299
Is it because you're writing?

50
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,305
B-because I smoke

51
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,643
Then you were someone who needed fire like me

52
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,107
woah
