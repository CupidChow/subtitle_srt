1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,932
Dozens of manuscript

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,727
Countless negative reviews

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:25,066
The self-esteem I had built up crumbled like a sand castle

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,486
I can barely breathe at night

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,866
Now I've become someone who can't even write a single line

6
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,830
My life was like a stopped clock

7
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,878
Then I heard the ticking of an unfamiliar clock

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,758
Excuse me, could I borrow your charger?

9
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,094
My charger is broken

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,138
What is it?

11
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,931
It's type C

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,943
thank you

13
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,945
I'll return it to you tomorrow

14
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:33,426
It's night so I can't sleep

15
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,307
Oh yes

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:47,899
So sorry for coming so late at night

17
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,737
Well... yes

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,949
I'll go

19
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,226
excuse me

20
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,521
Why?

21
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,232
could I borrow a lighter?

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,247
Why does Oh Sian consistently write novels centred on murder?

23
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,420
For the dead cannot voice their displeasure at my work

24
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,428
then

25
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,100
If I die, will you write me as a criminal? Or

26
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,977
As a victim?

27
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,651
It depends on my mood

28
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,029
That's good

29
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,408
Just as you can read people's minds through words, I can do it through songs

30
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,205
Is that why?

31
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:12,126
I feel like your novel and my song are very similar

32
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,382
Would you like to express your novel with this song?

33
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,219
What are you talking about?
