1
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,947
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,936
Boss, here's your phone.

3
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,441
Clean this place up

4
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,528
then call the cops.

5
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,238
Oh, right.

6
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,533
The NIS raided our gambling joint.
Those sons of bitches.

7
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,243
When?

8
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,744
Just now. Those bastards.

9
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,079
Why are you telling me now?

10
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,290
You useless piece of shit.

11
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:06,375
Damn it.

12
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,225
Freeze!

13
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,272
Step aside.

14
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,149
Move aside!

15
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,872
Pack everything up
and shut down the factory for now.

16
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,956
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

17
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,792
It's a Level One air-raid warning.

18
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,253
Let's move quickly and accurately,
just as we trained.

19
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,597
I am

20
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:04,766
the owner of this business
who got attacked by the robbers.

21
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,312
You have a system that monitors
the illegal gambling joint.

22
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:09,771
The one upstairs?

23
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:13,483
That's also my business.
Everything's all connected.

24
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,069
Man, these assholes.

25
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,579
Call for backup

26
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:27,206
and secure any and all evidence.

27
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,457
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,417
Yes.

29
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,127
Make the request quickly.

30
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:00,239
EPISODE 4: OPERATION;
THE 500 BILLION DISTRIBUTION PLAN

31
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,449
- What's wrong with you?
- Be quiet.

32
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,076
I own this business!

33
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,036
Man, what the fuck?

34
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:34,815
I always turn off

35
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,775
nearby surveillance cameras
during live fights.

36
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:39,194
What do we do?

37
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,906
What do you think?

38
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,827
Turn yourself in.

39
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,870
You put me up for it.

40
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,123
So?

41
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,083
You want to drag me into this?

42
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,794
You know I'm up for a promotion.

43
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:59,756
I'm asking you to pull some strings
with your connections and help me.

44
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,758
My connections?

45
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,219
Who are my connections?

46
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,638
Well, I wouldn't know.

47
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,849
But others say they're as powerful...

48
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,602
Listen to this punk.

49
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:15,522
You've become quite a talker,
haven't you?

50
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,232
You're almost finished.

51
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,734
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,279
I'll let you get off
with six months of probation.

53
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,656
So turn yourself in
to Internal Affairs.

54
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,659
What's wrong?

55
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,202
Is that not good enough?

56
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,788
No, sir. I appreciate your help.

57
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:39,129
- That's more like it. Right?
- Yes, sir.

58
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,048
You punk.

59
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,859
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

60
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,532
Please speak.

61
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:11,328
I had no idea
Han Soo-hyun knew about that place.

62
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,122
I kept trying to reach you.

63
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,250
What?

64
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:18,835
Yes.

65
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,462
I understand.

66
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,236
Let's get started.

67
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,405
I need to eat my food too.

68
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:47,697
We might have to spend the night up.

69
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,324
So come on, eat up.

70
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,701
How far did I get
during the testimony yesterday?

71
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,745
Forget it. I'm done!

72
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,164
I'm just saying, we should eat first.

73
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,083
Why are you so extreme?

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,043
Hey, take everything away.

75
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,628
Is now really the time
for a hamburger?

76
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,802
You said J went
to Jang Joong-hyuk's hideout

77
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,887
and gave him a business proposal.

78
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:16,893
Now, what's next?

79
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,483
3 MONTHS AGO

80
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,298
Have you been well?

81
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,308
I said I'd come back for you.

82
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,903
Darn it.

83
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:11,490
I almost lost my precious database.

84
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,081
I heard you were back in the game.

85
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,209
Jeez, how long has it been?

86
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,170
Five years?

87
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,838
Drop three years from that.

88
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,008
I had to rot in the pen
for three years because of you.

89
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,344
I hear you're laundering money.

90
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:34,513
It doesn't sound like you'll need me.

91
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,931
Why are you here?

92
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,265
Did you miss me?

93
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,980
You're going around
dropping something like this.

94
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,233
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

95
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:51,488
When did you master
counterfeiting the Hong Kong dollar?

96
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,242
So?

97
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,702
Why don't you join me
for one serious job?

98
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:58,912
"Serious"?

99
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,414
What do you mean by that?

100
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,502
That this time,
you won't stab me in the back?

101
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,672
Do you mean
that you won't kill anyone?

102
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,340
What?

103
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,267
- It wasn't me.
- No?

104
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,893
The warehouse explosion.

105
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,229
That wasn't you?

106
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:29,109
Man, this is just...

107
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,030
What will it take
for you to accept my offer this time?

108
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,783
Would you join me if I said...

109
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,662
I was behind
what happened five years ago?

110
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:43,331
Then I'll admit it.

111
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:44,958
I'll do that 100 times,
even 1,000 times.

112
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,043
As many times as you want.

113
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:50,297
Don't think you can
talk your way out of this.

114
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,340
Be honest.

115
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,801
Tell the truth.

116
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,595
The truth?

117
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,055
Then will you believe me?

118
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,391
If you tell the truth.

119
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,062
It wasn't me.

120
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,236
How brazen are you?

121
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,865
You came to find me,
as if nothing had happened

122
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,075
after that horrendous thing you did

123
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,369
just to offer me another job?

124
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,495
You know what?

125
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,664
If you join me this time

126
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,584
- we can fix that misunderstanding.
- Don't be ridiculous.

127
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,760
I've left your portion in the bank
to earn interest over five years.

128
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,387
In today's world of Bitcoins
and NFT projects

129
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,015
real currencies are disappearing

130
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:46,269
and even counterfeiting
will soon disappear into the past.

131
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,479
Your technique

132
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,939
will fade into memory.

133
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:52,776
Let's do it right, one last time

134
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,612
using the counterfeit bill of dreams

135
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,614
supernote.

136
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,700
Soo-hyun.

137
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,541
Come find me tomorrow.

138
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,502
Okay?

139
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,354
You didn't even
recognize your partner.

140
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:31,439
If that hit me, I'd be a goner.

141
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,984
Why didn't you tell me beforehand
that J was going to be here?

142
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,696
I couldn't find time to reach out.

143
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,132
Is Yeon working with Soo-hyun?

144
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,426
Oh, that little kid.

145
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,428
Of course, she's with Soo-hyun.

146
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,806
That girl, Yeon.

147
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:51,352
I always knew she was a good hacker

148
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:55,315
but I didn't know she was good enough
to hack crypto wallets.

149
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:59,152
We need her skills
for this plan to work

150
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,695
so make sure she comes tomorrow.

151
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,821
Come on.

152
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,490
Don't you trust me, Boss?

153
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,241
It's me, Fixer.

154
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,786
I'll make sure she comes,
so don't worry about it.

155
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:09,662
Seriously.

156
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:12,207
I don't trust you, you punk.

157
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:13,833
How am I supposed to?

158
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,960
Come on.

159
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:17,504
Jeez.

160
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,009
It's been so long, Soo-hyun.

161
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,437
Move your car!

162
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,189
- I said move your car!
- Here, valet.

163
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,157
You should have shut the door.

164
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,120
Who's she?

165
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:55,166
These days, serial numbers
are used to verify authenticity

166
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,918
so to get them

167
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,379
we have to hack
the Korean Mint Corporation's server.

168
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:02,215
Meet Yeon, a renowned hacker.

169
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,760
I was going to start this,
counting only on Soo-hyun's skills.

170
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,136
I'm counting on you.

171
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,222
I'll decide after I hear the plan.

172
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,027
So?

173
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,071
Whose portrait are we using
for the supernote?

174
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,198
- Madam Saimdang.
- How many?

175
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:28,825
- A million bills.
- A million?

176
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,286
- And the distribution?
- I'll use 50 billion in fake bills

177
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,830
to score 200 billion worth of drugs.

178
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:35,623
Then I'll split them
and sell them to the mafia

179
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,417
in Colombia and Mexico
for 100 billion each.

180
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,961
Ask Fixer for more details.

181
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:45,383
- How much do I get?
- After the ingredients and expenses

182
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,845
it'll come to around 200 billion,
and we'll split that 6-4.

183
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,221
Of course, I get six.

184
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,723
Six to four?

185
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,809
So 200 billion times 4,
divided by 10...

186
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,980
Forty billion.

187
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,486
I'm in.

188
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,780
I'm totally in.

189
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,660
You're taking 120 billion alone

190
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,537
while we split the rest?

191
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:15,622
What's wrong?

192
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,415
You don't like it?

193
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,001
You already know
that in this line of work

194
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:23,212
planning and distribution
are more important than production.

195
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,341
No way.

196
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:29,177
I love the idea of splitting.

197
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,637
What's the schedule like?

198
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,349
Let's keep it tight.
Two weeks of setup

199
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,893
ten weeks of production,
so that's three months in total.

200
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:40,730
But we're missing someone
who is the most important.

201
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:43,107
Intaglio printing machine.

202
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,109
You can't make supernote without it.

203
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,654
You mean that we need
Kkangsooni, the Iron Curtain, right?

204
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,908
I tried to look for her a few times,
but I couldn't reach her.

205
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:55,411
She's been working on the machine
for five years

206
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,956
so she should be done by now.

207
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,751
GANGNAM MASSAGE
PICK YOUR COLLEGE GIRL AMONG 50!

208
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,552
Look at this.

209
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,055
Did you cut these?

210
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,265
Look what you've done.

211
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,559
Do you know how much
one piece of this paper costs?

212
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,145
It's enough to feed a starving kid

213
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,022
back in your mother country!

214
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm saying this piece of paper

215
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,485
is as valuable as your life.

216
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,821
Pull yourself together!

217
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:32,573
Man, you never stop talking.

218
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:34,867
Have you ever been exiled
to the Aoji Coal Mine?

219
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,704
I've been there twice.

220
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,372
Have you ever killed a man?

221
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,875
If you haven't, don't mess with me.

222
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,128
Is Ms. Park Gwang-sun here?

223
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:46,921
Who are you?

224
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:48,715
I am Park Gwang-sun.

225
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,138
Look who this is.

226
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,188
It's been so long, Kkangsooni.

227
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:13,948
Have you been well?

228
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:19,662
Anyway

229
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,874
who's that little punk
acting smug over there?

230
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:23,958
Me?

231
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:26,961
- You can see me?
- Oh, dear.

232
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,755
You don't seem
to have anything in your head.

233
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,633
- What about my request?
- Come this way.

234
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,610
Come in.

235
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,573
All right.

236
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,743
Wait, we're going in this way?

237
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,790
Be careful.

238
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,315
I may not have been well-off

239
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,400
but I never wasted
the investment money.

240
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,653
I put everything into this machine.

241
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,950
This is what you use to make money?

242
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,298
BANK OF KOREA
FIFTY THOUSAND WON

243
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,026
This is amazing.

244
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:57,904
Nice.

245
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,617
Kkangsooni.

246
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,226
Serial numbers, hacked.

247
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,274
Generate ten million new numbers

248
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,235
and register them on
the Korea Mint Corporation's server.

249
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,319
Okay.

250
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,284
Is it going well?

251
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,497
Hey, throw in 11 million numbers,
and we can split the million.

252
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,296
Is it going well, Kkangsooni?

253
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,978
Now, five stripes will appear
at the tips of the bill...

254
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,857
and fine prints on the apricot tree

255
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,068
will show through intaglio printing.

256
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,570
This completely incapacitates

257
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,447
the forgery prevention aspects.

258
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,657
Let me start the machine.

259
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,835
- Drink up!
- Cheers!

260
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,135
Darn it.

261
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,261
- Good work.
- A shot at it all.

262
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,976
On the day we finished printing
all 50 billion supernotes

263
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,730
Yeon pestered J
to go party at a wine bar.

264
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:21,774
And

265
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:25,945
I secretly switched out
every single bill in his wallet

266
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:29,407
with the freshly minted counterfeits.

267
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:36,414
- That'll be 2.75 million won.
- Here's 2.75 million.

268
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:39,583
Here.

269
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:46,632
2 WEEKS AGO

270
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,855
I'm calling to report circulation
of counterfeit money in the market.

271
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,898
Would you like
to share your identity?

272
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:05,943
No, I wish to remain anonymous.

273
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,737
We always keep the informant safe.

274
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,531
That way,
the tip becomes more credible.

275
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:14,034
You'll be able to check it right away
at the address I shared.

276
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,268
Where did you get this?

277
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,145
Spill it.

278
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,069
It was perfect.

279
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,654
So

280
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:53,282
I thought I could deceive everyone.

281
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,493
But

282
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,705
J found out I reported to the NIS

283
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:02,082
- Get inside.
- and locked up Yeon and me.

284
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:10,090
Supernotes are tough to make,
but you were all finished.

285
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,094
He didn't need you two anymore.
You two were like ticking bombs.

286
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,179
No.

287
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:18,516
He wanted to change
the distribution plan

288
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:20,559
and forced me to do more work

289
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:22,561
by threatening Yeon's life.

290
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:23,896
What did he make you do?

291
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,571
And what was the new plan?

292
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,576
He printed more supernotes.

293
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,496
Nine million bills.

294
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,874
With the initial 50 billion won...

295
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:47,836
that comes to...

296
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,921
Five hundred billion?

297
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:58,639
And then?

298
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:00,599
And then what?

299
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:04,687
On the day
we finished printing 500 billion won

300
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,731
he suddenly moved hideouts.

301
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,775
2 DAYS AGO

302
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,615
Get Yeon inside too.

303
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:18,534
Where?

304
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,953
- In the container?
- Yes.

305
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,205
Come on.

306
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:24,707
- Go.
- That's right.

307
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,503
Soo-hyun.

308
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,715
Stay here.

309
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:38,220
Clean up everything.

310
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,891
You said you'd do anything I say.

311
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:44,643
Right?

312
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:50,357
Lock the door.

313
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:17,259
And then

314
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,137
he called you out
to the port the next day, and "bang"?

315
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:23,641
He probably
couldn't trust me anymore.

316
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,809
He got what he wanted

317
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:27,519
so I wasn't useful anymore.

318
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:29,563
Seriously?

319
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,817
So now, 500 billion won
in counterfeits is being unleashed?

320
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:36,987
Wait.

321
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,448
With the plate and intaglio machine

322
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:41,408
he can print unlimited supernotes.

323
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,329
This is driving me crazy.

324
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:46,997
How will that affect the money supply

325
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,582
and the inflation rate?

326
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,250
I get what you mean.

327
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:51,877
But

328
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,546
that's all I know.

329
00:27:58,801 --> 00:27:59,802
Listen up.

330
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,012
I'll erase

331
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,390
your name and Yeon's
from the case file.

332
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,726
Then I'll put him on the wanted list
after you leave Korea.

333
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:09,395
How does that sound?

334
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:13,357
You rot in prison for three years
because of that jerk.

335
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,693
Think about it.

336
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,429
Yeon.

337
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:45,597
Can we talk?

338
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,365
Where was she taken?

339
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:04,533
Yeon.

340
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,411
You knew Soo-hyun went to the NIS.

341
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:10,080
She went to the NIS?

342
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:11,165
You didn't know?

343
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:15,919
You really didn't know?

344
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,171
No.

345
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,923
Well, if you say so.

346
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:27,931
She got into a small accident.

347
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:29,767
So the police got involved.

348
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,351
But in the process

349
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:35,647
Soo-hyun asked the NIS
to let her talk to Cha Ki-tae.

350
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:37,274
You see.

351
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,567
Why?

352
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,903
There's no reason for her to do that.

353
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,405
She got cornered after being caught

354
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,782
reporting to the NIS

355
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,992
so she decided to walk in herself.

356
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:50,454
- Even so, she...
- Again

357
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:52,122
just like five years ago

358
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,792
she'll end up taking the full blame

359
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,669
and getting locked up.

360
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,148
Jang Joong-hyuk has

361
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,818
powerful people behind him.

362
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:24,696
That was why Cha Ki-tae
lost his case during investigation

363
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:26,824
and why Soo-hyun
ended up taking the blame.

364
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:29,159
But this time

365
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:34,122
I plan to make use of that power.

366
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,793
I will ask them
to guarantee our safety

367
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:40,796
by offering half of 500 billion won.

368
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:42,798
And of course

369
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,343
Soo-hyun is included in that group.

370
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:53,100
How am I supposed
to believe everything you say?

371
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:55,894
And if you don't?

372
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,730
Will you just leave her there?

373
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,858
We have to do something.

374
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:04,736
I know

375
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:07,114
we can get her out safely.

376
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,866
And to do that

377
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,492
your talent

378
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,203
is absolutely necessary.

379
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,164
MYEONGSEONG THRIFT INSTITUTION

380
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:19,209
I just need a little more
to take the lead

381
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,752
but I don't have enough funds.

382
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,755
We're only three months away.
It sounds like trouble.

383
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,050
You talked like you could find
enough funds just yesterday.

384
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:29,887
- What's going on?
- I've run into a sudden problem.

385
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,848
I've been finding more money
in another way.

386
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,600
You must try harder.

387
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:37,311
You already know I must
get my hands dirty to find money

388
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:41,315
that won't cause any scandals
for candidates of both parties

389
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,568
that aren't from a corporation
or a slush fund.

390
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:48,322
MYEONGSEONG THRIFT INSTITUTION
CHAIRMAN BANG GEUK-HYUN

391
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,490
- Representative Choi.
- Yes?

392
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,910
I've been extorting money
only from criminals

393
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,745
to make sure there's no trouble.

394
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,581
This isn't something
that everyone can do.

395
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,541
I know. I know that very well.

396
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,752
You don't seem to
appreciate my hard work.

397
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:02,836
I'm disappointed.

398
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,547
I'm asking you
to try just a little harder

399
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:06,840
so please don't be disappointed.

400
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,343
I'll take responsibility
and do my part until the end

401
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:13,639
so you have to help me
rise to the top of finance.

402
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:16,808
Both parties are aware
of your hard work, Chairman Bang.

403
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:20,270
I've also been emphasizing it
until people got annoyed

404
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:21,813
so don't worry.

405
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:24,066
You suddenly can't meet
the funding deadline

406
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:26,568
because of the gambling incident
in Incheon, right?

407
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:31,448
Yes, that factory was in charge
of making over 70% of the funds

408
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:34,493
but that incident
put a halt on everything.

409
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:37,287
Was it him again?
Did he get himself into trouble?

410
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,166
Chief Prosecutor,
please step in and help out.

411
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:44,419
Well, I took an emergency measure
after getting the call last night.

412
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:47,506
But I mean, in this day and age?

413
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,257
Has he lost his mind?

414
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:53,136
SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
CHIEF PROSECUTOR PARK DAE-SIK

415
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:58,100
But he's amazingly talented,
making something from nothing

416
00:32:58,475 --> 00:32:59,601
when it comes to fundraising.

417
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't care how talented he is.

418
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:06,441
If he continues
to cross over the line

419
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,068
we'll have to cut him off.

420
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:11,363
Otherwise, we'll end up harmed.

421
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,074
I'll talk to him.

422
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:36,054
I've been anxious
since you kept a low profile.

423
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:38,515
This time,
you got yourself into huge trouble.

424
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,145
I raised your status,
so shouldn't you live accordingly?

425
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:51,695
I believe the contract
we signed a decade ago says

426
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:56,074
we do not meddle
with each other's lifestyles.

427
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,076
Yes.

428
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,078
Ever since I met you

429
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,663
I got to join the Eul Society.

430
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,624
I was a loan shark
funded by the yakuza

431
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,501
but now I'm the chairman
of a third-tier finance group

432
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:09,254
after taking over eight thrift banks.

433
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:12,299
And that means I'm almost there.

434
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,926
I'm about to enter
the top-tier financial sector

435
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:19,598
and Woorim Financial Group's
chairmanship is just ahead.

436
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:22,392
So be as careful as you can.

437
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,269
Don't let anger control your actions.

438
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,398
Did you handle this incident
so that nothing would happen?

439
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:30,150
Chief Prosecutor Park's already acted

440
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,818
and he said he'd handle everything.

441
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:35,072
Anyway

442
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:37,866
we had to stop the factory,
our biggest source of income

443
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,950
so what do we do now?

444
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,042
We don't have to run
the factory in secret

445
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,627
or meet dangerous kids anymore.

446
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,421
That's a business proposal
that can bring in 300 billion won

447
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:54,257
just by standing around
and looking cool, so take a look.

448
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,267
SUPERNOTE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

449
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,358
Is this really possible?

450
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,573
Take your time to read it,
and feel free to ask questions.

451
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,367
I'll give you
as much time as you need.

452
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,127
KC FINANCIAL GROUP

453
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:01,158
J is about to circulate
500 billion won worth of supernotes.

454
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:06,163
But we're sitting here,
not ready, and losing time.

455
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,167
J's 500 billion won
distribution plan.

456
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:13,503
What could it be?

457
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:32,522
You're about the only person
who would suddenly call me

458
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:35,066
Jang Joong-hyuk, and want to meet me.

459
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,361
It seems like

460
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:41,823
you've been waiting for me to call.

461
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:44,492
Did the business proposal I sent you

462
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,954
keep spinning round and round
on your mind?

463
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,998
What a load of bullshit.

464
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:52,167
You never miss a moment
to act cocky, do you?

465
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,251
Follow me.

466
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,171
I'll show you
the documentary proposal.

467
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:00,342
Man, the weather's so nice.

468
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,596
Good work, everyone.

469
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,431
Hey, you.

470
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,690
