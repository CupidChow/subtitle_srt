1
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,030
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,114
ALL MINORS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STANDARD PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

3
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:34,908
They said Dad can get
his hearing back

4
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,827
if we have money.

5
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,000
Snow Fairy Sugar.

6
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,128
Please turn the snow
that falls like crazy into money

7
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:47,796
like in cartoons.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,799
Help my dad get surgery.

9
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:00,828
It's been about a 7km walk
from Cheonggye Plaza to here.

10
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,413
Are you on a date with me or what?

11
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,916
We'll get attached at this rate!

12
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,752
Stop whining. We're almost there.

13
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,507
What trick are you pulling right now?

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,051
You wanted a documentary proposal.

15
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,638
Just follow me.

16
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:24,184
Seriously.

17
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,021
It had better be that proposal.

18
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,459
It was you who got J into action

19
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,753
and created the supernote.

20
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:52,838
And

21
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,800
you already knew that a counterfeit
100-dollar bill was stuffed

22
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,218
in the dead Choi Do-sik's mouth.

23
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,305
Yes, you know way too much.

24
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,559
That's how you almost got killed.

25
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,521
But here's the thing

26
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,817
you know nothing

27
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,777
about supernote distribution.

28
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,034
I have something to report.

29
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,327
Come back later if it isn't urgent.

30
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,953
The autopsy results are in.

31
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,371
The Incheon murder case.

32
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:28,832
Come outside.

33
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,604
EPISODE 5:
PLAN A AND PLAN B; GAME OF DECEPTION

34
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:53,815
We recovered a bullet fragment

35
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,692
from the victim's thigh
in the liquor warehouse.

36
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,194
It's 9mm Major.

37
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,112
A round that was made
through a workaround in Europe

38
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,114
for use in civilian handguns.

39
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,335
Is this Sergeant Jung?

40
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:14,419
Yes.

41
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,506
It's written in the report.
Give me one moment.

42
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,549
Hey, what was it again?

43
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,970
The bullet inside Choi Do-sik.
What type was it?

44
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,263
It's 9mm Major.

45
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,890
It's called 9mm Major.

46
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,476
It's not something you see in Korea.

47
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:37,776
SINDAP RAILWAY BRIDGE, CHEONGGYECHEON

48
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,237
Back under Park Chung Hee,
they covered up Cheonggyecheon

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,531
with concrete
to build the Cheonggye Overpass

50
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,617
and restored it in the early 2000s.

51
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,743
So what?

52
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,832
From Cheonggye Plaza where we started

53
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,210
to under that Sindap Railway Bridge
you see over there.

54
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,838
That's the stretch
they covered back then.

55
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:02,301
What does that
have to do with your proposal?

56
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:04,678
Gosh, your temper.

57
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:07,264
How come you're so impatient?

58
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:08,849
Seriously.

59
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,647
All right. This is the core
of the real documentary pitch

60
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,024
so listen carefully.

61
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,443
Seoul in the 1960s.

62
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,737
They said they were building

63
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,281
the Cheonggye Overpass
to improve traffic.

64
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,575
But the real reason was
to prepare for war.

65
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,494
They covered up Cheonggyecheon

66
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,330
to build escape tunnels
and bunkers underground.

67
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:36,960
You're saying there's a tunnel
under Cheonggyecheon?

68
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,047
It's 30m down.

69
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,888
We go 30m underground

70
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,723
move forward 7km

71
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,685
then come up 30m to the surface

72
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,978
and we're on Cheonggye-ro.

73
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,898
And less than 10m from there is

74
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,983
KC Bank headquarters.

75
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,528
That building right there is
the place we met two hours ago

76
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,238
and our target.

77
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,868
KC Bank is scheduled to move
to a new headquarters in two weeks.

78
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:10,994
Before that

79
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:13,997
they're transferring
2.25 trillion won in cash

80
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:17,542
and the VIP safe-deposit boxes
to the new building.

81
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,296
There will be
three cash-transport operations.

82
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,132
Next Wednesday is their first run.

83
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:28,553
How much are we taking?

84
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,264
It's 500 billion won.

85
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,560
Before the transport even begins

86
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:38,355
we walk out with 500 billion won

87
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,190
and leave counterfeit bills
in their place.

88
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,610
You're telling me the counterfeits

89
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,028
won't be noticeable?

90
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,325
Here.

91
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:51,993
This is my guys' work.

92
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,790
What's this?

93
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:58,166
Are you sure this is fake?

94
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,420
High-precision counterfeit.

95
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:03,880
A so-called supernote.

96
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,677
That's insane.

97
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:12,889
I'm keeping this as a souvenir.

98
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:17,602
But from here to KC Bank looks like

99
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,021
at least 20 to 30 meters.

100
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,274
We hired
a Chinese gold-mine excavation team

101
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:23,442
with 30 years of experience

102
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,068
and they've been digging
for a month already.

103
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,404
The passage is secured.

104
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,449
Let's check it out.

105
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:35,954
You don't trust me?

106
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,665
Me? Trust you?

107
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,670
I have to see it to believe it.

108
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:45,046
Especially when it's coming from you.

109
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,383
KC FINANCIAL GROUP

110
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,316
Careful.

111
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,164
What do you think?

112
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,877
You lunatic!

113
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:29,466
This is what I call
a documentary proposal, you punk!

114
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,514
You're out of your mind!

115
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,521
You slick son of a bitch.

116
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:47,108
You lovable bastard!

117
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,153
All right!

118
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,743
J killed Do-sik, right?

119
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,248
I don't know.

120
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,250
We confirmed

121
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,460
that J took the counterfeit bills
and met up with Do-sik.

122
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,753
Yes, there was a time

123
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,005
when he took 25 billion won
in counterfeit cash

124
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,799
and came back empty-handed.

125
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,636
About five days
before I called in the tip

126
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,054
to the NIS

127
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:18,557
J and I went out together
for the first time in a while.

128
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:22,686
5 DAYS BEFORE THE TIP-OFF

129
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:25,063
He's not here yet.
It's been two hours.

130
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,774
He called and said
he'd reschedule for tomorrow.

131
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,486
He's got zero intention
of doing this deal.

132
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,947
- It's hot!
- Sorry.

133
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,657
- That's so hot!
- I'm sorry.

134
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,325
What were you even looking at?

135
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,618
Yes, my eyes are crooked.

136
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:39,703
What?

137
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,122
Cops are on us.

138
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
Listen to me.

139
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,793
Go outside

140
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,212
grab a commercial taxi,
license plate 8508

141
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,089
and say you're going
to Jangchung Arena.

142
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,592
We've met with Choi Do-sik.

143
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:12,944
Well, a welcome passenger
after two hours.

144
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,321
Go to Jangchung Arena, please.

145
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:15,697
Goodness.

146
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,659
I almost got a stiff neck
waiting for you, sir.

147
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:22,245
Two hours isn't exactly a short time.

148
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:26,666
You could have come out
a little sooner.

149
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,586
You kept me waiting for two hours.

150
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,342
Let's talk naturally, sir.

151
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,760
J?

152
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,597
That 97% pure meth

153
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,891
I'm trying to buy for 50 billion won.

154
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,517
That's Joong-hyuk's product,
isn't it?

155
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,727
How did you...

156
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:49,105
I know that bastard Joong-hyuk.

157
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,607
He's getting more and more arrogant.

158
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,319
He's trashed
every bit of industry etiquette.

159
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,654
That two-faced son of a bitch.

160
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:58,365
I came because you said
you were investing 50 billion.

161
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,825
I didn't come to listen
to you talk trash about people.

162
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,705
You're right.

163
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,624
We should talk business.

164
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:13,129
There's a 97% pure meth
production plant in Incheon.

165
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,215
From manufacturing to shipping

166
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:18,176
it's locked down so tight
that not even security cameras

167
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,678
can catch anything.

168
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,513
And right now

169
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,558
they've got products
worth 100 billion won finished.

170
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,186
You extract all of it

171
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,980
you take your promised 50 billion

172
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,901
and we split the product 50-50.

173
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,988
Do you seriously think
that's possible?

174
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,282
All right.

175
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,326
Listen carefully from here on out.

176
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,871
Joong-hyuk has a secret
underground route

177
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,165
into his drug plant.

178
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,751
Because of toxic fumes called

179
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,503
formalin that come out
during production

180
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,004
they have to vent it every day.

181
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,465
So, from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.

182
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,217
the plant shuts down.

183
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,138
There's a sewer tunnel 6m underground

184
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,391
and it's a drainage route built to
prevent flooding during rainy season.

185
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,352
It's so safe that no one can know

186
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,146
unless they're local rats and cats.

187
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,274
That's why Joong-hyuk

188
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:17,861
doesn't pay much attention
to security down there.

189
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:22,824
You're the hottest drug dealer
in the country

190
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:26,286
so selling top-shelf meth
you bring out

191
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:27,412
will be nothing for you.

192
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:29,330
And you get

193
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,833
your 50 billion that I promised.

194
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,088
How long are you going to keep living

195
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,840
getting looked down on
by a guy like him?

196
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,176
It's a deal.

197
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:42,927
Let's do it.

198
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,703
The day J was supposed to meet Do-sik

199
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,956
after he stole the drugs

200
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:16,419
J told Joong-hyuk
that Do-sik robbed the stash.

201
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,397
What?

202
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,941
- What?
- What is it?

203
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,445
Hey, Do-sik.

204
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,364
Have you been having
a hard time lately?

205
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,366
Fuck.

206
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,285
Hand it over, you bastard.

207
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:54,958
What a pathetic piece of shit.

208
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,630
So

209
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,716
you're saying Joong-hyuk chased
Do-sik down and shot him?

210
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:05,718
Is that what you're saying?

211
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,555
I only laid out the circumstances.

212
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,431
You're the one
who has to find the evidence.

213
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,185
Joong-hyuk shot him.
That part is true.

214
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:15,436
But

215
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,313
what about the bill in his mouth?

216
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:18,439
Why are you asking me that?

217
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,400
You don't remember
what you said yesterday?

218
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,027
You said it was staged by the guy
who put the bill in his mouth.

219
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,740
It was J, wasn't it?

220
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,127
What the hell is he plotting?

221
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:45,550
There is no security footage.

222
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,136
One Jung-gu Police Station detective
is set up to take the fall.

223
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,054
And they're

224
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:52,056
pushing the narrative
that the killer was a junkie.

225
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,683
Meanwhile

226
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:56,811
some random asshole is claiming
the illegal fight club is his.

227
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,356
So, the conclusion is

228
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,817
that Joong-hyuk has
nothing to do with any of this.

229
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,862
Why not investigate the bullet found
in the victim's thigh?

230
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,197
The murder weapon was a knife

231
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,366
and they found
the killer's prints on it.

232
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,328
They're focused
on getting a confession.

233
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,330
Getting a confession is one thing.

234
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,249
Can't you assign a detective or two
to trace where that round was bought?

235
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,126
That's the police's job.

236
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,210
We

237
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,339
focus on the supernote case, okay?

238
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,427
Jang Joong-hyuk, that bastard.

239
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:33,264
I have a feeling
he'll slip out once again.

240
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,435
Darn it!

241
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,853
Where are you going
without reporting?

242
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,438
To interrogate Han Soo-hyun.

243
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,524
Talk to me.

244
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,360
Didn't you come to spill everything?

245
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,954
The third member.

246
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,207
The doctor is here.

247
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:07,757
A woman in her mid-30s.

248
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,634
J called her "Dr. Choi."

249
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:10,843
Dr. Choi?

250
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:15,348
She was J's mole planted
on Joong-hyuk's side.

251
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,768
He asked her to manufacture

252
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,729
some kind of chemical agent

253
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,273
for Plan B.

254
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,067
Jeez.

255
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:28,903
I can't even figure out Plan A,
and now there's a Plan B?

256
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,990
And what's the deal
with the chemical agent?

257
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,868
Every substance causes
different chemical reactions

258
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,412
and leads to oxidation and corrosion.

259
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,122
We need to derive

260
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,165
the reactive elements
that match our operation.

261
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:42,250
Here.

262
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,803
The chemical formula is NaCIO3.

263
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:55,346
It triggers powerful oxidation
and corrosion

264
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,806
in an acidic aqueous solution.

265
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,769
Bring me Han Soo-hyun's phone
that we confiscated.

266
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,732
That's really all you know?

267
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,483
Yes.

268
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:10,611
Right.

269
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:11,988
How would you know their Plan B

270
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,823
when you don't even know
what Plan A is?

271
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,993
A chemical agent

272
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,745
that oxidizes and corrodes material.

273
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:21,247
Why?

274
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,291
Why exactly?

275
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,667
What for?

276
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:40,725
What do you think?

277
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,274
So

278
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,737
this is 500 billion won
in counterfeit bills, right?

279
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,076
Oh, man.

280
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,412
It's rough.

281
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,962
That's impressive.

282
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,339
It's perfect.

283
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,549
Nice.

284
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,514
It's unbelievable.

285
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:39,325
It tastes good.

286
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,581
There's something

287
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,209
I need your help with.

288
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,548
Ask me.

289
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,174
Anything.

290
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,259
BANK OF KOREA

291
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:02,014
I heard B&amp;A Security
was KC Bank's cash transport firm.

292
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:04,559
But your bank runs two-track security

293
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,686
with B&amp;A Security and Secure, right?

294
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,855
- Your two security companies.
- Yes, so?

295
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,106
From now on

296
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,191
route the jobs through B&amp;A Security.

297
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:15,236
Our group owns eight savings banks.

298
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,655
How can B&amp;A's headcount handle that?

299
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,033
They can barely handle KC Bank alone.

300
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,203
J is using that exact weakness.

301
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,205
Who is he?

302
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,875
He prepared them in advance.

303
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:34,881
They're former and current
cash-transport security agents.

304
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,341
Every one of them is
a high-risk credit delinquent.

305
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:41,220
He cut deals with them
for 500,000 dollars as a signing fee.

306
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:47,602
So, his plan is to merge KC Bank
with the outsourced contractor

307
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:51,731
to push new hires and plant moles?

308
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,191
All you need to do is

309
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,111
keep an eye on the people
with acquisition rights over B&amp;A.

310
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:02,200
Even without your 10%
out of 300 billion won in profit

311
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,827
it's still 270 billion
getting wired to the Eul Society.

312
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,245
That would cover

313
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:08,581
next year's budget,
even after funding the election.

314
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,626
What do you mean, "270 billion"?

315
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,464
The amount going to the Eul Society
is 500 billion won.

316
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:19,800
You said J would take half.

317
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,053
Oh, come on.

318
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,596
You've been living

319
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,557
with high society for too long.

320
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,851
You've lost your edge.

321
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,020
My ten percent.

322
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,731
We must make it 50 billion.

323
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,992
That's good. I like that.

324
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:47,745
Sure.

325
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:51,165
Joong-hyuk said he'd shut down
the drug plant for a while.

326
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,667
Instead

327
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,794
he asked me to make a gas bomb.

328
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,881
A gas bomb?

329
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,091
It's called toluene.

330
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,927
It releases a huge amount
of toxic gas as it burns.

331
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,137
If inhaled, it can melt
a person's lungs in ten seconds.

332
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,555
It's extremely lethal.

333
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,767
That's Joong-hyuk for you.

334
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:13,854
Just like I expected.

335
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,358
When we pull out
500 billion won in real cash

336
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:21,779
he plans to intercept all of it
in the middle.

337
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,659
So, that's how you want to play it?

338
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:30,913
Plan A and Plan B.

339
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,415
We run both at the same time.

340
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:36,085
Boss.

341
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,297
What's the target for Plan B?

342
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,134
The Bank of Korea.

343
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,554
These element symbols
on Soo-hyun's phone.

344
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,472
They're a list
of chemical reactions that occur

345
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:50,308
when fiber materials
oxidize and corrode.

346
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:52,643
Got it. Leave us.

347
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,235
Fiber material?

348
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:07,950
A chemical agent that oxidizes
and corrodes fiber?

349
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,538
Banknotes aren't paper.

350
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,665
They're fiber. Short-staple fiber.

351
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,543
Worn-out bills.

352
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:20,087
He's going to turn freshly printed
counterfeits into worn-out bills!

353
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,173
Why would he do that
right before distribution?

354
00:22:23,257 --> 00:22:24,592
Exactly.

355
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,302
Right?

356
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,346
It doesn't make sense.

357
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,392
Darn it.

358
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,025
Come on.

359
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,198
Worn-out bills.

360
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,282
Why?

361
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,412
You're so disgusting
that I can't even sit with you.

362
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,123
Why turn perfectly fine bills
into worn-out bills?

363
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:02,129
RECYCLE

364
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:03,798
Yes.

365
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,801
Exchanging mutilated currency!

366
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,552
You scared me.

367
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,014
"Exchanging mutilated currency"?

368
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:14,558
Burned, stained,
torn, and worn-out bills.

369
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,686
The bills sent to the Bank of Korea
for disposal each year

370
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,980
are enough to fill
a hundred five-ton trucks.

371
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,857
That bastard, J.

372
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,277
He's going to turn 500 billion
in supernotes into worn-out bills

373
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,738
and submit an exchange request
to the Bank of Korea.

374
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,199
Then, they shred and incinerate them

375
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:34,745
and hand over brand-new bills,
fresh off the press.

376
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,291
That's how you switch
from counterfeit

377
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,877
to real cash instantly,
with zero evidence left behind.

378
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:44,964
He gets to secure
500 billion won in one move.

379
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:50,970
It's me.

380
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,888
Call the Bank of Korea to see
if any bank requested

381
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,598
to exchange 500 billion won
in 50,000-won notes

382
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,058
as mutilated currency for new bills.

383
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,814
Myeongseong Thrift Institution

384
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:04,191
requested an exchange
for 500 billion in worn-out bills.

385
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,401
When is the approval?

386
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:07,653
Next Thursday at 10:30 a.m.

387
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:09,613
Call Myeongseong
and tell them to cancel the request.

388
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:10,948
Right now.

389
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,366
Hold on.

390
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,911
What about J?

391
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:19,915
How am I supposed to catch the rat
if you block up the rathole?

392
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:23,294
Listen.

393
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,130
We've got plenty of time
until next Thursday.

394
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:27,840
If J comes

395
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,885
to the Bank of Korea like he planned,
we grab him there.

396
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:32,845
Keep that in mind.

397
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:40,853
What's wrong now, Team Leader?

398
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,688
Stop being so childish.

399
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:45,524
You're making it hard
for the team to work.

400
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:47,318
Smile a little.

401
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,944
No matter what I tell the team

402
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,322
you're still our team leader, okay?

403
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,616
Even if I catch him,
you're getting the credit.

404
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,536
What did I even do now?

405
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,498
Also

406
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:01,832
I am

407
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,752
going to catch J myself.

408
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,088
All right. To the conference room.

409
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:21,018
Man, I hate you.

410
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:23,103
You're even more annoying
because you're so slick.

411
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:27,983
5 DAYS BEFORE D-DAY

412
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:33,155
NO CALLER ID

413
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:41,413
Where are you rushing off so early,
skipping work?

414
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:44,208
D-Day's in five days,
and you've got time to call me?

415
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,920
The part you were
supposed to handle was sloppy

416
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:50,214
so I made time to nag at you.

417
00:25:50,297 --> 00:25:51,840
This bastard.

418
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:54,677
I let you share a table
with me a few times

419
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,844
and now you're getting cocky.

420
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:56,929
Aren't you?

421
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,806
Cocky.

422
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,976
Since I'm already being cocky

423
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,435
should I get even cockier?

424
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:07,314
I'm moving D-Day to the last day

425
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,400
of KC Bank's cash transport.

426
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,943
You piece of shit.

427
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,531
Hey! Are you messing with me?

428
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,784
The outsourced
cash-transport contractor

429
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:21,745
and the experienced-hire paperwork
for B&amp;A Security.

430
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,289
We need a perfect alibi

431
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:24,748
so Chairman Bang
doesn't suspect anything

432
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,918
and you won't end up in a tough spot.

433
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:31,630
But the thing Chairman Bang's side
promised to do is so sloppy

434
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:34,592
that I'm moving D-Day
to the last day.

435
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,844
I'll lay it out again from the start

436
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,470
so if you think you're too dumb

437
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,180
write it down.

438
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,016
You know this.

439
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,602
Money solves everything in Korea.

440
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:47,855
Stuff enough cash
into B&amp;A's CEO's pocket

441
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,231
put out his little fire

442
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:51,650
and in exchange,
tell him to fix the paperwork

443
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:54,028
so the moles I planted look
like they were hired

444
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:55,529
three months ago.

445
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:58,198
Do I really have to nag you

446
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,117
like some mother-in-law?

447
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:01,827
Do I?

448
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,087
Chairman Bang, your boss

449
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:16,175
is an ambitious man
with dreams big enough

450
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:18,886
to bankroll a secret organization
called the Eul Society.

451
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:20,137
But on something this big

452
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,681
he wants to invest nothing
and eat for free.

453
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,809
Why are people so cheap these days?

454
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:26,894
You.

455
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,812
How do you know Eul Society?

456
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,026
Is there anything I don't know?

457
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,361
You see

458
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,780
unlike you, Detective Jang

459
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:40,282
I don't solve crises with a gun.

460
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,909
I solve them with this.

461
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:45,287
My head.

462
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:47,998
Isn't it basic to run
background checks on the cast

463
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:50,000
before starting a job?

464
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,878
That way, when trouble hits

465
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:56,090
we have leverage and an escape route.

466
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,426
Now that D-Day is postponed

467
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,763
do your job right.

468
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:04,848
You idiot!

469
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,859
And there's one more variable.

470
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:18,278
One member who held
a grudge against me

471
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:21,740
walked right into the NIS
and turned herself in.

472
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,117
But the problem is

473
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,661
that she was the one
who made the supernotes.

474
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:28,539
So, I've got no clue

475
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:31,083
how much she'll talk over there.

476
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,167
So

477
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:34,461
just in case

478
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,131
I've prepared Plan B.

479
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,133
What?

480
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:41,176
We'll see on the day before D-Day

481
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,596
and decide whether we run
Plan A or Plan B.

482
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,765
Oh, I'm going to share Plan B

483
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,392
so don't get paranoid, okay?

484
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,768
That would be petty.

485
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,604
Stop the bullshit

486
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:55,274
and share Plan B immediately.

487
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,862
Since you love proposals so much

488
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,321
I'm drafting it at the moment.

489
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,115
Give me two hours.

490
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:06,618
The prep for Plan B is

491
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,205
so simple that it's not even
comparable to Plan A.

492
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,833
It'll be ready by the day
before the last day

493
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,085
so don't worry.

494
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,260
People call my network
an MLM network.

495
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,096
When you tossed me that proposal

496
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,640
you think I didn't run it
by my own network?

497
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,894
Her name is Han Soo-hyun, right?

498
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,110
That bitch who walked into the NIS.

499
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,528
She's getting interrogated just fine.

500
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:45,532
Listening to what she's been
running her mouth about over there

501
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:48,410
this crossed my mind.

502
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,828
"What if

503
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,288
the two of you are working together?

504
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,123
The technician

505
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,335
goes into the NIS
to throw the investigation off

506
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,795
while the architect

507
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:01,298
plays me and the NIS
at the same time?"

508
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,135
If my concern is correct

509
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,346
what's the bluff

510
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,515
and what's real?

511
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,809
Your Plan A.

512
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,853
It was detailed and real.

513
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,980
The presentation was perfect.

514
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,108
But when you think about it

515
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:21,568
it's too dangerous

516
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:23,237
and too complicated.

517
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:25,322
You said Plan B was simple.

518
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,288
So, the card you're holding.

519
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,666
Is that Plan B?

520
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,795
Dozens of expert diggers.

521
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:45,592
Plan A cost you a fortune, didn't it?

522
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:49,721
Would you really use a plan
you worked that hard on

523
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:50,848
as a bluff?

524
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:58,146
I told you, didn't I?

525
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,691
We'll see on the day
before the last day

526
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:02,818
and pick one of the two plans.

527
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:05,028
Gosh, that brain of yours.

528
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,031
Maybe my little comment

529
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:12,911
about using your head
got on your nerves.

530
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:16,248
That's why you're rambling on
about how smart you are.

531
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,666
Fine.

532
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,626
Detective Jang.

533
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,961
You are not dumb.

534
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,129
You're smart.

535
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,757
I disrespected you to your face.

536
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:27,217
Let's just say

537
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,053
I was concerned about my partner.

538
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,305
Yes.

539
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:33,181
Think of it as a matter of caution.

540
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:34,850
Please be generous and let it go.

541
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,059
Okay?

542
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,354
All right.

543
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:41,189
I'll wait.

544
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:43,066
But if that day

545
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,652
you try to backstab me

546
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,696
I'm rounding up

547
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,199
your whole crew.

548
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:52,409
Be my guest.

549
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,437
RECENTS

550
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,521
CHOI CHANG-SEOK

551
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:22,606
NIS

552
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,289
- Yes, sir.
- Did you find anything?

553
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:41,416
Han Soo-hyun?

554
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,502
J and Han Soo-hyun.

555
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,754
There's something
going on between them.

556
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:48,548
I have a feeling
they're working together.

557
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:52,052
I already told you everything
about what happened eight years ago.

558
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:53,512
Dig deeper.

559
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:54,596
Deeper!

560
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:58,558
You met me twelve years ago

561
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:00,602
when I caught you getting high

562
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,687
and going to orgies.

563
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,896
I get it.

564
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,564
I only need to run
her full background

565
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,483
and see if there's any link with J

566
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,985
right?

567
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:10,028
This bastard.

568
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,907
You always make me talk too much.

569
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,535
I won't give you too much time.

570
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,259
Now, that's fresh air.

571
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,471
Detective Choi, where are you headed?

572
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,641
The illegal gambling incident

573
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:41,518
is all cleaned up and closed.

574
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,770
The guy who came in for you

575
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,981
got his statement fabricated
and was released this morning.

576
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,608
I didn't know you were

577
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:51,737
handling business
for the Eul Society.

578
00:33:58,577 --> 00:33:59,745
How did you know?

579
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,663
You know

580
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,249
my family is qualified
to be in that circle

581
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,625
but they never contacted me.

582
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:08,837
I'm almost 60 now.

583
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:12,466
Shouldn't I get to be
the chief before I die?

584
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,262
I'll set up a meeting.

585
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:21,516
Visit Seoul sometime.

586
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,351
You're leaving already?

587
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:26,104
I was going to buy you
an expensive drink.

588
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,273
Can't you cancel your plans?

589
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,776
I'm busy. Let's drink another time.

590
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:33,361
Joong-hyuk,
we have to drink next time.

591
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,863
Promise me!

592
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:41,745
Welcome back.

593
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:42,829
- Boss!
- Boss!

594
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:45,791
Big Boss told us not
to act like thugs.

595
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,250
Cigarette.

596
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:04,476
Can you dress a little more freely?

597
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:06,186
Why is everybody dressed the same?

598
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,771
- Sorry, Boss.
- Did you go to the same store?

599
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:09,815
Fucking idiots.

600
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:13,318
If Big Boss sees me like this,
he'll lose his mind.

601
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,739
Who do you think you're honking at?

602
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,368
Where are you going?

603
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,163
You're here, Boss.

604
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:28,416
You want to let everyone know
you're a gangster?

605
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,253
Get in.

606
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,470
What brings you
all the way to this dump?

607
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,514
You suffered after eating
government rations for a few days.

608
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,099
Get some real food in you.

609
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,351
Thank you, Boss.

610
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:49,896
Do a job for me next Thursday.

611
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:52,566
It might get rough.

612
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:56,945
We're having a meeting.

613
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,114
Come to Pearl House
in Songdo tonight.

614
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,661
Yes, Boss.

615
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:16,423
Ta-da!

616
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:20,760
All right.

617
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:22,429
If you've changed your mind

618
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:25,265
leave the 500,000 dollars here
and walk away.

619
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:27,893
There's no way we change our minds.
Don't worry.

620
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:30,937
All right, then. Let's go.

00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,239
Jindo Dog just departed.

626
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,368
Jindo Dog is out for a walk.

627
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:10,370
We're looking at about 13 minutes.

628
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,080
It's a paranoid dog

629
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:13,581
so hold your positions

630
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,874
until it enters the kennel to eat.

00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:42,861
I have visual on Jindo Dog.

635
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,175
Jindo Dog is approaching the kennel.

636
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:09,637
Wait for my signal.

637
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,335
We hit them
when the elevator comes up.

638
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:50,845
Hold.

639
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:27,924
Get them!

640
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,074
Stay right where you are.

641
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,383
Turn around.
