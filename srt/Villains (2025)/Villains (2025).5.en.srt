1
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:25,508
(This drama is a work of fiction)

2
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:26,148
(Any similarity to real people,
organizations, or events is coincidental)

3
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:26,923
(Scenes with child actors
followed production guidelines)

4
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,015
Money can
make my dad hear again.

5
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:37,938
Snow Fairy Sugar,

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,259
just like in the cartoon,
please change this snow

7
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:42,734
into money.

8
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,779
Help me so that Dad can have surgery.

9
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:16,901
Stand on your own two feet
if you want a chance.

10
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,951
Fairies are made up by adults.

11
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:35,283
This is the reality we're living in.

12
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,296
We've been walking from
Cheonggye Plaza for seven kilometers.

13
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,602
Are we on a date or something?

14
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,045
I might actually start to like you!

15
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,774
Stop whining. We're almost here.

16
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,498
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,864
You wanted to see
an actual proposal.

18
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,785
Follow me, okay?

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,832
That punk.

20
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,126
This better be good. I swear.

21
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,689
J began working

22
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:46,775
and started making supernotes
all because of you.

23
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,026
Also,

24
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,018
you knew Dosik had

25
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:52,948
a fake hundred-dollar bill in his mouth.

26
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,284
It's true, you know too much.

27
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,456
That's why you were almost killed.

28
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,626
But then,

29
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:08,880
regarding the supernote distribution,

30
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,175
you don't know anything.

31
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,277
I have a brief report for you.

32
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,384
If it's not urgent,
come back later.

33
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,034
The autopsy results came in

34
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,435
for the Incheon murder case.

35
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,136
Come out here.

36
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,946
From the thigh of the man
who was killed in the basement,

37
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,794
we found a bullet.

38
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,305
It's a 9mm Major bullet.

39
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,173
It's used in Europe
for commercial handguns.

40
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:55,873
It's a makeshift bullet.

41
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,315
- Chief Jung?
- Yes.

42
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:11,796
It's stated in the autopsy result.

43
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:12,754
Just a second.

44
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,685
Hey, what was it?

45
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,273
The bullet that was found
in Choi Dosik's body.

46
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,376
- What kind was it?
- It was a 9mm Major.

47
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,325
Okay.

48
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,907
It's a 9mm Major.

49
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,373
This one is hard to find in Korea.

50
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,145
During the Park Administration,
in order to build the Cheonggye Overpass,

51
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,594
they covered the Cheonggyecheon stream
with concrete.

52
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,595
In the early 2000s, the stream
was uncovered again.

53
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,848
So?

54
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,020
From the plaza we started from,

55
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:50,305
all the way to the new railway bridge
you see there,

56
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,901
the whole thing was covered with concrete.

57
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,476
What does that have to do
with your proposal?

58
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,674
Seriously, you and your temper.

59
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,407
I can't believe how impatient you are.

60
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,766
You punk, I swear.

61
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,784
Okay, I'm getting to the good part
of my serious proposal.

62
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,311
Listen carefully.

63
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,794
In the 1960s in Seoul,

64
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:16,863
the government said
they wanted to mitigate traffic

65
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,219
by building the Cheonggye Overpass.

66
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,682
But in reality, the higher-ups
were preparing for the war.

67
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:24,521
To build a tunnel and a bunker
that would provide an underground escape,

68
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,597
they covered the Cheonggyecheon.

69
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:31,940
Are you saying
a tunnel exists under the stream?

70
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,669
It's 30 meters underground.

71
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,037
If you go 30m under, walk for 7km,

72
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:50,122
and come back up 30m,
you'll find Cheonggye Road.

73
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:53,006
Just 10m away is

74
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,963
the KC Bank Headquarters.

75
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,758
That's where we met two hours ago.

76
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,469
That's also our target.

77
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:02,917
Two weeks from today,

78
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,079
the KC Bank Headquarters will move
to a new building.

79
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:08,727
First, they will move 2.25 trillion won,

80
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:12,606
as well as the VIP safes,
to the new building.

81
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:16,463
The cash will be transported
in three batches.

82
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:19,154
The first batch will be sent
next Wednesday.

83
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:21,864
The money we'll take.

84
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,970
How much is it?

85
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:26,536
It's 500 billion won.

86
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,577
Before the cash transport,

87
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,680
we'll take the 500 billion won

88
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:35,462
and leave counterfeits instead.

89
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:40,040
Won't they notice
the fake bills?

90
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:45,555
Here.

91
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,140
My team made that.

92
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:51,603
What the hell?

93
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,313
Is this really fake?

94
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:56,817
It's a super-intricate counterfeit.

95
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:58,892
It's a supernote.

96
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:03,740
This is incredible.

97
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,870
I'll take this as a welcome gift.

98
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,474
But the distance from here to KC Bank

99
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,126
is at least 20 or 30 meters.

100
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:18,592
I hired a Chinese mining team
with 30 years of experience

101
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,423
to start digging a month ago.

102
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:22,467
We already secured a path.

103
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,595
Let's go there.

104
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,059
Don't you trust me?

105
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:32,728
Me...

106
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,187
trust you?

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,689
It's better to be safe than sorry

108
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:39,985
with you.

109
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,504
Be careful.

110
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,352
What do you think?

111
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,940
You crazy bastard.

112
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,244
This is

113
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,362
a serious freaking business proposal!

114
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,827
You're one mad, crazy bastard!

115
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,591
You're not bad at all!

116
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:38,919
Damn!

117
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,923
You're such a lovable bastard!

118
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,217
Yes!

119
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:51,848
Did J kill Choi Dosik?

120
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,536
I don't know.

121
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,328
We know J took counterfeits

122
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,572
and contacted Choi Dosik.

123
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:04,140
Yes, he left with 25 billion
fake won,

124
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,112
but returned with nothing to show for it.

125
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,655
It was before I called the NIS.

126
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,076
About five days before,

127
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,369
J and I went out
for the first time in a while.

128
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,218
This punk hasn't shown.
It's been two hours.

129
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:22,587
He called to reschedule
the meeting for tomorrow.

130
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,443
This asshole has no intention
of doing business!

131
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,584
- That's hot!
- Gosh...

132
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,822
- I'm sorry.
- That's hot.

133
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:32,367
- I'm sorry.
- Are you freaking blind?

134
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,651
What's it going to be?

135
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:34,782
What?

136
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,518
A cop is tailing you.

137
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,492
Listen carefully.

138
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:44,188
Go outside and take the taxi
with plate number 8508.

139
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,152
Say you're going to Jangchung Arena.

140
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,863
We've made contact
with Choi Dosik.

141
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,331
Goodness, it took me two hours

142
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:07,884
to finally get a customer.

143
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,369
To Jangchung Arena, please.

144
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:10,762
Goodness.

145
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:14,758
I waited until my neck was sore
for a customer.

146
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:17,267
Two hours isn't exactly short.

147
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,821
You could have come out earlier.

148
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,858
How could you make me wait for two hours?

149
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:30,842
Let's be real now, sir.

150
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:31,939
J?

151
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:37,990
The 97% pure crystal meth
you want to buy is

152
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:39,694
Jang Junghyuk's masterpiece.

153
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:40,874
How did you...

154
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,073
I know Jang Junghyuk really well.

155
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:45,663
He's getting cockier by the day.

156
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,863
He screws up what little work ethic
is left in this field.

157
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,769
That bastard.

158
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,606
I came because you wanted
to invest 50 billion won,

159
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,014
not to listen to you trash-talk someone.

160
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,852
That's true.

161
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,636
We should talk business.

162
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,227
The crystal meth lab is in Incheon.

163
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,497
From production to shipment,
the lab is so secure that

164
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:14,741
even a surveillance camera can't spot it,
let alone the human eye.

165
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:16,465
The lab is

166
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,497
sitting on 100 billion won
worth of product.

167
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:23,291
If you take it all,

168
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,793
you take 50 billion won as promised.

169
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,923
We'll go half and half with the product.

170
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:33,968
Do you really think
that's possible?

171
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:37,943
Now, listen carefully.

172
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:42,017
Jang Junghyuk enters the drug lab

173
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,103
through an underground path.

174
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,937
The production emits

175
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,851
formaldehyde, which requires
daily ventilation.

176
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,466
So from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.,

177
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:54,923
the lab stops working.

178
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,106
The tunnel is six meters underground.

179
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:01,246
It's a drain that prevents flooding
due to heavy rain.

180
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,375
Only a street rat or cat knows about it.
It's a very safe route.

181
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,031
That's why when it comes to
the underground tunnel,

182
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,882
Junghyuk is less guarded.

183
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,387
You're the best dealer in Korea.

184
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,395
Methamphetamine is a hot commodity,

185
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,731
a piece of cake for you to sell.

186
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:26,980
You would also get
the 50 billion won I promised.

187
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:33,987
How long are you going to
let Junghyuk get ahead?

188
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,405
I'm in.

189
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,135
Let's do it.

190
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,683
But Dosik ran away
with the drugs.

191
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,270
The day J was supposed to meet Dosik,

192
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:11,483
he told Jang Junghyuk
that Dosik stole the drugs.

193
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:31,456
What the...

194
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:32,969
What the...

195
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,915
- Damn it!
- Gosh, it's Dosik.

196
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,276
- Damn!
- Pinching pennies, are you?

197
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,224
Damn it.

198
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,343
Give me that, you bastard!

199
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,599
You asshole...

200
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:50,313
That crazy bastard.

201
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:55,735
So,

202
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:59,261
Junghyuk followed Dosik, and bang!

203
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:00,890
Is that it?

204
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:03,601
I'm only stating what happened.

205
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,453
You have to find the evidence.

206
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:10,124
It's true that Jang Junghyuk
shot him,

207
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,442
but what about the hundred-dollar bill?

208
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,753
Why are you asking me?

209
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,391
Don't you remember
what you said yourself?

210
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:16,737
You said it's the guy

211
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:17,966
who put the hundred-dollar bill
in his mouth.

212
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:22,846
It was J, wasn't it?

213
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:34,231
What the hell is that asshole
up to?

214
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:40,238
There's no surveillance footage.

215
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:43,449
Everything is dumped on a local detective.

216
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:47,579
The killer is framing a junkie.

217
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,778
Some punk is insisting

218
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,791
the illegal den is his.

219
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:57,908
It all comes down to Junghyuk
being wiped clean from this case.

220
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,800
Why aren't they investigating
the bullet from the victim's thigh?

221
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,111
He was killed with a knife.

222
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,337
It also had the killer's fingerprints.

223
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,509
They must be focusing on
getting a confession.

224
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:10,345
A confession is one thing,

225
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,538
but it only takes a couple of detectives

226
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,333
to find out how the bullet was purchased.

227
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,890
That's the police's job.

228
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,485
We only need to worry about
the supernote case.

229
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:24,906
Jang Junghyuk, that bastard.

230
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,494
I can feel him slipping away again.

231
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,535
Damn it!

232
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,003
You haven't reported
where you're going!

233
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,334
I'm interrogating Suhyun!

234
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,678
Spit it out.

235
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,381
Aren't you here to spill the beans?

236
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,059
The third member.

237
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,936
The doctor is here.

238
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,717
A woman in her 30s.

239
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,776
J called her Dr. Choi.

240
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:05,940
Dr. Choi?

241
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,075
That woman

242
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,411
was a mole J planted on Junghyuk's team.

243
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:13,664
J asked her

244
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,542
to create some kind of chemical,

245
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,670
in order to prepare for Plan B.

246
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,766
Shit.

247
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,388
I don't even know what Plan A is,
and there's Plan B?

248
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,803
What's this chemical business?

249
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,986
Materials are
oxidized and corroded

250
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,578
by chemical reactions.

251
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,027
We need to figure out the formula

252
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,308
that will create the reaction
we need for our plan to work.

253
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,521
Here.

254
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:48,858
It's the NaCIO3 formula.

255
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,113
In acidic solutions,

256
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:51,945
it causes strong oxidation and corrosion.

257
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,708
Bring Han Suhyun's phone.

258
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,245
You really don't know anything else?

259
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,587
No.

260
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:05,591
Good.

261
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,819
If you don't even know about Plan A,
how would you know about Plan B?

262
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:13,724
A chemical that oxidizes
and corrodes materials...

263
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,511
Why?

264
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:19,707
Right? For what?

265
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,014
What do you think?

266
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:39,430
Well...

267
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:40,585
Goodness.

268
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,295
This is...

269
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:47,712
five hundred billion won
worth of fake bills, right?

270
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,431
Wow.

271
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:57,346
It's rough on the outside.

272
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,645
Right?

273
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,775
Wow.

274
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:08,487
It's flawless.

275
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:14,618
It's incredible.

276
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:34,540
Tastes good.

277
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,644
Chief Jang,

278
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,773
I need your help.

279
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,946
Ask me anything.

280
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,783
I heard
KC Bank's cash transport

281
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,175
is being outsourced to B&A.

282
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,686
Your banks outsource work

283
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,758
to B&A Security
for security stuff as well.

284
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:03,955
Yes, so?

285
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,503
From now on,
give B&A all the work.

286
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:10,299
My group
has eight savings banks.

287
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,677
B&A's staff is nowhere near enough.

288
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,013
KC Bank alone overwhelms them.

289
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:19,517
J is
taking advantage of that.

290
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,269
Who?

291
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,188
J prepared this in advance.

292
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,441
Take a look.

293
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:29,985
They're former and current cash movers.

294
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,571
They're also malicious defaulters.

295
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,659
He bought them out for $500,000 each.

296
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,322
First, we use

297
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,799
the same security company as KC Bank.

298
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:44,553
Then, we naturally lead them to hire

299
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:47,149
extra movers to be our moles?

300
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,296
Your job is

301
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,332
to keep an eye on the B&A acquirers.

302
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:57,318
Even after your 10% cut
of the 300 billion won profit,

303
00:19:57,402 --> 00:20:00,012
Eulsa Club gets 270 billion won.

304
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,341
It's big enough to fund

305
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,519
the election and next year's budget.

306
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,022
Did you say 270 billion won?

307
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,777
Eulsa Club gets 500 billion won.

308
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,890
You said J gets half.

309
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,306
My goodness.

310
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:18,594
I feel bad.

311
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:21,329
After hanging with classy guys,

312
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,775
you're no longer a wild man.

313
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,055
My 10% cut.

314
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,952
We should grow it to 50 billion won.

315
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,678
Fifty billion won.

316
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,056
Good. I like that.

317
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,528
You're right.

318
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:46,155
Jang Junghyuk ordered
the local lab to halt operation.

319
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,521
Instead,

320
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,108
he asked me to make an aerosol bomb.

321
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,936
An aerosol bomb?

322
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,338
It's called toluene.

323
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,056
It releases a massive amount of toxic gas
when it explodes.

324
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,231
The gas can melt human lungs
in ten seconds.

325
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:01,786
That's how toxic it is.

326
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,589
That's what Junghyuk would do.

327
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,709
It's to be expected.

328
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:12,427
When we have 500 billion won in real cash,

329
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:16,842
he'll snatch it right
from under our noses.

330
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:21,597
Is that how he wants to play?

331
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,060
Plan A and Plan B.

332
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:27,603
We operate them both.

333
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,148
Boss.

334
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:34,568
What is the target of Plan B?

335
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:38,823
Korea Bank.

336
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,627
The chemical symbols
on Suhyun's phone.

337
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:43,564
It's a list of chemical reactions

338
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,329
that occur when fiber
is oxidized or corroded.

339
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:47,998
Okay, you can go.

340
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,299
Fiber?

341
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:02,888
A chemical that oxidizes
and corrodes fiber?

342
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,476
Bills aren't paper.

343
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:09,770
They're fiber. Short fibers.

344
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,678
Damaged bills.

345
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,191
Is J going to damage the counterfeits?

346
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,236
Right before distribution? Why?

347
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:19,948
You're right.

348
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,488
Isn't it weird?

349
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:23,325
It makes no sense.

350
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:35,797
Come on.

351
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:42,338
Damaged bills.

352
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,180
Why would he?

353
00:22:44,886 --> 00:22:45,848
Gosh.

354
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:48,468
You're so sloppy, it's embarrassing.

355
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:51,187
Why would he damage the bills?

356
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:58,970
Right.

357
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:01,739
Damaged bill exchange!

358
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,908
You scared me.

359
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:07,213
Did you say "Damaged bill exchange?"

360
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,497
Bills get burned, dirty,
ripped, and old.

361
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,666
People ask Korea Bank to discard cash.

362
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:14,897
They request 100 five-ton trucks a year.

363
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:16,879
J, that weasel.

364
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:20,266
After damaging 500 billion won
in supernotes,

365
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,660
he'll ask Korea Bank to replace them.

366
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:25,513
The bank will shred and burn the fakes

367
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,558
before replacing them
with freshly made bills.

368
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:34,405
Without leaving
a single trace of evidence,

369
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,774
he can launder the fakes into real money.

370
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,943
He immediately secures 500 billion won.

371
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:45,963
It's me.

372
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:48,638
Call Korea Bank to see

373
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:50,871
if any bank has requested
to replace 500 billion won.

374
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:58,018
Myungsung Savings Bank
requested

375
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,261
to replace 500 billion won.

376
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:00,481
When was it approved for?

377
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,738
Next Thursday at 10:30 a.m.

378
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,826
Call Myungsung and tell them
to cancel the replacement.

379
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,840
Right now.

380
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,430
Hold on.

381
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:10,984
What about J?

382
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,812
Your dog can't come home
if the flap door is blocked.

383
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,232
Listen up.

384
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,110
We have enough time until next Thursday.

385
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,929
We're going to catch J
according to his plan

386
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,878
when he shows up at Korea Bank.

387
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,985
Remember that.

388
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:35,918
Come on, Chief.

389
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:37,726
We're professionals here.
Don't be inflexible.

390
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,671
You're making people uncomfortable.

391
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:42,386
Lighten up.

392
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:43,924
I might be sowing,

393
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,427
but you're the chief.

394
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:49,054
You reap the benefits of me catching J.

395
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:52,600
I didn't say anything.

396
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:56,729
And regarding J,

397
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,648
I'll catch him myself.

398
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,193
Okay, to the meeting room.

399
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,094
I hate everything about
that asshole,

400
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:18,167
especially how sneaky he is.

401
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,305
Did you ditch your day job

402
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,541
to run off at the crack of dawn?

403
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:39,480
We're five days out,
and you have time to chat?

404
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,898
You've been doing a shoddy job.

405
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,274
I made time to nag you.

406
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,112
You little punk.

407
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:49,764
I pat you on the back a few times,

408
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,076
and now you're cocky.

409
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,745
So cocky.

410
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,370
Since I'm cocky,
why don't I become cockier?

411
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,085
D-Day,

412
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:02,438
I'm changing it to the last day

413
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,540
of the KC Bank cash transport plan.

414
00:26:04,623 --> 00:26:06,423
Listen, asshole.

415
00:26:08,548 --> 00:26:09,458
Hey!

416
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,802
Are you joking?

417
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,914
Outsourcing the cash movement,

418
00:26:13,997 --> 00:26:16,558
hiring the experienced B&A guards...

419
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,849
A perfect alibi will keep Chairman Bang
out of the picture.

420
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,747
You can also dodge a bullet.

421
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:26,690
But Chairman Bang is doing
such a terrible job

422
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:29,363
that I'm changing the D-Day
to the last day.

423
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,159
I'll break it down for you
from the beginning.

424
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:35,019
If you're a little slow,
you had better write it down.

425
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,996
As you know,

426
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,641
everything is possible
with money in Korea.

427
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:43,030
Grease the palm of the B&A owner.
Make it slick.

428
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:44,306
Lower the hurdle.

429
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,699
Make it look like my mole cash mover

430
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:48,882
was hired three months ago.

431
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,592
Put it in writing.

432
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,970
Do I have to act like
your nosy mother-in-law

433
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:54,972
constantly nagging you?

434
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:57,558
Do I?

435
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:07,218
Chairman Bang,
the guy whose boots you lick,

436
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:11,300
is in charge of funding the Eulsa Club,
a secret organization.

437
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,160
He dreams big,

438
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,075
but in this huge deal,

439
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,900
you don't invest. You try to freeload.

440
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,539
Why are you all so petty?

441
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:21,999
You...

442
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,076
How do you know about the Eulsa Club?

443
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:29,006
Of course, I know everything.

444
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:30,526
You know,

445
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,755
I'm not like you.

446
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:35,554
I don't use a gun in an emergency.

447
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,431
This brain.

448
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,350
I use my brain.

449
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,102
I get to know the cast
before starting any project.

450
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:45,022
It's Con Artistry 101.

451
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:47,816
That's why, in an emergency,

452
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,986
I tackle the weakness and plan my escape.

453
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,365
With D-Day pushed back,

454
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,869
get it right.

455
00:27:57,953 --> 00:27:59,995
You bastard!

456
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:10,875
I have another surprise.

457
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,258
I had an unhappy member.

458
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:16,637
She turned herself in to the NIS.

459
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:18,261
By the way,

460
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,470
she made the supernotes.

461
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,661
Who knows what and how much she'll say?

462
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,687
Even I can't guess.

463
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:27,356
So,

464
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:29,316
in case of emergency,

465
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,111
I came up with a Plan B.

466
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,171
What?

467
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,349
Depending on how things are on D-1,

468
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:39,618
I'll decide between Plan A and Plan B.

469
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,622
I'll tell you about Plan B too.
Don't get carried away with your thoughts

470
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:45,112
and be so sensitive.

471
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:50,565
Stop bullshitting,
and tell me what Plan B is now.

472
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:54,982
You love a proposal,

473
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,426
so I'm writing it now.

474
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,273
Give me two hours.

475
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:01,564
Preparing for Plan B is

476
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:05,316
so much simpler than Plan A.

477
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,146
It will be ready by D-1.

478
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:10,148
Don't worry about a thing.

479
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,320
People say

480
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,740
I have a pyramid network.

481
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,493
When you pitched that proposal,

482
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:23,621
don't you think I tapped into my network?

483
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,040
Isn't her name Han Suhyun?

484
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,842
The bitch who turned herself in.
The NIS is treating her well.

485
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,429
When I heard the report
about her babbling,

486
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,348
I thought to myself...

487
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,476
If you two teamed up,

488
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,206
that technician cow...

489
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,386
could be misleading
the NIS's investigation.

490
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,649
And the mastermind

491
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,194
could be screwing over me and the NIS.

492
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,948
If I'm right to worry,

493
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,325
which is a bluff?

494
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:04,620
Which is real?

495
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,830
Your Plan A.

496
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:10,011
It was very specific and realistic.

497
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:12,044
You presented it perfectly.

498
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,380
However, when I think about it,

499
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:18,259
it's too risky and complicated.

500
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,386
Your Plan B is simple.

501
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,435
So, are you holding

502
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,041
Plan B as your card?

503
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:35,220
You hired dozens of expert diggers.

504
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:38,631
For Plan A,

505
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,126
you spent a lot on the operation.

506
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,865
After all your hard work,

507
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,203
would you really use it as a bluff?

508
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,335
Didn't I tell you?

509
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,798
Depending on how things go the day before,

510
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:57,853
I'll decide between the two plans.

511
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:00,021
I knew you had a thick head, but...

512
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:03,095
I know I told you

513
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,691
to use your brain.

514
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:07,641
I must have ticked you off.

515
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,045
I kept going on and on about being smart.

516
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,436
I rubbed it in.

517
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:12,946
Fine, I admit it.

518
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:16,066
You're not a simpleton, Mr. Jang.

519
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,279
You're smart.

520
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:20,654
Why did I put you down?

521
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:22,280
That's just

522
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,033
me being a paranoid partner.

523
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,370
Yes, think of me as a paranoid partner.

524
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,789
I hope you understand. Okay?

525
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:34,459
Fine.

526
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:36,378
I'll wait.

527
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,164
But when the day comes,

528
00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:40,674
if the plan is to stab me in the back,

529
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,093
your team...

530
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,138
I'll hunt you all down.

531
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:47,590
Suit yourself.

532
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,144
- Yes?
- Did you find out?

533
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:36,497
About Han Suhyun?

534
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,398
J and Han Suhyun, that cow.

535
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,848
I can sense they're up to something.

536
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:43,612
They're probably hooking up.

537
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,990
I told you everything about
what happened eight years ago.

538
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,402
Dig deeper! Deeper!

539
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:51,691
Twelve years ago,

540
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:53,671
when you first met me,

541
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,859
you were a junkie who had sex parties.

542
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:57,976
Okay.

543
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,697
I'll start with Han Suhyun's family

544
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,296
to find any connection to J.

545
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,069
I just need to find something, right?

546
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,217
You asshole.

547
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:08,804
You're an asshole for making me say more.

548
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,473
There's not much time.

549
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,405
Damn, the air feels nice.

550
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:31,851
Detective Choi,
where are you going?

551
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,648
The illegal den.

552
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,415
It's been handled nicely.

553
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,802
Your replacement was freed

554
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,794
with a nicely drafted report.

555
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,505
I found out that you

556
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:46,967
have been aiding the Eulsa Club.

557
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,808
How did you know?

558
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,607
I mean,

559
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,046
I come from an eligible family,

560
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,930
but I haven't received an invitation.

561
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,151
Goodness, I'll be 60 soon.

562
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:07,947
Shouldn't I run for the national agency
at least once?

563
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,659
I'll set up a meeting.

564
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:16,538
Come visit Seoul.

565
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,543
Are you leaving already?

566
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,821
- Yes.
- Come on.

567
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,435
I was going to buy you a big dinner.

568
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,367
Hey, can't you cancel your thing?

569
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,859
I'm busy.
We'll have a drink later.

570
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:29,843
Junghyuk, promise me
we'll have a drink later, okay?

571
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:36,909
Congratulations!

572
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,068
Sir!

573
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,854
Big Boss told us
not to look like thugs.

574
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:42,314
Cigarette.

575
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:59,414
Can't you dress casually?

576
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,404
Why do you all dress exactly the same?

577
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,859
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Did you shop at the same place?

578
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:05,170
You freaking bastards.

579
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,256
Big Boss will go mad if he sees you.

580
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:12,928
Don't honk at me, you...

581
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,389
Where are you going, sir?

582
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:20,143
You're here, sir.

583
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:23,271
Wow, looking like a thug.

584
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:26,483
Get in.

585
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,617
It's good to see you,
but what's going on?

586
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,219
I know the state lunch sucks.

587
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,371
Treat yourself.

588
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,373
Thank you, Boss.

589
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,834
You have work next Thursday.

590
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:47,879
It might be a rough job.

591
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:52,050
For our meeting,

592
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:54,422
come to the place in Songdo tonight.

593
00:35:58,561 --> 00:35:59,683
Yes, boss.

594
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,530
Ta-da!

595
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:17,326
Okay, it's not too late
to change your mind.

596
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,161
You can put down the $50,000 and leave.

597
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:22,409
There's no way
we'll change our minds.

598
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:23,999
Don't worry.

599
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,084
Then, let's go!

600
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,346
The dog is on the move.

601
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:00,345
Okay.

602
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,448
The dog went for a walk.

603
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,266
It will take about 13 minutes.

604
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:06,935
It's a damn suspicious dog.

605
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,660
Before it enters the cage to eat,

606
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,854
stand by.

607
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,924
I have eyes on the dog.

608
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,260
The dog is entering the cage.

609
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,743
Wait until the signal.

610
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:35,398
Get them when the elevator
comes up.

611
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:45,813
Wait.

612
00:40:22,062 --> 00:40:22,914
Get them!

613
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:48,596
Don't move. Stay still.

614
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,446
Turn around.
