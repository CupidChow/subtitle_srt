1
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:30,988
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,072
ALL MINORS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STANDARD PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

3
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:36,827
MUJOO DOCK, INCHEON

4
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,042
I'll take one.

5
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,251
It's 5,000 won.

6
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,471
MUJOO DOCK

7
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:08,734
Disguised truck approaching.

8
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:28,754
Stay in position
and behave naturally.

9
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,393
Stand by until I give you a sign.

10
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,028
Jang Joong-hyuk is in the black van
right behind the box truck.

11
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:00,035
Here are the two things

12
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,788
that give me the most joy in life.

13
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:04,957
First.

14
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,876
Screwing up the assholes

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,837
who don't pay me back
after borrowing from me.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,921
Second.

17
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:13,757
Cutting the throat

18
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,052
of the girl who looks down on me,
you bitch.

19
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,137
Hey, bring me a knife.

20
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,221
- Hey, knife.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:22,516
Joong-ki!

22
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,644
- Bring me a box cutter.
- Bring a box cutter. Here.

23
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,024
Joong-ki, slice her aorta.

24
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,401
The aorta?

25
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:34,778
J!

26
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,532
He'll show up disguised as a driver.

27
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,383
You see a taxi nearby, right?

28
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,302
J is inside, in disguise.

29
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:02,514
J is disguised inside the taxi.

30
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,765
I'll take him.

31
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,142
Everyone else,
go after Jang Joong-hyuk.

32
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,021
Back it up and slam into the taxi.

33
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,704
Whoever has the flash drive

34
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:28,707
must be sealed away with it forever
and never come back into the world.

35
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,426
Jang Joong-hyuk!

36
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,182
Darn it.

37
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,445
Come here.

38
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,284
Don't make a move. Don't come closer.

39
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,412
Stay back!

40
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,002
Jang Joong-hyuk
holds Soo-hyun hostage

41
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,754
while confronting the NIS.

42
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,677
Get in.

43
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:30,978
Go.

44
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,105
Let's go!

45
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,902
Follow him!

46
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,203
Boss, I'm ready to go.

47
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:51,123
When will the box truck
with 500 billion won drive by?

48
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,541
Please respond.

49
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,043
I need your order.

50
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,212
There's over a 90% chance

51
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:01,383
Joong-hyuk will use the road to reach
Incheon Port container terminal

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,720
but just in case,
I need you to go to the dock, Fixer.

53
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,804
Yes, Boss.

54
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:12,436
What happened?

55
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:15,897
What happened?

56
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,066
I almost died just now,
so I couldn't see everything

57
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,152
but it looks like
he took Soo-hyun hostage.

58
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,492
EPISODE 8: THE LAST CARD;
A WORLD OF REVERSED TRUTHS

59
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,663
I'm not saying
I won't give you the money.

60
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,458
A lot of eyes are on us,
so we can't act hastily.

61
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,294
I mean, we aren't strangers, are we?

62
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:40,482
Should I thank you

63
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,820
for those 500 billion won?

64
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:47,864
I mean

65
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,325
your misunderstanding

66
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,869
became the trigger
for making those supernotes.

67
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,913
And thanks to you,
I got to take all 500 billion.

68
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:55,997
"Misunderstanding"?

69
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,168
What if

70
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,504
I didn't blow up

71
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,925
that warehouse with a bang

72
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,427
five years ago?

73
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,972
Then you wouldn't have had
a reason to make those supernotes.

74
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,101
Look at that.

75
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,732
Unbelievable.

76
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:27,988
I took a wild guess
and thought I'd feel you out.

77
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:32,951
But you really didn't know.

78
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:35,996
Did you crawl your way
into the NIS because of J?

79
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,080
To get revenge?

80
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:39,833
J wasn't behind the explosion...

81
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,254
at the warehouse,
but it was just you and you alone?

82
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:48,508
I did it.

83
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:55,599
I guess you didn't know.

84
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,481
Thanks for the present.

85
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,530
J

86
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:15,118
2013, INCHEON

87
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,708
Why won't he pick up?

88
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:36,723
- Who's that?
- Hey.

89
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,226
- Who the heck are you?
- You fucking bastards.

90
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,310
What the fuck?

91
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,066
What's going on?

92
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,359
Hey, someone's here.

93
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,033
You fucking asshole!

94
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,892
Man, come on.

95
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,228
You punk.

96
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,896
Hey, that's enough.

97
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,190
My nose hurts. It stings.

98
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,985
Who the heck is this punk?

99
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:33,572
Man, you startled me.

100
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:36,199
Hey.

101
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,951
Why did you all run out
just to take down a kid?

102
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,537
Let go of me, punk!

103
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,746
Where's Mr. Yang?

104
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,124
Hey, get him off me! Damn it.

105
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,625
Hey.

106
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,587
Let go. Get him off.

107
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,589
Let's go.

108
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,048
I can't believe all of you ran out

109
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,842
with those metal pipes
to take down this kid.

110
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,051
You should be embarrassed.

111
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,845
Get in.

112
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,685
No, wait. Fuck...

113
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:06,229
Hey!

114
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,275
Hey.

115
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,195
Hey! Damn it.

116
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,280
Hey!

117
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:16,740
Hey, where's Mr. Yang?

118
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,200
And Soo-hyun!

119
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,298
Mr. Yang!

120
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,675
Han Soo-hyun!

121
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,801
Darn it.

122
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,661
Soo-hyun.

123
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,124
Han Soo-hyun.

124
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:14,756
Fuck this.

125
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,299
Man, fuck this.

126
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,350
Soo-hyun.

127
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:26,768
Mr. Yang.

128
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:28,770
Mr. Yang.

129
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,397
Mr. Yang.

130
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:32,816
Mr. Yang.

131
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,883
Mr. Yang?

132
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,642
Yang Dosa.

133
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,811
Yang Dosa!

134
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,146
J?

135
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:46,825
Mr. Yang!

136
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,574
Please wait just a little.

137
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,536
I'll orchestrate something new.

138
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,344
Anyway

139
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:34,641
I always thought you and J

140
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,810
were up to dirty tricks together.

141
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:40,939
- What did you say, bastard?
- That bastard

142
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:43,900
he completely loses it
whenever he's with you.

143
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,985
He always keeps calm
with everything else.

144
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:47,362
Wait and see

145
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:52,033
whether he comes here
to find you or not.

146
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:54,744
You fucking bastards.

147
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,494
Boss, is everything all right?

148
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:38,746
What about the 500 billion won?

149
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:43,668
They're getting ready
to load it into a container.

150
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,088
Boss, I'm on standby with her.

151
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,382
All right.

152
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,259
You two.

153
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,386
Listen carefully to my words.

154
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,638
You two need to meet

155
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:59,308
with the customs officer
Jang Joong-hyuk has bribed.

156
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,393
And...

157
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,021
Boss.

158
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:04,814
Yes?

159
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,902
Hey, stash her inside.

160
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,415
I hope you live a long life.

161
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:30,256
Goodness, you have such an odd taste.

162
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,508
It must sting so much
in that salty water.

163
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,427
You could've just had fish stew.

164
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,595
How did it go?

165
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:40,808
We need to pay in full
before loading it into the container.

166
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,315
Hey, there.

167
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,109
How are you all doing?

168
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,034
SEAWEED

169
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,411
These are for you.

170
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,163
I hope you like dried seaweed.

171
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:45,665
What are these?

172
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,501
Your favorite, money.

173
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,253
Six hundred million won each.

174
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,133
What about my money?

175
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,010
We kept it safely in there.

176
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,513
In an hour, we'll load it
in the shipping container

177
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:01,806
and send it to the dock.

178
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:04,976
From now on

179
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,187
I will move with my money.

180
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,815
Do you mean you want to get in
the container with the money?

181
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:11,899
Yes.

182
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,819
It takes all day just to reach
the Port of Lianyungang, China.

183
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,028
On top of that

184
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,072
the space is tight,
full of other shipments.

185
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,032
You won't be able to move at all.

186
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,534
He's right, Boss.

187
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,744
Why would you do that?
It's a stretch.

188
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,079
Joong-ki.

189
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,624
I have to do that much
to protect my money.

190
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,209
Right?

191
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,837
You should go get something to eat.

192
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,216
All right. Let's go!

193
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,275
J!

194
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,571
Darn it.

195
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:00,156
I thought he'd show up

196
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:01,699
but he didn't.

197
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:05,203
You've kept her around for a while.

198
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,370
Who is she?

199
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,749
The best in the industry

200
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,500
at counterfeiting money.

201
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,587
The best in the industry

202
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,464
at drug manufacturing.

203
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,050
We're going to rake in
every single penny from China!

204
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,724
There's no one to let go of.

205
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,603
Bring them both.

206
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,064
Let go of me.

207
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,075
What is this?

208
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,881
Why are there so many fatties here?

209
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,052
Hey!

210
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:04,971
You came for Soo-hyun, didn't you?

211
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,181
I came to retrieve my 500 billion.

212
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,517
For both of us, it's all or nothing.

213
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,686
This game will only end
when one of us is six feet under.

214
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,979
Release Soo-hyun.

215
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,023
Then we settle this
until one of us wins.

216
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,817
What a load of bullshit.

217
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,992
There's no need to pull out knives.

218
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,243
Isn't it embarrassing?

219
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,709
- Hey!
- What the heck?

220
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,807
Darn, that stings.

221
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:58,441
Take this!

222
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:07,867
You punk!

223
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,371
You bastard.

224
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:20,796
Darn it.

225
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,549
- You punk.
- Even in this industry

226
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:25,509
there's such a thing as ethics.

227
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,762
Man, that bastard.

228
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,388
Come on, J.

229
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:30,598
It is nice to meet you.

230
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,932
Muscles?

231
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:33,726
Do you work out?

232
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:40,107
J, how can you call a man "Muscles"?

233
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,902
Darn it. All right.

234
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:45,446
Let's see.

235
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:46,864
Here it comes.

236
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,120
Stop!

237
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:56,374
Tell him to stop!

238
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,417
Let go of me, bitch.

239
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,254
One more time.

240
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,800
I'll do anything.
Just tell him to stop, please.

241
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:06,884
You bitch.

242
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,599
Joong-ki.

243
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,018
You'll hurt your hands. Stop that.

244
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:19,438
Darn it.

245
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,735
Hey, Muscles.

246
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:26,529
Hey, man.

247
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:28,280
So you aren't a beginner lifter.

248
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,410
You need to stop.

249
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:40,709
Liars always get the biggest share.

250
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,132
Man, that son of a bitch.

251
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:47,842
Darn it.

252
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,389
Step aside.

253
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,393
Take your 500 billion and get lost.

254
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:00,146
Stop bothering me and get lost,
you bitch!

255
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:03,774
You little...

256
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:10,698
Hey!

257
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:12,867
Soo-hyun.

258
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,420
Do you know why I went to Mujoo Dock
instead of coming straight here?

259
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,714
I never forget punks who get smart

260
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:28,632
or cheeky with me.

261
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:31,927
I never spare punks like that.

262
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,429
Hey, bring me a box cutter.

263
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:34,930
I'll tear him apart.

264
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,515
Hey, J!

265
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:37,975
You idiot.

266
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,562
Did you think 500 billion was yours?

267
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,940
Nothing is yours forever
in this jungle, you idiot!

268
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,860
Whoever takes it first gets it,
you son of a bitch!

269
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,112
This is exactly why

270
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,157
you're a cocksucker, idiot.

271
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,076
Boss, are you all right?

272
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,204
Let go of me, you punk!

273
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:04,793
Jeez.

274
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:08,214
Jungle, my ass.

275
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:09,340
You bastard.

276
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,550
Wildness?

277
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,636
Is this the animal kingdom?

278
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:15,846
Fuck this.

279
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:19,975
Let's see who loses flesh first.

280
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,311
Let's do this.

281
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:24,063
You son of a bitch.

282
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,856
Have you lost your mind, bastard?

283
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,705
Muscles, it's kind of hot.

284
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:42,790
Damn it.

285
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,961
My ears nearly exploded.

286
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:52,258
I'm fucked.

287
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:55,386
Are the villains

288
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,681
fighting over who's worse?

289
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:02,685
Don't move,
or I'll put a bullet in your head.

290
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,105
Man, Cha Ki-tae.

291
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,401
I expected your ambition to get me.
What a surprise.

292
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:12,278
Watching you two

293
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,321
I suddenly came to my senses.

294
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,199
I'm not a wild beast like you.

295
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,618
- A wild beast?
- I'm sorry.

296
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:22,663
Wild beasts must be caught and caged.

297
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:23,747
All right.

298
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,793
My dear police family.

299
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:31,088
Do you know
what annoys you the most on duty?

300
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,466
It's when you take a midday nap

301
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:38,637
and a fly keeps buzzing
around your head.

302
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,475
All of you are the same as ever

303
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,770
annoying as fuck, bastards.

304
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,316
- Drop the knife.
- Drop the guns, sons of bitches!

305
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,942
Hey, Jang Joong-hyuk!

306
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,278
You already know what I'm like.

307
00:26:58,574 --> 00:26:59,783
Five hundred billion won!

308
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:03,746
You can have all 500 billion won

309
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:06,373
so let Soo-hyun go.

310
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:08,083
Son of a bitch.

311
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:10,544
Hey.

312
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:12,671
It's 500 billion.

313
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:14,673
Five hundred billion won.

314
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,636
Soo-hyun.

315
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,869
JANG HYUK-JIN

316
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:10,979
Son of a bitch.

317
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:21,198
Think wisely.

318
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:24,618
It's 500 billion.

319
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,538
You can take all 500 billion won.

320
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:32,918
What the heck are you doing?

321
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:34,920
Let Soo-hyun go

322
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,381
and get lost.

323
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:41,218
Take the damn 500 billion
and get lost, bastard!

324
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:42,553
Jang Joong-hyuk!

325
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,016
Hey, run after him!

326
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,061
Move aside.

327
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,855
Shut your mouth and don't move.

328
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:55,899
Damn it.

329
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,610
Revenge is good for your health.

330
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:10,372
Do not follow me.

331
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,678
Don't try to get smart with me.

332
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,097
Stop.

333
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,403
I'll chase after them,
so handle everyone here.

334
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,488
Yes, sir!

335
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:58,295
Man, these punks.

336
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:01,048
You little...

337
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:04,343
Hold still.

338
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,097
Fuck.

339
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,117
I'm fine.

340
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:06,154
That bastard, J.

341
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,447
All right.

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,992
Just you wait.

343
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,217
Old memories

344
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:30,095
came back to me.

345
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:31,513
What took you so long?

346
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:37,477
With the misunderstanding resolved

347
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:40,314
I can finally sleep easy.

348
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:43,692
Will you

349
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:46,653
disappear again?

350
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,363
That's nonsense.

351
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,742
You only disappear
if you're gone forever.

352
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:04,713
He has such awful timing.

353
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:11,929
Stop it.

354
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:27,527
It was our misunderstanding.

355
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,948
The warehouse explosion
from five years ago wasn't done by J.

356
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:46,380
Bang.

357
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:56,098
Who is this supernote game for?

358
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:58,850
Were you seeking revenge

359
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:02,104
because he damaged your pride
for losing your perfect record?

360
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,814
Or is it revenge for Soo-hyun?

361
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,403
It's not over yet.

362
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:10,946
Our revenge, that is.

363
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,656
"Our"?

364
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,792
We three were after the same thing.

365
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,672
Why did you give up Jang Joong-hyuk
and 500 billion won that easily?

366
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,048
"Give up"?

367
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,301
Did you just say I gave up?

368
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,565
If you leave now,
when will you return?

369
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,029
I haven't had...

370
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:57,492
a chance to apologize or thank you.

371
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:00,746
You wouldn't have gone through

372
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:03,457
everything that you went through...

373
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,377
if it hadn't been for me.

374
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,463
It wasn't your fault.

375
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,507
I'm a villain...

376
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:17,637
so everyone in my life is a villain.

377
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,098
If I stay with you...

378
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,518
your life will be ruined too.

379
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:30,734
It's a world where real becomes fake
and fake becomes real.

380
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,319
This day and age is like that.

381
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,946
Stay sharp about your life.

382
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:37,783
Otherwise, I might come back.

383
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,416
If I'm going to put on a show

384
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,668
I better do it well.

385
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,833
- What's this, Hyuk-jin?
- Give it to your dad.

386
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,084
What is it?

387
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:31,169
My dad took your dad's money and ran.

388
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:33,672
It's only half of what he took,
but it should be enough

389
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,507
to cover your dad's surgery fees.

390
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,221
Hyuk-jin!

391
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,223
If you leave now,
when will you return?

392
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,062
In two to three days.

393
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,369
He swindled over eight million won.

394
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,163
He hasn't returned for a week.

395
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,665
That means he ran far away,
just like his father did.

396
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,251
- Like father, like son.
- No wonder.

397
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:13,170
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

398
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:14,337
A con artist.

399
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,423
But they are bad people.

400
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:18,717
If you become the best con artist

401
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,219
you can live a fake life
as if it were real.

402
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:33,773
JANG JOONG-HYUK'S LOCATION

403
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:06,014
Jang Joong-hyuk.

404
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:07,307
Everything is over.

405
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:25,158
How did you know...

406
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,452
How did I know you were here?

407
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:43,176
Jeez.

408
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:45,845
I have to pee really badly.

409
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,014
Please excuse me.
I have to take a leak too.

410
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:51,017
- Let them go.
- Sorry?

411
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,104
The director was blackmailed again
and told us to let them go.

412
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:55,814
You two.

413
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:57,607
Listen carefully to my words.

414
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:59,067
You two need to meet

415
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,112
with the customs officer
Jang Joong-hyuk has bribed.

416
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:05,824
And offer more money
than what he gave

417
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,909
to win over

418
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:10,453
the customs officers.

419
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,802
I'm getting sick of this.

420
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,178
Let's just go now.

421
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,638
The moment I open my mouth

422
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:33,226
many powerful figures
in politics and business

423
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,769
will go down.

424
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,897
- And?
- In this state

425
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,650
do you really think
I won't use any means necessary?

426
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:42,610
You know what?

427
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,072
You've done too much evil
for it all to just disappear.

428
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:51,161
Those at the top

429
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:53,496
who've done worse than me

430
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,373
are bound to cover up my crimes.

431
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:57,792
Don't die too soon in prison.

432
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:01,296
You must serve
your precious sentence until the end.

433
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,465
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:07,635
Cuff him.

435
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,097
Take the evidence, bastard.

436
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,182
Take it.

437
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,352
Let go of me, you punk.

438
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:27,364
What a load of bullshit.

439
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:34,788
Go.

440
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,305
The chief of a VCU
at Seoul Police Agency

441
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,308
have been publicly listed as
a suspect in two firearm homicides

442
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,352
sending shockwaves through society.

443
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:07,821
A, E, I, O, U.

444
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:08,905
Perfect timing.

445
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,074
What's with the long face?

446
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:16,371
Is it because I'm doing
your nationwide briefing?

447
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:19,290
Isn't it a given?
I'm the team leader.

448
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:23,670
Here.

449
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:24,838
RESIGNATION LETTER

450
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,173
- What's this?
- I don't want to see the director

451
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:29,426
so relay that to him for me.

452
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,595
You solved a huge case.

453
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,556
The five-year-old misunderstanding
was cleared up

454
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:38,101
and you wouldn't have to roam around
in Myeong-dong anymore.

455
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,228
Should I really give it to him?

456
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,522
Okay, I get it.

457
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:45,191
I'll go ask him for your position.

458
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,110
- Give that to me.
- Come on.

459
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:48,778
You already made your decision

460
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,489
so I should respect that
out of courtesy, shouldn't I?

461
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:56,911
Good grief, idiot.

462
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:58,037
Bye, then.

463
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:00,957
Wait.

464
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,376
The director had been worried.

465
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:06,588
You never found
the flash drive, right?

466
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,591
Why do you ask?

467
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:12,010
Well...

468
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,598
I got intel that you and Han Soo-hyun
are working hand-in-hand.

469
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:25,106
Why would I hold her hand?

470
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,816
I have something called taste.

471
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,905
Is the director freaking out
that I might expose the file?

472
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,574
Yes, I think that's the case.

473
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:40,538
Hey.

474
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,041
Do I seem that righteous?

475
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:46,920
That's true. No, right?

476
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:49,631
Then I'll tell him
that you don't have it.

477
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:52,842
Bye.

478
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:55,637
Ki-tae!

479
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,681
Think of your wife and kids, okay?

480
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:03,102
I need to marry first
to have a wife and kids, you lunatic.

481
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:19,536
I'm leaving a message
because you seem to be on air.

482
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:22,956
Have you looked through
the files I've given you?

483
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,217
I want to go back to those days.

484
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,349
It's about time
we moved on from this.

485
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,017
That way

486
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,270
Mr. Yang

487
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,814
will finally rest in peace.

488
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:59,784
THE LATE YANG CHEOL-JIN

489
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:08,459
What's real becomes fake

490
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,336
and what's fake becomes real?

491
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:12,297
What?

492
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,881
It's something J said.

493
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:15,925
He said in this world

494
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:18,595
what's real becomes fake,
and what's fake becomes real.

495
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:22,473
It must've been one of his wordplays.

496
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:24,058
He loved doing that.

497
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,104
No.

498
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:31,065
His face seemed different

499
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:32,817
when he said that.

500
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,027
How can I put this?

501
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:36,654
It was as if
he was sending a message.

502
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:40,908
Could it be...

503
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,213
HAN SOO-HYUN

504
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,929
What's up? Did you want an update?

505
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:03,890
I handed over the flash drive.

506
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:05,558
It's not that.

507
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,977
J's words have been on my mind.

508
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,813
Have you made a request
to authenticate the 500 billion won

509
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,816
confiscated at Incheon Port
container terminal?

510
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,152
Why would I make a request
to authenticate real money?

511
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:18,404
I had them run a few tests
on the counterfeit notes

512
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,031
sent to KC Bank's new headquarters.

513
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:22,241
It's been ten days since the request,
so it should be done soon.

514
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,827
You can come along if you're curious.
After all, you made it.

515
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:35,338
There you are.

516
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:37,173
Hey.

517
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:52,689
What's the result?

518
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:02,448
You seem better than I expected.

519
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:04,534
I just need to rot in here
for three years

520
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,911
so why would I be bitter?

521
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:09,080
Your release is much earlier
than I thought.

522
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:12,959
The firearm case got dismissed
for lack of evidence.

523
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,089
All of Eul Society is keeping quiet,
watching my every move.

524
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:19,757
So

525
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:24,345
all I got was three years
as a first-time offender for theft.

526
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:28,725
Make sure you stay healthy, okay?

527
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:31,602
I'll repay my debt once I get out.

528
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:38,067
Unfortunately, I have bad news.

529
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:40,611
I have a feeling

530
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:44,031
you'll rot in there
for at least 20 more years.

531
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,703
The money you went after

532
00:45:49,036 --> 00:45:52,248
even at the risk of your life...

533
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:53,624
The counterfeits that were swapped

534
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,877
with real notes
and sent to KC Bank...

535
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:59,505
...were supernotes.

536
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:02,508
...were authentic.

537
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:13,060
Boss.

538
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:16,147
Why are we swapping
real money with fake ones

539
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,858
and fakes with real notes again?

540
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,987
Once Yeon finds out,
Soo-hyun will find out too.

541
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:25,740
Then Cha Ki-tae of NIS
will find out as well.

542
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:28,659
The key to this plan

543
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,413
is to deceive everyone

544
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,957
I invited five years ago.

545
00:46:39,545 --> 00:46:41,964
I thought we were almost done.
Why does it feel like it never ends?

546
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:45,885
I have no idea
what's real and what's fake anymore.

547
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,720
Shut your mouth.

548
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,555
We have a long way to go
to meet the D-day.

549
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:50,640
Hurry up.

550
00:46:55,978 --> 00:46:56,979
How much is left?

551
00:46:57,063 --> 00:47:00,274
We still have
about 25 billion won down there.

552
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,319
We've been doing this
every night for a week

553
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:04,445
and we're not done yet.

554
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:06,781
I can't believe
we're doing this on the day of.

555
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,201
- Is this the last batch?
- Yes, it's the last one.

556
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:11,285
Okay, let's go.

557
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,709
Do you expect me to believe you?

558
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:30,555
I finally understand the real ending
to the supernote game

559
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:31,848
just as J wanted.

560
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:35,560
I made sure you got caught

561
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:38,771
circulating a huge amount,
a total of 500 billion won.

562
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,982
To make matters worse,
they were realistic fake bills.

563
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:42,984
It was to make sure
he serves over 20 years in prison.

564
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:46,445
Because you were the real culprit
who caused Yang Dosa's death.

565
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:47,864
Because I wanted revenge.

566
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:51,325
J reached that final goal

567
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:54,871
in my place.

568
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:17,059
Why are you playing
this reckless game

569
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:19,854
when you gain nothing from it?

570
00:48:23,608 --> 00:48:25,610
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

571
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:28,321
You're that slow.

572
00:48:32,658 --> 00:48:33,868
Hey!

573
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:44,921
CITIZEN SERVICE CENTER

574
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:05,524
I hacked the server
that stores private keys.

575
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:08,653
Yes?

576
00:49:13,324 --> 00:49:14,325
Leave it.

577
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:17,578
Just leave it.

578
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:37,390
Let's eat tteokbokki.

579
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:38,516
- Tteokbokki.
- What?

580
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:40,685
We already bought enough food.

581
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:47,858
Thank you.

582
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:50,236
It looks so good. Let me try one.

583
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:15,928
MYEONGSEONG GROUP, CHAIRMAN BANG
SLUSH FUND ACCOUNT UNCOVERED

584
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:31,068
How long has he been meditating?

585
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:32,987
He must be atoning for his sins.

586
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,489
He's confirmed to serve 25 years

587
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:37,324
so he'll be sent
to prison by tomorrow.

588
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:39,744
We won't have to walk on eggshells
on our shifts anymore.

589
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:08,601
