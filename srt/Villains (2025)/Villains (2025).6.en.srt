1
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:25,692
(This drama is a work of fiction)

2
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:26,888
(Any similarity to real people,
organizations, or events is coincidental)

3
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:37,404
(One week to D-Day)

4
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,950
Wow.

5
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,379
This is no joke.

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,037
Let's see.

7
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:17,352
I knew it.

8
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,691
You'll see four micro holes.

9
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:52,546
Yes, that's right.

10
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:58,927
- Wow.
- Nice.

11
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,858
The main computer
in the control room

12
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,727
can order the main circuit of the vault

13
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,795
to create a password.

14
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,885
Then, the main circuit

15
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,055
creates a 16-digit password

16
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,982
and sends it back to the main computer.

17
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,104
Then...

18
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,214
the security manager comes here
from the security room

19
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:18,148
and uses that password
to open this vault.

20
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,456
That's the idea.

21
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:21,408
What?

22
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,627
Sounds complicated.

23
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:28,244
I accessed the server of
the main computer in the control room.

24
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,257
I ordered the main circuit

25
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,218
to create a password as well.

26
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,951
Which chip creates the password?

27
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,965
Firewall...

28
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:11,646
deactivation...

29
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,518
complete.

30
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,015
Okay.

31
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,144
Password.

32
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:27,274
It's 832-0523-7882-06580.

33
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,825
Please.

34
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,166
Is it open?

35
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:50,922
Okay.

36
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,873
Nice.

37
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:27,834
Nice.

38
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:31,338
We have one week until D-Day.

39
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,367
We must switch our 500 billion won
worth of supernotes

40
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,469
with the 500 billion won in this room
within the week.

41
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,877
Okay.

42
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,829
Let's go!

43
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,527
- Yes! Let's go!
- Let's go!

44
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,184
Go!

45
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,147
Nice to see you, lady in yellow.

46
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,368
Turn around.

47
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:27,769
It's KC Bank.

48
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,197
Sir.

49
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,133
Have some coffee while you work.

50
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:00,510
Yes, coffee.

51
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:02,816
Yungyu!

52
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,839
- Who...
- It is Park Yungyu, right?

53
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:11,605
Thank you.

54
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,944
This printer can replicate
human skin,

55
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:52,458
blood vessels, corneas,
even entire organs.

56
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:07,369
Damn it.

57
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,929
I need to quit drinking.

58
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:39,983
How much is left?

59
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,405
Just 25 billion won more,
and we're done.

60
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:48,188
We started working at dawn
all week and still couldn't finish.

61
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,669
Now, we have to beat the clock on D-Day.

62
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,685
- Right?
- With this many people,

63
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,958
one hour is more than enough.

64
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:56,543
You can do this.

65
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,254
Okay, let's go!

66
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:02,716
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

67
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:04,599
Go!

68
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:17,155
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,249
Look there.

70
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:19,821
Do you see?

71
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,846
The password is 857-8538...

72
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,712
then 1005-83880.

73
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,313
- Trash.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:37,577
- Get that cleaned up.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,608
Yes, this is the security team.

76
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,321
I see trash in Area One.

77
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,029
Yes, thank you for your help.

78
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,473
Quickly!

79
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,989
Let's go!

80
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,448
The big boss told me
to gear up for a rough job.

81
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:16,477
No one is even guarding it.

82
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,329
What in the hell?

83
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:21,953
They must have all crawled underground.

84
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,708
Should we take a closer look?

85
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,132
That thing...

86
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,279
Give it to me.

87
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,821
Are you trying to advertise this? Damn it!

88
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,139
Stash it away.

89
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,041
Stash them all away!

90
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,671
I'll go in with Unit One.

91
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,740
Unit Two, wait here.

92
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:14,132
Unit Three, bring the aerosol bomb.
Got it?

93
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,343
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,187
Sure, one second.

95
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:28,640
- Sir.
- Yes?

96
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,192
The NIS wants to talk
to the security manager.

97
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,861
- The NIS?
- Yes.

98
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,190
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

99
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,656
They're on line one.

100
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,432
This is the security manager.

101
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:42,289
Is the cash being moved now?

102
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:43,495
No, not yet.

103
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,759
It will start after lunch, at 1 p.m.
What is this about?

104
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:49,326
Do not move the cash
before we get there.

105
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,750
Also, check the vault immediately.

106
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,080
Okay, we'll do that.

107
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,016
There's nothing wrong.

108
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:06,387
- Yes?
- Let's get down there now.

109
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:08,546
- Yes, sir.
- You keep watching.

110
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,882
- Is this the last of it?
- Yes, it's the last.

111
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,025
Clear out.

112
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:47,621
What's going on?

113
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,127
I said, what's going on?

114
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,986
My colleague had diarrhea
and had to rush inside.

115
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,591
Did he?

116
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,886
Then why are you
sweating so much?

117
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:07,557
I'm naturally very sweaty.

118
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,454
Hey, you!

119
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:32,749
What are you doing here?

120
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,338
Gosh, this is why
I didn't want to do this.

121
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,840
The bank is always the king,
and the movers are just peasants.

122
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,552
Did I do something wrong?

123
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,831
Movers always wear their hats.

124
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,566
Don't you know?

125
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:04,947
You know what?

126
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:09,243
I hung my hat right here.

127
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,576
The moving schedule changed.

128
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,978
We're starting later.
Go rest in the waiting room.

129
00:16:13,062 --> 00:16:14,618
Yes, of course.

130
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,107
My goodness, I apologize.

131
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,787
Yes, please excuse me.

132
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,924
I apologize.

133
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,886
I haven't worn a hat in a while.

134
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,514
- Gosh.
- Damn.

135
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,641
His eyes are oddly friendly.

136
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,563
- All done?
- Yes.

137
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:22,371
What is going on here?

138
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:23,751
How much cash are you
moving today?

139
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,341
It's 750 billion won plus the VIP safes.

140
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,538
Where is the new building?

141
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,781
It's around Gangnam Station.

142
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,495
Stop!

143
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,450
What are you doing?

144
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,296
Move!

145
00:17:58,624 --> 00:17:59,651
Moles, where are you?

146
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,606
Move!

147
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,528
We're 2km away from base camp.

148
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,349
Timing is crucial.

149
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:11,782
When you reach base camp,
Kkangsuni can start climbing.

150
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,661
How long until you break into
the Seoul transport main control room?

151
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,581
Maybe 20 minutes?

152
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,844
Miners, when are you leaving?

153
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,170
I'm not exactly sure.

154
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,837
Probably after the security search.

155
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:39,808
Okay.

156
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:44,425
The miners are about to leave.

157
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,523
Moles, move fast.

158
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:47,929
Let's go!

159
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:00,543
We load three trucks
with 250 billion won each.

160
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,307
We load the VIP safes on the last one.

161
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,814
Then, the security check...

162
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,882
The surveillance cameras
didn't show anything peculiar.

163
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,122
The vault checked out as well.

164
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,633
- Can I take a look?
- Yes.

165
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,551
Stop!

166
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,083
Boss, we've reached base camp.

167
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:39,245
Kkangsuni, start climbing. Fixer...

168
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:42,164
Wait until you hear from me.

169
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,433
See you at the peak.

170
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,366
Okay, we should hurry too.

171
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:09,762
Here we go.

172
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:45,881
Here.

173
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,488
Take this.

174
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,297
Why...

175
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,354
From the cash in the three trucks,

176
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:53,737
each of you, take out one 50,000-won bill.

177
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,779
Why?

178
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,322
Counterfeit bills have
been reported.

179
00:20:58,161 --> 00:21:00,284
No way. That can't be.

180
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:02,588
You don't want to?

181
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:03,746
That's not what I meant.

182
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:05,540
I'll take them out.

183
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,845
I should have known
when Suhyun crawled back to us

184
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,563
to turn herself in.

185
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,816
She played us.

186
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,736
Are you even sure about
the fake 500 billion won?

187
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:40,157
Hey...

188
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:54,446
What is Suhyun doing right now?

189
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:57,834
She skipped lunch.

190
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:00,404
She's sitting in the corner, not budging.

191
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,037
I'm going to interrogate the hell
out of her, so make sure she eats.

192
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,156
Yes, sir.

193
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,922
- Not yet?
- Don't nag.

194
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,233
Rushing won't get it done.

195
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,396
Tiger Tunnel, report.

196
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,779
It's been 48 minutes
since 20 weasels entered the tunnel.

197
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,417
Wait here.

198
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:53,825
There are three
underground bunkers.

199
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,341
Which way is the
entrance and the exit?

200
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,310
You're holding the map
upside down.

201
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:00,849
Jongno is this way.

202
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:02,865
Majang-dong is this way.

203
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,242
We should see the bunker
just around the corner.

204
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,917
- Damn it.
- Sorry, sir.

205
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,030
Yeah, I never did
my military service, you punk.

206
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:13,559
I'm sorry.

207
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:16,812
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,366
Fixer, we're going in 16 minutes.

209
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,586
Look at this.
There's a bunker 30m underground.

210
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,375
Is this the time to be awestruck?

211
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,044
In a few minutes,

212
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,523
they will come around that corner
with 500 billion won.

213
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:03,768
They don't know we're here.

214
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,418
We'll ambush them with the bomb

215
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:06,887
and leave with 500 billion won.

216
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,149
Yes, sir.

217
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:12,638
What's going on?

218
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:14,395
There's no blackout.
What's wrong with this?

219
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:17,581
Get the surveillance footage
from the other roads,

220
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,108
and put it on the screen to check.

221
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,911
It's nothing, right?

222
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:32,913
I'm done.

223
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:36,667
Good work.

224
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,752
I'm only doing this

225
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,838
for Suhyun.

226
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:43,882
You have to get her out.

227
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,135
Don't worry.

228
00:24:46,648 --> 00:24:48,220
It's all taken care of.

229
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:03,361
Okay, here we go.

230
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:09,001
Kkangsuni,

231
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:10,551
how long until you reach the peak?

232
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,287
Approximately two minutes.

233
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:30,357
Those bastards.

234
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,907
Intercept the traffic lights.

235
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:13,818
What's up with the lights?

236
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,983
The remote control won't work.
What's going on today?

237
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,006
This is bad.

238
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,472
- Yes, we know...
- Yes, nothing works.

239
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,249
It's like a parking lot now.

240
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:04,590
The Seoul transport control room
caught on to my hacking.

241
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:05,822
We'll lose them in one minute.

242
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,476
Kkangsuni, are you almost there?

243
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,239
- I'm almost there.
- You better be.

244
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,588
What's this? Is that all?

245
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:37,364
Damn it.

246
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,175
I'm so sorry.

247
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,530
The traffic jam was so bad.

248
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:43,744
I dozed off before I knew it.

249
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,369
What's with the reckless driving?

250
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,145
- I feel so bad.
- My neck.

251
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,789
This was for the materials.

252
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,377
I need to see a doctor.

253
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,435
Who cares? Whatever.

254
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,479
- Here.
- Gosh.

255
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:56,481
It's five million won.

256
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,556
No strings attached.

257
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,698
Even a dog knows how good cash is.

258
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,213
You're so straightforward.

259
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,634
- Thank you.
- Sure.

260
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:15,573
- No insurance. Drive safely.
- Okay.

261
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:16,522
Take care.

262
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,003
Okay.

263
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,254
All clear!

264
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,675
I'm Kkangsuni from the Iron Curtain,
North Korea.

265
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,242
Nothing is impossible
as long as you have grit.

266
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,107
Damn it!

267
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,093
This is ridiculous.

268
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:09,668
Damn it! Run! Hurry!

269
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,327
Damn.

270
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,107
Hey, clean it up.

271
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,818
- Congratulations.
- Quiet!

272
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,891
The 500 billion won

273
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,776
all went to Junghyuk.

274
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:48,653
What about Suhyun now?

275
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:50,088
Without the money,

276
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,240
how are you going to get Suhyun out?

277
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,966
Is that USB really worth
all the trouble?

278
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,511
I was going to use this as blackmail
when I left.

279
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:18,558
I thought I could flee safely.

280
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,475
I just don't get it.

281
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:24,790
I mean,

282
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,877
who were you going to blackmail?

283
00:35:26,962 --> 00:35:29,027
The head of the NIS, of course.

284
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,613
The NIS...

285
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:47,212
Create a shipment invoice

286
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:50,090
to get through the main gate
of the Incheon Container Terminal.

287
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:53,345
Okay.

288
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,891
We've been on the road
for hours.

289
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:12,195
We're wasting time.

290
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,737
I feel just as clogged up

291
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:16,866
as all of this traffic.

292
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:20,732
Who should I thank for that?

293
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:24,479
Who is this?

294
00:36:24,563 --> 00:36:26,461
I manage
KC Bank's new building security.

295
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:27,418
I see.

296
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:30,195
Did the cash trucks arrive safely?

297
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,701
The cash is all inside,

298
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:35,026
but we have a problem
with the truck with the VIP safes.

299
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,010
What kind of a problem?

300
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,585
Well...
One of the safes was robbed.

301
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:40,723
It belongs to Chairman Bang
of Myungsung Group.

302
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:41,891
I'll be right there.

303
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:44,528
Go to KC Bank's new location.

304
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:45,562
What's going on?

305
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:49,108
Someone robbed the safe
of the chairman of the Myungsung Group.

306
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:50,567
What?

307
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,612
Hey!

308
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,285
Gosh, it's a big one.

309
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,163
- Get it.
- I got it.

310
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,419
Goodness.

311
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,074
Look at this.

312
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:35,503
Wow.

313
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,186
Hey.

314
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,788
Doesn't it look like it will die?

315
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,226
- I don't see how it can live.
- It can.

316
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:00,862
It won't die.

317
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:03,098
It's not enough to die,

318
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,558
so it will keep living in that state.

319
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:08,937
You know,

320
00:38:09,032 --> 00:38:10,997
even with fish,

321
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,316
I don't touch the guts.

322
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,986
That's how I deal with people.

323
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,799
It's my silly philosophy.

324
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:23,868
Some suckers borrow from me

325
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,788
and never pay me back, right?

326
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:29,564
I beat them up just to keep them alive

327
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:32,335
so that I can get my money
before I set them free.

328
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,504
Until they fatten up again.

329
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,686
Okay.

330
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:08,121
Shouldn't we get going?

331
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:13,126
Thank you.

332
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:26,389
Damn.

333
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,105
Where are you off to again?

334
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,669
Why?
Are you going to follow me again?

335
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,234
Yes.

336
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:40,086
Hey.

337
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,807
You keep following me for no reason.

338
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:43,833
Aren't you sick of it?

339
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,620
You brought this on yourself.
Don't raise your voice at me.

340
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:49,095
If you can't trust me,
assign someone to follow me.

341
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,580
Changsuk!

342
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:52,774
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

343
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,542
- Me?
- Yes, you idiot.

344
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,340
Changsuk, go.

345
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,829
Go.

346
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:02,133
- Call me.
- Okay.

347
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:07,720
Have you called Gangnam?

348
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,107
We can't reach them.

349
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:11,059
Junghyuk, that asshole.

350
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,853
My vault was robbed,
and I can't reach him.

351
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:16,981
If it gets leaked, it's all over.

352
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,998
Chairman, the NIS
Financial Crime Unit

353
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:21,361
is here to see you.

354
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,251
I was going to
call the police anyway.

355
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:33,473
Seeing the NIS on the case,

356
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,873
I assume you've been filled in.

357
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:36,918
Yes.

358
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,464
How is the head of the NIS?

359
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,393
I haven't called him
since we played golf a few weeks ago.

360
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:44,810
Even if you hadn't called,

361
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:46,594
I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

362
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:49,764
Don't worry. He's good on his own.

363
00:40:50,268 --> 00:40:52,100
I see.

364
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,854
Usually, with the VIP safes, sir,

365
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,778
they're worth millions and billions

366
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,619
filled with diamonds, securities,

367
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:02,490
and sometimes with confidential documents.

368
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,696
They usually hold things like that.

369
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,115
Did your safe also hold

370
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,242
some really important stuff?

371
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:12,370
It isn't cheap.

372
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:14,873
I wouldn't keep just anything in there.

373
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:18,326
Regarding KC Bank's cash moving,

374
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:19,950
we were tipped off

375
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:23,381
that 500 billion won would be swapped
to counterfeits.

376
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,675
During our investigation,

377
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:28,052
we found out that your safe was robbed.

378
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,458
Before we connect the two cases,

379
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,558
we'll look into this quietly.

380
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,760
Okay,
it's the NIS on the case.

381
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,773
I feel a little relieved.

382
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:42,275
What was your name again?

383
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:44,511
My name?

384
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:45,795
Yes.

385
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,422
I'm Cha Gitae.

386
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:50,316
Agent Cha,
you're as quick as a cat.

387
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,660
I'll let the head of the NIS know.

388
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,913
Sure, suit yourself.

389
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:59,834
I'll get going.

390
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,892
- Go ahead.
- Well...

391
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:03,338
I should take this cake.

392
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,425
I almost forgot.

393
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:09,177
By the way...

394
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:10,636
Chairman, sir.

395
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:12,847
There's a guy named Jang Junghyuk.

396
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:15,717
He's the Seoul City Police
Violent Crimes Unit Chief.

397
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:19,312
Do you know him?

398
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,399
Jang Junghyuk...

399
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:26,236
Well, I might have heard of him.

400
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,324
I've met with so many people.

401
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:32,575
I'm also a bit flustered.
I can't remember well.

402
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:35,536
It's how it is at my age.

403
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,347
I see.

404
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,173
How much has been leaked?

405
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:06,195
Junggi!

406
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:07,335
Yes, sir.

407
00:43:08,395 --> 00:43:09,529
Yes, sir?

408
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:13,657
If you drink the seawater
because you're thirsty,

409
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:16,706
will it be okay or not?

410
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:19,456
Well...

411
00:43:20,216 --> 00:43:21,238
It's not okay.

412
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:23,610
You'll become even thirstier
if you drink it.

413
00:43:24,714 --> 00:43:25,754
You're right.

414
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:31,616
I never knew that,
even when I was a child.

415
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,011
I couldn't stand feeling thirsty.

416
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:37,306
Whether it was seawater or muddy water,

417
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:39,976
I just had to drink something.

418
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:43,621
So,

419
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,857
I drank until I dropped.

420
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,778
Like you said,

421
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:52,947
I became thirstier

422
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:55,450
the more I drank.

423
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,497
That's the nature of money.

424
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,752
The more you have, the thirstier you get.

425
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,130
You want more.

426
00:44:16,468 --> 00:44:17,388
Junggi.

427
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,850
That money?

428
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,607
I'm gulping it all down.
