ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

ALL MINORS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE

KC BANK

4
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,499
1 WEEK BEOFRE D-DAY

5
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,056
This is really something.

6
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,099
Now let's see...

7
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:22,498
This is it.

8
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,461
You'll spot four faint holes.

9
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,116
I'll open it now.

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,625
The control room's main computer

11
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,627
will send a PIN command signal

12
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,629
to the main circuit board
in the vault.

13
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:14,967
Then the vault's main circuit board
generates a 16-digit PIN

14
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,261
and sends it back
to the control room's main computer.

15
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,097
Then the head of security
will come down here

16
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,309
and use that PIN to open the vault.

17
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,311
What?

18
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,438
That's really complicated.

19
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:29,815
- It is.
- Yes.

20
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,110
I'm in the control room's
main computer.

21
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,946
I also sent a PIN command
to the main circuit board.

22
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:40,284
Which chip did they say
produces the PIN?

23
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,361
Security program decoding...

24
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,487
PASSWORD DECRYPTOR

25
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,406
...complete.

26
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:22,868
Okay.

27
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:32,294
The PIN is 8-3-2-0-5-2-3
7-8-8-2-0-6-5-8-0.

28
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,470
Please.

29
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:49,937
Is it working?

30
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,518
Amazing.

31
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,233
D-day is one week away.

32
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,111
Before then, we must replace
the 500 billion won here

33
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:42,364
with 500 billion won worth
of our supernotes.

34
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,782
Okay, then.

35
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,534
Let's go!

36
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:47,995
- Let's do it.
- Go!

37
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,250
It's nice to see you, Madam Saimdang.

Mr. Park.

51
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,071
Please have a coffee.

52
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,405
A coffee sounds nice.

53
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,741
Yun-gyu?

54
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,870
- Who are you?
- It is you, Park Yun-gyu.

55
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,458
Thanks.

56
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,139
Darn it.

57
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,851
I should really quit drinking.

58
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,419
WAITING ROOM

59
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:44,880
How much is left?

60
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,008
We still have
about 25 billion won down there.

61
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,803
We've been doing this
every night for a week

62
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,013
and we're not done yet.

63
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,599
I can't believe
we're doing this on the day of.

64
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,895
We have enough manpower here
to finish in an hour.

65
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,271
We've got this.

66
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,023
Let's go.

67
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:07,819
- Let's go,
- Okay.

68
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:21,977
Yes, Mr. Park.

69
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,646
Do you see that?

70
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:32,571
The PIN is 8-5-7-8-5-3-8
1-0-0-5-8-3-8-8-0.

71
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,911
- That piece of trash.
- Oh, yes.

72
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,705
- Tell them to pick it up.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,628
Hello, this is Security.

74
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,214
There's some trash in Area One.

75
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,008
Can you pick it up, please?

76
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,285
Hurry up.

77
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,218
Let's keep going.

78
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,220
I got nervous because Boss said
it was a big deal

79
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,304
but no one's standing guard.

80
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:24,265
What the fuck is going on?

81
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,393
Did everyone burrow underground?

82
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,894
Should we look around a bit more?

84
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,010
Hey, you...

85
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,096
Give me that.

86
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:06,599
Are you fucking
telling everyone who we are?

87
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:07,892
Put them away.

88
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,936
Hide your tools, punks.

89
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:14,357
Team One and I will go in.

90
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,776
Team Two, wait here.

91
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,987
Team Three, get the gas bomb, okay?

92
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,321
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

93
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,166
Just a moment, please.

94
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,460
- Mr. Park.
- Yes.

95
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,129
The NIS wants to speak
with our head of security.

96
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:38,256
- The NIS?
- Yes.

97
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,799
What for?

98
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,551
I don't know.
Take the call on line one.

99
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,430
Hello, this is the head of security.

100
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:46,973
Did the cash transport start?

101
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,516
No, not yet.

102
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,477
We'll start after lunch at 1 p.m.

103
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,603
What's the matter?

104
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:54,189
Halt all procedures until we arrive

105
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,690
and check the vault immediately.

106
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,775
Okay, understood.

107
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,995
There's nothing wrong.

108
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,372
- Yes?
- Let's go downstairs.

109
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:12,957
- Yes, sir.
- You keep watching.

110
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,292
What's this about?

111
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,251
Is this the last batch?

112
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,335
Yes, it's the last one.

113
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,546
Okay, let's go.

114
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,512
WAITING ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

115
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,307
What's going on?

116
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:58,771
I asked what's going on.

117
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,483
My partner said he has diarrhea.

118
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,068
He rushed inside.

119
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:05,778
Is that so?

120
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,489
Why are you drenched in sweat?

121
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,410
I tend to sweat a lot, you see.

122
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,307
Who are you?

123
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,727
What are you doing here?

124
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,566
This is why
I didn't want to take the job.

125
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,569
All bank staff
think they're better than us.

126
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,364
Did I do something wrong?

127
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,709
All transport personnel
must wear a cap.

128
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,419
Don't you know that?

129
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,467
Oh, my bad.

130
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:14,097
I hung my cap on my belt
and forgot about it.

131
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,431
We changed the schedule around.

132
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,016
The kick-off time got delayed.

133
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,101
Rest in the waiting room.

134
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,311
Oh, yes, sir.

135
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,021
I'm real sorry about this.

136
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,692
I'll head to the waiting room then.

137
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,902
My bad. I'm sorry.

138
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,780
Gosh, I forgot the hat.

139
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,865
My goodness.

140
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:34,575
Darn it.

141
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,327
Why do those eyes seem familiar?

142
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,082
- Ready?
- Yes.

143
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,336
What's this about?

144
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,629
How much are you moving today?

145
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:31,257
It's 750 billion won
and our VIP safe-deposit boxes.

146
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,341
Where's the new headquarters?

147
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,551
It's close to Gangnam Station.

148
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,326
Wait!

149
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,495
What are you doing?

150
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,121
Load it fast!

151
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,582
Mole, where's your location?

152
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:05,666
Move it!

153
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,672
We're about 2km from the base camp.

154
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:13,299
It's all in the timing.

155
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:16,719
Once you reach the base camp,
start transporting, Kkangsooni.

156
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,515
How long do you need to hack
Seoul Central Traffic Control?

157
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,142
Around 20 minutes?

158
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,730
Gold Mine, when do you leave?

159
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:28,815
I don't know yet.

160
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,371
We'll set off after the search.

161
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:44,747
Okay.

162
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,252
The Mine's about to set off.

163
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,045
Mole, get into position quickly.

164
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,380
Let's go!

165
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,184
These three trucks
will each take 250 billion won.

166
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:08,229
The other truck will take
our VIP safe-deposit boxes.

167
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,772
Did you check everything?

168
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,858
There was nothing out of the ordinary
on security footage

169
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,026
and we confirmed
the vault was secure.

170
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,570
- Can I have a look?
- Sure.

171
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:35,339
Stop!

172
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,052
Boss.

173
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,971
We reached the base camp.

174
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,389
Kkangsooni, start transporting.

175
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,473
Fixer.

176
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:46,934
Stand by until we get word.

177
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,145
I'll see you on the top.

178
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,196
Come on, let's get moving.

179
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,503
Let's do this.

180
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:50,748
By the way.

181
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:52,333
Take this.

182
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,210
Why give me this?

183
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,295
Out of the bills
in each of these trucks

184
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,631
can you get me a 50,000-won bill?

185
00:20:58,714 --> 00:20:59,715
Why?

186
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:01,300
We got a tip about counterfeit bills.

187
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,346
No way. That can't be.

188
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,348
What? You won't do it?

189
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,599
No.

190
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,434
I'll do it.

191
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,832
I should've noticed Han Soo-hyun

192
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:34,333
when she walked into the NIS.

193
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,545
We all got played.

194
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:40,381
Is there even 500 billion
in counterfeit bills?

195
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,510
Wait...

196
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,941
What's Han Soo-hyun up to?

197
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:02,695
She skipped lunch

198
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:05,197
and is sitting in a corner
of the night-duty room.

199
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,782
I'll grill her hard when I get back

200
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,451
- so make sure she's well fed.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,809
- You're not done yet?
- Don't pester me.

202
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,436
Rushing me won't help.

203
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:40,232
Tiger, report on the tunnel.

204
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,068
It's been 48 minutes

205
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,861
since around 20 Weasels
and Tiger entered the tunnel.

206
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:52,119
Hang on.

207
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,664
BUNKER A, BUNKER B, BUNKER C

208
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:58,751
There are there bunkers in total.

209
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,295
Where do we get in and out?

210
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,880
You're holding the map upside-down.

211
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,841
Jong-ro is this way.

212
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,885
Majang-dong is that way.

213
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:11,138
The bunker's right around the corner.

214
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,809
- Fuck you.
- Sorry, Boss.

215
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,894
Yes, I didn't serve
in the army, okay?

216
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,020
- Sorry, Boss.
- This bastard.

217
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:21,649
Sorry, Boss.

218
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,219
Fixer, set off in 16 minutes.

219
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,519
There's a place like this
30m underground?

220
00:23:58,602 --> 00:23:59,603
This isn't the time to gape.

221
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:02,189
Not long from now

222
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,484
they'll come around that corner
with 500 billion won.

223
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:10,281
We'll use the gas bomb
while their guard is down

224
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:12,616
- take the 500 billion and leave.
- Okay.

225
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,663
What's wrong?

226
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,290
What's happening
when the power's still on?

227
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,003
Check the security footage
from other highways.

228
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,550
SAMIL-DAERO

229
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:30,634
It's nothing, is it?

230
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,264
SAMIL-DAERO, HANNAM-DAERO

231
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:37,850
Happy now?

232
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,479
Good job.

233
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:45,483
I'm doing this for Soo-hyun.

234
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:48,903
Promise to get her out.

235
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:50,946
Don't worry.

236
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,157
I told you, I made a deal.

237
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:08,380
Let's go.

238
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:13,886
Kkangsooni.

239
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,387
Estimated time to the top?

240
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,265
I expect to take about two minutes.

241
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,985
What the fuck?

242
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,261
ENTERING TUNNEL 1

243
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:08,602
Traffic lights, now.

244
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:18,779
What's wrong with the lights?

245
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,823
I can't control them remotely.
What's going on?

246
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:21,990
This is bad.

247
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:23,117
- Hello?
- I can't get through.

248
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:28,706
Yes, the roads are packed!

249
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:01,465
Do you want to die?

250
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,050
Fuck it.

251
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:09,389
Central Traffic Control detected it.

252
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:10,682
I'll lose control in a minute.

253
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:12,434
Kkangsooni, are you done yet?

254
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,228
- I'm almost done.
-I need you finished.

255
00:30:58,564 --> 00:30:59,690
What's this?

256
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:00,774
This is it?

257
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,815
What the heck?

258
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,109
I'm so very sorry.

259
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:46,403
The traffic's at a standstill

260
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,614
and I fell asleep at the wheel.

261
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:50,240
You can't be like that on the road!

262
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,325
My bad.

263
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:52,701
My neck hurts so much.

264
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:54,828
This was meant to pay for materials.

265
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,246
I should see a doctor.

266
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,332
Oh, darn it.

267
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,416
Here.

268
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,293
It's five million won.

269
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,340
The money's clean.

270
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,592
Even a stray dog would take it.

271
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:09,968
It's cash.

272
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:16,099
I like your style.

273
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:17,476
- Thanks a lot!
- Sure.

274
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,560
Don't call your insurance.

275
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,520
- Drive safely.
- Thanks.

276
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:21,730
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

277
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,774
Take care. Go on your way.

278
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,801
I'm Iron Curtain, Kkangsooni.

279
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,678
There's nothing I can't do

280
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,262
if I fight with all my might.

281
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,902
- Okay.
- Darn it!

282
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:10,946
I don't believe this.

283
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,616
Fuck, run.

284
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:24,626
Come on.

285
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,044
Clean up.

286
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,530
Congratulations, Boss.

287
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:01,997
MOZART'S SYMPHONY NO. 25

288
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,755
We lost the 500 billion
to Jang Joong-hyuk.

289
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:53,632
What'll you do about Soo-hyun?

290
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:55,217
We lost the cash!

291
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,177
How will you get her out now?

292
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,945
That flash drive's worth that much?

293
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,490
I was going to
blackmail him with this...

294
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,120
to smuggle my way out.

295
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,248
What the heck is that anyway?

296
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,670
Who were you going to blackmail?

297
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:34,047
The NIS Director, of course.

298
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:36,424
The director of the NIS?

299
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,149
Print me an invoice

300
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:54,734
that'll get me
into Incheon Port container terminal.

301
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:57,988
Okay.

302
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:17,174
We've been stuck here for hours.

303
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:21,636
I'm as frustrated as this traffic.

304
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,266
I wonder whose fault that is.

305
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,352
Who's this?

306
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm head of security

307
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,314
- at KC Bank's new headquarters.
- Oh, hello.

308
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:35,108
Did the trucks
reach their destination safely?

309
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,610
The cash is fine

310
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,905
but there's a problem
with the safe-deposit truck.

311
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:40,989
What is it?

312
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:43,491
Someone got into one of the boxes
belonging to

313
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:46,369
- Myeongseong's Chairman Bang.
- I'll be right there.

314
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,247
Take me to KC Bank's
new headquarters.

315
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,332
What's the matter?

316
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:53,752
Chairman Bang's safe
has been broken into.

317
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,086
What?

318
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,466
There you go.

319
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:03,386
My gosh.

320
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,222
That's a big one.

321
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:08,099
- Get it.
- All right.

322
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:14,522
Oh, gosh.

323
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:17,859
My word.

324
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,215
My goodness.

325
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,981
Hey.

326
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,692
You think it'll die, right?

327
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:01,987
How could it survive?

328
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,071
You're wrong.

329
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:05,573
It won't die.

330
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,412
It'll go on living in that state,
unable to die.

331
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:13,873
Listen.

332
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:15,917
Even when I'm eating a fish

333
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,378
I leave its internal organs intact.

334
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,048
That is how I deal with people...

335
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,385
and my stupid philosophy.

336
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,220
You know?

337
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,888
Fools who borrow my money

338
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,725
and don't pay me back.

339
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,519
I beat them just enough
so they don't die

340
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:37,230
and I let them go
once they pay principal and interest.

341
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,441
Then I wait
until their flesh grows back.

342
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,372
Okay.

343
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:12,974
Shouldn't we get moving now?

344
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:31,284
Darn it.

345
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,125
Where are you off to now?

346
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,210
Why?

347
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:41,586
You'll tag along?

348
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:42,670
Of course.

349
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,881
Hey.

350
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:48,760
Don't you get tired of tagging along
when you've got nothing to do?

351
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:51,554
Why are you complaining
when you're not at all in the right?

352
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:53,598
Have someone tail me
if you don't trust me.

353
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:56,393
- Chang-seok!
- Yes?

354
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,186
- You're with me.
- Me?

355
00:39:58,269 --> 00:39:59,312
Yes, you.

356
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:02,899
Chang-seok.

357
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:05,026
Go, hurry on after him.

358
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:06,861
- Call me.
- Okay.

359
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:12,617
Did you call Gangnam Police?

360
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,077
They can't reach him.

361
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,745
Jang Joong-hyuk, that punk...

362
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,873
We can't reach him,
my safe has been broken into?

363
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,960
I can't let that get out.

364
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:24,879
Sir, someone
from the NIS Financial Crime Team

365
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:26,381
is here to see you.

366
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:36,224
I meant to call the police.

367
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,226
The NIS sent someone right away.

368
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,770
You got a tip-off, didn't you?

369
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:41,855
Yes.

370
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,150
How's your director doing?

371
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:48,278
We haven't talked since
our golf outing three weeks ago.

372
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,696
I'm sure he'll be fine

373
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,364
without having to hear from you.

374
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,532
Don't mind him.

375
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:54,909
He has no problem
having fun on his own.

376
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,620
I see.

377
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:00,874
Regarding the safe-deposit boxes
that the bank's VIP clients rent.

378
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:03,710
I believe items
worth hundreds of billions of won

379
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,545
such as diamonds, stocks and bonds

380
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:09,674
and top-secret documents are kept.

381
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:12,093
Were you keeping something important

382
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:14,220
in your safe-deposit box?

383
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,474
I wouldn't pay a fortune

384
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:19,559
to hide something unimportant.

385
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,313
We got a tip
that 500 billion won in cash

386
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:26,274
from KC Bank is going to be swapped

387
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:28,026
with counterfeit bills
while being transported.

388
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,737
I was looking into it

389
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,072
when I heard
your safe-deposit box was raided.

390
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:36,367
Until I find a connection
between the two incidents

391
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:38,161
we'll conduct a secret investigation.

392
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:39,746
I see.

393
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:43,374
I'm greatly relieved
that the NIS is on the case.

394
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:47,170
What did you say your name was?

395
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,173
- My name?
- Yes.

396
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:52,217
It's Cha Ki-tae.

397
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,094
Oh, Agent Cha's quick action.

398
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,639
I'll be sure to mention it
to your director.

399
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:00,767
You can do that.

400
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,104
I'll get going, then.

401
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:06,189
Sure.

402
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:08,316
I'll take one of these.

403
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:12,195
Oh, right.

404
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,532
Chairman, do you happen to know

405
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:17,909
someone called Jang Joong-hyuk?

406
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,620
He's head of the Violent Crimes Unit.

407
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:23,998
Do you know him?

408
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:28,419
Jang Joong-hyuk?

409
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,005
The name does sound familiar.

410
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:34,259
I meet so many people for work

411
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,052
and I have a lot on my mind.

412
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:37,637
I can't say for sure.

413
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,473
We're all like this at my age.

414
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,226
Sure.

415
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:52,068
How much of the information got out?

416
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:11,129
Joong-ki!

417
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:12,297
Yes?

418
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:14,215
Yes, Boss.

419
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:18,469
If you're thirsty

420
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:21,723
should you drink seawater or not?

421
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,060
You shouldn't.

422
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,479
It'll make you even more thirsty.

423
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:30,607
Right?

424
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:36,529
I didn't know that as a kid.

425
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,698
I couldn't help but drink.

426
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,368
Whether it were seawater or mud water

427
00:43:42,994 --> 00:43:44,996
I had to drink it to feel better.

428
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:48,458
So

429
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,794
I drank it to my heart's content.

430
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:54,631
But you were right.

431
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:57,925
I actually got even thirstier

432
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,053
the more I drank.

433
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:06,476
That's what money is like.

434
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,688
The more you gain,
the thirstier you feel.

435
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,025
The more you crave.

436
00:44:21,282 --> 00:44:22,283
Joong-ki.

437
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:25,453
That cash.

438
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,377
That's all mine.

439
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:05,470
