1
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,947
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:33,949
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

3
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,618
NIS DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

4
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,122
DIRECTOR OH GI-HWAN

5
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:49,465
EUL SOCIETY ROSTER

6
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,056
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

7
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,516
Deputy Director Ma.

8
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,271
Have you heard of the Eul Society?

9
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:10,486
I only know it's a social club
for high-ranking political figures.

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,281
I heard many descendants
of collaborators are members.

11
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:15,616
Then

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,536
do you know what kind of project
the Eul Society is pushing?

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,373
I've heard some political gossip

14
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:25,626
but who would believe
such a baseless rumor?

15
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,965
I'll get straight to the point.

16
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:34,384
I received a decisive document.

17
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:38,222
A list of Eul Society members
and a record of what they've done.

18
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:39,473
Who would...

19
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:44,520
It said the group laundered
500 billion won through KC Bank.

20
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,148
If the member list leaks

21
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,901
it won't just be a scandal.

22
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,986
The country will fall into chaos.

23
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,115
Just who are the members?

24
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:03,622
My influence in that organization is
somewhere in the middle.

25
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,165
Let's put it that way.

26
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:45,080
Everyone opposed it,
saying you were some loan shark

27
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,540
without a pedigree.

28
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,084
And I took the heat
and recommended you.

29
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,169
And

30
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,213
what makes you think
you can stab us in the back?

31
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,799
Because you didn't trust us

32
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,342
you collected and kept that ledger

33
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,803
and those photos
on a flash drive, didn't you?

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,722
An uncopyable flash drive.

35
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,265
You really came prepared.

36
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:07,186
The money to make
Eul Society's chosen man a candidate

37
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:11,565
and get him into the Blue House
can't come from clean funds.

38
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,568
That's why you picked me,
a guy who plays in the shadows.

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,361
That's right.

40
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:21,575
But just what were you thinking,
collecting evidence to backstab us?

41
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:26,914
Everyone here is
a so-called leader of society

42
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:29,166
each with a firm grip
on their own field.

43
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,210
Like you said, Representative Choi

44
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:34,046
I'm just a loan shark
with no pedigree.

45
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,381
If we create a president

46
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,799
is there any guarantee

47
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,260
you'll make me
head of Woorim Financial Group?

48
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,554
If people around you oppose it

49
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:45,682
is anyone here going to step up
and take the bullets for me?

50
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:48,644
So you kept the evidence
as an insurance policy?

51
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:49,853
That's right.

52
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,315
- Come on.
- I put my life into the work.

53
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,318
I didn't want to get thrown away
the moment I was no longer useful

54
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,862
so I secured leverage.

55
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,614
Also

56
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:03,367
once you keep your promise,
it's automatically destroyed.

57
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,286
Don't tell me
you're afraid of such insurance.

58
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,669
We struggled to build a front-runner

59
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,004
and now we're close
to taking back first place.

60
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,174
If you dump me now...

61
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:26,848
who's going to raise the money
for the remaining race?

62
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:27,933
So?

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,688
By when can you secure the funds?

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,191
Well...

65
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:40,279
Whether or not the funds are secured
will determine your value.

66
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,656
And if that flash drive leaks

67
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,493
I can't guarantee your position.

68
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,793
The truth is

69
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,880
that 500 billion was
supposed to come into my hands.

70
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,134
But

71
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,303
it looks like Jang Joong-hyuk

72
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,014
pulled a stunt.

73
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,600
I believe he's also the one
who touched my safe-deposit box.

74
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,315
That's why I told you repeatedly.

75
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,609
A wolf can never become a dog.

76
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,530
I'll sketch the plan.

77
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,615
The result is on you, Chairman Bang.

78
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,163
EPISODE 7:
UNDERCOVER; A HIDDEN TRUTH

79
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,048
There was a carpet
that hadn't been there before

80
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,382
so I got a bad feeling and moved it.

81
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,508
This is what I found.

82
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,514
How did they rob the vault?

83
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,016
It's biometric access

84
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,143
with a real-time
self-generating passcode system.

85
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,227
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,291
Sir.

87
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:35,894
CHIEF'S OFFICE,
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION

88
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:37,104
You could have called for me.

89
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,688
I didn't expect you to come here.

90
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,360
I heard you're very interested
in our organization.

91
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:44,778
Yes.

92
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:48,865
I thought I might be able to help,
so I knocked a few times

93
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,535
but I guess I wasn't qualified.
I never got a response.

94
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,999
Do opportunities just fall
into your lap if you sit around?

95
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,002
As for the mess
Jang Joong-hyuk caused

96
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,505
I already took swift measures.

97
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,799
You know about the drug ring boss

98
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:08,927
who was shot dead in Jong-ro
in broad daylight, right?

99
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:12,180
The bullet from that scene matches
the bullet recovered

100
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,724
at the Incheon
illegal gambling murder scene.

101
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,854
Reopen that murder case properly.

102
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,314
Hold a press conference
and tell it exactly as it is.

103
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,399
Pardon?

104
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:24,401
But we already wrapped it up.

105
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:27,320
Our organization wants people
who make quick decisions.

106
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,699
If you do this job well,
I'll put in a good word for you.

107
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:32,993
Yes.

108
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,245
I understand exactly what you mean.

109
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,664
Are you fucking serious?

110
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:40,083
Why are we suddenly dropping
the investigation?

111
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,086
Also, why does the deputy director
keep avoiding me?

112
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,841
I can't tell you the details.

113
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:52,012
We got an order
to quietly close the supernote case

114
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,264
so you can go back
to roaming around Myeong-dong.

115
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,348
Hey.

116
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,267
You know the 500 billion
they sent to the Bank of Korea?

117
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,978
They were chemically treated
to look that way.

118
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,938
If we collect samples
and run a composition test

119
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,941
we can immediately see
that it was done artificially.

120
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,527
Then, we have grounds to interrogate
Chairman Bang of Myeongseong.

121
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,696
Those bills were already shredded.

122
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,822
- What?
- And Myeongseong

123
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:14,075
followed normal procedures
and got brand-new bills in exchange.

124
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,785
Who told you to destroy the evidence?

125
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,537
You sons of bitches.

126
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,623
You're quick as hell with that,
you fuckers.

127
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,208
Will you please stop swearing?

128
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,376
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

129
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,837
Did you just swear at me?
Your superior?

130
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,256
Does it look like
I'm swearing at you?

131
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,050
Should I swear at them
who did all the dirty work?

132
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,427
- Darn you.
- What?

133
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,012
A suspect has been wanted.

134
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,848
The public was shocked
to learn the suspect is a mid-level

135
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,975
Seoul Metropolitan Police officer.

136
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,061
An urgent press conference
is now taking place

137
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,605
at Incheon Jung-gu Police Station.

138
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,440
Let's go live.

139
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:49,694
A strong suspect in the Songwol-dong
shooting murder in Incheon

140
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,530
has been identified
as Violent Crimes Unit Chief

141
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,365
Jang Joong-hyuk

142
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,283
and we're currently pursuing him.

143
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,661
This follows
an internal investigation...

144
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,204
They're rewriting the story.

145
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:03,959
You know something, don't you?

146
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,419
What do you mean?

147
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,631
The reason the counterfeit case
turned around so suddenly.

148
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,178
I don't know.

149
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,224
Tell me.
How much do you actually know?

150
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:20,850
I told you. I don't know.

151
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,602
Tell me.

152
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,687
How much do you know?

153
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,605
Stop bugging me.

154
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:26,690
Come on.

155
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:33,822
Here's what I know.

156
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,157
Orders came down from above

157
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,078
to wrap this case up clean
and send you back to where you were.

158
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,082
You can clean up the mess
on your way out.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,001
What mess?

160
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,252
Han Soo-hyun.

161
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,714
It's like we started surgery
and had to stitch up halfway.

162
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:53,300
What's the point of keeping her here?
We should get rid of her.

163
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,635
That's it?

164
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,597
That's the only reason
you're hastily releasing Han Soo-hyun

165
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,308
the one who knows the most about J?

166
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:09,983
The crew that swapped the 500 billion
for supernotes

167
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,569
is threatening the director.

168
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:14,738
That's all the deputy director said.

169
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,822
What?

170
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,762
Wait.

171
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,639
Look who it is.

172
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,558
Aren't you the guy
getting famous as a murder suspect?

173
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,394
What made you look for me?

174
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,482
Do you want to give me a promotion

175
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,484
by letting me arrest you?

176
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,361
Oh, man.

177
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:59,991
Look at you.
You're barking like a damn stray dog.

178
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:03,453
Jeez.

179
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:12,587
Follow me.

180
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:19,177
Open it.

181
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,728
So?

182
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,064
Does this change your mind?

183
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:33,316
My goodness.

184
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,651
Boss.

185
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:38,029
I'm still hungover from yesterday.
Sorry for being so rude.

186
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:41,449
You pathetic little bastard.

187
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,660
Jeez.

188
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,496
That's your best trait, you know.

189
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,916
That's why I can feel at ease
leaving the work to you.

190
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,711
- You little shit.
- Yes.

191
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,087
You punk.

192
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,339
That's right. That's my strength.

193
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:57,674
I'll do anything!

194
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,885
Take this, bastard.

195
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,474
The sea routes are
all blocked now, right?

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,103
Of course. There's a warrant out.

197
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,357
You've been covering
for those Chinese smugglers

198
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,192
so you're familiar
with the customs guys, right?

199
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:17,360
Yes, I am.

200
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:19,154
Now, listen carefully to what I say.

201
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,615
You're going to plant it

202
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,952
in the logistics warehouse
that I already bribed

203
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,496
on the day of the inspection.

204
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,167
Keep it on-site,
no matter what it takes.

205
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,007
Before that

206
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,261
we'll hide the money
in boxes of dried seaweed.

207
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,769
Then you move them to China.

208
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,483
That's a brilliant idea.

209
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,901
How long to get it done?

210
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,778
Money's the key.

211
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:02,530
Cargo ships come and go all day long

212
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,658
so they'll be gone in no time
if I pay the right people.

213
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,914
What's she doing here?

214
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,248
Right.

215
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,793
She wanted to come
to pick up the drugs we made.

216
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,379
Take me with you.

217
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,715
China, the Philippines,
Thailand, wherever.

218
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,926
With my skills,
we can make good money.

219
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:26,638
You don't want to stay in school?

220
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,766
What do I get as a famous professor?

221
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,351
A measly 200 million won a year?

222
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,229
And what do I have left
after 30% tax and deductions?

223
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,523
I got into this to make money
in the first place.

224
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,660
Do you want a smoke?

225
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,206
Sure.

226
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:05,844
She's coming with us.

227
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:25,989
2 YEARS AGO

228
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,592
How dare you show up in front of me

229
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,261
after what you did to me?

230
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,557
Get in.

231
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,352
You suffered for three years.
You need some nutrients.

232
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:08,114
Remember when I said
I'd get you revenge for free?

233
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,708
Let's try the stew.

234
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:20,835
That's hot.

235
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,047
Stop glaring at me like that.

236
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,300
If you really want to screw J over

237
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:30,011
you have to drop that grudge
you have against me.

238
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:33,890
Trying to fix it on your own
gets you nowhere.

239
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:36,935
Eat this.

240
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,481
Keep your head and think smart.

241
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,776
Fine.

242
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,986
CASINO COUNTERFEIT CASE REPORT

243
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:48,529
You said you saw a Carnival

244
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,365
and a box truck
on the way to the warehouse, right?

245
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:51,658
Check out the photo.

246
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,579
We tracked down both vehicles
and identified the drivers.

247
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,706
It's Choi Do-sik in the Carnival.

248
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,167
An Incheon-based drug kingpin.

249
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,169
And that mean-looking guy
in the box truck.

250
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:06,255
That's Jang Joong-hyuk
from Incheon Jung-gu Police Station.

251
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,007
- Why would a cop...
- That bastard J

252
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,010
wanted to bail overseas
with the 30 million.

253
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:13,429
He probably got together
with Joong-hyuk for that reason.

254
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:18,977
Here.

255
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:23,564
Exactly 13 minutes
after the warehouse blew up

256
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,192
this security camera
a kilometer away caught it.

257
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,324
That's the J you mean, right?

258
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:40,790
Yes.

259
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:44,627
So?

260
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,547
What do you want from me?

261
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:55,513
How about you and I team up?

262
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,183
After all, we want the same thing.

263
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:09,902
Did you get some rest?

264
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,530
Did you catch J?

265
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,616
Tell him that I'll see him next time.

266
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,995
Show her out.

267
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,040
What are you talking about?

268
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,461
You're still putting on the act?

269
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:27,837
What?

270
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,423
Chemicals that turn
new bills into worn-out bills?

271
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,675
Because of you,
I went to the Bank of Korea

272
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,093
and made a complete ass of myself.

273
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:35,303
While that was happening

274
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,598
that bastard swapped 500 billion won
in counterfeit bills into real cash

275
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:41,601
then raided Chairman Bang's safe
and took the flash drive.

276
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,727
The flash drive?

277
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,645
- Yes, keep acting.
- What...

278
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,273
So what happened to J?

279
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,817
I don't care how he swapped them.
What matters is that we catch him.

280
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,111
How am I supposed to catch him
when you're stalling me

281
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,654
and throwing
the whole case into chaos?

282
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,743
I got orders to kick you out

283
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,037
because you're a compulsive liar
and a crazy bitch.

284
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,290
My take is different, though.

285
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:07,460
Different how?

286
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,380
You

287
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,758
and J are partners.

288
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,096
You guys are the same.

289
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:21,682
The con artist
and the one chasing him.

290
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,726
You use people when you need them

291
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,561
and blame them when it falls apart.

292
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,648
No one has the guts
to see it through.

293
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,858
I'm leaving.

294
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,653
Sorry for throwing
the investigation into chaos.

295
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,943
Hired a Jung-gu Station cop
with a six-month suspension.

296
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,736
Disguised as export seaweed.

297
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:20,199
I have Dr. Choi's location.

298
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,427
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

299
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,348
Bring it to me.

300
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,933
I got a text from a professor I know.

301
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:53,900
Let me see it.

302
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,206
I told you to keep the phone off

303
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,249
until we left Korea.

304
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,752
I apologize.

305
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,589
Assigning the police
to Joong-hyuk's case

306
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:01,759
by linking the two murders was

307
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:06,430
simply a temporary measure
to blind him for a while.

308
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,891
For the survival of the Eul Society

309
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,103
the NIS should handle him.

310
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:18,276
We were getting ready to catch him.

311
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:21,404
"Catch him"?

312
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,741
We need him dead.

313
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:33,708
This isn't Namsan in the KCIA days.

314
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,419
Do you truly believe
that's still possible these days?

315
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,546
And if it isn't?

316
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,506
Should we just sit back

317
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:44,093
and let him decide
whether Eul Society survives or not?

318
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,936
- How about using Cha Ki-tae?
- Cha Ki-tae?

319
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,188
He got burned for defying orders

320
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,482
over the counterfeit 100-dollar bills
at the casino five years ago.

321
00:21:58,566 --> 00:21:59,567
That Cha Ki-tae.

322
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,361
I see.

323
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:05,531
He's waiting for a chance

324
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,950
to restore his reputation
with this supernote case.

325
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:12,079
We put blood on his hands?

326
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,250
I like it.

327
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:10,679
What is this?

328
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,436
Food tastes better outside, right?

329
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,648
Better than the slop in there.

330
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,568
Why do you keep following me?
You're annoying.

331
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:27,405
You're a VIP.
I have to provide security.

332
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,456
J's here.

333
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:47,550
Can you come right now?

334
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:51,345
The heavier the object,
the more accurately it falls.

335
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:56,100
A wide rectangle
won't catch air resistance.

336
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:57,726
Trust me.

337
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,732
Are you sure you'll be okay?

338
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:04,942
I said I'm fine.

339
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,111
Why do you keep asking?
I can do this.

340
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:11,240
If you're going to do it,
hurry the fuck up.

341
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,426
We're going back into the lion's den.

342
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,844
What's the point of security?

343
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:35,473
I'm still not sure
if this is the right call.

344
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:40,853
We attempted to bait the lion,
but it didn't work.

345
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,813
We have no choice
but to go primitive.

346
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:47,943
It's not primitive.
It just sounds dumb. That's why.

347
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:49,695
By the way

348
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,656
are you really stepping away
from this case?

349
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:54,658
Beats me.

350
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,206
INCOMING CALL

351
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:03,375
This is Cha Ki-tae.

352
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:06,420
What?

353
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:08,339
Okay, I'll be right there.

354
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:12,676
How's the seaweed packing coming?

355
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,138
Our guys are working hard in shifts.

356
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,557
It'll be done by dawn
if they move fast enough.

357
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,810
- Anything unusual?
- Unusual...

358
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,649
- What is it?
- Money surely talks.

359
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:28,901
I offered 600 million won up front
and 1.2 billion in total

360
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:30,819
- and they said yes immediately.
- What time?

361
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,947
At 3 p.m.
It's the cargo ship to China.

362
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,740
What about the Coast Guard?
Any movement?

363
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,033
Oh, please.

364
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:39,620
Even the Coast Guard
doesn't inspect ships that massive.

365
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,332
Don't let your guard down.
Finish the job clean.

366
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:44,416
Yes, sir.

367
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,836
It's going faster than I expected.

368
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,921
Yes.

369
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,216
We leave here at 7 a.m. tomorrow

370
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,260
- so have everything ready.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:56,762
Dr. Choi.

372
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:58,722
Bring me a bottle of water.

373
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,642
Oh, sure.

374
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:09,900
Also

375
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:12,319
to the Incheon Port
container terminal

376
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,990
we're using waterways, not roads.

377
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,993
We depart from Mujoo Dock
on Yeongjong Island

378
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,328
and go straight to the Incheon Port
container terminal.

379
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,664
Before 8 a.m. tomorrow

380
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:27,501
we need to move the box truck
with the 500 billion to Mujoo Dock.

381
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,587
Transfer them onto a fishing boat
within an hour

382
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,047
and move them to the Incheon Port
container terminal.

383
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,215
Yes, understood.

384
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:35,593
Is there anything I can do to help?

385
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,221
It's all heavy lifting.

386
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,599
What would
a high-level specialist like you do?

387
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,686
You just stay glued to my side.

388
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:47,104
Okay.

389
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:49,982
Boss, your phone.

390
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,360
Speak.

391
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:08,792
A ninth-grader scammed someone
and got sent to juvenile detention?

392
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,296
Choi Chang-seok.

393
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,048
Yes?

394
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,654
Soo-hyun!

395
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,281
Soo-hyun.

396
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,076
Is it all over now?

397
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,160
I came back safe.

398
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,080
You must have been worried.

399
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:48,499
Soo-hyun.

400
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:51,877
You're back.

401
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,677
This annoying little tumor
has latched on again.

402
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:03,263
I never thought of you as annoying.

403
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,017
The interrogation
must have worn you out.

404
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,228
Go inside and rest.

405
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,689
I got you a separate room.

406
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:13,399
The room in the middle.

407
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:18,570
Don't you want to know

408
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,366
what I talked about at the NIS?

409
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:26,078
Whatever you said over there

410
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,539
in a situation like this

411
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:30,999
what is it going to change?

412
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,086
You went and did your part.

413
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:35,879
Rest.

414
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:37,715
"You did your part"?

415
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:39,758
What's that supposed to mean?

416
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:44,596
You're hungry, right?

417
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:49,893
I haven't come here in so long.

418
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,520
It brings back old memories.

419
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,148
And it still tastes the same.

420
00:28:56,942 --> 00:29:00,571
What did you mean by I did my part?

421
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,865
The basic principle
of a magician's trick is

422
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:05,826
to fool people's eyes.

423
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,787
The second is to use psychology.

424
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:12,916
Even though I knew your scheme
to make perfect fake money

425
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,460
and pin me as the distributor

426
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:18,338
why do you think I suggested
we make the game even bigger?

427
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:20,758
Soo-hyun.

428
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,886
You pretended you couldn't refuse
and accepted my proposal.

429
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:28,766
You went all in
to make perfect counterfeit bills.

430
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,563
The day the supernotes were finished,
you made the tip-off call.

431
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,607
Go to the address I give you

432
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,567
and you'll be able to verify
the counterfeit bills.

433
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,778
The day 500 billion won was finished

434
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,155
why do you think I left you behind

435
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,365
and moved to a new hideout?

436
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:50,078
Soo-hyun.

437
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:51,914
Stay here.

438
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,373
Even so

439
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,709
how did you predict

440
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,128
I'd team up with Ki-tae
and walk into the NIS?

441
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,255
It wasn't a prediction.
It was an analysis.

442
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:04,051
Watching you look for an opening
till the very end

443
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:05,677
I analyzed you.

444
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,681
"If I give Soo-hyun a chance

445
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,017
she'll make a reckless move."

446
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:15,771
He asked her to manufacture

447
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:17,815
some kind of chemical agent

448
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,108
for Plan B.

449
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,529
Now I get what you mean.

450
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,407
I ended up disrupting
the NIS investigation myself.

451
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,117
That's how deception works.

452
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,662
The moment you go "Ah"

453
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:33,372
is the moment I go "Oh."

454
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,919
Then you don't need me anymore.

455
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,088
Why did you get me out of the NIS?

456
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,631
Why wouldn't I need you?

457
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,383
I'm going to use you

458
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,261
to push Cha Ki-tae into action.

459
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:49,888
You want me to act as a double agent?

460
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,098
I'm going to make

461
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,309
Ki-tae chase Joong-hyuk.

462
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,603
While that's happening

463
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:01,275
we intercept his 500 billion won
right in the middle.

464
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:11,618
A magician uses psychology
to pull a trick

465
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,662
and a con works the same way.

466
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,039
Would you like to team up with me

467
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,919
and pull off a magic-trick con?

468
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:29,219
You're not stalling
and plotting to backstab me again

469
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:30,762
are you?

470
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,724
The one who trusted you first...

471
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,019
was me.

472
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:46,695
Fine.

473
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,615
I also need to see the end.

474
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,576
I built it, set the table

475
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:56,371
and did everything
for the whole supernote project.

476
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,334
Let's reclaim 500 billion won.

477
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,710
Good.

478
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,546
I'll trust you one more time.

479
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,049
Soo-hyun.

480
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:11,511
It's a world where real becomes fake
and fake becomes real.

481
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:12,888
And we're going to

482
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,349
take advantage of that.

483
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,310
"A world where real becomes fake

484
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:20,062
and fake becomes real"?

485
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,276
There's such an organization
in this country?

486
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,450
I only recently learned

487
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:35,494
what you've been going through.

488
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:37,955
Depending on the results

489
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,209
that hardship could turn
into the one big shot of your life.

490
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:46,129
Well, I'm just glad that you let me

491
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,423
keep the investigation rights.

492
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:50,384
It gives me a chance to catch them.

493
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:52,678
Good.

494
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:57,099
With that grit,
make sure you deal with Joong-hyuk.

495
00:32:58,475 --> 00:32:59,977
There will be a reward.

496
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:04,272
Intel says J has the flash drive,
not Joong-hyuk.

497
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:05,983
What?

498
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,860
That means Joong-hyuk ran
with only the 500 billion won.

499
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,992
Joong-hyuk or J

500
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:20,122
it doesn't matter who took
the flash drive now.

501
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:24,292
Whoever has it

502
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,962
he needs to be

503
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:30,549
sealed away with it forever
and never come back into the world.

504
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:34,386
Then

505
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:36,555
you want J to...

506
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,059
A national agency for the people?

507
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:48,567
A national agency is
literally an agency for the nation.

508
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:49,818
Wouldn't you agree?

509
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,611
Team Leader

510
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:53,697
Cha Ki-tae?

511
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:57,868
No.

512
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:01,663
I should make you
an assistant director, at least.

513
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,380
So

514
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:14,593
he's transporting the 500 billion
by waterway, not roads?

515
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:16,219
Yes.

516
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,267
By the way

517
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,395
about the text I sent

518
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:28,732
Joong-hyuk snatched my phone
after seeing it

519
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:30,692
then he just let it slide.

520
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,946
Maybe he missed it.

521
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,531
But it also feels like he didn't.

522
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,501
Dr. Choi.

523
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,545
We've known each other
for five years now.

524
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,465
Why do you always wear
those same glasses?

525
00:34:58,553 --> 00:34:59,638
Boss.

526
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,641
If you suspect Dr. Choi,
why did you let her go out?

527
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,481
We feed false intel,
send J to the Mujoo Dock

528
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,067
while we take the road

529
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:15,195
to Incheon Port container terminal.

530
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:20,784
You take the 500 billion
and wait at the Mujoo Dock.

531
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,036
I'll be there
after I handle something.

532
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,969
My revenge was

533
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:41,930
to ruin his life
by tying him to the supernote case.

534
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,850
No matter how it ends,
you get what you want, don't you?

535
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,145
I've been thinking about it
since yesterday.

536
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,604
About J, I mean.

537
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,150
The way he bit our bait
without hesitation

538
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,986
and the reason he targeted
KC Bank's 500 billion won.

539
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,905
What if it was all
for the flash drive?

540
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:00,365
That makes no sense.

541
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,868
He was just trying to get
out of here with the 500 billion.

542
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:05,162
He only stole the flash drive
for personal protection.

543
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:09,332
Once he leaks the flash drive,
he'll become a target.

544
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:12,002
Printing it out
and sending it to the NIS Director?

545
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,713
That doesn't exactly sound like J.

546
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:15,839
Okay, then.

547
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:18,508
If J is such a cautious type
who moves with multiple plans

548
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:21,178
why doesn't he see
he's risking himself?

549
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:24,222
He's good at playing on
people's psychology.

550
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:25,599
Obviously. He's a con man.

551
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,978
Let's not see him as a con man

552
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:32,314
but as a magician.

553
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,734
People who are obsessed
with what happened five years ago.

554
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,611
Let's do it right, one last time

555
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:39,279
with supernotes.

556
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:42,949
The magician used their obsession

557
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:45,493
to recreate the exact same situation
as five years ago.

558
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:51,208
They fell under the hypnosis
of obsession and desire

559
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,418
and moved exactly as commanded.

560
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,556
Exploiting the gap

561
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,351
the magician went ahead
with the show he had devised.

562
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,271
He manipulated people
with desperate needs

563
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:16,149
and used them as pawns

564
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,026
for his real mission.

565
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:20,946
What's the real mission?

566
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,698
Exposing the Eul Society
for what it really is.

567
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:26,785
I suspect you're at the heart of it.

568
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:28,245
Five years ago

569
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:31,498
because of the Eul Society,
you got unfairly exiled.

570
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:33,792
And J designed the supernote case

571
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,962
to play out like
it did five years ago.

572
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,130
If you don't take this chance

573
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:42,259
you will never be reinstated.

574
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,302
With your temperament

575
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:46,388
would you really just sit and watch?

576
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,975
Wouldn't you want to go all-in,
betting your entire life?

577
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,726
I got pushed out unfairly

578
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,312
and chased the warehouse case
for five whole years.

579
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:59,567
If J is using my need for payback
after five long years...

580
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,319
Looks like the ball is in your court.

581
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:04,030
Will you let yourself be used

582
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:05,699
or will you use him?

583
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,869
We teamed up for your revenge,
while I wanted to reclaim my honor.

584
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:11,579
What's your next move?

585
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:14,499
I get what you're saying.

586
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,420
Just pass the information
without exposing J's movements.

587
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:19,504
Don't worry.

588
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:21,840
After all

589
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,551
that's why I accepted J's offer.

590
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:39,190
If Joong-hyuk
takes the Incheon Bridge

591
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:41,026
it's about 17 minutes

592
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:42,819
to the Mujoo Dock.

593
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,659
If he takes
the Yeongjong Grand Bridge

594
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,661
it's about 12 minutes.

595
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:53,246
JANG JOONG-HYUK'S EXPECTED ROUTE

596
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:23,276
What's going on?

597
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:31,659
There you go.

598
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:05,837
Yeon, you know the taxi J uses
when he's disguised as a taxi driver.

599
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,589
Do you know what car it is?

600
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,549
It's a modified smartcar.

601
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,842
A smartcar?

602
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:15,221
It means you can control
its basic functions with a phone.

603
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:25,857
We're done packing. Please confirm.

604
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:40,288
DR. CHOI
HEADING TO THE DOCK AT 7 A.M

605
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:53,635
Joong-hyuk is heading
to the Mujoo Dock at 7 a.m.

606
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:55,345
Call Ki-tae.

607
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:57,889
Where is everyone?

608
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,766
They had a job to do,
so they left first.

609
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,520
We don't have time.

610
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,146
Call Ki-tae now.

611
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:12,487
Soo-hyun and Yeon.

612
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,781
You're out of this operation.

613
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,329
Is this why you wanted to team up?

614
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,461
You accepted my offer,
intending to lock me up too.

615
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,093
Call Ki-tae now.

616
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,177
Call him.

617
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,141
Oh, my.

618
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,310
It's nice to see you.

619
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:04,956
We're ready to go, sir!

620
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:22,557
I hacked the system.

621
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:24,767
It's open.

622
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,111
You contacted Mr. Cha, right?

623
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,821
No.

624
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,532
You want to go alone
to a place that dangerous?

625
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,409
I'll handle it myself.

626
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:55,465
SEAWEED

627
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:57,300
It smells savory.

628
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,551
Let's go.

629
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,094
Yes, sir.

630
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:01,763
Let's move!

631
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,852
This is our chance to catch both J
and Joong-hyuk together.

632
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:52,313
They're no pushovers, so stay sharp.

633
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:53,398
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,003
