ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,116
EPISODE 1: J, THE ARCHITECT
RECRUITMENT AND BETRAYAL

3
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:42,249
2013, INCHEON

4
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,144
(Foreign language)

5
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,065
(Foreign language)

6
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,276
(Foreign language)

7
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,039
(Foreign language)

8
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,086
(Foreign language)

9
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,201
Yes, I know.

10
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,789
The money's coming in.

11
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,502
Auntie, are you sick?

12
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:09,795
Why do you look so down today?

13
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,422
Do I?

14
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,216
That can't be right.

15
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,885
All right! I win!

16
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:22,683
About that counterfeit yuan you make.

17
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:25,727
I hear it's so precise,
it caused a stir in China.

18
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,063
People always know
when you get new stock.

19
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,983
With material prices going up,
I barely break even.

20
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,485
Let's just go
with a 10% commission today.

21
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,617
Soo-hyun.

22
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,661
You didn't learn that on your own,
did you?

23
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,832
I mean,
the counterfeiting techniques.

24
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,209
Yang Dosa taught you, right?

25
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,462
- Kind of...
- No.

26
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,132
Your mascara smudged.

27
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,383
I'm not even wearing makeup.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,142
Auntie, let me use the restroom.

29
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,310
Get her!

30
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:07,644
Shoot.

31
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,241
Stop!

32
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,437
- Move!
- Move aside!

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,064
Hey! Grab her!

34
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,382
She's not here?

35
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,841
Over there.

36
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,604
Let me go. Who are you?

37
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,107
- There she is.
- The foreigner.

38
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,444
- Come here!
- Stop right there!

39
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:40,529
Stop.

40
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,216
INN AND SAUNA

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,010
Are you crazy? Where are we going?

42
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,262
You'll get caught eventually.

43
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,932
Stop imagining weird scenarios
and come with me.

44
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:10,684
- Wait.
- Hurry.

45
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,023
Give us a room.

46
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,109
Your Korean is really good.

47
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:20,485
We're in a hurry!

48
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,237
All right, you lovebirds.

49
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,782
The most romantic room is...

50
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:26,867
Faster.

51
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,244
Go on up.

52
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,640
The guys after you came into the inn.

53
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:52,934
- Change into these clothes.
- What?

54
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,271
Where did you even get these?

55
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,731
Is that your concern right now?

56
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:27,969
Who are you?

57
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,518
Who the heck are you?

58
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:36,686
Me?

59
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,480
The guy who saved you.

60
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,527
If you don't trust me

61
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,821
you're free to handle
everything alone.

62
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,657
I won't stop you.

63
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,162
You're a real cop, right?

64
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,791
People keep posing
as others these days.

65
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:00,127
I'm a detective
from Seoul's Major Crimes Unit.

66
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,336
Check my badge.

67
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,754
Fine.

68
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:06,049
- Lieutenant...
- What are you doing?

69
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,427
You can't bust down the door
and arrest them.

70
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,011
- Seriously.
- Come on.

71
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,432
The spare key for Room 302...

72
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,643
- Where did I put it?
- Hurry.

73
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:34,703
Act natural.
Look at me with loving eyes.

74
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,381
Why do they always do it
outside the room?

75
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,196
So who exactly are you?

76
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,240
I think you mean to say, "Thank you."

77
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,703
I hadn't sprinted at full speed
for a long time, and I'm starving.

78
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,164
Is there any good place
for hangover soup nearby?

79
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,373
Are you joking right now?

80
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,876
After what I just did for you

81
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,003
I deserve at least a meal.

82
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:26,713
Don't I?

83
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,971
You drive a truck pretty well, too.

84
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,892
Is it the one wearing them

85
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,228
or the clothes I picked,
that look good?

86
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,688
You still haven't told me
who you were.

87
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,941
Well, why were you running
from the police?

88
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,196
You must have had a reason.

89
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,781
Everyone is

90
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,575
faced with unexpected situations.

91
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,327
I just got lucky

92
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,497
and got involved with you.

93
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:08,880
Haven't we met before, though?

94
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:15,512
Are you hitting on me right now?

95
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:17,847
Please.

96
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,892
Why would I even bother?

97
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,312
How far are we going for food?

98
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,921
That was good.

99
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,718
What? Are you done already?

100
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:58,305
Maybe I ran too much.
I lost my appetite.

101
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,602
Come to think of it...

102
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,939
one bowl of soup isn't enough
for what I did today.

103
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,068
Name, Han Soo-hyun.

104
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,239
Born at 1887-8, Sui-dong, Seoul.

105
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,742
Your mom ran away
because she couldn't handle

106
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,368
your dad's long illness.

107
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,911
At the age of eight

108
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:24,247
you moved to a shantytown
in Poi-dong, Seoul.

109
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,376
Your dad died when you were 12.

110
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,965
Who are you?

111
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,469
It's extremely high-quality
counterfeit yuan

112
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,512
with perfect designs,
precise security features

113
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,473
flawless holograms,
and great paper stock.

114
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:44,726
Rumor has it in Macau
that it's spreading through China.

115
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,977
So

116
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,563
I tracked down your identity.

117
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,774
After coming to Korea,
I watched you for two weeks.

118
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:55,070
To see if you were
good enough to work with me.

119
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,114
In other words,
I'm going to scout you

120
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:01,409
and find out
if you're worth working with

121
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,619
or not.

122
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,792
You got the wrong person.

123
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,761
At the age of 18, you became a family

124
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,596
with Yang Cheol-jin by chance

125
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,557
also known as Yang Dosa,
a legendary counterfeiter

126
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,892
and his daughter Yeon.

127
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:30,480
You treat them more than family.

128
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:33,066
To pay off Yang Dosa's debts

129
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,529
you started making counterfeit bills
and distributing them.

130
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:40,407
Thanks to that

131
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:44,077
I discovered someone with real talent
who can make me money.

132
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,371
Who the hell are you?

133
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:47,497
Big or small

134
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,666
you've already stepped
into the crime world.

135
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,086
For a family not related by blood.

136
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:56,631
- Don't talk about them like that.
- It must have taken you courage.

137
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,218
You might as well
go big once and get out.

138
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,850
An architect can hand you
a perfect blueprint

139
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,562
but if the technician refuses,
we walk away.

140
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,313
That's the rule in this line of work.

141
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:17,861
But etiquette says
you at least hear the plan.

142
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,613
So?

143
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,285
Are you ready to listen?

144
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,500
Counterfeit 100-dollar bills.

145
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,003
I just need 300,000 of them.

146
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:42,969
Then I'll swap 30 million dollars
in counterfeits for real US dollars.

147
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:44,512
That's...

148
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:48,975
roughly 30 billion won.

149
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,394
And we split it 50-50.

150
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:56,858
Not everyone gets to be a criminal.

151
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,736
Just take a big score once
and walk away.

152
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,991
Pay off the debts of Yang Dosa

153
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:06,451
who you love so much

154
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,537
and live happily.

155
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,206
Eat whatever you want.

156
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,415
Buy whatever you want.

157
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,823
Dad! Soo-hyun! Let's eat!

158
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,492
What are they doing?

159
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,370
Dad, the noodles are getting soggy.

160
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,915
Why isn't anyone answering?

161
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,301
Thirty million dollars
in counterfeits?

162
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:10,390
Even you selling paintings overseas
was nerve-wracking enough.

163
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,058
This is way too big.

164
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,394
How could you trust him
to jump at that offer?

165
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:16,312
Let's at least hear him out.

166
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:19,065
We can walk away from this life

167
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,526
and start fresh.

168
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,319
And then what?

169
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,613
Who's going to pay
for your medicine and surgery?

170
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:29,158
You need that surgery this year,
or you might lose your leg.

171
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:32,078
How am I supposed
to just watch that happen?

172
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:35,373
This isn't worth your future.

173
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,501
What about the money
you lost to a scam

174
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,254
after taking loans
to start a fishing-boat rental?

175
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,047
Forget the principal.

176
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,884
You're adding 100 million won
in interest every year.

177
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:48,678
Seriously.

178
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,106
Who wants ramyeon?

179
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,983
Yeon does.

180
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:03,943
- Soo-hyun? Dad?
- Yes.

181
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,153
- Sure.
- Come on.

182
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,280
The noodles are getting soggy.

183
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,407
Ta-da!

184
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,491
That looks delicious.

185
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:13,995
Let's eat.

186
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,835
Isn't it amazing?

187
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,003
Indeed.

188
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:30,303
Did you cook just enough
for each of us?

189
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:36,142
- Yes.
- I told you to make

190
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,478
a double portion
if you're going to make it this good!

191
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,650
Late-night ramyeon is the best!

192
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,444
Let's see.

193
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,279
All right.

194
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:51,991
I barely touched mine,
and you already took half.

195
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,869
I served myself too much.
There's only one bite left now.

196
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,205
- Seriously.
- Eat up.

197
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,581
- Sure.
- Eat.

198
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,791
Should I cook more?

199
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:02,543
- Cook six packs. Put the water on.
- Six?

200
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,431
Hey, Yeon.

201
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,352
I told you I'd smash your computer
if you kept doing that.

202
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,271
Hackers are like mountaineers
risking their necks

203
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,191
for the thrill of reaching the top.
It's about the achievement.

204
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:28,528
I'm not stealing info or money.
What's the big deal?

205
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:29,654
Seriously.

206
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:31,781
Just one minute. No, two minutes.

207
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:33,700
If I pull this off

208
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,202
I'll be the youngest hacker to breach
the US Department of Defense.

209
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,286
Hey!

210
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:41,749
Fine.

211
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,713
Do that again, and I'm smashing it.

212
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,423
Okay.

213
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,482
Not everyone gets to be a criminal.

214
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,360
Just take a big score once
and walk away.

215
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:45,855
Ms. Han Soo-hyun?

216
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:47,732
Excuse me?

217
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,154
Hey!

218
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,156
Hey!

219
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,407
- Wait!
- Come on.

220
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,703
Oh, man.

221
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,246
I told you to stop.

222
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, my heart.

223
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,086
Take your earbuds out
when someone's calling you.

224
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,964
Stop messing with me and go.

225
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,674
I am going.

226
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,718
Here, take this.

227
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:22,475
If you want to hear
the rest of the architect's plan

228
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:24,936
come at 2 p.m. today. From J.

229
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:31,150
Let's at least hear his briefing.

230
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,736
You know I'm gullible.

231
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,321
That's how I always get scammed.

232
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:37,698
I'm here with you.
What are you worried about?

233
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:38,950
Forget it.

234
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:42,537
Man, you live rough.

235
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,831
Houses like this still exist?

236
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,544
Hello, sir.

237
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:00,513
- What's this?
- It's seed money.

238
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,515
But we haven't even agreed yet.

239
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:06,477
To print 300,000 100-dollar bills,
you'll need tons of materials

240
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,271
and a bigger printing machine.

241
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,399
Here.

242
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,987
All in 50,000-won notes.

243
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,765
This way.

244
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,180
This is the count room.

245
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,641
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
move through daily

246
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,602
so swapping out 40,000 dollars a day
won't leave a trace.

247
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,521
It's a foreigners-only casino

248
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,315
so I'll be using disguises.

249
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:35,733
So will Soo-hyun.

250
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,109
Me too?

251
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,239
GAMING ROOM

252
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,844
I thought you were
only a bold, young man

253
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,972
but you're surprisingly thorough.

254
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,644
What is your name?

255
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,981
Our boss's name is a company secret.

256
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:16,065
NORTH KOREAN DEFECTOR

257
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:17,275
SPECIALIZING IN SUPERNOTE PRINTING
KKANGSOONI

258
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,111
I go by J.

259
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,280
Please call me that from now on.

260
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,073
CRIME ARCHITECT
J

261
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:28,327
J?

262
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,498
Shall we have some fun?

263
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:40,089
MASTER BANKNOTE ARTIST
YANG DOSA

264
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,885
YANG DOSA'S SOLE SUCCESSOR
HAN SOO-HYUN

265
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:45,970
Let's do it!

266
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,118
Not bad at all.

267
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,015
It looks good.

268
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,434
2013

269
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:01,605
2016

270
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:55,576
Good work.

271
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:07,296
You said you had something to say.

272
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:12,426
Do you want to join me

273
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:14,553
for hangover soup?

274
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:26,941
The 30 million dollars
are laundered into real cash.

275
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,984
And you have something to say.

276
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,947
Why? Are you planning to disappear?

277
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,990
That's nonsense.

278
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:38,494
You only disappear
if you're gone forever.

279
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,789
Someday

280
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,166
I'll show up in front of you again.

281
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,004
When you do

282
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,215
I'll be in a different line of work.

283
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,509
An architect like you.

284
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,558
Yang Dosa's surgery went great

285
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:02,518
and you made plenty of money.

286
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,189
You really want to keep your foot
in this world?

287
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,986
There's a thrill to it.

288
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,280
And the more you make,
the more you want.

289
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,323
It's kind of addictive.

290
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:23,747
You're not cut out
to be an architect.

291
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:26,333
- Why not?
- You've got a nasty temper.

292
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,501
You...

293
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:30,921
How are you going to control others
when you can't control your emotions?

294
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:33,507
See?

295
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,927
It's written all over your face.

296
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,179
Jeez, I swear I'll bite you.

297
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:50,190
Three years flew by, like a dream.

298
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,694
Guess our time together felt
like a dream to you.

299
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,372
You're not addicted to the work.

300
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,042
You're addicted to me.

301
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,133
When you asked me to work
with you in the beginning

302
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:17,926
I wanted to punch you in the face.

303
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:20,679
Why does this feel so bittersweet?

304
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,923
Once you understand
someone's emotions...

305
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:00,386
you can predict what they'll do next.

306
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,183
Especially you.

307
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,021
You're way too easy to read.

308
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,447
That's why

309
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:22,533
you're better suited as a technician.

310
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,056
Seriously.

311
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:50,310
You can get conned,
but you could never con anyone.

312
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,816
I put some thought into picking it.

313
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,526
I hope you like it.

314
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,369
Is this a parting gift?

315
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:11,206
Do you want to come with me?

316
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,760
Living with Mr. Yang and Yeon

317
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:25,971
makes me happy.

318
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:44,072
Haven't you seen me somewhere before?

319
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,454
Why do you keep asking that?

320
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:52,748
I don't know.

321
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,501
You just look familiar.

322
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,090
A con artist's life

323
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:04,426
is all fake.

324
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:10,974
The only real moments are
when you stab someone in the back.

325
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,228
We live lies like they're real.

326
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,317
So don't trust me too much.

327
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:22,778
Okay?

328
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,216
MR. YANG

329
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,509
Hey, Mr. Yang.

330
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,513
He says they'll let us walk

331
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,431
if we bring the money.

332
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,601
Cops don't make calls like that.

333
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,479
Don't believe a word he says.

334
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,273
I'm almost there.

335
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:02,526
Do not hand over the money.
I'm on my way.

336
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:14,288
It's solid intel.

337
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,582
They printed 300,000 fake bills there

338
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:19,126
and cleaned them through the casino.

339
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:20,460
You punk.

340
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:23,088
Stop yapping. Just go and check!

341
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:33,181
It's a sensitive case,
so the investigation was planned.

342
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,101
What the fuck?

343
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:38,645
We busted our asses on this case,
and now you're pulling the plug?

344
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:10,761
I am not giving up on this,
you sons of bitches. You hear me?

345
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,212
Dad!

346
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,172
- Yeon!
- Dad!

347
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,174
Yeon.

348
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:50,384
- Are you okay?
- Soo-hyun.

349
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:53,345
- Are you hurt?
- Dad's inside.

350
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:55,722
Get out of here.

351
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:56,932
Stay outside.

352
00:32:57,015 --> 00:32:58,684
Go as far as you can.

353
00:32:58,767 --> 00:32:59,935
Watch out.

354
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:45,522
J?

355
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,325
Mr. Yang.

356
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:42,788
Mr. Yang.

357
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:44,873
Mr. Yang.

358
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:47,000
Wake up, Mr. Yang.

359
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,646
Stop right there!

360
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,651
Let go.

361
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,654
Let go of me!

362
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:19,694
You're in early.

363
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:21,738
- You were here all night?
- Pretty much.

364
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:26,076
What's going on?

365
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,369
Good morning, sir.

366
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:29,412
Did you all stay up?

367
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,956
No, I just came in early.

368
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:32,874
My goodness.

369
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:43,718
Oh, boy.

370
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:53,436
Hey.

371
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:55,981
This is Jang Joong-hyuk
from Incheon Jung-gu Police Station.

372
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:58,191
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION,
CHIEF OF NARCOTICS TEAM

373
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,859
JANG JOONG-HYUK

374
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,070
- How did you get this number?
- What do you mean, "How"?

375
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:05,365
Your buddy Charles ratted you out.

376
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,450
- Darn it.
- "Darn it?"

377
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,910
You bastard.

378
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,370
Hey.

379
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,165
Make a lunch reservation
for noon today.

380
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:17,711
You're paying,
since you just cussed at me.

381
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,840
You know I love
multi-level fraud investigations.

382
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:26,511
Charles gave me 8 names,
so you bring me 16. Got it?

383
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:29,472
Do that, and I'll cut you loose.

384
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,558
I'm busy, so I'll hang up.

385
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:41,443
Oh, man.

386
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:43,486
Oh, boy.

387
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:48,241
Oh, that feels good.

388
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,499
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

389
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,794
- Good work.
- Good work.

390
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,266
YANG CHEOL-JIN

391
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,020
Yang Dosa,
the greatest banknote designer.

392
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:19,606
HAN SOO-HYUN

393
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:20,690
And

394
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:23,693
his only apprentice

395
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,112
Han Soo-hyun.

396
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,115
That's you.

397
00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:40,043
HEAD OF NIS FINANCIAL CRIME TEAM
CHA KI-TAE

398
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:48,259
You spent one year printing
300,000 counterfeit 100-dollar bills.

399
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:50,553
And another two years
working undercover

400
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:53,223
in the casino's count room
to swap them for real cash.

401
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:56,476
You pulled it off spectacularly.

402
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,311
Just a day after you succeeded

403
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:00,438
you lost everything.

404
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,609
Who took the 30 million dollars?

405
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,903
If it weren't for you

406
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,447
I would have

407
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,075
killed that guy with my own hands.

408
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:14,619
That man in the gas mask?

409
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:15,912
Yes.

410
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:20,166
He blew up the place to burn evidence
and ran off with the money.

411
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:21,751
That bastard.

412
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,131
He's the one who killed Mr. Yang.

413
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,438
Tell us who he is
and where we can find him.

414
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,981
We'll take him down for you.

415
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:45,024
He said

416
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,652
he lived abroad most of his life.

417
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,073
All I know...

418
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:56,286
is his nickname, J.

419
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:57,829
J?

420
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,372
Did you just say J?

421
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:01,166
The one the FBI, Interpol

422
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:05,044
and even the Chinese police
have been after for five years?

423
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:10,508
I didn't know he was that famous.

424
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:13,303
He only said...

425
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,141
he was a top-tier crime architect
in the industry.

426
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:22,187
We had J right in front of us.

427
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:31,988
2021, SEOUL

428
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,675
Move!

429
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:54,719
Get out of the way!

430
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:20,578
Son of a bitch.

431
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,033
