1
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:29,903
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,030
ALL MINORS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STANDARD PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

3
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:33,365
You're so good with words.

4
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,993
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

5
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,077
A con artist.

6
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,829
What?

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,499
I'm going to be the best con artist
and make lots of money

8
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,501
beyond anyone's imagination.

9
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,462
But they are bad people.

10
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:56,430
What do you think is the difference
between us and people who live there?

11
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm not trying to become a con artist

12
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,727
just because of money.

13
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,065
If you become the best con artist

14
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,233
you can live a fake life
as if it were real.

15
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,034
You suddenly use the sign language
only to badmouth me, right?

16
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:18,160
No.

17
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:19,286
I can't let this go on.

18
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:20,913
Teach me how to sign starting today.

19
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,336
Only if you race on the bike
all the way back home.

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,171
Deal.

21
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:32,800
Hold tightly.

22
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:35,928
I'll start racing.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,145
EPISODE 2: SUPERNOTE GAME;
THE REINVITED ONES

24
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,977
Thank you.

25
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,567
What on earth, mister?
Do you know who I am?

26
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,360
Seriously.

27
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:34,653
This is too harsh.

28
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,697
Here, look.

29
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:42,828
I'm a diabetic patient.

30
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,454
I'm going to faint right away

31
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:46,582
if my blood sugar level drops
behind the wheel!

32
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,833
The ticket.

33
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,254
Please take this. Thank you.

34
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,256
Oh, right. Hey.

35
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,468
This is a token of my gratitude.

36
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,846
Due to the anti-graft law,
I can only give you the smaller size.

37
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,390
It's just a token of my heart.

38
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,703
What the heck?

39
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:25,787
TEAM LEADER HAN YONG-SAN

40
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:27,539
My goodness.

41
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,584
To what do I owe the honor, Mr. Han?

42
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,419
I can't believe you called this man

43
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,922
who snoops around
private loan sharks in Myeong-dong.

44
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:38,842
I'd receive the call with both hands
if I weren't on the road.

45
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,552
My apologies for using Bluetooth.

46
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,804
Quit that kind of nonsense on me.

47
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,473
We got a tip on counterfeit bills.

48
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,725
You should check it out
since you always seem to be free.

49
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,644
What?

50
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,687
A tip on counterfeit bills?

51
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,773
HEAD OF NIS FINANCIAL CRIME TEAM
CHA KI-TAE

52
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,608
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY CRACKDOWN TEAM

53
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,238
Darn it.

54
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,656
Hey, Violent Crimes Unit!

55
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,492
You can pull out and come back later!

56
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,576
My man.

57
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,789
Did you hit male menopause?
Why are you so annoyed?

58
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,124
You reek of alcohol.

59
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,210
The alley is way too narrow.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,379
Just put up with us
until our boss gets here.

61
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,422
You know how he is.

62
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:19,508
Fine.

63
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,759
Hey, are you done taking pictures?

64
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,016
- You're here, sir.
- Make way!

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,810
Please move aside!

66
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,328
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION
CHIEF OF NARCOTICS TEAM

67
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:49,413
JANG JOONG-HYUK

68
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:50,872
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
CHIEF OF VCU

69
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,416
Hey.

70
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,384
We found an ID in his wallet.

71
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,511
Hey, what was his name again?

72
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,263
I know him.

73
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,347
You do?

74
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:09,975
Anything notable?

75
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,686
He had this in his mouth.

76
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,750
I was in need of cash

77
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,418
so I had kept it in the safe.

78
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:40,464
It's not fake, is it?

79
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,175
The tip must've been a prank call.

80
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,428
It's not easy

81
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,139
for someone to come up with the idea
to prank call the NIS.

82
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,307
That's true.

83
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,725
I knew something was odd.

84
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,227
- When he ordered expensive wine
- Jeez.

85
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,063
and paid millions of won in cash

86
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,898
I should've noticed something.

87
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,364
What the heck? Is this real or what?

88
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:06,490
Is it real money?

89
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,793
BREAKING: A DEAD MAN FOUND IN SEOUL
WITH 5 GUNSHOT WOUNDS

90
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,297
2 WEEKS LATER

91
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,593
Which artist is behind this?

92
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,845
I had a rough time
because it passed all tests

93
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,889
including the counterfeit detector

94
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,599
the IR detector,
and the chemical test.

95
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:36,269
On top of that,
it has intaglio printing.

96
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,354
Is it a supernote?

97
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,856
It took us two weeks
to examine a single note

98
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,149
so yes, it's 100% a supernote.

99
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,317
SUPERNOTE
A HIGH-PRECISION COUNTERFEIT BILL

100
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,278
I can't stand here like this.

101
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,863
- Thanks for the good work.
- Wait.

102
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,034
Don't you remember
this fake 100-dollar bill?

103
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,334
Is this from five years ago,
the casino counterfeit case?

104
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,419
Yes.

105
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,296
The guy who got shot dead
in Jong-ro two weeks ago

106
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,382
had this in his mouth.

107
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:07,551
It only lacked intaglio printing

108
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,553
but had all the other
anti-counterfeiting features.

109
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:13,640
How would he suspect it was fake
just by looking at it

110
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,100
if he wasn't an expert?

111
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,768
Who made the request?

112
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,979
The chief of the VCU
at the Seoul Police Agency.

113
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,689
What was his name?

114
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,734
Jang Joong-hyuk, I think.

115
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:30,615
This doesn't feel good.

116
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,451
Do you know him?

117
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,152
I welcome all of you
who came out to watch the battle.

118
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,779
It's showdown!

119
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:13,033
Will they prove themselves today?

120
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,411
We have been waiting
for the fight between these two men.

121
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,624
Which one of them
will win the jackpot tonight?

122
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,002
And now, the main event
of today's competition.

123
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,922
Players, come on out!

124
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,469
You have excellent uppercuts.
You know that, right?

125
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:36,806
Hello, sir.

126
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,769
- There's a crackdown next week.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,522
Make sure you let the customers know
when the game ends.

128
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,942
Things have been too peaceful lately.

129
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,319
It's all thanks to our big boss.

130
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:50,946
That's true.

131
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,658
Nothing bad will happen
as long as our big boss is here.

132
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:58,662
Place your bet
on the player of your choice.

133
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:01,831
This is your last chance to be rich!

134
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,924
The life of a thug

135
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,968
should have lots of ups and downs.

136
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,387
It should be tumultuous,
between a rock and a hard place

137
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,847
hanging by a thread,
making narrow escapes

138
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,725
and going through whirlwind years.

139
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,361
Sir, the phrase "whirlwind years"
refers to someone's teenage years.

140
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,073
I apologize.

141
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:36,157
You know

142
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,953
punks who cut off someone
should get their tongues pulled out.

143
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,663
You son of a bitch.

144
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,206
I apologize.
I will not do that again.

145
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,374
Hey, my sis!

146
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:47,294
JANG JOONG-HYUK'S RIGHT-HAND MAN
TAK JOONG-KI

147
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,129
Joong-ki!

148
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,255
It's nice to see you!

149
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:51,756
You won a lot of money.

150
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,174
- Yes.
- Man, you won quite a lot.

151
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,676
Did you get something done?
You look great.

152
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,720
Cut it out. I'm always gorgeous.

153
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,138
- Let me pour you one.
- Okay.

154
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,347
Here. Wait, one second.

155
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,436
I have to take this call.

156
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:06,271
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

157
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,025
Yes, Boss.

158
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:17,824
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,284
Goodbye.

160
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,333
Be careful.

161
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:42,974
She's here, Boss.

162
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,316
- Joong-ki.
- Yes, Boss.

163
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,693
Bring some of these.

164
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,379
Have you won some?

165
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,089
Well...

166
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:15,548
I lost it all.

167
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,440
CHIEF OF DRUG PRODUCTION
METHAMPHETAMINE EXPERT, DR. CHOI

168
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,757
Move it.

169
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,388
Clean up spick and span
when the game ends.

170
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,265
I'll be waiting outside, Boss.

171
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,225
I'm not some kind of a thug,
you punk.

172
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:08,852
Why would I keep a guy
outside the door?

173
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,174
That's nice.

174
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:41,968
Here.

175
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,722
Jeez, babe.

176
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,799
In 1989, millions
of counterfeit 100-dollar bills

177
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:23,301
were found in a bank
in Manila, Philippines

178
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,470
causing chaos in the U.S. government.

179
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,057
At the time, the notes were deemed

180
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,559
perfectly indistinguishable
from real money

181
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:34,938
and the U.S. named them "supernotes."

182
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,022
So...

183
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:38,817
Are you saying this 50,000-won bill

184
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,985
is a supernote?

185
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,070
Yes.

186
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,281
What's your ground?

187
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:47,742
Those counterfeits

188
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,202
and that 50,000-won bill

189
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,247
were both printed
by intaglio printing machines.

190
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,583
All around the world,
the state controls the machines

191
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,545
and even the blueprints
are kept highly confidential.

192
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,130
How would anyone print these
with an intaglio machine?

193
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,841
There was a tip that, seven years ago

194
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:05,510
the blueprint disappeared
from North Korea.

195
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,429
If that ended up in the South,
it wouldn't be impossible.

196
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:09,889
Anyone comes to your mind?

197
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,392
The one who made this.

198
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,396
Do you remember
the 30 million dollars in fake bills

199
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,605
found at a casino five years ago?

200
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,274
The 100-dollar bill from that case

201
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:23,862
and the bill found at the shooting
in Jong-ro two weeks ago

202
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,072
are exactly the same.

203
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:29,826
Coincidentally

204
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,329
the day I received a tip
about this fake 50,000-won bill

205
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,914
was the same day

206
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:38,126
that the 100-dollar bill was found
in the mouth of the victim

207
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,377
of the Jong-ro shooting.

208
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,797
In conclusion, it's highly likely
that the casino counterfeits

209
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,632
and the recent supernotes

210
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,385
are made by the same suspect.

211
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:52,807
Allow me to speak as the team leader
of the Financial Crime Team...

212
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,975
The same suspect...

213
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,646
Look.

214
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,984
Here's the security footage
from the wine bar 50,000-won case.

215
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,948
The man in the photos is the leader
of the casino counterfeit case.

216
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:10,241
A man by the name of J.

217
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,828
If he got his hands
on the intaglio machine

218
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:16,164
this 100-dollar bill

219
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:18,124
must be a message from him.

220
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:24,422
The key suspect of
the biggest domestic fake note case

221
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:25,548
from five years ago

222
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,635
returned with supernotes?

223
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,136
Yes, sir.

224
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,475
You two, team up
and start investigating.

225
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:36,893
Wait, Director.

226
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,938
Financial Crime Team is in charge
of cases involving counterfeits.

227
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:41,648
And he's the expert.

228
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,400
He has failed
to catch the culprit before.

229
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,527
He has been running riot
trying to catch that punk

230
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:48,237
so he must have lots of data.

231
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,989
You can't give this important case

232
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,658
to a mere agent
who keeps an eye on loan sharks.

233
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,159
In sports teams

234
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,329
there are managers
and general managers above them.

235
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,248
Let's implement that.
Ki-tae will take charge of the case

236
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,792
and he'll report to you, Yong-san.

237
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,460
Let's keep that system, okay?

238
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,923
We're in a critical situation.

239
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:08,007
Yes, sir.

240
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,770
You've become quite good

241
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:23,982
at making yourself look grand
after years with loan sharks.

242
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,775
You did a great job

243
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,987
at mesmerizing the director,
rubbing him the right way.

244
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,281
Did it seem so?

245
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,038
You probably want to use this case

246
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:41,457
that you came across by chance
to return to your job

247
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,711
but let's see
if it goes to your plans.

248
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,463
It's not like I want to become
the head of the NIS.

249
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,091
Why would I want your job
as a mere team leader?

250
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,845
Don't worry.

251
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,681
I'm not such a petty man
who obsesses over

252
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,308
such a minor role.

253
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,560
Bye, now.

254
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,097
Hey.

255
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:39,599
Where?

256
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,144
Okay, I'll be there.

257
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:49,233
That was our D-day, actually.

258
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:51,027
We're also at a loss

259
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:52,779
because he suddenly died.

260
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,280
The D-day?

261
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,949
Was that the day of the roundup?

262
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:58,284
Yes.

263
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,373
Darn it.

264
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:47,375
That stuff works so well,
so it's the only thing people want.

265
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,793
Can we buy it?

266
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,421
The manufacturer isn't interested
in selling domestically.

267
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,881
And?

268
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,883
They won't sell anything here?

269
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,053
They'll only take orders
above 50 billion won.

270
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,681
BOSS OF A DRUG RING
CHOI DO-SIK

271
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,599
What? Fifty billion won?

272
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,853
I don't care how good it is.

273
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,521
He must be out of his mind.

274
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,314
Don't call him crazy.

275
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:14,527
He's the man who helped me
reach the top in this industry

276
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,611
by acting as a stepping stone.

277
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,489
You know, the prestigious university.
That place far away.

278
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,950
He brought
many chemical engineers from there

279
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:24,537
and had to conduct many researches
to complete that fantastic drug.

280
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,746
That was the sample.

281
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,416
If you know him that well

282
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,293
why don't you pull some strings?

283
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,460
Do you think I haven't tried?

284
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:36,966
Boss.

285
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,467
Have you heard

286
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,469
of a man named J?

287
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,056
J, the man with flying rumors

288
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,018
yet the man no one has ever seen?

289
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:49,645
J?

290
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:51,272
Yes.

291
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,149
Yes, what about him?

292
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,943
Is he willing to finance the game?

293
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,029
He's willing to invest

294
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,781
50 billion won in that amazing drug.

295
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:04,702
And?

296
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:07,705
J contacted them through Fixer

297
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:11,125
and said he'd send 25 billion won
of 50 billion as the upfront payment.

298
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,836
He tried to launder
the fake notes by using drugs?

299
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,478
THE TROUBLESHOOTER
FIXER

300
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,021
There are too many of you. How scary.

301
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,315
Please.

302
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:49,872
Ta-da!

303
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,923
The man in the truck seems to be J.

304
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,634
Tell him we'll sign the paper
and continue with the business.

305
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:07,556
Man, why is this guy talking to me
so casually like he's a friend?

306
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,310
My boss is a very cautious man

307
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,729
so tell your boss
that he does not work in haste.

308
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:16,148
He'll let you know
where we'll sign the papers.

309
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,484
Hey, wait.

310
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,610
Give me a moment.

311
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,406
I'm a cautious type.

312
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:29,412
There was a rumor that J was behind
a counterfeit money case.

313
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,124
Don't you think we'll have to have
all these bills inspected

314
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:36,210
to see whether they're real or not
before we sign the paper?

315
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,755
Damn it. This is too much work.

316
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:47,096
On the day J and Choi Do-sik
were signing the contract

317
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,931
the place of their rendezvous
changed in real-time

318
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,850
and we missed the guy near Jong-ro.

319
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,352
Bang... bang.

320
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:54,478
Bang.

321
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:56,981
Who would've known that would happen?

322
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,275
Where did you say
was the place J and his men went to

323
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,027
in the truck with 25 billion
to meet Choi Do-sik?

324
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:03,779
A dock near the warehouse facility

325
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,905
in Incheon Port.

326
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,333
I know where J's hideout is.

327
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,502
He must be using the same place
where he made dollars five years ago.

328
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:19,962
Bring your men

329
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:21,422
to Incheon Port container terminal.

330
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,258
We'll meet there
and raid him at the hideout.

331
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,010
Are you trying to order me around?

332
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,890
I am only making my report.

333
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:32,308
Okay? Can you hear me?

334
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:35,895
Bring the boys,
and come over promptly and carefully.

335
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:38,147
I'm asking of you.

336
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,857
Mr. Han Yong-san!

337
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,906
I'm on my way to get you!

338
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:08,803
Hey, guys.

339
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,721
We're going to Incheon.

340
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:24,860
Listen up, everyone.

341
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,154
Stay on top of everything.

342
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:29,615
He's unbelievably elusive.

343
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:30,699
- Okay.
- Okay.

344
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:32,326
Let's find out

345
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,037
how good that punk J is.

346
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,206
Oh, man.

347
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,792
Don't you think this is too grand
for your return after five years?

348
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,794
Don't you agree?

349
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,300
That startled me!

350
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:14,220
Darn it.

351
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:18,766
He left just recently.

352
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:21,644
Go.

353
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:52,091
I mean

354
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:55,219
you concluded that the supernotes
were made in that warehouse

355
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,720
just because
of signs of human activity.

356
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,224
It's not just overly daring,
but downright reckless.

357
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:02,685
Don't you think?

358
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:37,279
Yun-gyu?

359
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,450
- Who are you?
- It is you, Park Yun-gyu.

360
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,369
It's me, Jung Sang-gi.

361
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:44,953
Jung? No, I don't know...

362
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:46,580
Hey, man. Have you been well?

363
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,915
I don't know you.

364
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,100
Let's go.

365
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,462
Han Soo-hyun. I heard you returned
from the brink of death.

366
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:37,423
Right?

367
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:44,221
But you don't look it.

368
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:46,223
You look quite fresh.

369
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,059
Anyway.

370
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,688
It's been five years,
since I got demoted because of you

371
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:55,607
but how do you still look young?

372
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:56,775
Enough.

373
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:58,902
Let's not beat around the bush
and just cut to the chase.

374
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,237
Listen to yourself.

375
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:05,534
It's when you talk so damn rudely,
that containers fall from the sky.

376
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,959
What have you been doing all along?

377
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,754
That's not the right question.

378
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:19,673
You should ask whom I've met with.

379
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,011
You met that bastard.

380
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,431
Yes.

381
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:29,475
J.

382
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,437
He came back.

383
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:35,314
I knew it.

384
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,526
I got a tip two weeks ago
about supernotes circulating.

385
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:42,529
On the same day

386
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,241
the 100-dollar bill you made
5 years ago were found.

387
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:48,952
And today

388
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,330
you came to see me yourself.

389
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,332
Is it a coincidence?

390
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:57,336
The people involved in the
counterfeit case five years ago

391
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,546
began to reappear one after another.

392
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:04,218
Me, you, J

393
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:06,178
and even Jang Joong-hyuk.

394
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:07,805
And Choi Do-sik, who's dead.

395
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,556
Yes, Choi Do-sik.

396
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:13,602
It must be the one

397
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:15,521
who left the 100-dollar bill

398
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,314
in Choi Do-sik's mouth.

399
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,071
His identity was never disclosed.

400
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:26,240
And the story about 100-dollar bill.

401
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:30,828
How did you know?

402
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:36,250
I know too much.

403
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,210
That's why he wants me dead.

404
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,132
- What's going on?
- Is someone in there?

405
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,343
- What?
- There's someone!

406
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,387
Someone's there!

407
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,764
- Call the authorities!
- Call 911!

408
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:52,266
Hey.

409
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:53,642
Are you all right?

410
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,352
After nearly dying

411
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:56,854
I wanted to live.

412
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:00,023
That's why I came to see you.

413
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:03,527
This seemed to be my only safe zone.

414
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,364
Five years ago,
you forged 100-dollar bills perfectly

415
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:10,409
and now you've mastered
counterfeiting 50,000-won bills.

416
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,453
It was you and J again, wasn't it?

417
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,041
Yes.

418
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,168
It was my creation.

419
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,632
I had a feeling it might be true.

420
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,637
I know you harbored spite
and vowed revenge on Yang Dosa

421
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,264
while you were locked up.

422
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:37,769
Han Soo-hyun.

423
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:42,399
How did you begin
making those supernotes

424
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,526
and how far have you come?

425
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:46,653
What if I tell you?

426
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,617
Will you protect me if I tell you?

427
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,994
Will you protect my life?

428
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:56,371
Of course.

429
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,665
We are obligated
as a state institution.

430
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,334
But what if

431
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,712
things turn out
like it did five years ago?

432
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,802
Well, never mind.

433
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,638
Even if what happened
five years ago repeats itself

434
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,766
the only person I can trust
at this point in time

435
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,768
is you, Mr. Cha.

436
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:22,814
I'll tell you everything.

437
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,407
Now, shall I begin

438
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,660
the supernote game?

439
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:48,752
