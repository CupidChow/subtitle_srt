00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,697
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:43,375
Okay, let's hear it.

3
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,086
How did you begin
making those supernotes?

4
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:55,429
EPISODE 3:
BAIT; THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CASE

5
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:58,974
4 MONTHS AGO

6
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,022
Look at this.

7
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,611
Here you go.

8
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:31,673
My goodness.

9
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,759
Time catches up with everyone.

10
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,512
Most of the black-market
money changers in Namdaemun

11
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,138
are gone now.

12
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:41,350
They're saying cash is
going to disappear soon.

13
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:45,521
Now, there are only two artists left
who can make counterfeits

14
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,397
and export them overseas.

15
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,901
There's another psycho doing this
besides me? Who?

16
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:53,028
Who else?

17
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:58,242
You really don't know?

18
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:01,578
Do you mean Yeon?

19
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,247
Yes.

20
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:06,500
Since when did she start
exchanging money here?

21
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,336
It's been about six months.

22
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,715
That punk. I'm going to kill her.

23
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,053
Auntie, I'm here.

24
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,602
Demand is down lately,
so the price dropped.

25
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:28,272
Let's do a 10% commission. Please?

26
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,984
Your mascara smudged.

27
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,027
What are you talking about?
This is waterproof.

28
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,530
Your mascara smudged.

29
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:38,907
No, it didn't...

30
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,715
There's no way
you printed these yourself.

31
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,383
Where did you get them?

32
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,263
Five years ago

33
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,515
I found them while sorting
through Dad's things.

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,520
Why are you pushing them
onto the mainland?

35
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,315
- To get revenge.
- What?

36
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:15,527
I've been planning
to avenge my dad for five years.

37
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,070
And I'm putting it into action now.

38
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,072
How are you planning to get revenge?

39
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,157
Eight years ago

40
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,576
J approached you
because of the counterfeit bills

41
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,203
you spread in China.

42
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,371
I'm going to take advantage of it.

43
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,626
You think a guy who won't even bite
on Hong Kong dollars

44
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,003
will bite on Chinese yuan?

45
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:34,922
Hong Kong dollars?

46
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,382
Actually

47
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:40,385
I've been circulating
Hong Kong dollars in Macao

48
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,720
for the last year
for the same reason.

49
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,306
But he's not taking the bait.

50
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,356
I have an idea.

51
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:53,857
What idea?

52
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,027
Yeon.

53
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,197
I genuinely didn't want
to drag you into this world.

54
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:03,283
But I need your skills
for the revised plan.

55
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,036
- My skills?
- You know

56
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:08,330
you were glued to the computer
back in middle school

57
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,957
and I used to chew you out for it.

58
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,043
Hacking?

59
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,420
That I'm confident about.

60
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,133
But why were you
so hesitant to ask me?

61
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,593
Of course, we do it together.

62
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,016
What's the plan?

63
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,184
I've got a partner.

64
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,440
Hey, I'm Fixer.

65
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,733
Tracking, surveillance, tailing

66
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:39,194
digging into backgrounds,
gambling intel, mining, and trading.

67
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,405
I don't care about the industry
or the deposit order

68
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,489
nor do I have work ethics.

69
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,616
I simply work off the amount.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,827
Which means if a client pays more

71
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,413
I'm ready to stab the client,
who pays less

72
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,915
from behind at all times.

73
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,792
So you're a scumbag.

74
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,133
You're a total psychopath.

75
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:05,095
His nickname is "King of Bullshit,"
so he's not exactly trustworthy

76
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:06,805
but I picked him because

77
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,559
he's been doing business
with J for ten years.

78
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:13,729
He knows J better than anyone.

79
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,148
I admire your wise choice, client.

80
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:18,608
Anyway, J has been

81
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:22,529
off his main job of crime design
for over two years

82
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:24,531
laundering and managing secret funds

83
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:27,534
for rich people around the world
through Bitcoin.

84
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:30,329
I casually asked him

85
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,997
and he said he hasn't quit
his main lane.

86
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:34,416
He's also tracking trends
in digital currency markets...

87
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:37,336
I don't care why J is doing it.

88
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,380
What I care about is
that Jang Joong-hyuk

89
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,300
is on his multinational client list.

90
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,384
What?

91
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,971
Not all that rich-people money
that he's handling?

92
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:52,100
Why would you choose a notorious,
foul-tempered psycho cop?

93
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,894
What happened to Mr. Yang

94
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,355
and the stolen 30 million dollars.

95
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,315
J and Joong-hyuk were
behind all of it.

96
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,444
You plan to set
the two villains on each other.

97
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:03,653
Is that it?

98
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,364
That would be fun to watch.

99
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:07,657
Show him, Yeon.

100
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,453
Is it time to show you what I can do?

101
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,838
I hacked the server
storing his private keys.

102
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:26,218
How about I open
Joong-hyuk's crypto wallet now?

103
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,569
What's wrong? It's not working?

104
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,656
See? No matter how good she is

105
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,200
hacking Bitcoin is way beyond her.

106
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,749
I did it.

107
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,875
For real?

108
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,254
That's my girl.

109
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:07,843
After my hero Yu Gwan-sun,
I respect you the most.

110
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,473
You cleaned out
all of Joong-hyuk's crypto, right?

111
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,518
How much are we talking?

112
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,602
Thirty billion won.

113
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,357
I erased all of it, though.

114
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,612
Why?

115
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,449
This is about Mr. Yang's revenge.

116
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:33,076
We won't allow
even a fingernail's worth of greed.

117
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:37,122
If you didn't want it,
you could have given it to me!

118
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,587
INCOMING CALL

119
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:45,964
Is this J?

120
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,299
How did you know?

121
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,009
You sound
like you were waiting for me.

122
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:54,181
I always miss you, think about you,
and want to hear your voice.

123
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,224
Of course,
I was waiting for your call.

124
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,767
I need you in Macao.

125
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:01,480
If you call, I come.

126
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,441
Just book my flight,
and I'll fly out immediately.

127
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,488
Our meeting time was 30 minutes ago.

128
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,947
Why aren't you here yet?

129
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,949
J is finally starting to move.

130
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,452
I'm turning the car around
and heading to the airport now.

131
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:16,912
I'll call you after I see him.

132
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,375
Why? Is it about J?

133
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,420
He took our bait.

134
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,221
MACAO

135
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:36,890
Okay.

136
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,392
I'll go for it. We go big or go home.

137
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,186
Player. Let's go.

138
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,104
Come on.

139
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,359
Wait.

140
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:52,614
Let's see.

141
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,408
Three. What do I need?

142
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,746
Let's go.

143
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,873
Here it comes.

144
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,209
The flight to Incheon is taking off!

145
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,045
Five! That's not bad.

146
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,838
It's not bad.

147
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,215
Great.

148
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,591
Come to Papa.

149
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:14,219
Come...

150
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,596
I'm doomed.

151
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,392
Damn it.

152
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:23,186
Shit.

153
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,314
Looks like I'm walking
all the way to Incheon Airport.

154
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,608
Come...

155
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,652
Idiot.

156
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,696
Who the hell is it?

157
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,780
It's me, you punk.

158
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,575
Hey, Boss.

159
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,544
But

160
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,629
you live a flashy life.

161
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,091
Why do you carry cash like this?
It's kind of pathetic.

162
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,384
You don't want it? Give it back.

163
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,927
Man, you're cold.

164
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,429
You're like a New Yorker.

165
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:58,805
Seriously.

166
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,604
That's counterfeit.

167
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,022
What?

168
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,108
No way.
I've got a great nose for money.

169
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:15,655
This has to be real.

170
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:20,619
Chinese sailors dumped them in Macao.

171
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,541
Are you saying
this was made in Korea?

172
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,629
Only one person in Korea
can produce such quality bills.

173
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,423
Who?

174
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,344
My secret server, where I manage
my clients' hidden funds

175
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:38,803
was recently hacked.

176
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,766
Out of all that easy money
from those rich guys

177
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,142
they ignored everything

178
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:47,020
and pinpointed
just one person's money.

179
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,153
Your business philosophy is

180
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:58,323
that you stab the guy
who pays less from behind

181
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,450
if a new client pays more, right?

182
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:05,747
Why are we suddenly talking
about my philosophy?

183
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,207
Tell me the truth

184
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,793
and I'll pay you ten times more

185
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:11,878
than your current client.

186
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:14,422
Ten times?

187
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,678
- What's the retainer?
- One billion won.

188
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:20,762
One billion?

189
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:24,808
Client.

190
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,977
If you have dinner plans tonight

191
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,396
you might want to cancel.

192
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,441
I've got a lot to brief you on.

193
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:39,656
Soo-hyun, your bait worked so well
that he wanted to come to Korea

194
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,908
only one day after we met.

195
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,744
Everything moved so fast

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,497
that I couldn't even call
and just flew in.

197
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,084
Yes, Boss. I'll be right there.

198
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,378
I should hang up.

199
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,838
I'll call you back.

200
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,886
May only good things
happen to you, Boss.

201
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,321
- Fuck you!
- Die!

202
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,281
See the guy in white?

203
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,325
He runs a fried chicken place.

204
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,535
And the one in khaki.

205
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:08,828
He's the delivery guy.

206
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:12,540
They worked together for three years

207
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,834
and now they're doing that crap here.

208
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,171
And see that old lady over there?

209
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:19,339
The one who passed out.

210
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,840
That's the owner's wife.

211
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,258
She's a total junkie.

212
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,015
How much are you paying them

213
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,518
that they're fighting
as if their lives depend on it?

214
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,020
This is an exhibition match.

215
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,563
I'm not exactly paying them.

216
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,107
The winner's interest gets waived.

217
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:40,860
Depending on how hard they fight,
I shave down the principal too.

218
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,071
The owner

219
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,739
owes me 230 million won.

220
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:48,618
The delivery guy owes me
120 million won.

221
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,206
And they haven't paid interest
for months. Morons.

222
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:57,877
Watch those regular people
backed into a corner

223
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:01,923
for messing with my money.
It's a survival bloodbath.

224
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,344
It's nice, isn't it?

225
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,888
It's provocative.
Perfect for the reality show era.

226
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:12,600
Just booze and food aren't enough
to compete anymore

227
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,521
so you put debtor fights on stage

228
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,940
to pull in more customers?

229
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,361
You're using people
at the edge of a cliff.

230
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:25,196
You're something else.

231
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,630
Well done.

232
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:52,015
What to do now?

233
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,810
My goodness.

234
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,022
What should I do?

235
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,609
- About what?
- Can you fight?

236
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,738
You want to fight them,
spill some blood

237
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,364
and pay me back?

238
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,368
How about it?

239
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:29,719
So you summoned me
from Macao to ask me that?

240
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,561
Darn you.

241
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:43,066
You switched industries

242
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:45,985
about two years ago, right?

243
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:49,280
That's impressive.

244
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,032
In only two years

245
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,118
you became the best in the industry.

246
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,497
Seriously. That's huge.

247
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,666
Did you ever

248
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,085
mess up over there?

249
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,088
No, right?

250
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,007
Did you ever make those people

251
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,468
lose money?

252
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,764
No.

253
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,477
Why did it have to be me?

254
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,354
Why?

255
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:26,943
Why am I the one taking the loss,
you piece of shit!

256
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,195
That's my question for you.

257
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:33,950
A mistake?

258
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:35,785
Sure, mistakes happen.

259
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,203
A couple of times... No.

260
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:41,082
You can screw up dozens of times,
and I won't care.

261
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,001
But the one thing

262
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:47,755
I don't tolerate is losing my money!

263
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,173
It was 30 billion won!

264
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,562
Come here.

265
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,439
Come.

266
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,738
I'll wipe your principal clean.

267
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:13,614
How about another game?

268
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:14,741
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,755
Mr. Choi, step into the ring.

270
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:33,217
Look at that.

271
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,974
What are you trying to do now?

272
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,810
What's it like being lumped together
with those people?

273
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,022
Embarrassing, isn't it?

274
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,275
Before you get humiliated even more

275
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,402
make up for the money

276
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,655
that you lost. Understood?

277
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:04,707
Come on.

278
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,838
All this trashy circus
over a measly 30 billion won?

279
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,716
Chief Jang Joong-hyuk.

280
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,012
Are you broke,
or have you got no pride?

281
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,972
This is so pathetic.

282
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:24,143
Let's

283
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,063
try to keep it classy.

284
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:28,356
Hey!

285
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:29,899
What did you just say?

286
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,028
"Classy"? This motherfucker.
Are you out of your mind?

287
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,988
Who do you think you are?

288
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,240
What a jerk.

289
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:38,449
Hey.

290
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,910
Crazy bastard.

291
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,205
I ought to just...

292
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,999
Maybe you can say

293
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,544
that it's a measly 30 billion won

294
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:52,755
because all your clients are
billionaires from all over the world

295
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,549
but my 30 billion?

296
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:58,427
I earned that by doing
disgusting shit, risking my life.

297
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,013
That's everything I have,
you bastard.

298
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,181
You get that?

299
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,773
The world is vast

300
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,110
and there's plenty of money to skim.

301
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:17,280
If you use your brain, that is.

302
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,783
Take a look at it and decide

303
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,744
whether to kill me or play me.

304
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,462
We split the profit 6-4.

305
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,299
You get six, and I take four.

306
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:40,136
I'm adding interest
to the 30 billion I lost.

307
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,226
I was so bored
that I was about to get depressed

308
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,603
but just a quick look tells me

309
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,146
this is going to be a thrill.

310
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:51,731
Do you seriously think
you can pull it off?

311
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:59,447
I'm sure you've heard the rumors
that I've never failed once

312
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,825
as an architect.

313
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,121
A business proposal like this is
infused with imagination.

314
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,629
Bring me a video pitch for this plan.

315
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,756
I'll decide after I see it.

316
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,801
You're incredibly picky.

317
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,846
Fine. Better safe than sorry.

318
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:31,479
So J got Joong-hyuk involved again,
just like five years ago.

319
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:34,440
He would have gone looking for you,
the technician.

320
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,820
What did he say to get you
to make supernotes?

321
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,531
What was the distribution plan?

322
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:47,870
What?

323
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,999
Why did you suddenly get quiet again?

324
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,508
I barely survived.

325
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:04,220
I'm exhausted,
so give me a few hours of sleep.

326
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,605
The world isn't going to end
if we wait a few hours.

327
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:15,815
Let's get some rest first.

328
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:22,154
You heard her, right?

329
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,367
You all heard Soo-hyun, right?

330
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,370
- Jeez.
- Find the exact location

331
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:30,830
of that illegal fight arena.

332
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,082
I want to see it with my own eyes.

333
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,139
Again, you're acting
without consulting me.

334
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,016
Report to me first!

335
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,727
Then you get to order the team.

336
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,853
Understood?

337
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,980
Can we keep things simple?

338
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:58,566
Don't tell me

339
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,776
you actually believe her.

340
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,778
That's why I'm going to confirm it.

341
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,573
To the illegal fight arena
that she mentioned.

342
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,909
Try using your brain once in a while.

343
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,120
I wouldn't be going
if I believed her.

344
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,591
They open twice a week

345
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,384
and there's a fight tonight.

346
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,678
- It's been open for over five years.
- What?

347
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,264
It says hundreds of millions of won
move in bets in a single day.

348
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,060
You're telling me
the local precinct never once busted

349
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:35,436
such a massive illegal gambling ring?

350
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,021
Hey.

351
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,482
We're 30 minutes out.

352
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,359
Get Incheon Major Crimes moving.

353
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,028
- Step on it.
- Yes.

354
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,782
Give me some more.

355
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,992
Yes, give him.

356
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,669
These scumbags. Get them out.

357
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:43,504
Hey, wake up.

358
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,005
- Hey.
- Snap out of it.

359
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,507
- Move, you bastard.
- Hey.

360
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,467
- Kid.
- Jeez.

361
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:53,639
Seriously.

362
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:54,932
- All right!
- Cash me out.

363
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,114
Go home, you bastard.

364
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,950
You scumbag.

365
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,285
Get lost.

366
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:30,569
This fucker.

367
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:31,654
YEOM CHEOL-JU

368
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,822
What?

369
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,491
You already blew
through all the money?

370
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:36,825
The NIS has made its move.

371
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,953
Incheon's Major Crimes Unit is
on its way to raid us.

372
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,622
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT, YEOM CHEOL-JU

373
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:42,706
The NIS?

374
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,960
All right.

375
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:49,004
The NIS?
What kind of bad luck is this?

376
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:50,756
BIG BOSS

377
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:16,991
- Come here.
- Idiot.

378
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,075
Dumbass.

379
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,743
Get over here.

380
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,085
Bitch.

381
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:31,422
Hey!

382
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,216
Darn it.

383
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,969
I haven't even won back
what I lost yet.

384
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:41,682
Detective Yeom.

385
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,770
What took you so long?
I've been waiting forever!

386
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,439
You came alone?

387
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:51,859
I got the call while I was on duty.

388
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,737
We also got an urgent call
while we were asleep.

389
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,821
We're barely awake right now.

390
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:57,656
Hurry up!

391
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,910
Open your eyes. Wake up.

392
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,579
Let's move.

393
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,291
Police!

394
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:08,542
What?

395
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,295
- Get in. Hurry.
- What's going on?

396
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,011
It's the police!

397
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,639
Freeze!

398
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:30,564
Attention.

399
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,150
Shit. Do not move!

400
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:36,403
We're the police, okay?

401
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,365
- Quiet!
- Who do you think you are?

402
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,201
Put your hands on your head
and sit down.

403
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,661
Sit, you fuck!

404
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,205
We've got nothing to lose!

405
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:47,915
Let's smash everything and get out!

406
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,251
Hold on.

407
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,465
Push!

408
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:05,557
Please pick up.

409
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:09,645
Why aren't you answering...

410
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,398
What the fuck?

411
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:27,037
Oh, shit.

412
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,754
Boss!

413
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:55,983
This bitch is mine.

414
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,904
If you take her, I'll slit her throat

415
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:03,198
and kill you too.

416
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:05,200
You punk!

417
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,539
I'm from Busan.

418
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,040
Are you from Busan too?

419
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:14,042
Where have I seen you?

420
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,544
What neighborhood are you from?

421
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:18,130
Saha-gu? Suyeong-gu?

422
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:20,132
- Yeongdo?
- Quit your bullshit.

423
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,009
I told you not to come close.

424
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,136
You bastard.

425
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:25,721
If you're going to get high

426
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:27,389
spend some money
and take the expensive stuff.

427
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,683
Shut your mouth, you fucking bitch.

428
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:33,020
No one can take her from me.

429
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,481
She's mine.

430
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:45,407
Fine. Fuck it. She's all yours.

431
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,784
I don't want her either.

432
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:48,911
Go on. Take her.

433
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:51,580
Take her, you fuck!

434
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,791
Are you okay? You're bleeding.

435
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:55,250
Darn it.

436
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,586
Man, that burns.

437
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:03,383
Let go.

438
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,011
Put the knife away.

439
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,098
This motherfucker.

440
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:12,351
You know what my family motto is?

441
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,436
It's "watch your back."

442
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,604
"Always watch your back."

443
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,773
I know I never listened to my father

444
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,983
but do you really think

445
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,735
I'd ever turn my back

446
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,612
on trash like you?

447
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:25,989
That really stings.

448
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,410
Man, this bastard.

449
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,372
Have you lost your mind?

450
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,840
Move.

451
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,636
What are you doing?

452
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,222
How should I...

453
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:51,390
Boss.

454
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:53,141
You're not going to shoot, are you?

455
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:02,985
What's this?

456
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:05,737
All right. Move out!

457
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:20,794
Shit.

458
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:24,798
What happened?

459
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,555
Fuck.

460
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,940
Where should I shoot
so it really hurts?

461
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,359
Boss.

462
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:47,070
- This is going to get messy.
- Let go!

463
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,572
You.

464
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:50,574
Unless you want a hole in your head

465
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,868
shut your mouth and stay still.

466
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,921
You pick. Left ankle

467
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:06,715
or right ankle.

468
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:09,509
Which one do you need less?

469
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,138
- Please spare me.
- I'll count to three.

470
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:15,474
- Three.
- Stop.

471
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,225
Stop, you son of a bitch!

472
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,853
- Two.
- Please forgive me.

473
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:22,814
I'll do whatever you tell me.

474
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,525
- One.
- Left.

475
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:26,610
Left foot!

476
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:31,156
Consider yourself lucky.

477
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:35,535
Aren't you grateful?

478
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:38,789
Thank you, sir.

479
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,625
- Thank you so much.
- You express gratitude

480
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,212
through actions, not words,
you bastard.

481
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:52,094
What is this, your living room?

482
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:54,554
This idiot.

483
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:59,685
This is going to be a problem.

484
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,985
Look at yourselves.

485
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,695
Anybody hurt?

486
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,655
We were called out all of a sudden

487
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,365
so our men weren't
in perfect condition.

488
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,742
How impressive.

489
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,036
Oh, jeez.

490
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,622
Find out exactly who owns this place.

491
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,958
- Yes, sir.
- Pull every surveillance feed.

492
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,836
Track down the gamblers who ran,
the fighters who fought

493
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,130
and every staffer involved.
Investigate every single person.

494
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:30,465
That's under
the local precinct's jurisdiction.

495
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,259
You'll need to talk to him.

496
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:33,552
Detective Yeom.

497
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:40,267
How did you know to come here?

498
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:46,023
I'm asking how you knew.

499
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,608
We got a call at our precinct.

500
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:50,777
From who? From us?

501
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,529
But we never called.

502
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,204
Are you suspecting me or something?

503
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,539
I came because I got a call.

504
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:03,999
I'm only telling the truth.

505
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:05,876
What's with that look?

506
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,919
Why are you treating me
like I'm a criminal?

507
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:11,131
Someone else at the NIS
must have called to tip us off.

508
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:13,383
That never happened.

509
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:16,803
Come on.

510
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,474
You don't have to get that mad,
you know.

511
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,769
It's not that important.
Let's just move on.

512
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,688
This won't work.
We'll check the footage ourselves.

513
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:27,773
Yes, sir.

514
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,442
We'll send our agents
to Jung-gu Police Station tomorrow

515
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:31,943
so secure all the footage.

516
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:33,945
But you're all busy.

517
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,031
We'll review it at our station.

518
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:37,991
No, we'll do it ourselves.

519
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,743
All right.

520
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,163
It's time to go home

521
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,832
Go home, wash your feet,
and go to bed.

522
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,042
Let's wrap up.

523
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:48,960
Everybody, head home.

524
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,219
Why are you still standing here?

525
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:00,347
Oh, right.

526
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,768
I'm screwed.

527
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:11,900
Jang Joong-hyuk has been in
Jung-gu Police Station the longest.

528
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:14,027
Judging from
how that detective was trembling

529
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,695
this place is definitely
Joong-hyuk's operation.

530
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,198
And Soo-hyun's statement
about J teaming up with him

531
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,699
sounds more credible now.

532
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:22,244
Search again
and see if anything else turns up.

533
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,412
Would you look at that.

534
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,584
Jeez.

535
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,171
What are you doing that for?

536
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:35,257
I didn't do it.

537
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,217
What matters isn't who caused

538
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,678
this fucked-up situation.

539
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:42,013
What matters is

540
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:44,975
how I get out of it.

541
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,059
Fine.

542
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:47,769
You didn't do it.

543
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:51,690
That girl?
Let's say your friend killed her.

544
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,442
You two came in here
to steal booze, okay?

545
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:58,572
And I wasn't here
with that girl from the start.

546
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,867
You have to testify to that. Got it?

547
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:05,453
Fucking bastard.

548
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:15,255
Shut it. You're too loud.

549
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:18,216
I can't focus
with you being this loud.

550
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,801
Stay still.

551
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,011
Damn it.

552
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,470
Now...

553
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:29,394
Joong-ki, bring the drugs.
Bring whatever's left.

554
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,191
Bring it.

555
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:37,777
- Look at me.
- Yes.

556
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:42,824
Here, take it.

557
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,452
Here.

558
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:48,872
Drink some water.

559
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:55,587
Hey.

560
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:57,464
Did it hurt a lot?

561
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:58,882
This will make you feel better.

562
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,176
Open your mouth.

563
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,802
Open it. It's okay.

564
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,054
Open.

565
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:05,889
Take it.

566
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,685
Swallow.

567
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:22,572
How is it?

568
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,243
Better?

569
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:28,662
It hurts less, right?

570
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:47,615
Aren't you thankful
you're the only one still alive?

571
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:52,704
Don't thank God for that.

572
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,414
Thank me.

573
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,709
And keep that gratitude

574
00:38:58,626 --> 00:38:59,711
in your heart

575
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:03,340
while you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

576
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,550
If you even think
about crawling back out

577
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,594
you'll end up dead like him.

578
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:08,928
Okay?

579
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:10,513
Good.

580
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:38,708
Boss, here's your phone.

581
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:44,381
Clean this place up

582
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,300
then call the cops.

583
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,052
Oh, right.

584
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,347
The NIS raided our gambling joint.
Those sons of bitches.

585
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,015
When?

586
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,725
Just now. Those bastards.

587
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:56,935
Why are you telling me now?

588
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,313
You useless piece of shit.

589
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,398
Damn it.

590
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:17,747
Freeze!

591
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:43,208
