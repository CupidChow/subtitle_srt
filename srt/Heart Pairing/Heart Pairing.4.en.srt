1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,440
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,600
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,740
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,570
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,310
Heart Pairing is back.

6
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,440
(Super sympathizer, Choi Si Won)

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,380
(Access complete for Heart Pairing)

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,980
Last week, the pair matching rate...

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,520
- was amazing.
- Right.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,780
While it's not easy
for one couple to be paired,

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,750
- three couples were paired.
- Oh, my.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,790
Ji Min's strong defense succeeded.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,960
Including Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul,
and Chang Hwan and Ji Won,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,030
we got three couples.

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,330
If this continues,
for the first time on a dating show,

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,330
we might have everyone paired in the end.

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,730
We may change this show's title...

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,240
from Heart Pairing to Heart Decider.

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,870
The pairing success rate was high,

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,640
and the MCs' prediction rate also...

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,980
at 100 percent.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,440
We hit the jackpot.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,410
- We should travel together.
- To Tuscany.

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,480
- You should go to Tuscany.
- Yes, Tuscany.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,510
We should go there.

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,150
Accommodation for two nights
at the Pairing House in Italy...

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,550
depends on our guesses.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,420
After doing it for three episodes,
I got the hang of it.

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,660
I can clearly see things.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,760
We didn't count it, but only Jong Shin...

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
guessed wrong about Woo Jae.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,230
I think Woo Jae...

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,630
(When everyone guessed
Woo Jae would pick Je Yeon,)

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,700
(Jong Shin alone insisted
that Woo Jae would pick Ji Won.)

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,140
(Confident)

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,770
(For a moment, he dreamed
of monopolizing the accommodation.)

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,810
I mean, Woo Jae...

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,010
is a bit unstable.

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,650
(Is he blaming Woo Jae?)

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,480
No, he isn't.

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,720
Woo Jae has lost his mind a bit.

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,780
(What is he saying?)

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,420
However, a person like Woo Jae...

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,420
solidifies his style as time goes on.

45
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,820
Also, each couple's date...

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,690
was quite impressive.

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,260
I had supported Woo Jae all along,

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,000
but watching how Ji Min was at the date,

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
I suddenly felt pity for his heart.

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,800
How could he gaze at someone
in such a way?

51
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,870
Many young men...

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,510
- need to learn from him.
- They need to.

53
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,470
For those who wait,

54
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,580
- The chance never comes.
- no one comes.

55
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,250
Is that Yoon Jong Shin's quote of the day?

56
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,910
Yes, they should be active like that.

57
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,380
He has romantic eyes too.

58
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,020
Anyway,
expressing you're into someone earlier...

59
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,820
is definitely necessary.

60
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,890
- That flutters a woman's heart.
- Last week,

61
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,520
- their occupations were revealed.
- Yes.

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,290
- Their occupations surprised me.
- Right.

63
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,460
The moment we found out
Je Yeon is an attorney,

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,230
and Chan Hyeong became the youngest...

65
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,600
Doctor, yes.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,170
He's awesome.

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,040
An employee of a major company
and a pilot.

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,940
It's hard to meet people
with such impressive qualifications.

69
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,470
- And they have good looks too.
- That's right.

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,610
This is unbelievable.

71
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,640
It's a group of invincible characters.

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,510
"Invincible characters"
is just the right word.

73
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,350
However, currently, they...

74
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,450
can't reveal their occupations to anyone.

75
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,150
- Only we know what they do.
- Right.

76
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,120
It must be hard for them to keep quiet.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,460
"I'm an attorney."

78
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,160
(It's hard not to say it.)

79
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,230
Clearly,

80
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,790
after we found out what they do,

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,760
we see an aura.

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,500
Their jobs change our thoughts.

83
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Actually, a person's occupation...

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,200
tells a lot about that person.

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,040
- That's true.
- It's important.

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,070
After knowing their occupations,
I made a different guess.

87
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,310
My prediction changed.

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,380
- A lot.
- "Je Yeon must be meticulous."

89
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,180
- "She must be logical."
- "She should be rational."

90
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,880
Suddenly, she turns out to be an attorney,

91
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,520
and I think,
"I knew she was a careful person."

92
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,650
(Confused)

93
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,950
I feel people around me...

94
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,220
are getting more immersed
in Heart Pairing.

95
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,720
There are people who pester me...

96
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,690
- to spoil the result.
- Right.

97
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,490
- We honestly don't know anything.
- That's right.

98
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm sorry. Even if we want to tell you,
we know nothing.

99
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,400
I have a movie to be released soon,

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
so when I promote it somewhere,
people ask me.

101
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,500
But I also can't say anything.

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,140
I hope "Lobby" gets paired
with 10 million audience members.

103
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,470
(That's the only thing he can say.)

104
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,010
- Pairing.
- Pairing.

105
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,880
It's the same for the viewers and us.

106
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,610
Things have never happened
as we predicted...

107
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,980
- in the end.
- Right.

108
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,680
Big twists continue,

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,350
so please keep watching this show...

110
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,090
to the last episode.

111
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,160
Today, as usual, be fully prepared
to be overindulged in the show.

112
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,130
Last week, they had 1-on-1 dates.

113
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,760
After the dates were over in the evening,

114
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
they gathered at a Michelin restaurant.

115
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,830
- How nice.
- None of them is cooking now.

116
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,800
Let's watch the video.

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,140
This is fun, isn't it?

118
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,240
We keep saying, "isn't it?"

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,510
- It's so beautiful here.
- Really.

120
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,910
- It's amazing.
- Shall we go inside?

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,180
So cute. This one's cute too.

122
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,180
It's hard to decide.

123
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,380
They're buying gifts.

124
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,890
(They think hard about which memory
they should give with the gift.)

125
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,920
(Careful)

126
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,960
Wait a minute. He's here.

127
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,700
What shall I do?

128
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,760
(Perplexed to see Ji Min)

129
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,370
I guess they should keep it
a secret to each other.

130
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,300
(He hasn't noticed her yet.)

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
(Stealthily approaching)

132
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,410
- Wait. Why are you following me?
- Did you get the gift?

133
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,680
I wasn't following you.

134
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,750
- Come on.
- Why are you following me?

135
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,110
They're cute.

136
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,950
Is Woo Jae buying the gift alone?

137
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,090
(As they pick the gifts carefully,)

138
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,950
(the sun goes down in Florence.)

139
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,490
That's so beautiful.

140
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
Where is the restaurant?

141
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,860
Is that it?

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,860
- It's a huge door.
- It sure is.

143
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,170
Does it closed?

144
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,700
It's really big.

145
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,980
(In this fancy and romantic place,)

146
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,850
(they will have dinner.)

147
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,720
- This is so luxurious.
- That's true.

148
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,950
It's so beautiful here.

149
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,060
No one has arrived yet.

150
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,890
No one is here.

151
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,530
I couldn't see because of that tree.

152
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,730
This room is gorgeous.

153
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,300
It's so beautiful.

154
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,470
There are eight seats.

155
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,680
(There are eight chairs in the room.)

156
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,580
She's sharp.
Ha Neul noticed there were eight seats.

157
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,650
Does it mean a female catfish? Already?

158
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,690
I think a catfish will be here.

159
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,890
I think there could be an extra chair.

160
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,320
(Is it for a newcomer?)

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,620
Are you happy?

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,190
She's conscious of the catfish.

163
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,830
You're looking at me with a grin, so...

164
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,370
Seriously.

165
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,800
Here he is.

166
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,370
- I knew it.
- He's really here.

167
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,500
- I knew it.
- Is it Woo Jae?

168
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,300
I guessed right about who will enter next.

169
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
- We guessed who was coming.
- Me?

170
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,310
- Did you guess it would be me?
- Yes.

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,440
- They look good together.
- They look great together.

172
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,380
- Did you have fun?
- Did you have fun?

173
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,520
It was a fulfilling day.

174
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,950
This is so nice.

175
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,120
It's really nice.

176
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,390
On a day like this,

177
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,220
I think we should have some wine.

178
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,690
We really should.

179
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,660
We should drink.

180
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,430
They talk comfortably to each other.

181
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,670
- They're finally here.
- Hi.

182
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,070
You're late.

183
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,230
- Are we late?
- Yes.

184
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

185
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,040
I feel so hungry.

186
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,840
I'll sit here.

187
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
There are eight seats here.

188
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
We have an extra seat.

189
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,120
He's conscious of her.

190
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,690
Did you visit many places?

191
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,590
(Conscious)

192
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,930
(With dinner,)

193
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,570
May I have this one?

194
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,570
(they will have wine.)

195
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,310
What have you been talking about?

196
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,650
- Me?
- That's brutal.

197
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,920
I asked a lot of questions to myself.

198
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,150
Questions?

199
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,920
What questions did you ask?

200
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
It reminded me of the old days.

201
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,190
It was nice. It was meaningful.

202
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,760
By the way, we didn't get an extra book.

203
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,430
- She might bring it with her.
- But the funny thing is...

204
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,830
that the women got four books...

205
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,940
- that we wrote.
- Right.

206
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,970
Today, we need to look at the men's faces.

207
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,070
We should.

208
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,540
(Who will take the empty seat?)

209
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,750
(While everyone is getting more curious)

210
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,850
(Heels clacking)

211
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,920
Who is it?

212
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,930
(A person in black
heads to the restaurant.)

213
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,730
When Ha Neul was entering,
didn't she look charismatic?

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,330
- Did she?
- She looked determined...

215
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,200
as if she would turn this place
upside down.

216
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,730
She walked in with clacking sounds.

217
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,840
Right.
I remember hearing the clacking sounds.

218
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
She looked very ambitious.

219
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

220
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,550
Hello.

221
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Hello.

222
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,920
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

223
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,290
(All 8 chairs are taken.)

224
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,590
She's beautiful.

225
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,660
Oh, my.

226
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,760
She's a beauty too.

227
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,730
(Eyes shaking)

228
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,800
(Nodding)

229
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,740
- She looks very oriental.
- She totally looks different.

230
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,070
Hello.

231
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,370
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
It wasn't five men.

233
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,610
Chang Hwan is looking at her too.

234
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,220
(With a newcomer's appearance,)

235
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,750
(they keep silent for a while.)

236
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,820
Ji Min.

237
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,020
- She's beautiful.
- She's beautiful.

238
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,120
Shall we order for her?

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,860
- Have you eaten?
- No.

240
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,230
Did you place an order?

241
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,830
No, I haven't yet.

242
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,800
- Then we need to order more.
- You need to eat, right?

243
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,900
- Yes.
- So...

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,670
(Drawing attention)

245
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,310
What is your name?

246
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,040
- Chae Eun.
- Chae Eun?

247
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,510
- Yes.
- Chae Eun.

248
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,840
Chae Eun.

249
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,780
- I'm Ji Min.
- Hi.

250
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,050
Shall we introduce ourselves in turn?

251
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,050
(They begin to introduce themselves.)

252
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,750
- I'm Chang Hwan.
- Chae Eun.

253
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm Woo Jae.

254
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm Chan Hyeong.

255
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,290
I'm Ha Neul.

256
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,530
I'm Ji Won.

257
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,260
I'm Je Yeon.

258
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,030
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

259
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,870
(Interested)

260
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,610
- She has a peculiar atmosphere.
- I know.

261
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,640
- She's beautiful.
- Yes.

262
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,510
She looks like a cool city girl,

263
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,250
but I feel that she's a very warm person.

264
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,280
- She has an oriental vibe.
- Right.

265
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,480
She has the most oriental look
among the cast.

266
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,550
She's very calm,

267
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,660
and to me, she looks like June Kang...

268
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,320
- when she was young.
- Right, June Kang.

269
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,830
(Glancing)

270
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
The server is behind you
to get your order.

271
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,800
Here. Thank you.

272
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,330
This is our menu,
and you can have what you prefer.

273
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,630
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay?

274
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,570
- I'll be coming back to you soon.
- Okay.

275
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,170
Can I just get some...

276
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,710
- Can I get some time?
- Yes.

277
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,370
Excuse me.

278
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,540
Prepare some wine for her first.

279
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,840
Yes.

280
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
There he goes.

281
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,510
(Chang Hwan paid attention
to get wine for Chae Eun.)

282
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,450
This is our wine list.

283
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,120
Were you observing our looks?

284
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,150
Yes.

285
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,160
Ha Neul is watching Chan Hyeong.

286
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,390
(Feigning innocence)

287
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,360
Oh, my.

288
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,770
(The dishes they ordered...)

289
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,310
(are served 1 by 1.)

290
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,670
- That looks good too.
- Thank you.

291
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,880
Yes?

292
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,850
- Can I make an order?
- Sure.

293
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,280
- He keeps staring at her.
- Can I get one...

294
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,390
burrata and cherry tomato salad?"

295
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,650
- With the cherry tomato?
- Yes.

296
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,890
One of that, and...

297
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,490
- one of the sea bass.
- Sea bass?

298
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,660
Yes. For the wine,

299
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,460
I'll get a...

300
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,070
Just one glass.

301
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,840
What was that?

302
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,440
Her English is good too.

304
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,650
Her pronunciation shows that
she's been across the Pacific Ocean.

305
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,050
- I'm curious if you read the books.
- Yes, I read the books.

306
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,720
- Did you read 4 books?
- Yes, I read 4 books.

307
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,690
- Have you written one too?
- Yes.

308
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,430
However, unfortunately,

309
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,960
we got three books.

310
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,930
- So that made us...
- That's understandable.

311
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,200
- think someone wasn't coming.
- I see.

312
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,670
(Chan Hyeong asked
her questions in a row.)

313
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,540
You could feel awkward here sometimes.

314
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,300
- I see.
- We still do.

315
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,210
It's been like this.

316
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,140
I'll adjust myself.

317
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,340
We're all a bit shy.

318
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,850
You can take your time.

319
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,480
She looks very elegant.

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,020
Shall we make some guesses from her image?

321
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,720
- You mean, like her occupation?
- Yes.

322
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,250
I felt,
although I've seen her for only a bit,

323
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,820
- that she had a specialized job.
- Same here.

324
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,630
So, if I may make a guess,

325
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,760
- you look like an attorney.
- No, not her.

326
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,230
- I strongly feel that.
- "That should be me."

327
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
- Rather...
- He's an attorney too.

328
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,070
You really give off such a vibe.

329
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,110
- I feel so.
- I feel...

330
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,340
that she looks like a diplomat.

331
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,180
- She's in that field.
- I think you're a diplomat.

332
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,520
A diplomat.

333
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,920
I think you're a professional.

334
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,020
You speak in a very calm manner.

335
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,720
That's possible.

336
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,030
I think you're a professional.

337
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,430
An interpreter?

338
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,900
- An interpreter.
- An interpreter.

339
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,830
- That matches her.
- Doesn't it?

340
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,130
- That matches her too.
- Yes.

341
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,570
An interpreter?

342
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,540
She reminded me of the UN
the moment I saw her.

343
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,040
- The UN.
- The UN?

344
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,240
I guess she's from New York,
where she works at the UN.

345
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,610
- That UN.
- That UN.

346
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,150
(What's Chae Eun's occupation?)

347
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,780
I think Chae Eun is an instructor
at an English kindergarten.

348
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,950
That's possible.

349
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,720
I feel that she once lived abroad.

350
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,760
Why do I feel that
she's in the art industry?

351
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,560
You mean like a curator? Or...

352
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,360
I feel that she's an artist.

353
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,800
It's going to be revealed now.

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,970
(Walking in a concrete jungle,)

355
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,140
Is she in finance?

356
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
(she arrives...)

357
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,770
(at a securities company
located in Seoul.)

358
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,280
- Right. She's in finance.
- She's in the stock industry.

359
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,510
It's very different from my prediction.

360
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,850
(She majored in natural science
at a university in Canada.)

361
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,090
(After she came back to Korea,
she got a job at a securities firm.)

362
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,660
(With a sharp analysis...)

363
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,960
(and insight,)

364
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,460
She's consulting.

365
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,430
(she works...)

366
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,070
(to help companies
make a sustainable growth.)

367
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,110
(Chae Eun is a senior researcher
at a stock firm's economy institute.)

368
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,440
She looks so beautiful when she smiles.

369
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,080
What do you think?
Did we say something similar to your job?

370
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,850
I think you're definitely an N type.

371
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,450
- The second part of an MBTI type. N.
- I see.

372
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,420
You're right.

373
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,320
She means you totally got it wrong.

374
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,260
- You went too far.
- You went too far.

375
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
Did I go too far? I'll try again.

376
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,100
With one female catfish added,
the atmosphere gets...

377
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,240
So different.

378
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,870
She's not the kind of catfish
we're familiar with.

379
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,970
Rather, she's very elegant...

380
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,840
and calm.

381
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,280
She can be a type of woman...

382
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,380
that many men prefer to marry.

383
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,080
All of them guessed she's a professional.

384
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,220
I think they felt...

385
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,950
that she's complete.

386
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,160
(I see.)

387
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,220
(Their first meal...)

388
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,660
(with a newcomer is over.)

389
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,730
Here we are.

390
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,430
Good night.

391
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,670
Good night.

392
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,710
It's here.

393
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,770
Her Pairing Book was delivered.

394
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,610
Now they have her Pairing Book.

395
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,580
- This is hers.
- Yes.

396
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,910
"Love does not mean
gazing at each other..."

397
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,820
"but looking outward together
in the same direction."

398
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,390
They read the Pairing Book,
knowing who wrote it.

399
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,660
(In the light green Pairing Book,)

400
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,230
(what kind of story is written?)

401
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,330
(That night)

402
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,100
(The male residents...)

403
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,710
(left their gifts under the tree.)

404
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,440
They gathered the gifts
they bought earlier.

405
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
Next to the tree.

406
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,690
The gifts from the male residents.

407
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,190
The gifts will show their tastes.

408
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,290
(What kind of gifts
will the female residents get?)

409
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,690
It's the last day.

410
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,060
(It's the last morning in Italy.)

411
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,960
I think it got much more comfortable.

412
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,730
We talked to each other more.

413
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,300
- Right.
- That's good to hear.

414
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,570
That's so true with Ha Neul.
This morning, she said,

415
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,970
- "Hi."
- "Hi."

416
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,970
She said hi to me this morning.

417
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,280
- She said hi?
- Yes.

418
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
I said, "Hi."

419
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,980
She talked casually to me so naturally.

420
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
- I did?
- Yes.

421
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,150
- When did I do that?
- Did that make you upset?

422
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,820
What? No.

423
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,490
- Seems like it did.
- Well, I...

424
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,120
Did you feel like she was
challenging you or something?

425
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,930
Actually,
when someone talks casually to me,

426
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,030
- it makes me feel more comfortable.
- Me too.

427
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,530
- If someone talks casually to you?
- Yes.

428
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,070
- I see.
- Is that so?

429
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,070
Yes.

430
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,670
It's so nice...

431
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,740
- when others do that first to me.
- That sounds fun.

432
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,110
Before we reveal our age,

433
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,770
- we could talk casually to each other.
- Shall we talk casually from now on?

434
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,440
We'll talk casually to each other,

435
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,880
- and we'll reveal our age.
- That sounds good.

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,140
I agree with
talking casually to each other.

437
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,380
I agree with
talking casually to each other too.

438
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,050
- Is everyone okay with this?
- Yes. It sounds good.

439
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm good too.

440
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,620
(After breakfast)

441
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,820
What are you doing?

442
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,860
I had too much for breakfast,

443
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,420
so I'm having some enzymes.
Do you want some too?

444
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,890
- Thank you.
- This is made of farro.

445
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,630
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

446
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,630
- Let's open it.
- Ta-da.

447
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,170
- It's so cute.
- It's cute.

448
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,940
"The first official date?"

449
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,610
I have a question. What is that?

450
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,370
Oh, that. It's the river.

451
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,410
- This is so pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

452
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,450
- This too.
- What's this?

453
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,110
Pens, pencils, and a notebook.

454
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,720
- I see.
- There are envelopes too.

455
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,450
These are colored pencils.

456
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,750
That's so cute.

457
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,860
- Colored pencils?
- Yes.

458
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,290
- That's cute.
- Don't you think...

459
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,360
- they'll know who they are from?
- This looks like a tile.

460
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,930
- Gosh, this is so cute.
- It's upside down.

461
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,960
This is crazy.

462
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,200
(Inhaling)

463
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I think...

464
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,670
they are from Woo Jae.

465
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,670
- Okay.
- I see.

466
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,200
- I think they are from Woo Jae.
- From Woo Jae?

467
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,070
(Thinking hard)

468
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,210
Maybe this is from Ji Min?

469
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,950
(Thinking)

470
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,560
- Maybe, it's Chan Hyeong?
- Chan Hyeong?

471
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,090
I think this is from Chang Hwan.

472
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,430
You think that's from Chang Hwan?

473
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,370
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- They're doing that to choose first?

474
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,770
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Goodness.

475
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,870
- Shall we do it once more?
- No, it's okay.

476
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,900
- You can go first.
- Go ahead.

477
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,010
(Careful)

478
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,810
(She picks it up.)

479
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
They don't want her...

480
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,480
- to pick the one they want.
- Right.

481
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,480
I'll choose this one.

482
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,880
- The Santa mug?
- I choose this.

483
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
But they don't know who they're from.

484
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,150
- I choose this.
- That one?

485
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,290
(Stationery and postcards)

486
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,690
What about Ha Neul?

487
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,690
(It's Ha Neul's turn.)

488
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,630
(Nervous)

489
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,860
I choose this one.

490
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,500
(Ha Neul chose the Arno River.)

491
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,570
The Arno River.

492
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,070
(The last one goes to Ji Won.)

493
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,580
Let's go and see if our guesses are right.

494
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
- Right.
- Okay.

495
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,580
It's so hard to guess who they are from.

496
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,610
I think so too.

497
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,520
(Putting on makeup)

498
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,720
(They are putting more effort into
getting ready today.)

499
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,420
(For a romantic date...)

500
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,290
(Shining)

501
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,200
That's pretty.

502
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,640
(The first official date begins.)

503
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,970
I can't wait to see this.

504
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,070
I'm looking forward to it.

505
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,210
(Smiling)

506
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,740
(The downtown of Florence is drizzling.)

507
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,080
- Gosh, she's gorgeous.
- Ha Neul is so pretty.

508
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,880
(She's waiting for the one
she'll walk side by side with.)

509
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,050
(This morning)

510
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,490
(I choose this one.)

511
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,020
(She chose the art of Florence.)

512
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
From Ji Min?

513
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,330
Did she choose that,
thinking it was from Ji Min?

514
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,690
I can't wait to see this.

515
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,300
(Will the one who she's waiting for
appear today?)

516
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,570
Who is it?

517
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,340
(This man...)

518
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,210
(is walking toward her.)

519
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,210
Who is it?

520
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,710
(Ha Neul's date is Ji Min.)

521
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,750
Why...

522
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,650
- What is it?
- Gosh, it was you, Ha Neul.

523
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,750
My goodness.

524
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,120
(Floundering)

525
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,220
My gosh.

526
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,130
I was flustered.

527
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,730
I guess I got too comfortable around you.
I apologize.

528
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,060
- So it was you.
- What's wrong with you?

529
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,100
I was surprised.

530
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,400
Goodness. I really like you, Ha Neul.

531
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,340
They don't feel like a couple to me.

532
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,670
- We don't know that yet.
- Well...

533
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,040
I think Ha Neul is
interested in Ji Min a little.

534
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,370
(Is she?)

535
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,010
I wanted to have a conversation with you.

536
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,350
By the way, I really like this.

537
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,720
- You do?
- Yes.

538
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,820
Really?

539
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,220
Actually, I haven't thought about...

540
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,460
going out on a date with you. So...

541
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,490
Why not?

542
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,230
- Because you feel too comfortable?
- Well...

543
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,330
I just couldn't imagine it.

544
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,060
- Is that so?
- So I was surprised to see you.

545
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,530
Well, I apologize.

546
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,300
- If I made you feel bad.
- No, it didn't make me feel bad.

547
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,230
So it was a surprise.

548
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,740
- Ji Min is so frank about it.
- Right.

549
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,540
We didn't talk that much, but...

550
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,070
But you think we got so close?

551
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you feel too comfortable around me?

552
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,780
- I don't know why,
- Yes?

553
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,710
but I feel comfortable around you.

554
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,650
I think it felt so comfortable around you,
Ha Neul.

555
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Why?

556
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,880
It seemed like I was treating you
as someone younger than me.

557
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,220
- And...
- I'm treating you like that?

558
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,250
No, I'm the one who's doing that.

559
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,320
You said it felt like
I was your younger friend.

560
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,820
Right. But...

561
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,890
When I get comfortable with women,

562
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,230
I tend to become friends with them.

563
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,230
I see.

564
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,930
- I don't want to do that, but...
- I see.

565
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,530
That's how I felt with you.

566
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,830
- Really?
- Yes.

567
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,140
I'm not being so comfortable around you,
though.

568
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,900
But it seems that way.

569
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,670
You can't be sure about that.

570
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,180
I chose the gift, knowing it was from you.

571
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
- You knew it was me?
- Yes.

572
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,950
- The painting?
- Yes. The painting.

573
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,820
- I see. So they made you choose it.
- Right.

574
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,220
- Will she go straight to him?
- She's going straight to him.

575
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,050
- Let's see what Ha Neul is capable of.
- All right.

576
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,590
I can't wait to see this.

577
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,690
(I chose the gift,
knowing it was from you.)

578
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,030
- You knew it was me?
- Yes.

579
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,230
- The painting?
- Yes. The painting.

580
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,970
- I see. So they made you choose it.
- Right.

581
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,770
Chae Eun went first.

582
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,170
- So she went first.
- Yes.

583
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,300
- Who went 2nd?
- Je Yeon went 2nd.

584
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,570
- Je Yeon went second.
- Right.

585
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,840
- And the 3rd...
- The 3rd one was me.

586
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,440
Doesn't that mean you just chose
1 of the 2 that were left behind?

587
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,780
Actually, I was going to choose it
from the beginning.

588
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,910
- Really?
- Yes.

589
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,950
I could see that it was you...

590
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,250
who chose that gift.

591
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,250
(She somehow knew it was from Ji Min.)
- Is that so?
- Yes.

592
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,750
- About that painting...
- Yes?

593
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,320
(About that painting...)

594
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,660
- I was out on a date with Je Yeon.
- Right.

595
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,760
And I think Je Yeon knows
what I got as the gift.

596
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Thank you.

597
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,700
(Last evening, Ji Min and Je Yeon
got their gifts at the same store.)

598
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,330
Hold on.

599
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,400
- Why did you follow me?
- Did you buy it?

600
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,640
I didn't follow you.

601
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,570
- Then Je Yeon must've known what it was.
- What?

602
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,810
- Right.
- Why did you follow me?

603
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,470
I came here first.

604
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,410
I see.

605
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,750
I guess Je Yeon didn't like the date
last night.

606
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,650
Well, Je Yeon might want to go on a date
with someone else too.

607
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,890
You're right.
We should do that freely here.

608
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,120
Ha Neul didn't step back.

609
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,460
She's not offended by that at all.

610
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,590
- But the thing is,
- But...

611
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,260
- Ji Min is only into Je Yeon.
- Right.

612
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,200
I think Ha Neul has her unique energy.

613
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,530
I don't think she showed that
when she was with Chan Hyeong.

614
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,130
(Could that be right?)

615
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,970
Let's have a lot of tasty food today.

616
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,300
Sounds good. Since it's the last day...

617
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,270
(A steak restaurant in Florence
known for its T-bone steak)

618
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,280
- Hi.
- Over there.

619
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,440
(A steak restaurant in Florence
known for its T-bone steak)

620
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,850
- This place is so pretty.
- I know.

621
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,250
I think you made a good choice.

622
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,100
- Let's have a hearty meal here.
- Right.

623
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,430
Let's shake off the cold too.

624
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,100
(Realizing)

625
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,140
(Je Yeon picked someone else's gift.)

626
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,180
Is it because of the fever medicine?

627
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,780
It's on his mind.

628
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,120
I feel fine, though.

629
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,150
(Worried)

630
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,690
I'll help you feel better.

631
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,130
See? She looks different from
when she's with Chan Hyeong, right?

632
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,860
- Goodness.
- Right?

633
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,830
I'll help you feel better.

634
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,870
(I'll help you feel better.)

635
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,570
- This menu is in Korean.
- Wait.

636
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,880
- It is.
- Right?

637
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,580
- It's so nice.
- He's famous, isn't he?

638
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,050
- What?
- Alberto?

639
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,650
It's Alberto.

640
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,680
- He's such a famous chef.
- Yes, he's on Korean TV.

641
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,620
I didn't take this into account
when I picked this place.

642
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,490
This is awesome. You picked the best one.

643
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,330
- Yes.
- You're so considerate.

644
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,330
Which do you prefer
between cream and tomato sauce?

645
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,760
- I usually prefer cream sauce.
- So do I.

646
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
- I honestly like cream sauce.
- They're a match.

647
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,770
You're...

648
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,510
the white one, aren't you?

649
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,570
She's busted.

650
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,980
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

651
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,480
It can only be you.

652
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,850
One of the phrases I thought was funny...

653
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,320
was that when you flirted,

654
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,520
you would approach a man at first...

655
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,330
and act like you weren't interested.
Is that you?

656
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,190
Do you want to see it?

657
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,200
(Flustered)

658
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,360
You're going to do it on me?

659
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,100
I think I've approached you enough.

660
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,600
Well, you approached everyone.

661
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,670
That's how I felt. Am I wrong?

662
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,110
It's complimentary bread.

663
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,250
Stop confusing me.

664
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,750
You're making me feel flustered.

665
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,950
I'm here to go on a date with you, Ji Min.

666
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,690
From the moment I saw that gift.

667
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,120
She's being very direct.

668
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
I picked it as soon as possible.

669
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,890
- Really?
- And we could have...

670
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,860
exchanged the gifts.

671
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,300
And no one wanted to, right?

672
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,930
I didn't even want to change it.

673
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,810
They're more straightforward
than "Heart Signal."

674
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,070
I felt that you were...

675
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,010
treating me...

676
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,650
- like a friend.
- Really?

677
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,820
You never saw me flirting with you?

678
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,050
With me?

679
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,020
I looked into your eyes
and paid attention.

680
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,820
You look into everyone's eyes.

681
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,530
Not everyone.

682
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,760
- Really?
- Yes.

683
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,760
(Pondering)

684
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,370
(The evening on the first day)

685
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,070
I only made eye contact...

686
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,170
with you.

687
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,470
Yes, we all saw it.

688
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,880
Ji Min was too busy looking at Je Yeon
at the time.

689
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
(Last evening)

690
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,650
(Grinning)

691
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,220
- We met eyes so many times.
- Right?

692
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,060
Look at her eyes!

693
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,360
(He doesn't know what to do.)

694
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,400
Don't think of me as your friend.

695
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,910
(Don't think of me as your friend.)

696
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,740
Oh, my gosh!

697
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,450
Are you thirsty?

698
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,480
(Shocked)

699
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,920
Oh, my gosh!

700
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,950
(He's so flustered!)

701
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,250
This is so much fun.

702
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,320
She wore a sweatsuit
on a date with Chan Hyeong,

703
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,930
and she wore her battle uniform this time.

704
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,360
(That's so precise.)

705
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,800
You're right.

706
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,370
(How she seduces a man)

707
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,600
Thank you.

708
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,100
- This is their soup?
- It's so much.

709
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,910
- We could have ordered just one.
- Right.

710
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,240
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

711
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,980
You should eat this when you have a cold.

712
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,420
Is this bread?

713
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,250
I think there's bread underneath it.

714
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,460
It feels different just cutting it.

715
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,400
It's so tender.

716
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,030
It's the tenderest meat I've had so far.

717
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,170
You picked the perfect restaurant.

718
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,710
I mean it.

719
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,340
What did you write as your superpower?

720
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
Me?

721
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,580
Was it something about
turning weaknesses into strengths?

722
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,420
Was it? I'm not sure.

723
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,150
(I have the ability to turn
people's weaknesses into strengths.)

724
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,660
I guess it shows.

725
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,860
What do you think about it?

726
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,530
It's such an awesome superpower.

727
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,500
I was worried, though.

728
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,670
It looked like you were
interested in Je Yeon.

729
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,300
(Flustered)

730
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,970
It seemed like she was your favorite.

731
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,970
- Great move.
- She's so direct.

732
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,180
It's so gratifying!

733
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,310
(Feeling gratified)

734
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,810
It seemed like she was your favorite.

735
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,750
- It looks to me like you're interested.
- What makes you say that?

736
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,160
From the way you look at her.

737
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,120
(What?)

738
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,330
He's surprised.

739
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,230
You seem so intrigued
when you're looking at her.

740
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,000
- I do?
- It's an observation I made.

741
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,330
How do I look at her?

742
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,570
Even when you're being nice to her,

743
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,140
you look at her like this and go,
"Do you want one?"

744
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,010
- But you never do that to me.
- How did I treat you?

745
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,780
You never even suggested it to me.

746
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,550
You looked like you were thinking,
"I'm sure she can eat by herself."

747
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,050
Try being nicer to me now, okay?

748
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,090
(Try being nicer to me now.)

749
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,560
I didn't know you noticed that.

750
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,890
But...

751
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,900
Je Yeon...

752
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,740
makes me...

753
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
a bit curious.

754
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,210
I'm curious to find out
what type of person she is,

755
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,920
but she's calm at the same time.

756
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,250
So I feel like I should look after her.

757
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,490
I think that plays a part.

758
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,360
So, when we were on a date yesterday...

759
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,600
(Thinking)

760
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,500
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's first date)

761
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,840
(Close)

762
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,210
(When Ji Min was with Je Yeon,)

763
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,510
(he laughed at the smallest things.)

764
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,250
(Glancing)

765
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,490
(And he was curious
about her vacant look.)

766
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,030
This is so complicated.

767
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,730
I enjoyed it.

768
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,800
I hope you enjoy today's date as well.

769
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,340
Let's have more fun than yesterday.

770
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,370
That sounds very meaningful.

771
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,410
I'm saying this because I'm jealous.

772
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,980
(This morning)

773
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,950
- You said you were unwell. Are you okay?
- Yes.

774
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,320
No, I'm not.

775
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,790
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes. Thanks for asking.

776
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,990
- I heard you were sick.
- I heard you were sick.

777
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,960
- I guess we had a hard time last night.
- I guess so.

778
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,060
(She accidentally eavesdropped
on their conversation.)

779
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,000
- Did you take medicine?
- I should have gotten up sooner.

780
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,070
- I already had medicine.
- I didn't have any yet.

781
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,570
Take your medicine.

782
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,640
(She saw Ji Min looking after Je Yeon.)

783
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,470
This is like a drama.

784
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,650
You were looking after her today as well.

785
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,450
(Exclaiming)

786
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,320
Please stop making me feel jealous.

787
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,250
"Stop making me feel jealous?"

788
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,390
Are you feeling thirsty?

789
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,090
(Startled)

790
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,160
Well...

791
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,890
You sound very determined.

792
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,730
You're determined to make me nervous,
aren't you?

793
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,230
Earlier, I felt too comfortable.

794
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
Are you uncomfortable right now?

795
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,340
There's a bit of tension.

796
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,410
You don't seem tense at all.

797
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,010
- This is me being tense.
- Is that right?

798
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,920
(She keeps staring at Ji Min.)

799
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,260
I think I feel dizzy.

800
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,490
(Staring)

801
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,660
I'm getting dizzy.

802
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,500
Ji Min can't look at her.

803
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,510
(Turning away)

804
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,870
Your heart's fluttering, isn't it?

805
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,540
No?

806
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,450
I'd like you to keep...

807
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
a steady amount of dopamine rush for me.

808
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,250
How about now?

809
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,450
- It's too frequent.
- Is it? Okay.

810
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,820
I'll slow down for you.

811
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
(Exhaling)

812
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
(Dizzy)

813
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,430
You're probably feeling...

814
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,130
a bigger dopamine rush
because we don't get to use our phones.

815
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,440
Does it feel different
from when you first saw me?

816
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,470
Between when you first saw me and now?

817
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,480
(Looking away)

818
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,440
You need to look me in the eyes.

819
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,410
(Rolling his eyes)

820
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,620
It's just that you're looking at me
so daringly.

821
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,790
If people ask me how the date was today,

822
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,020
I won't be able to answer.

823
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,060
Tell them you were captivated by me.

824
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,760
(Dizzy)

825
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,900
(She keeps hitting him with her charms.)

826
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
These are the charms you get
on the last day.

827
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,070
- She's really impressive.
- Well done, Ha Neul.

828
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,940
- She's so cool.
- You're amazing.

829
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,780
- She's so charming.
- I've become a fan.

830
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,950
(He's a fan of Ha Neul's now.)

831
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,320
You need to be like that on today's date
so that you don't leave any regrets.

832
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,890
I don't think I can eat with you.

833
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,460
- Am I too much?
- I feel like I'll get an upset stomach.

834
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,560
An upset stomach?

835
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,360
What's gotten into you?
How come you changed all of a sudden?

836
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,500
She hasn't changed.

837
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,660
She needed to be like that.

838
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,130
(Thinking)

839
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,070
(Why has she become much bolder
than before?)

840
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,470
Do you want to rest?

841
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,980
- Me?
- Yes.

842
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,340
- You seem tired.
- I didn't get much sleep.

843
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,840
Right? You're tired.

844
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,880
Does it show?

845
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,910
No.

846
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,980
She didn't have a chance.

847
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,050
It looked like...

848
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,660
you were trying...

849
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,120
to get to know the others slowly.

850
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,530
But you were so friendly with me,

851
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,030
so I thought you took me
as just a female friend.

852
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,070
So, I thought, "This isn't right."

853
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,570
- She's honest.
- Yes.

854
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,440
That's part of the reason.

855
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,380
I didn't mean to,

856
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,410
but I thought about it last night
before bed.

857
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,050
I realized that I said your name
more often than I thought.

858
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,220
(Last night)

859
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,170
(A name occurred to her before bed)

860
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,470
Ji Min did say he preferred white wine.

861
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,440
I wonder how old Ji Min is.

862
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,580
(On the second day)

863
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,110
I wonder if Ji Min enjoyed it.

864
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,710
He kept mentioning that square.

865
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,880
(On the third day)

866
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,020
I should go and ask
how much Ji Min enjoyed it.

867
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,450
Do you feel most comfortable
with Ji Min now?

868
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,220
Ji Min said...

869
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,020
that I looked the oldest.

870
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,190
(On the fourth day)

871
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,130
I have a feeling that
Ji Min is the youngest.

872
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,830
Among the men, I mean.

873
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,560
- Me?
- Yes.

874
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,570
- You said my name often?
- Yes.

875
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,040
(He finally realized...)

876
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,470
(Ha Neul's feelings toward him.)

877
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,170
Ha Neul seems sincere.

878
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,050
This is good. She's being candid.

879
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,450
Ha Neul's feelings for him
were pretty deep.

880
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,680
- From the beginning.
- Yes.

881
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,690
- She's been into him from the start.
- Right.

882
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,050
She's been watching him.

883
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,890
I think she's letting him know
of her feelings without pressuring him.

884
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,890
(I admire your courage.)

885
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,460
(A street in Florence late at night)

886
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,430
Florence certainly is a night city.

887
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,470
I know, right?

888
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,070
- It's more atmospheric with the rain.
- Yes, I like it.

889
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,870
- They're speaking casually now.
- Yes.

890
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,170
It's like we're on a trip by ourselves.

891
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,110
Like the movie, "Before Sunrise."

892
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,610
I was worried
because you said you were sick.

893
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,750
- I thought I'd see you.
- Right.

894
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,950
- Can I speak casually?
- Sure.

895
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,820
I thought I'd see you.

896
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,820
You said it was your first time in Italy,
right?

897
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,290
Have you checked out enough places?

898
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,630
I got to spend the last day with you,
Ji Min.

899
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,230
You keep...

900
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,740
- Look at the moon.
- Goodness.

901
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,940
- Here?
- Let's sit here.

902
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,410
- Oh, it's really hot.
- It's hot, right?

903
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,250
I finally feel like I'm in Italy.

904
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,260
Same.

905
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,530
When will I ever come back here?

906
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,700
Ji Min seems to be deep in thought.

907
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,370
This is your first time...

908
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,940
- in Florence, right?
- It is.

909
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,340
If there were buskers,

910
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,040
you would have liked it better.

911
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,610
It lacks about 20 percent.

912
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,820
- Because there's no music?
- Yes.

913
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
For you, I mean.

914
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
(Staring)

915
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,190
She's staring!

916
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,200
What's on your mind
when you're staring at me?

917
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,130
I'm just looking at your face.

918
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,700
- Without any thoughts?
- Yes.

919
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,370
Your eyes are glowing right now.

920
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,950
- So are your eyes.
- Really?

921
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,450
Their words are so...

922
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,760
You gave this to me, Ji Min.

923
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,830
- Do you like it, though?
- Yes. Absolutely.

924
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,060
It was really cute.

925
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,360
You bought the perfect one.

926
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,370
You don't mind me keeping it, right?

927
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,340
No. And I'm glad you love it.

928
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,640
Do you want to see this?

929
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,040
- A light bulb?
- Yes.

930
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,780
That's nice.

931
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,140
(Amazed)

932
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,410
He's so cute.

933
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,850
- I love it.
- Do you?

934
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,890
It's right up my alley.

935
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,590
I'll get you a better one next time.

936
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,920
Sure.

937
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,600
What's your type?

938
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,660
What type of woman do you like?

939
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,800
A woman with a vintage elegance.

940
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,240
Vintage elegance is a tough one.

941
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,340
I want her to speak with grace...

942
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,080
and depth.

943
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,420
You know, someone...

944
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,780
with dignity, should I say?

945
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,250
- You like someone with class.
- Yes.

946
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,420
Class.

947
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,690
I find such people admirable.

948
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,230
And I'm attracted to them
as another human being.

949
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,790
Romantically as well.

950
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,030
I try to be such a person, but...

951
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,200
Well, I know I'm not like that, but...

952
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,000
Denim really suits you.

953
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,440
- What?
- Denim.

954
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,310
- That denim shirt.
- My denim shirt?

955
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,310
Yes.

956
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,510
And I like brown.

957
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,010
I don't think I've ever worn one here.

958
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,990
What?

959
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,190
(Speaking with her eyebrows)

960
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,620
What was that just now?

961
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,090
"Brown? Brown is nice."

962
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,460
That was what I was saying.

963
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,330
I was wondering
if I saw it wrong just now.

964
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,600
(Dizzy)

965
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,340
Flirt a little.

966
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,170
Me?

967
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,270
I told you I didn't know how to flirt.

968
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,740
How can you say that...

969
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,840
after what you wrote?

970
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,150
Your words prove your confidence.

971
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,150
Only when the situation calls for it.

972
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,780
You seem like someone
who is cute and sweet.

973
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,590
- Why is that?
- I just get that feeling.

974
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,420
- Have I been cute around you?
- What?

975
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,990
Have I been cute to you?

976
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,430
Not really, but you have that tone.

977
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,930
- The way I speak?
- Yes.

978
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,830
Of course,
I act cute when with my girlfriend.

979
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,940
I like seeing her smile.

980
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,670
I'm curious.

981
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,410
Well...

982
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,780
Are you the jealous type?

983
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,180
- Me?
- Yes.

984
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,580
- I thought I wasn't.
- Right.

985
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,920
- But I am.
- Is it bad?

986
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,480
You won't allow your girlfriend
to help with others' perilla leaves.

987
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,920
Of course, I'd allow that.

988
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,390
- You would?
- I wouldn't care.

989
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,020
Can she help with another man's zipper?

990
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,160
That's insane.

991
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,890
- Would you allow it?
- No way.

992
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,560
I don't want my boyfriend
helping out with perilla leaves either.

993
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,600
I see.

994
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,960
You want him to only care about you.

995
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,460
I'd prefer that, yes.

996
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,440
I bet you'll be constantly together.

997
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,240
I also tend to be glued to my girlfriend.

998
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,370
Is that so?

999
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,940
I'm even more curious.

1000
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,450
(Just then, like a scene from a movie,)

1001
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,920
- I suddenly hear music.
- Goodness.

1002
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,790
(music starts to play.)

1003
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,890
Isn't this romantic?

1004
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,660
- With that, the night is perfect.
- Right.

1005
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,700
Right?

1006
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,040
Last Christmas.

1007
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,040
What's going on?

1008
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,980
(They pause their conversation
to listen to the music.)

1009
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,080
- This is great.
- What?

1010
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,250
- I love it.
- Same here.

1011
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,250
Right.

1012
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,960
Did you enjoy our trip?

1013
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Yes.

1014
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,830
Oh, dear.

1015
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,370
(Did Ha Neul's feelings reach Ji Min?)

1016
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,810
All right.

1017
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,040
(They can't help but sigh.)

1018
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,180
I need to take off my glasses.
My head is pounding.

1019
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,610
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

1020
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,150
- My head hurts.
- What on earth...

1021
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,480
did we just see?

1022
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,950
Could a man coldly reject
a woman's advance like that?

1023
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,160
I highly doubt it.

1024
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,920
If she were in front of me,

1025
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,260
(Lost for words)

1026
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,090
I would've found it very difficult.

1027
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,930
- That would've left me dizzy.
- Exactly.

1028
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,800
My temples are hurting.

1029
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,600
On top of that,
this is their last night in Italy.

1030
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,470
She didn't get a chance to be alone...

1031
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,370
- She didn't.
- with Ji Min.

1032
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,810
So it was the right approach
to lay out her cards...

1033
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,110
at that moment.

1034
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,410
Also, this would leave Ji Min...

1035
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,110
with a lot to think about
on the flight home to Seoul.

1036
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,720
- It's the best.
- Also, we don't know...

1037
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,790
who Je Yeon will spend the evening with,

1038
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,390
but if whomever she's with
manages to impress her,

1039
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,890
Ji Min...

1040
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,320
could open up to Ha Neul.

1041
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,330
Right.

1042
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,290
It has only gotten more intriguing.

1043
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,300
That was the first date, though, right?

1044
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,330
That's right.

1045
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,870
I have a feeling
there will be one even more powerful.

1046
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,970
Next up is Chae Eun's first date.

1047
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,710
Who will be the first person
she spends the day with?

1048
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
Let's see.

1049
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,540
This is so much fun.

1050
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,610
(A rainy afternoon)

1051
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,290
(In the rain,)

1052
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,260
(she awaits her date.)

1053
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,730
We don't know a lot about Chae Eun,
including her personality.

1054
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,060
I wonder who it is.

1055
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,960
(Who will be her first date?)

1056
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,830
It'd be fun to have it be Chan Hyeong.

1057
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,170
Hold on.

1058
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:38,240
(From afar, a man approaches Chae Eun.)

1059
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,240
- Hi.
- Gosh, hello.

1060
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,710
Hello.

1061
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,520
(Chae Eun's first date is Chan Hyeong.)

1062
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,120
I was wondering who it'd be.

1063
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,420
- You were right.
- It's Chan Hyeong.

1064
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,120
This will make things interesting.

1065
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,750
I'm curious.

1066
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,730
- Right.
- You probably had no idea.

1067
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,060
- I was clueless.
- Right?

1068
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,230
There was no way of knowing.

1069
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,130
That was your mug, wasn't it?

1070
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,370
- The Santa mug.
- That's right.

1071
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,470
Chae Eun chose it,
thinking that it would be...

1072
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,110
- Chan Hyeong's.
- Right.

1073
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,640
(A lot of thought went into the gift.)

1074
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,280
(Chan Hyeong's gift was the Santa mug.)

1075
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,880
- The gift...
- That's what my choice was based on.

1076
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,920
- That's what you chose.
- Right.

1077
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,950
I see.

1078
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,390
Goodness.

1079
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,020
Did I keep you waiting?

1080
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,560
Not really. I'm good.

1081
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,790
- Are you?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1082
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,730
It's a bit chilly, though, today.

1083
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,990
She has a great smile.

1084
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,160
- I...
- Yes?

1085
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,930
- Didn't you see this coming?
- There was no way of knowing.

1086
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,770
That's right.

1087
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,200
(Chan Hyeong's date with Chae Eun
was unexpected.)

1088
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,840
- An investor and a start-up CEO.
- Right.

1089
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,940
An economic researcher and a start-up CEO.

1090
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,910
- They go together.
- Tell me about it.

1091
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,340
That's a good match.

1092
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,650
Doesn't Chan Hyeong prefer women...

1093
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,110
like Chae Eun who are bright and cheerful?

1094
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,650
- That's right.
- Right.

1095
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,250
Let's see how he is today.

1096
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,790
- We'll see how different he is.
- Right.

1097
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,750
(San Gimignano:)

1098
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,390
(A medieval town in Tuscany...)

1099
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,930
(that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site...)

1100
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,060
(known for its towers)

1101
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,930
Is this that famous place?

1102
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,860
I heard there was a famous gelateria.

1103
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,900
Is that so?

1104
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,940
- This place...
- It says "Most famous gelato."

1105
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,170
- Should we get some later?
- We'll get some later.

1106
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,410
We could get some right now.

1107
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,810
- Do as you wish.
- Should we, then?

1108
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,340
- I'm up for it.
- Sounds good.

1109
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,110
- Look at you.
- I love it.

1110
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,650
- You must like gelato.
- I'm a huge fan.

1111
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,910
A fanatic, actually.

1112
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,050
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1113
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,120
Then let's have some now
rather than later.

1114
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,690
- Shall we have some right now?
- Sounds good.

1115
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,120
- Hi.
- Hello.

1116
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,690
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

1117
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,620
She called herself a serious foodie.

1118
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,790
That's right.

1119
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,660
Chan Hyeong's considerate, isn't he?

1120
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,630
Everything looks great.

1121
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,130
This looks amazing.

1122
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,100
Would you like to choose for me as well?

1123
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,170
You can choose all four flavors to try.

1124
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,500
I'll probably enjoy any flavor.

1125
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,310
Really? I love it.

1126
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,510
My gosh. This is amazing.

1127
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,910
- She's adorable.
- This is the happiest I've seen you.

1128
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,680
- You have no idea.
- Right?

1129
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,110
I love it.

1130
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,820
Can I get ricotta and blueberries?

1131
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,950
- Yes.
- She's fluent in English too.

1132
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,950
And...

1133
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,460
(Chae Eun orders in fluent English.)

1134
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,760
Italian garden.

1135
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1136
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,360
- That looks really good.
- Thank you.

1137
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,730
I got the photo.

1138
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,440
Don't you take photos like that
with your significant other?

1139
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
That's right.

1140
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,470
(First date, first photo)

1141
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,640
(They both enjoy a bite.)

1142
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,850
- How is it?
- It's absolutely great.

1143
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,650
- My gosh, it's so good.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1144
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,820
Do you look for gelato shops in Korea?

1145
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
Yes.

1146
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,720
- I see.
- I absolutely love gelato.

1147
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,220
- Really?
- When I traveled in Italy,

1148
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,860
I had three cups a day.

1149
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,930
- She's so cute when she smiles.
- I'm sensitive to cold weather,

1150
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,330
but that doesn't keep me away
from my gelato.

1151
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,760
(She's adorable.)

1152
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,730
When we were passing by,

1153
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,840
you looked at this place
like you were burning a hole in it,

1154
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,940
saying "Hey, it's gelato!"

1155
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,010
- Was it that obvious?
- Yes.

1156
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,010
My gosh.

1157
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,310
(When Chae Eun spotted the gelateria,)

1158
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,650
Is this that famous place?

1159
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,250
(she stopped in front of it.)

1160
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,920
(Cheerful)

1161
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,220
(He smiles as if he finds her adorable.)

1162
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,790
- Oh, no. Everyone's wavering.
- Then...

1163
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,830
Chan Hyeong finds her adorable.

1164
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,160
At the moment, we've only seen
Chan Hyeong be Chan Hyeong.

1165
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,530
He's naturally kind.

1166
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,000
- Don't let that fool you.
- Really?

1167
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,070
- There's an innocence to Chae Eun.
- Right.

1168
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,910
And Chan Hyeong saw that.

1169
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,840
I'm suddenly curious about something.

1170
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,850
- Did you live abroad for a long time?
- Yes.

1171
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,480
- Where?
- I lived in Canada.

1172
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,550
I was in Canada as well.

1173
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,190
Not for long, though. About six months.

1174
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,020
- I see.
- They have a lot in common.

1175
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,120
- Really?
- Yes.

1176
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,960
I lived there for a long time.

1177
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
About 11 years.

1178
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,230
(Startled)

1179
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,200
No wonder. Your English accent...

1180
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,500
Goodness.

1181
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,530
(Embarrassed)

1182
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,240
She's charming.

1183
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,610
Could I perhaps...

1184
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,380
- try that cherry flavor?
- Sure.

1185
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,980
- I had too much of it, didn't I?
- That's all right.

1186
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,080
My gosh.

1187
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,010
It's not easy to share food like that...

1188
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,550
- on the first date.
- It's not.

1189
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,650
How is it?

1190
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,620
It's good.

1191
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,850
This is good as well.

1192
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,290
I ate all of mine.

1193
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,090
- How adorable.
- This is good.

1194
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,530
- This...
- I tried some, and it's good.

1195
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,630
It's so big that
it needs to be broken apart.

1196
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,230
I doubt it's big for you. Let's be honest.

1197
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,240
- You can have it, right?
- Gosh, no.

1198
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,110
- Do you see me as a pig?
- It's not that.

1199
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,370
That's not what I'm saying.

1200
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,110
You like gelato, that's why.

1201
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,610
It's so good.

1202
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,550
They're both delicious.

1203
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,480
She must really love to eat.

1204
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,120
You want to treat those
who react enthusiastically.

1205
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,120
Men are like that.

1206
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,120
You're staying a day, right?

1207
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,790
- Yes, just today.
- Just today.

1208
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,520
But you're spending that day with only me.

1209
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,930
- Right?
- Exactly.

1210
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,530
We should spend it wisely.

1211
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,460
- Today...
- It has to be good.

1212
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,060
You can have gelato three times
if you want.

1213
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,230
- Have it when we pass by again.
- Really?

1214
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,700
- Of course.
- You're the best.

1215
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,810
- Should we go to the place I found?
- Sure.

1216
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,970
- That sounds like a plan.
- Right.

1217
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,470
I'd love that.

1218
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,040
I always wonder what it'd feel like
to live in a place like this.

1219
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,250
It's like a scene from a movie.

1220
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,020
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

1221
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,620
- This place...
- Just walking the streets...

1222
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,690
- It's so pretty.
- This is beautiful.

1223
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,720
(The streets look even better
with lights.)

1224
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,890
- What a beautiful place.
- Right.

1225
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,620
(The streets look even better
with lights.)

1226
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,360
They make a sweet couple.

1227
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,160
Could we take a look over here?

1228
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,500
- Of course.
- Thanks.

1229
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,870
Every shop on the street
has its own charm.

1230
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,600
- Including what's on display.
- I know.

1231
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,340
- Do you know what artichokes are?
- Yes, of course.

1232
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,040
I know what artichokes are.

1233
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,980
I heard that it's a cooking ingredient
from northern Italy.

1234
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,950
My dad loves these.

1235
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,880
- Artichokes.
- Really?

1236
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,080
Because of that,
I was forced to eat a lot of it as a kid.

1237
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,320
When I ordered sea bass yesterday,
I ordered one...

1238
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,060
that was served with artichokes.

1239
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,090
- On purpose? Do you enjoy them?
- Yes.

1240
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,190
Really?

1241
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,330
You sound like an expert on food.

1242
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,730
- Well, I...
- You seem to like...

1243
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,330
even the little things.

1244
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,940
I like trying food
that I'm not familiar with.

1245
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,670
When I travel to a country
I haven't been to before,

1246
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,880
I try food that you won't find in Korea.

1247
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,140
- Same here.
- Right.

1248
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,550
I've tried venison.

1249
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,550
And alligator meat.

1250
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,420
- Ostrich meat as well.
- Really?

1251
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,980
- Have you tried them all?
- Yes.

1252
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,990
I've tried all kinds of unique dishes...

1253
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,050
since I'm adventurous.

1254
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,160
Here's how I see it.

1255
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,260
- If others can eat it, so can I.
- Exactly.

1256
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,660
People in those countries
don't find that odd at all.

1257
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,130
Exactly. That's what I think as well.

1258
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,230
I want to try new things,

1259
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,340
which is why I order
what I normally can't find.

1260
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,310
I like it. I love that attitude.

1261
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,740
That's how I am as well.

1262
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,980
They found something in common.

1263
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,750
They go great together.

1264
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,880
This must be the place.

1265
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,150
Is this the place?

1266
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,050
- This is pretty.
- It's stunning.

1267
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,520
It's so pretty.

1268
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,720
- Shall we see what's inside?
- Sure.

1269
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,460
(A bistro that opened in 1927,
famous for its microbeer and ragu pasta)

1270
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,900
- It's nice and warm.
- Right.

1271
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,200
(A bistro that opened in 1927
famous for its microbeer and ragu pasta)

1272
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,030
What time did you wake up today?

1273
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,530
At 8 a.m.

1274
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,740
- You didn't get a lot of sleep.
- I didn't.

1275
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,870
Right?

1276
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,340
Did you sleep well, though?

1277
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,610
I did. You can say I passed out.

1278
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,250
That's understandable.
You were probably nervous.

1279
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,610
How sweet of him.

1280
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,550
It was a bummer that you were seated...

1281
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,890
- at the far end.
- Exactly.

1282
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,020
It would've been nice
to have talked to you,

1283
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,420
so I felt bad.

1284
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,760
- We were seated far apart.
- I know.

1285
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,860
You were at the other end.

1286
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,130
(Yesterday evening, when they first met)

1287
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,100
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun
were seated the farthest apart.)

1288
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,300
Really?

1289
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,340
I see.

1290
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:59,510
(They couldn't talk much.)

1291
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,740
(What a bummer.)

1292
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,880
I know.

1293
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,980
- This is nice, though.
- Right.

1294
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,350
He agreed.

1295
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,690
Thank you.

1296
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,120
Look at how it's been plated.

1297
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,390
Thank you. This is incredible.

1298
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,990
- Should we try some?
- Should we?

1299
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,130
That looks delicious.

1300
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,730
Is there anything you can't eat?

1301
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,030
I can eat just about anything.

1302
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,870
Even coriander?

1303
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,570
I do eat coriander,

1304
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,310
but I don't like it with my pho.

1305
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,210
However, I like having coriander...

1306
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,450
with Mexican food like salsa.

1307
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,220
You're very well aware of what you like.

1308
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,780
Only when it comes to food.

1309
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,320
Goodness.

1310
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,160
(Hesitant)

1311
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,260
When it comes to women,

1312
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:58,230
what stands out to you
regarding their appearance?

1313
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,700
As for me...

1314
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,900
I'm curious too.

1315
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,470
(Curious)

1316
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,810
I look at the gaze.

1317
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,340
- Really?
- Yes.

1318
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:12,180
I believe that we all have
a different look in our eyes.

1319
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,380
That's true.

1320
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,120
When my friends asked...

1321
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,690
what I looked for in a man,

1322
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,520
I said I valued his pupils.

1323
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,260
I said his pupils
were most important to me,

1324
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,590
and they said I was weird.

1325
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,460
(Chuckling)

1326
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,670
- They said you were weird?
- "You look at his pupils?"

1327
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,900
That's what they said to me.

1328
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,810
(A man who values one's gaze,
a woman who sees a man's pupils)

1329
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,570
(One's pupils...)

1330
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,640
(as a means to flirt?)

1331
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,980
I should use that myself.

1332
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,510
"I like those who have clear pupils."

1333
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,710
(He saves the comment
since you never know.)

1334
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,950
How much older is your sister?

1335
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,720
- I have a twin.
- What?

1336
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,790
What?

1337
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,020
- I have a twin.
- An identical twin?

1338
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,560
- No, fraternal.
- Fraternal?

1339
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,460
We look alike, though.

1340
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,600
(How fascinating)

1341
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,360
Do you have any siblings?

1342
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,400
I have a brother
who's one year older than me.

1343
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,770
- Are you two close?
- We're super close.

1344
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,600
The work that we do is actually similar.

1345
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,970
He's my friend,

1346
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,610
my companion,

1347
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,150
and everything else.

1348
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,050
- I think that's great.
- It is.

1349
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,680
My older sister is also
someone I see as a companion.

1350
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,890
- They suit each other.
- They have a lot in common.

1351
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,890
(Chan Hyeong has a brother
who is a year older than him.)

1352
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,220
How fascinating.

1353
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,560
(Chae Eun has a twin sister who's older.)

1354
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,560
What do you think my gift is?

1355
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,740
Do I get a hint?
Does it have a Christmas vibe to it?

1356
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,070
Absolutely.

1357
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,340
It's a Christmas gift.

1358
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,710
- Really?
- Yes.

1359
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,010
You can say it's a typical Christmas gift.

1360
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,720
A typical Christmas gift?

1361
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,480
As in socks?

1362
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,190
- Busted.
- Oh, dear.

1363
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,920
- You can check later.
- What if they're small on me?

1364
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,190
You can check the gift later.

1365
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,190
(Curious)

1366
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,000
- There you go.
- Is it a stuffed toy?

1367
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,500
No, just open it.

1368
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,330
- Socks!
- Yes, socks.

1369
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,870
- I was right.
- Yes, I got you socks.

1370
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,600
I actually guessed correctly.

1371
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,770
I was surprised that
you guessed it right away.

1372
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,910
Then why...

1373
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,940
- You said I was wrong.
- I never said that.

1374
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,110
- Didn't you?
- I said you should check later.

1375
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,510
(Chae Eun's gift
is a pair of Christmassy socks.)

1376
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,850
I can't believe you really got me socks.

1377
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,950
- Aren't they adorable?
- They are, but...

1378
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,020
I thought I'd be wearing them,

1379
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,590
which is why the size...

1380
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,160
- But...
- What do I do about this?

1381
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,760
(Laughing)

1382
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,930
Pull on them to make them longer.

1383
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,160
Your feet must be this small.

1384
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,430
What's your shoe size?

1385
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,970
I wear 235mm.

1386
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,570
- What's your shoe size?
- It's 265mm.

1387
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,240
- They could fit if...
- If I could make them a bit longer.

1388
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,410
I could be wearing them on the 25th,
right?

1389
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,650
(Laughing and giggling)

1390
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,980
Just so you know,

1391
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,590
Chan Hyeong's not faking this joy.

1392
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,250
- He's having a good time.
- This is for real.

1393
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,260
He has never laughed like this before.

1394
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,690
(A laughter that wasn't heard
during his previous dates)

1395
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,690
They go like this.

1396
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,330
(They also open the present
from Chan Hyeong.)

1397
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,700
You can't tell that these are mugs, right?

1398
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,230
Right.

1399
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,770
They look so pretty.

1400
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,030
- These are perfect for Christmas.
- Yes, for Christmas.

1401
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,070
(A perfect gift for Christmas)

1402
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,910
Shall we have one each?

1403
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,640
- Shall we?
- I mean, these mugs.

1404
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,680
That sounds good.

1405
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,780
And one sock each?

1406
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,180
- Sure.
- I like these socks.

1407
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,620
If I feel bad about you wearing only
one sock, I'll give you the other one.

1408
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,120
I might wear it before then.

1409
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,390
Even if I only have one...

1410
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,860
Really?

1411
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,890
What if it goes to someone else?

1412
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,530
One of them has the Gingerbread Man.

1413
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,530
(The smallest thing makes them laugh.)
They're in trouble.

1414
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,530
- They're being genuine.
- They're in trouble.

1415
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,800
She's definitely a catfish.

1416
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,970
It gets dark very early.

1417
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,240
It's a bummer.

1418
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,540
By the way,
we decided to drop the honorifics.

1419
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,540
You're right.

1420
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,650
You can drop the honorifics first.

1421
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,880
(That's cute.)

1422
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
- Gosh.
- That's cute.

1423
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,120
Does it feel awkward?

1424
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,190
I can tell that he finds her cute.

1425
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,490
Both of them are cute.

1426
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:17,530
Did you drop the honorifics yesterday?

1427
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,590
- Yesterday?
- With the rest of them.

1428
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,830
Honestly,
all of us feel awkward around each other.

1429
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,730
- I see.
- None of us are...

1430
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,930
very close to each other yet.

1431
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,940
(Chan Hyeong reassures Chae Eun
who joined the group later.)

1432
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,970
It's hard to see what's ahead.

1433
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,470
It's completely dark ahead.
Is it some kind of a horror movie?

1434
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
- Did you turn on all the lights?
- It's dark. Yes.

1435
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,580
Aren't you scared?

1436
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,150
- Me? I'm okay.
- Yes.

1437
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,380
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1438
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,620
If you're scared, I'll slow down.

1439
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,450
- How is this speed?
- It's good.

1440
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,490
Are you okay with it?

1441
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,720
(Realizing that she's scared,
he slows down.)

1442
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
(Glancing)

1443
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,960
You're still sitting up straight.

1444
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,660
(Stiff)

1445
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,900
That's not true.

1446
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,300
You must still be very scared.

1447
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,770
You usually have a good posture, right?

1448
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,100
Yes, of course.

1449
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,440
(Will today's date
move Chang Hyeong's heart?)

1450
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,470
His relaxed demeanor with her is
different from when he's with Ha Neul.

1451
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,410
- It's different.
- He looks totally relaxed.

1452
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,080
- Goodness.
- I know a couple who's studying...

1453
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,180
in Boston together.

1454
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,250
They're at a graduate school.

1455
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,180
They remind me of that couple.

1456
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,420
Between Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul,

1457
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,220
there was a sense of difference
in their conversation.

1458
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,820
- Chan Hyeong made a lot of effort.
- Yes.

1459
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,790
Ha Neul also made an effort.

1460
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,230
- They're different from each other,
- Right.

1461
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,500
but they were willing to try hard.
This couple, on the other hand...

1462
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,770
- They don't need to make an effort.
- It's effortless.

1463
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,970
It's very effortless.

1464
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,070
Remember how Chan Hyeong
laughed near the end?

1465
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,540
- Right.
- People can pretend...

1466
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,940
to smile or laugh with their mouth.

1467
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,580
- But the eyes can't lie.
- Right.

1468
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,140
- I agree.
- From the look in Chan Hyeong's eyes,

1469
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,050
I could tell that he was truly laughing.

1470
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,450
It means that he's interested in her.

1471
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,880
When he was laughing about the socks.

1472
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,850
- He looked so happy.
- He was cracking up.

1473
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,120
A foolish smile.

1474
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,320
- A foolish smile.
- I agree.

1475
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,560
Here's what I thought.

1476
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,130
"Between Ha Neul and Chae Eun,"

1477
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,200
"which one of them is Chan Hyeong
more attracted to?"

1478
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,430
Once he goes back to the house...

1479
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,770
and faces both of them, he'll realize...

1480
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:08,940
his true feelings.

1481
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,240
He'd have to think about it.

1482
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,210
"What's going on here?"

1483
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,640
I can't wait to find out.

1484
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,710
(Volterra, an ancient city...)

1485
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,480
(where Piazza dei Priori
and Volterra Cathedral are located)

1486
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,310
(Also known as the location
for a series called "Twilight")

1487
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,350
She looks graceful.

1488
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,890
- Volterra?
- Volterra.

1489
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,720
(Every second and minute
feels long at this moment.)

1490
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,760
She looks nervous.

1491
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,430
With the stationery?

1492
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:35,030
Yes, with the postcard.

1493
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:40,230
(The owner of Je Yeon's present
is coming to see her.)

1494
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:50,510
(Who bought the present
that Je Yeon picked?)

1495
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,520
(Striding)

1496
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,990
(Glancing)

1497
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,330
(Je Yeon's date is Woo Jae.)

1498
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,430
What?

1499
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
This is fascinating.

1500
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,870
- When did you get here?
- Me? Not so long ago.

1501
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,000
- Not so long ago?
- No.

1502
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,440
Wasn't it difficult to get here?

1503
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,240
- I was excited about who'd come.
- Was it okay?

1504
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,880
Are you disappointed?

1505
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,080
No, I'm happy.

1506
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,250
She looks so excited.

1507
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:29,750
It's different.

1508
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,890
Woo Jae also has a big smile on his face.

1509
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,920
(Right.)

1510
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,520
Aren't you cold?

1511
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,990
A little bit.

1512
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,860
Shall we get something hot to drink?

1513
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,090
Sure. How about a cafe?

1514
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

1515
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,330
By the way...

1516
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,240
Did you pick my present?

1517
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,670
- Yes.
- That's how you came here?

1518
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,240
(Surprised)

1519
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,780
You didn't know who it was, did you?

1520
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,250
Why did you pick that present?

1521
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,120
- Why did I pick it?
- Yes.

1522
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,720
- It was the prettiest.
- Really?

1523
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,820
Come on.
She knew that it was from Woo Jae.

1524
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,060
- I'll pick this.
- This?

1525
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,090
Yes.

1526
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,860
- Woo Jae?
- You think it's from him?

1527
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,360
(Je Yeon thought that
the present was from Woo Jae.)

1528
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,860
As soon as I opened it,

1529
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,170
- I wanted to pick this.
- You did?

1530
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,570
- But you didn't know that it was from me.
- What?

1531
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,770
You didn't know that it was from me.

1532
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,040
Well...

1533
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,970
Let's say that you didn't.

1534
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,240
- No comment.
- No comment? Okay.

1535
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,250
Look at the tree.

1536
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,050
It looks pretty.
Isn't this place beautiful?

1537
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,120
Yes, when I was driving up here,

1538
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,150
the view was beautiful.
It reminded me of the Middle Ages.

1539
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,690
I looked around while driving.

1540
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,720
It looks beautiful.

1541
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,390
A cafe. Wait a minute.

1542
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,660
Shall I hold your umbrella for you?

1543
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,460
- Will you be okay?
- Yes.

1544
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,170
She's so forward. Goodness.

1545
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,170
(Searching for a nearby cafe)

1546
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,770
(Staying close)

1547
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,040
Let's go here.
It looks like the best place.

1548
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,810
It's a three-minute walk.

1549
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,340
That sounds good.

1550
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,680
- Aren't your hands cold?
- Yes.

1551
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:07,880
Is this the place?

1552
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,550
- It should be here.
- Is it this place?

1553
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,790
The cafe should be up there.

1554
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,790
(A steep uphill appears in front of them.)

1555
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,460
- I think it's possible to go...
- Shall we go?

1556
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,760
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

1557
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,400
Anyway, it's fascinating.

1558
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,070
- It's fascinating.
- Fascinating?

1559
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,910
Don't you feel the closest to me?

1560
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,240
- Yes.
- Aren't you familiar with me the most?

1561
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,280
Yes.

1562
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,550
- Is it closed?
- Is this it?

1563
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:40,980
(The cafe is firmly closed.)

1564
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,120
Is it closed?

1565
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,420
In that case...

1566
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,390
- We should go back.
- We should go back.

1567
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,790
Do you want to take a look
around the Christmas street?

1568
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,230
- If you're okay. Is it bearable?
- That sounds good.

1569
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,230
Yes.

1570
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,630
- Be careful as you're going down.
- Okay.

1571
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,700
It must be slippery.

1572
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,000
- It's quite steep.
- You're right.

1573
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,810
Can I hold onto you?

1574
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,340
Sure.

1575
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,410
(Tight)

1576
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,050
- Goodness!
- Gosh.

1577
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,350
I can't believe Je Yeon did that.

1578
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,710
- She grabbed him.
- She asked if she could hold onto him.

1579
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,720
Goodness.

1580
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,090
(Can I hold onto you?)

1581
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:22,120
(Tight)

1582
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,760
(Smiling)

1583
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,500
- Let's go slowly.
- Okay.

1584
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,830
If we slipped, we'd ruin the moment.

1585
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:34,640
It could be dangerous.

1586
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,840
Did we climb up this far?

1587
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
Slowly.

1588
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,550
Take your time.

1589
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,750
(Walking slowly at Je Yeon's speed)

1590
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,650
(Taking smaller strides)

1591
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,260
Woo Jae looks nervous right now.

1592
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,720
(Woo Jae is pacing himself at her speed.)

1593
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,190
- We got back down.
- Okay.

1594
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,800
That was the most nerve-racking moment.

1595
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,270
It could've been dangerous.

1596
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,040
As soon as she held onto him,
Woo Jae got very nervous.

1597
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,270
He was holding the umbrella
with the other hand.

1598
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:13,340
He kept fidgeting...

1599
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,140
and wondering what to do.

1600
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,510
- They look like a couple in a painting.
- Right.

1601
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,350
- Seriously.
- They're like a couple in an artwork.

1602
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,380
- Shall we go there?
- The street looks so beautiful.

1603
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,390
I agree.

1604
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,020
- It's very beautiful.
- Isn't it very beautiful?

1605
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,760
Among all the places I've visited,
this is the most beautiful.

1606
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,960
- Really?
- Yes.

1607
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,990
Right.

1608
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,960
- It's so Christmas...
- I want to bring my camera here.

1609
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,500
- Now?
- From my car...

1610
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,570
Is your car far away?

1611
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,200
Should I bring it?

1612
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,640
(Suddenly,
he wants to take photos of this moment.)

1613
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,510
I don't think it'll take long.

1614
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,480
I'll bring my camera.

1615
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,110
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

1616
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,710
- Should I wait here?
- Yes, it's nearby.

1617
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,750
Okay.

1618
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,290
(Rushing)

1619
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:01,290
(A few days ago)

1620
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,590
One, two, three. Only this.

1621
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:09,560
(He bought film to take photos.)

1622
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,170
(Short on breath)

1623
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,700
(Quick)

1624
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,810
(Following)

1625
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,810
This is fascinating.

1626
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,310
- What?
- It's fascinating.

1627
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,610
- It's fascinating?
- Yes.

1628
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:27,650
What is?

1629
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,580
This situation.

1630
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,590
- I agree.
- Wait, a car is coming.

1631
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,160
Goodness.

1632
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,660
- I'll take your photo.
- Now?

1633
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:40,930
Could you stand there?

1634
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,800
(He finds a good spot to take photos.)

1635
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,070
- The look on her face is different.
- She looks so cheerful.

1636
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,170
Over here?

1637
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:50,370
She looks slightly enamored by him.

1638
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,240
In 1, 2, 3.

1639
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,610
(Je Yeon, the first model of his new film)

1640
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,080
Hello. Good evening.

1641
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,280
(A fancy cafe inside a building
from the 12th century,)

1642
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,350
(located in the old town of Volterra)

1643
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,390
- Thank you.
- Espresso and sugar if you need.

1644
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,560
Thank you.

1645
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,420
Are you okay with espresso?

1646
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,160
- It's my first time drinking it.
- Really?

1647
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,430
Would you like to try it?

1648
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,230
(Je Yeon's first espresso)

1649
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,830
(Savoring)

1650
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,240
Isn't it strange?

1651
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,240
(Bitter)

1652
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,840
(Humming)

1653
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,040
(Her broken reaction
makes everyone laugh.)

1654
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,710
(She has to copy her right away.)

1655
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,280
That's cute.

1656
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,480
(An emergency treatment)

1657
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,820
(Woo Jae melts some sugar
in the espresso with care.)

1658
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,850
- Do you want to try it from this side?
- Okay.

1659
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,630
(Staring)

1660
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,700
- This is very good.
- Right?

1661
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,430
- Yes.
- She's cute.

1662
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,970
You can have that.

1663
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,400
(Slurping)

1664
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,740
She keeps drinking it.

1665
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,070
(The emergency treatment
seems to have worked.)

1666
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,070
(Chuckling)

1667
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,410
- He's smiling.
- It's very good.

1668
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,540
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1669
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,540
By the way,

1670
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,910
you speak better than me
with the Seoul accent.

1671
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,180
I don't know where to go.

1672
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,520
(Speaking with a countryside accent)

1673
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,120
I don't know which region you're from.

1674
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,120
I mean...

1675
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,560
That's difficult.

1676
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,560
- Don't ask me to do it.
- "Americano" is one of the hardest words.

1677
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,860
It's the hardest for me too.

1678
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,160
"Americano" is the hardest to say.

1679
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,230
Americano.

1680
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,230
"I'd like some Americano."

1681
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,030
Can you say it?

1682
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,230
(Shaking her head)

1683
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,430
Iced Americano.

1684
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,500
- IA.
- Goodness.

1685
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,110
Aren't you having a breakdown
because of me?

1686
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,610
I'm totally destroyed.

1687
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,010
I'm going to meditate in silence.

1688
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,180
She's cute.

1689
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,790
- Did you have fun yesterday?
- Yesterday?

1690
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,390
Yes, I had fun.

1691
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,090
Where did you go yesterday?

1692
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:53,630
Yesterday, we went to the place
with the merry-go-round.

1693
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,630
Right.

1694
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,500
And Piazzale Michelangelo at 4:30 p.m.
to watch the sunset.

1695
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,100
- That's where we saw each other.
- Right.

1696
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,470
He's asking her that.

1697
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,910
There's a place called
Piazzale Michelangelo.

1698
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,310
It's very beautiful there.

1699
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,540
Let's go there if we can.

1700
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,680
That sounds good.

1701
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,850
They talked about it.

1702
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:12,910
Right.

1703
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,750
(Last night, Je Yeon...)

1704
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,050
She went there with Ji Min instead.

1705
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:21,320
(was with Ji Min, not Woo Jae.)

1706
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,290
(Bothered)

1707
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,430
I should've asked you to join us.

1708
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,330
- I didn't have time to think...
- But that wasn't what you wanted.

1709
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,470
- At all.
- I mean...

1710
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,740
Anyway, it was good to see you.

1711
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,710
I know. I was very surprised.

1712
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,450
I tried to get there on time.

1713
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,980
While watching the sunset...

1714
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,720
When I got up there,

1715
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,420
it was very beautiful.

1716
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:58,230
You were taking photos of each other
like newlyweds.

1717
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,630
I caught you in action.

1718
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,630
(They were being lovey-dovey
like newlyweds.)

1719
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,700
(Approaching suddenly)

1720
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
- What?
- What?

1721
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,270
(He caught them in action.)

1722
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,140
I should've taken a photo of you.

1723
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,980
You didn't want to anyway.

1724
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,610
It's too late.

1725
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,650
It was nice.

1726
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,850
It was good.

1727
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,690
Aren't you curious to know
what I bought as a present?

1728
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,230
Yes, I am.

1729
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,500
Here you go.

1730
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,530
Thank you.

1731
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,240
- What do you think?
- It's pretty.

1732
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,640
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

1733
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,610
Where did you buy it?

1734
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,720
There was a shop
where they sold these drawings.

1735
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,520
Whenever I come to a new city,

1736
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,820
I like visiting galleries or art museums.

1737
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,020
- Do you like art museums?
- Yes.

1738
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,190
- So that's why.
- She remembered what he said.

1739
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,460
(Je Yeon bought a drawing
for the Christmas present.)

1740
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,030
(Looking at the drawing in detail)

1741
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:14,740
Hello.

1742
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,300
(Woo Jae's occupation)

1743
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,240
I'm 35 years old.

1744
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,610
I'm Shin Woo Jae.

1745
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,240
I'm a painter.

1746
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,980
- He paints?
- He's a painter?

1747
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,210
He's a painter?

1748
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,780
He's such a good-looking painter.

1749
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:34,150
Painting is something
that I'd like to do all my life.

1750
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,420
(Painting is something that
Woo Jae wants to do all his life)

1751
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:41,460
My dream is to continue...

1752
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,800
being able to paint.

1753
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,640
(Before Woo Jae became a painter)

1754
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,410
Italy was a battlefield to me.

1755
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,370
The battlefield was the field.

1756
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,880
When I was 17, I lived in Italy alone.

1757
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,250
I went there to learn how to play soccer.

1758
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,420
He was a soccer player.

1759
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,750
To train myself in a better environment,

1760
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,150
I made that decision.

1761
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,690
Then I lived in Germany...

1762
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,230
(After Italy, he was a professional
soccer player in Germany.)

1763
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,900
Until I was 23 or 24.

1764
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,070
It must have been a battlefield for him.

1765
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,930
At that time...

1766
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,370
(Being a soccer player was hard
as it was competitive.)

1767
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,770
It was difficult for me.

1768
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,870
(Suddenly, one day)

1769
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:30,580
I realized that I could be happy
without playing soccer.

1770
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,850
(When he returned to Korea,)

1771
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,850
That's amazing.

1772
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,550
(Woo Jae went back to painting,
which he loved during childhood.)

1773
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,320
(Expressing the world that he sees
on the canvas)

1774
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,330
(This is Painter Woo Jae.)

1775
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,560
- I didn't expect it at all.
- A painter.

1776
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:49,930
(Even Woo Jae's spokesperson
is surprised.)

1777
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,030
That's why he said that
he likes looking at paintings.

1778
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,100
I see.

1779
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,940
Isn't he more of a painter...

1780
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,010
- than a soccer player now?
- Yes.

1781
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,970
- It suits him perfectly.
- Right.

1782
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,610
Painters tend to...

1783
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,580
contemplate a lot.

1784
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,450
- I can see how he observes...
- Yes.

1785
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,810
objects differently.

1786
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,250
(Careful)

1787
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,490
- Was it drawn with crayons?
- Isn't it very detailed?

1788
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,490
Yes.

1789
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,960
It's very nice.

1790
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,490
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it very much.

1791
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,060
(Pleased)

1792
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:26,430
- In my room,
- Yes?

1793
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,500
I'll keep it carefully.

1794
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,770
I wanted to keep it myself,
but it's for you.

1795
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,040
(Joking)

1796
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,510
When we go back to Korea,

1797
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,250
I'll let you borrow it during our stay.

1798
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:40,980
That'd be nice.

1799
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,650
(After exchanging gifts
they picked wholeheartedly)

1800
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,020
- The street is pretty.
- It's so Christmas...

1801
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,220
Everything has Christmas decorations.

1802
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,290
- It's gorgeous.
- Right?

1803
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,360
(A warmly lit night has come.)

1804
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:54,330
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes.

1805
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,130
- It's a city I've never heard of before.
- I see.

1806
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,170
This place is cool.

1807
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,170
I imagine a photo of this area
will look nice.

1808
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,640
Really?

1809
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,210
(Snapping)

1810
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,880
- This couple is heartwarming to watch.
- I agree.

1811
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,980
That's a pretty camera.

1812
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,950
- Isn't the camera cute?
- Yes.

1813
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,820
Since when did you take photos?

1814
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,530
I bought this...

1815
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,530
about seven years ago.

1816
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:28,630
Seven years ago?

1817
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,960
It was already an old camera.

1818
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,170
I bought it from a camera shop
in Eulji-ro.

1819
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,840
It's been a while since I bought it.

1820
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,470
- Cute, right?
- Totally.

1821
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,680
I'll take a photo
of your side profile later.

1822
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,440
Okay.

1823
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,580
The two get along well, even emotionally.

1824
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,550
- You're sniffling, right?
- Yes.

1825
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,320
Same here. Do you have rhinitis?

1826
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,090
- I don't.
- Is it from the cold?

1827
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,560
It must be due to the cold weather.

1828
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,390
What were you going to say?

1829
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,230
On your way here,
who did you imagine to be here?

1830
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:04,830
- Who I expected?
- Yes.

1831
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,500
I did think...

1832
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,240
it might be you.

1833
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,010
- Because...
- Why?

1834
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,980
First off, this one.

1835
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,740
The Florence Cathedral.

1836
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,820
We were able to see
the Florence Cathedral...

1837
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,520
from the terrace of the coffee shop.

1838
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,920
It's so pretty.

1839
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,420
How cool.

1840
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,860
Woo Jae wanted Je Yeon to notice it.

1841
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,490
(The Florence Cathedral they saw
from the coffee shop in Florence)

1842
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,830
And this one.

1843
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,660
Ponte Vecchio.

1844
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,170
(They took a photo at Ponte Vecchio.)

1845
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,540
We took a photo
in the middle of the bridge.

1846
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,740
He gave her gifts...

1847
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,070
of what they saw together.

1848
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:52,150
(Did Woo Jae think of Je Yeon
while preparing the gifts?)

1849
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,680
Do you have space
in your suitcase for these?

1850
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,080
If I don't, I'll throw away other things
and put these in.

1851
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,660
Thank you for liking these.

1852
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:04,360
Thank you for the gift.

1853
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,030
I was wondering what to gift you...

1854
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,830
when I thought it'd be nice...

1855
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:14,070
if they could remind you of Florence.

1856
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,370
And looking at places...

1857
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,310
we've been to...

1858
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,640
could connect you back to Florence.

1859
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,810
- That was what I thought.
- I see.

1860
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,680
But that could be the reason
for not choosing them.

1861
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,060
- "I shouldn't pick this one."
- "Not this one."

1862
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,760
The way up here was gorgeous.

1863
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,400
- Driving was tough, wasn't it?
- I was sleepy.

1864
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,600
My eyes became droopy as I sang.

1865
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,000
Do you usually sing when you drive?

1866
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,200
I do when I'm sleepy.

1867
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,540
- Really?
- Yes.

1868
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,310
You'll become sleepy on our way back,
right?

1869
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,810
No?

1870
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,210
It'll be okay since you'll be there.

1871
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,810
Are you going to sleep in the car again?

1872
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,050
Why? Are you going to sing for me?

1873
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,790
Why are you good at talking
when it's just us?

1874
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,130
You talk well when there are two people.

1875
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,390
Ji Min said the same thing.

1876
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:14,960
- Really?
- Yes.

1877
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,360
- Yesterday?
- We asked if he had fun.

1878
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,670
- Hold on.
- He said he had a blast.

1879
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,540
They look soft.

1880
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,370
But the more you watch introverts,

1881
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,040
the more intense their flirtations are,
right?

1882
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,750
Would you like a photo
in front of the tree?

1883
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,650
- Really?
- But you don't want one, right?

1884
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,750
- I want one.
- You do?

1885
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,790
All good?

1886
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,390
- How pretty.
- Give me a second.

1887
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,590
(He finds an angle and takes a photo.)

1888
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,960
(A photo of Je Yeon by Woo Jae)

1889
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,800
Let me take one more with the phone.

1890
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,400
That's pretty.

1891
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,970
(Let's see.)

1892
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,340
It turned out really nice.

1893
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,970
- I'll send it to you.
- Okay.

1894
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,210
(It's Woo Jae's turn now.)

1895
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,110
(Finding the right angle)

1896
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,740
- You don't have to be perfect.
- Sorry?

1897
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,110
You don't have to be perfect.

1898
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,920
(A photo of Woo Jae by Je Yeon)

1899
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,820
Why does my phone have a really bad glare?

1900
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,220
(Woo Jae is gone due to the glare.)

1901
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,490
She's adorable.

1902
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,860
It's coming out really well.

1903
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,360
(Woo Jae has returned
taller than the tree.)

1904
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,660
You made me look really tall.

1905
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,230
I look much taller than the tree.

1906
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,500
Not bad, right?
I did a good job, didn't I?

1907
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,500
I did a really good job.

1908
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,110
It's warm.

1909
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,740
It really is warm.

1910
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,250
- You're hungry, right?
- I am.

1911
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,280
- Shall we get some meat today?
- Yes.

1912
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,290
- I'll cut them into pieces.
- Okay.

1913
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,160
Take some with your fork.

1914
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,490
(Munching)

1915
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,400
(Amazed)

1916
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,170
- It's really good.
- Is it?

1917
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,800
- Yesterday, Ji Min told me...
- Yes?

1918
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,340
that all four men gathered...

1919
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,470
and talked about their preferences.

1920
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,240
Apparently,
everyone had different preferences.

1921
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,650
I can't remember much.

1922
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:14,480
- Was I sleepy?
- Are you pretending like you can't?

1923
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,620
I'm serious.

1924
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,550
Were we talking about our ideal types?

1925
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,590
For example, if you prefer a cute style...

1926
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,620
and such.

1927
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,490
Something like that.

1928
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,500
I just heard that was the topic.

1929
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:31,130
- When four men gather,
- Yes?

1930
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,140
we self-reflect.

1931
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,040
Self-reflections? Really?

1932
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,740
We do reflect on ourselves.

1933
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,210
I did a lot last night.

1934
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,140
How come?

1935
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,650
A lot crossed my mind before bed.

1936
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,920
Anyway...

1937
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,220
It was tough yesterday, wasn't it?

1938
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,960
- Having to walk around alone.
- It was quite boring.

1939
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,160
What did you talk about yesterday?

1940
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:00,930
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

1941
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,400
Yesterday...

1942
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,230
(Hesitating)

1943
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,970
I'm not the only confused person, right?

1944
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,070
- Didn't you just use a dialect?
- Me?

1945
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,670
You get it, don't you?

1946
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,880
It's soft.

1947
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,650
I'll try.

1948
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:20,810
(The date with Ji Min
was full of laughter.)

1949
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:21,820
You'll try?

1950
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,320
(Thinking)

1951
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,120
(Staring)

1952
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,360
Either way,

1953
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,330
the only ones who have spent time...

1954
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,700
with you are me and Ji Min,

1955
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,960
- right?
- Yes.

1956
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,230
Both Ji Min and I felt that...

1957
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,400
(Curious)

1958
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,240
you talked well when it's just the two.

1959
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:51,380
We held quite a few conversations.

1960
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,180
And I heard you did too with Ji Min.

1961
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:59,250
Are you the type to get shy in a crowd?

1962
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,690
I think so.

1963
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,490
You don't like the attention, right?

1964
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,330
You find it hard to talk, don't you?

1965
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,830
She's so cute.

1966
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:28,480
Are you also calm when you date someone?

1967
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:31,020
- When I date someone?
- Yes.

1968
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,890
No. I'm less calm than I am now.

1969
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,130
Because you're more at ease?

1970
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,200
Yes, I'm more at ease
and closer to that person.

1971
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,400
Do you joke around and stuff?

1972
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,900
I like...

1973
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,500
- to experience new things.
- I see.

1974
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,340
I do various activities.

1975
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,310
What do you like to do?

1976
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,550
I like skating in the winter.

1977
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:03,080
- On the ice?
- Yes.

1978
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,150
Things like that.

1979
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,220
Ji Min said...

1980
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,930
we didn't talk...

1981
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,960
to each other much at first.

1982
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,200
We didn't talk for 20 minutes.

1983
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,530
Ji Min watched and waited to see how long
the silence between us would last.

1984
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,700
And we didn't talk for a while.

1985
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,310
There were no awkwardness or uneasiness.

1986
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,910
The silence felt peaceful.

1987
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,040
- Was it not awkward?
- No.

1988
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,610
I was told I'd be good at making ASMR.

1989
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,250
- Ji Min did?
- Ji Min told...

1990
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,050
- To you?
- me that.

1991
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,150
I bet you'll be good at it.

1992
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,750
- Whispering and such?
- Yes.

1993
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,660
ASMR.

1994
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,030
Some people might
find our energy quite tough.

1995
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,160
- Right?
- Yes.

1996
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,160
Even so...

1997
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,960
But I...

1998
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,770
find it most comfortable when you and I...

1999
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,400
are on the same energy level.

2000
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,840
It feels like we're on the same frequency.

2001
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,520
I felt it
ever since we had our first conversation.

2002
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,850
That we're quite alike.

2003
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:13,720
They must've had the same thought.

2004
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:19,230
(The two find each other similar.)

2005
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,960
(She's melting.)

2006
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,460
(His head is feeling numb.)

2007
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,860
I'm exploding with dopamine.

2008
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,770
- It spiked my blood pressure.
- It felt like watching...

2009
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,570
a youth movie just now.

2010
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,570
Why is there tension in this couple?

2011
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,240
I want them to get married.

2012
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,580
(Everyone is rooting for them.)

2013
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,950
The thoughts Woo Jae had last night
are playing a big role.

2014
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,920
It's a relief
that he's being honest about everything.

2015
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,220
That self-reflection last night
was a great choice.

2016
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,390
In a way, Ji Min's provocation...

2017
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:50,690
- helped Woo Jae out.
- I agree.

2018
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,030
I think so too.

2019
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,160
A stroke of luck.

2020
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,130
After seeing how bold Ji Min was,

2021
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,260
- Woo Jae found the route he should take.
- Right.

2022
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,770
"I should express my feelings like him."

2023
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,570
Totally.

2024
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:05,000
When introverts start to talk a lot,

2025
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,640
it's a big signal.

2026
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,880
When I begin to talk about myself,

2027
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,750
I think, "Why am I talking
so much in front of him?"

2028
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,380
"This is dangerous."

2029
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:17,220
I become aware of such a signal.

2030
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,020
(Fascinated)

2031
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:22,490
They laugh a lot,
and despite not talking as much,

2032
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:25,060
the few words they share
are unconventional.

2033
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,360
- Yes.
- They say things they normally wouldn't.

2034
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,930
- Totally.
- They have deep conversations.

2035
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:28,930
(It's a surprise.)

2036
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,960
An introvert's flirtation
is quite intense.

2037
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,100
What city is this?

2038
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:38,770
(The moment that makes you
forget about the cold weather)

2039
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,640
- How pretty.
- She's gotten prettier.

2040
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,280
(Moving up and down)

2041
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,680
(Who...)

2042
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,850
(will she go on a date with today?)

2043
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,420
(She patiently waits for her partner.)

2044
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,960
Hi.

2045
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,160
- Hi.
- What do I do?

2046
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:01,490
Did you know?

2047
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,200
Or...

2048
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,160
- Look at her smile.
- Was it by coincidence?

2049
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,100
- Did you know a bit?
- A bit.

2050
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,870
Thank you.

2051
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:13,140
- Are you cold?
- Yes, and I'm hungry.

2052
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,670
Right? You had a light breakfast.

2053
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,240
- Luckily, I found a restaurant.
- You did?

2054
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,350
Let's go and have a delicious lunch.

2055
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,320
How about some coffee too?

2056
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,520
- Siena?
- Is that Siena?

2057
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,220
This is interesting.
I wasn't sure if you'd come,

2058
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,190
- but you did.
- Aren't you disappointed?

2059
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,660
I was praying you'd come. I'm serious.

2060
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,930
- For real?
- Yes, I swear.

2061
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,430
(Known for gluten-free pizza, pasta,
and Ricciarelli cookies)

2062
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,500
Chang Hwan is cool too.

2063
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,960
Let's have a light meal and coffee.

2064
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,370
How about one of these?

2065
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,270
What's this?

2066
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,640
They have cafe latte.

2067
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,510
Yesterday,

2068
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:52,450
you said...

2069
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,420
you wanted to talk with many people.

2070
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,950
- But here I am again.
- No.

2071
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,090
- Aren't you disappointed?
- No.

2072
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,990
- No?
- Yesterday's conversation wasn't enough.

2073
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,960
(A perfect answer)

2074
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,090
I love it.

2075
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,260
As expected of our macho man.

2076
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,130
(Yesterday's conversation wasn't enough.)

2077
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,600
We should get to know each other more.

2078
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:21,140
And as you know,
we have more time from now on.

2079
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,240
But I'm really amazed. How...

2080
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,850
We opened the gifts...

2081
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,150
and chose one each.

2082
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,380
- You all agreed?
- Yes.

2083
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,050
This is the gift from you, right?

2084
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,220
I thought...

2085
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:37,420
you'd know right away.

2086
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,930
- That was one of the reasons.
- Are you sure?

2087
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:41,360
Yes, it was one of them.

2088
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,060
I thought you'd notice.

2089
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,070
I was kind of hoping you'd choose mine.

2090
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,970
- And I have a cat.
- Right.

2091
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,570
- The two tails are entangled.
- Oh, my.

2092
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,610
I only noticed that now.

2093
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:54,670
Isn't it adorable?

2094
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,610
You can totally tell...

2095
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,410
it's from me.

2096
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,580
Ji Won's smile is pretty.

2097
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:04,680
I'm sweating.

2098
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,660
This...

2099
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,990
I found this really cute.

2100
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:15,260
"Florence" written on it is pretty.

2101
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:18,160
And the drawings are what we'd seen.

2102
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:20,030
- The colors are beautiful.
- I agree.

2103
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:22,400
The red outline is also pretty.

2104
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,200
But the cup...

2105
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,440
- I love the colors.
- Right?

2106
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:28,710
It's camouflage.

2107
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,010
Thank you so much.

2108
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,850
I'll stop drinking Americano...

2109
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,420
and start drinking espresso.

2110
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:43,220
Thank you so much.

2111
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,590
I really love it.

2112
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,990
There's a particular face
that Ji Won makes when she's happy,

2113
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:47,990
like how she smiles.

2114
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,100
The foam looks delicious.

2115
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,870
I'm happy about the amount.

2116
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,910
- Let me take my jacket off.
- Go ahead.

2117
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,220
To look smart today,

2118
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,390
I wore glasses and a sweater.

2119
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:18,690
I looked like an athlete this morning.

2120
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:22,230
(This morning at the Pairing House)

2121
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:23,900
Did you sleep well?

2122
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,360
Aren't you cold?

2123
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,830
I exercised a ton outside.

2124
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,470
So you exercised.

2125
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,240
Did you have breakfast?

2126
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,840
I can't call it a breakfast,
but I had a light one...

2127
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,510
to get enough protein.

2128
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,340
- How do we eat this?
- Look at his arms.

2129
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,680
(He's like an athlete
from his arms to his outfit.)

2130
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:45,350
(An athlete in the morning
and a dandy guy in the evening)

2131
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,420
I was surprised to see you
in a sleeveless top.

2132
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:48,520
You see...

2133
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,290
I had no time to do my hair,

2134
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:53,360
had a hat on, and hadn't shaved.

2135
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,860
Not knowing what to do, I just sat down.

2136
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2137
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,570
- How is it?
- My body is melting.

2138
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,640
Is it warm?

2139
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:08,270
(Glancing)

2140
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,810
Your necklace is pretty.

2141
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,250
- Really?
- Yes.

2142
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,780
Thank you.

2143
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,650
- It suits her well.
- I agree.

2144
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,860
What's your dog's name?

2145
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,860
Take a guess. Or is it too hard?

2146
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,430
- Give me a hint.
- A hint?

2147
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,230
It's a name derived from my name.

2148
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,240
- Won?
- Won? No.

2149
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,170
Jiji?

2150
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,980
That's such a sad name. Jiji.

2151
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,780
Since my name is Ji Won,

2152
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,610
my dog's name is Ji Two.

2153
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:54,490
If you had a third dog, it'd be Ji Three.

2154
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,060
How cute.

2155
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,560
That's witty of you.

2156
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,330
(Ji Won's number 1 treasure, Ji Two)

2157
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,790
Because she's Ji Won.

2158
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,400
- It's beyond my imagination.
- Really?

2159
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,230
(Introducing her precious family
to Chang Hwan)

2160
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,430
- What's your dog's name?
- Seol.

2161
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,340
Right. I remember you telling me.

2162
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,940
My cat's name is Byeol.

2163
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,870
- Seol and Byeol.
- Seol.

2164
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:15,710
The names are so pretty.

2165
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,910
(They chat until the sun sets.)

2166
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:20,680
The lights are beautiful.

2167
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,520
I went with rock because men equal rock.

2168
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,950
I kept putting out rock.

2169
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:26,650
I won.
So I told them I wanted to go to Siena.

2170
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,220
- This is so beautiful.
- So beautiful, right?

2171
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,360
Right.

2172
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:31,760
- This side looks beautiful too.
- It's so beautiful.

2173
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:32,860
Take a picture of this.

2174
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:35,230
- Do you want one of my gloves?
- My gosh.

2175
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,330
This is so cute.

2176
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,530
I don't think it will fit your hand.

2177
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,100
It doesn't.

2178
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,800
- But let me put this on.
- Okay.

2179
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,840
But my hand feels warm
as I put on a glove just now.

2180
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:48,910
This is cute.
It's like my fingers are wearing a hat.

2181
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,080
(Gradually getting into it)

2182
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,910
They're a couple now.

2183
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:54,980
(Look at this couple.)

2184
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,420
It's so tiny and cute.

2185
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,790
Right. Surprisingly,
I couldn't go to places like that.

2186
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:03,790
Oh, no.

2187
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,920
One more time?

2188
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,430
(They talk about trivial things
in their lives.)

2189
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:07,660
What were you going to say?

2190
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,460
When do you usually have dinner?

2191
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,460
(They also stop by a store.)

2192
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:14,770
Thank you.

2193
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,300
What a nice view.

2194
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,670
(What a nice view.)

2195
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:20,170
This looks so picturesque.

2196
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:23,080
- It is indeed picturesque.
- My gosh.

2197
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,250
- I love it.
- Yes.

2198
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,310
(Then a place grabs their eyes.)

2199
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,520
This place is so beautiful.

2200
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:32,490
It's giving me goosebumps.

2201
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,320
(Surprised)

2202
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,820
- There's a Christmas tree.
- We ought to check that out.

2203
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,330
They look great together
since they're both tall.

2204
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,870
I love this quiet atmosphere here.

2205
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,670
- How about a photo in front of the tree?
- Sounds good.

2206
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,670
Will it come out nicely?

2207
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,970
I looked at the photos you took yesterday.

2208
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:54,340
You took really nice photos of me.

2209
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,280
I thought that there must be
at least one good photo among many.

2210
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,780
- You were like a professional.
- That's what I was hoping for.

2211
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,480
This way?
Or should we go that way to make a turn?

2212
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,520
- The back side looks beautiful.
- Sounds good.

2213
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,650
(He takes a photo of Ji Won from the back
instead of the tree.)

2214
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,790
They look great together.

2215
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:07,790
- Yes.
- Right.

2216
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,120
I'm taking a photo of you
taking a photo of the tree.

2217
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:13,490
(A photo I took of Ji Won
who's taking a photo of the tree)

2218
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:14,530
This is cute.

2219
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,260
I'll send them to you later.

2220
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:20,130
(Looking around)

2221
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,140
Is it open?

2222
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,910
(A 12th-century Gothic palace
with a cozy mood known for local dishes)

2223
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:27,610
- Should we order lasagna?
- Yes, the lasagna.

2224
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:29,640
(A 12th-century Gothic palace
with a cozy mood known for local dishes)

2225
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,440
- Let's drop the honorifics.
- Oh, right.

2226
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,450
Yes.

2227
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,720
Shall we drop the honorifics?

2228
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,980
Of course, I'm sure...

2229
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,250
that I'm older than you.

2230
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,560
Shall we?

2231
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,220
So we can get close quickly.

2232
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:47,360
- He's a charming guy.
- My gosh.

2233
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,390
Then...

2234
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:52,700
is there a specific reason
you want to get married?

2235
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,100
I wanted to get married
for an unexpected reason.

2236
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,700
- As you know, I have Seol and Byeol.
- Yes.

2237
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,870
- I adopted them.
- Yes.

2238
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:01,870
But...

2239
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:05,640
- as I told you, Byeol was abandoned.
- Yes.

2240
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,310
- Byeol was quite sick.
- I see.

2241
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,580
I found Byeol in a parking lot.

2242
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,990
Byeol must have drunk only stagnant water
that it had a serious case of diarrhea.

2243
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,220
Byeol was on the verge of death.

2244
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,790
I got Byeol admitted
into an animal hospital.

2245
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:21,830
- This tiny cat had to get the IV drip.
- I see.

2246
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:25,160
I did my best
because I wanted to save this cat.

2247
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,870
Luckily, Byeol is so energetic now.

2248
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,600
- Byeol is all over the place now.
- And gnawing on a rib.

2249
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,310
It took a rib
that was bigger than itself...

2250
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,540
and enjoyed it.

2251
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,980
This sick cat became
so healthy and beautiful.

2252
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,580
When I saw that transformation,

2253
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,580
I experienced a new type of joy.
Something I never felt before.

2254
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,690
I see.

2255
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:48,950
- Not the same as the joy from a career?
- No.

2256
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:52,260
I know how that feels
since I have dogs too.

2257
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,660
- I mean, they're like my babies.
- Yes.

2258
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,630
- I didn't give birth to them.
- Right.

2259
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,700
- But they're still our babies.
- Yes.

2260
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,230
That's how it feels.

2261
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,440
When my dogs are sick,
it feels like I'm sick.

2262
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:09,240
There are things I wouldn't buy for myself
because of the price.

2263
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,480
Love isn't some grand thing.
I think that's love, to be honest.

2264
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,050
- That's love. What else could be love?
- Right.

2265
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:15,780
- My dogs...
- It's like...

2266
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,050
you prioritize
your loved one's needs over yours.

2267
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:21,120
- Yes.
- That's how you show love. That's it.

2268
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:25,360
- Having my own family and children...
- I see.

2269
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,630
would give me a completely different life.

2270
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:32,630
There might be moments I feel happy
in the most unimaginable way.

2271
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,770
- I see.
- I see.

2272
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,870
It feels like
having that kind of moment...

2273
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:40,470
might start my Act Two in life.
That suddenly crossed my mind.

2274
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,640
That shows his thoughts on marriage.

2275
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,540
It's the most meaningful conversation
we saw today.

2276
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,180
(A meaningful conversation that shows
a glimpse of his thoughts on marriage)

2277
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:51,380
(The meaning of being together
with someone for the rest of your life)

2278
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,420
Do you think it will be fun
when we go back to Korea?

2279
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,860
Or are there things that worry you?

2280
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,260
Things have to be revealed.

2281
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,530
(Ji Won's job hasn't been revealed yet.)

2282
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:01,430
(What is her job?)

2283
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,600
She must work for a company.

2284
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:09,500
Hello. I'm working at the DS Division
of Samsung Electronics.

2285
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,670
I'm a semiconductor engineer.

2286
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,110
I'm 26 years old. My name is Moon Ji Won.

2287
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:15,770
- What?
- Samsung Electronics?

2288
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,280
(Which company?)

2289
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,580
Ever since I was a child,
I liked math and science.

2290
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,250
My interests were quite clear since then.

2291
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,780
She's what we call the Engineering Queen.

2292
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,750
I bet she was the prettiest one there.

2293
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:30,260
I'm satisfied with my career now.

2294
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:33,860
Semiconductors are manufactured
at the nanoscale.

2295
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,660
My job is to minimize defects...

2296
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:39,400
and ensure that the machines run smoothly.

2297
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,330
That's what semiconductor engineers do.

2298
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,840
That's unexpected.

2299
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,040
She didn't have the vibe
of an engineer at all. Right?

2300
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,740
- That's a big surprise.
- Right.

2301
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,340
Hold on. They're from the same company.

2302
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,210
Did she know about Ji Min?

2303
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,680
They work at different places.

2304
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,020
He works in the Strategy Development Team,
and she's a semiconductor engineer.

2305
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,050
Yes.

2306
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:59,080
Once their jobs are revealed,

2307
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,690
- things might get chaotic.
- Right. I bet.

2308
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:01,890
- Right.
- Yes.

2309
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,720
That's when the real game begins.

2310
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,930
Are there places you want to visit
in Korea?

2311
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,100
Or dates you want to go on?

2312
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:14,470
First of all, I want to eat tripe.

2313
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,470
My gosh.

2314
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,900
I want to eat dishes
like tripe and pork belly.

2315
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,640
I want that to be our first meal
as soon as we get back.

2316
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:25,080
(They gently reveal their preferences.)

2317
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:26,980
- They're comfortable around each other.
- Yes.

2318
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:29,450
Chang Hwan is becoming more
and more charming as the show continues.

2319
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:30,520
He keeps getting charming.

2320
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,420
Today,
Chang Hwan had this big brother vibe.

2321
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,420
- Right.
- I see.

2322
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:35,250
- He had a big brother vibe.
- He took good care of Ji Won.

2323
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,390
They shared gloves together.

2324
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:39,930
- They had separate covers for fingers.
- Right.

2325
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,860
He opened the door
and carried her umbrella.

2326
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:43,500
That was so heartwarming to watch.

2327
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,030
I was quite shocked
by his sleeveless shirt in the morning.

2328
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,770
- So that...
- It was even Christmas season.

2329
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Picture yourself living with him
after getting married.

2330
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,640
Mornings would be fun with him.

2331
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:54,410
Every day of your life might be fun.
So that's a huge plus.

2332
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:57,680
It seems to me that
Chang Hwan has a long-term perspective.

2333
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,210
He asked Ji Won about her thoughts...

2334
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:00,510
- Yes.
- on marriage and so on.

2335
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:01,980
- He's quite serious.
- Yes.

2336
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,920
And Ji Won is marriage material too.

2337
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,690
- She works at Samsung Electronics.
- Right.

2338
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,720
And she's a semiconductor engineer.

2339
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,720
- A semiconductor engineer.
- A semiconductor engineer.
- You know?
- She's a core employee.

2340
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:13,360
Personally, I want them to
set the date for their wedding quickly.

2341
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:15,860
(Returning to the house after their dates)

2342
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:17,730
I bet they'll be surprised.

2343
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,530
- Are we the first ones to come back?
- Yes?

2344
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,530
I think so.
There were no cars in the parking lot.

2345
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,470
- You should go in first.
- Okay.

2346
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,910
What? Is someone here?

2347
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,580
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

2348
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,850
We got back pretty early.

2349
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,450
It's cold.

2350
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:35,880
- Is it just the two of you?
- Yes.

2351
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,680
Sorry. We dropped the honorifics.

2352
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,080
Right. We decided to drop the honorifics.

2353
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:41,050
We all decided to do that.

2354
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,460
We're not even using any honorifics
for our names either.

2355
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,490
I see.

2356
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,790
- Water.
- I'm good at making ramyeon.

2357
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,830
- Really?
- Yes.

2358
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,360
Should we stir them?

2359
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,030
(Getting the chills)

2360
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,470
(She puts her hand warmer
on the back of Ji Min's neck.)

2361
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:01,910
- What's this?
- I need kelp and the seasoning packet.

2362
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:03,380
Look at Chan Hyeong.

2363
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,610
(They're in the same space,)

2364
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,350
(but spend their time differently.)

2365
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:09,750
(Chae Eun and Chan Hyeong
head to the Sunset Room.)

2366
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:13,420
How could they have ramyeon right now?

2367
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,060
But I'm curious now.

2368
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,220
How they didn't end up having a meal.

2369
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:20,230
No. I'm sure they had a meal. No way.

2370
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,560
No way.

2371
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,830
It's so late now.

2372
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,370
What did they do if they didn't eat?

2373
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,470
That's an interesting facial expression.

2374
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,640
They make an interesting pair, don't they?

2375
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,670
- Right.
- Yes.

2376
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:35,770
- No, you keep it.
- No. You take it.

2377
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,910
It's cold inside.
The windows are closed, right?

2378
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,880
(Putting it in)

2379
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,250
Having this would warm up
our body for sure.

2380
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,120
- Right. That's what I'm hoping for.
- Yes.

2381
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,130
This definitely washes away the cold.

2382
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,360
Yes.

2383
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,300
- We really needed this.
- Yes.

2384
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,440
It's a pity that we have to go back now.

2385
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,640
- I'm really glad we have a month.
- Why?

2386
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,610
If it were over in 1 or 2 weeks,

2387
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,610
- nothing would have come of it.
- Right.

2388
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,180
Wait. What he just said...

2389
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,050
- Yes. There's a possibility, right?
- That's... Yes.

2390
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,520
That's a loaded comment.

2391
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,650
Do you believe in love at first sight?

2392
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,750
- Yes.
- I see.

2393
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,220
I do believe that people...

2394
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:27,260
fall in love at first sight.

2395
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:29,460
I mean, it's rare.

2396
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,170
You could be curious about someone...

2397
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:35,470
at first sight.

2398
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,680
My cold is gone.

2399
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,440
- It is?
- Yes.

2400
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:48,250
Let's resume our date. Let's go.

2401
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,260
You can drink a lot.

2402
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,120
That's why...

2403
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,220
Did you guys have fun?

2404
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,530
- Hey.
- Where did you go?

2405
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,560
- Where did you go?
- We had ramyeon.

2406
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,100
- We were in Florence.
- I didn't mean now.

2407
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,900
- We had ramyeon.
- We just had ramyeon.

2408
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:09,540
- I wonder how Chan Hyeong feels now.
- We had ramyeon.

2409
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,240
It was cold today.
So we went to a nice restaurant.

2410
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,510
- Was it Alberto?
- Do you know Alberto?

2411
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,280
- The Italian guy?
- Yes.

2412
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,940
- We went to his restaurant.
- My gosh.

2413
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:20,980
There were so many Korean people.

2414
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,580
- That's fascinating.
- But...

2415
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:26,220
- you didn't need a reservation?
- No.

2416
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:28,490
- We didn't take a single photo.
- We didn't?

2417
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:30,220
- No, we didn't.
- I took a picture of that.

2418
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,590
- Of what?
- The tiramisu.

2419
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:34,290
(Giggling)

2420
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,560
We went to such a nice restaurant.

2421
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,230
- He sensed an unusual vibe between them.
- Yes.

2422
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,800
Was it a high-end restaurant?

2423
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,340
I wouldn't say
it was a high-end restaurant.

2424
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,210
The ambiance was really nice.

2425
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,440
Oh, right. We should tell them.

2426
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,380
We should tell them. You know...

2427
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,950
She's completely leaning into him.

2428
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,550
You know the bridge?

2429
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,920
The bridge we were on for some time?

2430
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,560
- Yes. I was standing slightly away...
- The bridge?

2431
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,560
from the bridge.

2432
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,860
As soon as Ji Min saw me...

2433
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:09,230
(Chuckling)

2434
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,360
What?

2435
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,900
- We're back here again.
- It's you.

2436
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,130
I already feel so comfortable now.

2437
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,540
What?

2438
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,240
I'm just so flustered.

2439
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,010
I must feel at ease now. Sorry.

2440
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,470
That's what he said to me.

2441
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,280
- He's faking his smile.
- I was really surprised.

2442
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,550
- I had no idea it would be her.
- Right.

2443
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,180
This crossed my mind.
I mean, I prepared myself too.

2444
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,620
Like how I should react...

2445
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,720
- when I see my date.
- How to react.

2446
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,760
But all of a sudden,

2447
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,120
- I blurted out what was on my mind.
- Really?

2448
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,390
- I was so surprised.
- That's funny.

2449
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,060
He said, "I almost put my hand
around you like a good friend."

2450
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:47,470
I thought...

2451
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:50,500
we were turning into siblings.

2452
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,300
(Flinching)

2453
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:54,110
But I was wrong.

2454
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:55,970
- "I was wrong."
- That's funny.

2455
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,440
So today was interesting.

2456
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,610
Chan Hyeong must be feeling
all kinds of things right now.

2457
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,780
Great.

2458
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,720
Before we came back, we had coffee.

2459
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,750
Someone was playing the guitar there.

2460
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:10,220
- I see.
- He was busking there.

2461
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,220
That was really nice.

2462
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:12,760
Didn't it rain?

2463
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,230
- Why...
- It was more romantic that way.

2464
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:15,290
- It was great.
- Once...

2465
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:19,030
- we finished our meal, it stopped.
- Yes, right.

2466
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:21,000
I see. That's a relief.

2467
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:23,700
We were cold,
so we ordered vegetable soup.

2468
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,700
We thought it would be tiny.

2469
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,240
But it was served in a big bowl.

2470
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,640
We each ordered one.

2471
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,440
- They served us two big bowls.
- It was too big.

2472
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,210
- I bet you couldn't finish it.
- Right.

2473
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:35,750
- It's so obvious that she loved the date.
- I knew something was off.

2474
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,480
His gaze seems so cold.

2475
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:40,650
But you had a healthy meal.
A vegetable soup.

2476
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,990
- I've never seen that look on him.
- I was okay until then.

2477
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:45,260
(Responding)

2478
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,860
I was fine at the restaurant.

2479
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:48,130
- But when I left...
- I see.

2480
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,460
We went to Florence four days in a row.

2481
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,860
So I liked that.

2482
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,600
It was cold.

2483
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:56,940
Chae Eun sensed the mood too.

2484
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,440
- She felt something was off.
- Right.

2485
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,540
And you didn't bundle up today.

2486
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:01,770
- Me?
- Yes.

2487
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:02,870
Right.

2488
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:08,250
I think we celebrated Christmas
a bit too soon.

2489
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,480
Right. It was like...

2490
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,780
- the end of December.
- Yes.

2491
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,450
It was beautiful.

2492
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,290
- Which place?
- The cafe with the terrace.

2493
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:19,890
That's great.

2494
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,860
That look on his face... My gosh.

2495
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,870
I wonder what he's thinking now.

2496
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:28,970
(The mood has changed after a day.)

2497
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,740
(Bothered)

2498
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,370
I think she picked up on the mood.

2499
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:38,110
She figured it out. She sensed it.

2500
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:39,540
- My gosh.
- Chae Eun felt it.

2501
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:41,780
(Woo Jae and Je Yeon return
after their date too.)

2502
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:43,950
Gosh, an important couple is coming in.

2503
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,420
I guess everyone is upstairs.

2504
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,150
- They must be in their rooms.
- Yes.

2505
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,220
I want to go back there.

2506
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,930
I want a do-over.

2507
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:57,560
Your last date?

2508
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,830
Not just that.

2509
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:00,130
- I had fun.
- Yes.

2510
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:01,730
- It was really fun.
- Our time...

2511
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,170
- in Italy is over now.
- Yes.

2512
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,640
(Sighing)

2513
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,040
(Having complicated feelings)

2514
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:14,250
I think Ji Min and Ha Neul are upstairs.

2515
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,680
- On the third floor?
- Do you want to come with me?

2516
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,750
(Nodding)

2517
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,780
Let's tell them our story.

2518
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,620
- But he couldn't remember it.
- I see.

2519
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:23,620
(Nudging)

2520
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:28,460
You know what he said?
I did this with my hair for a second.

2521
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:31,030
He said,
"You look great with your hair up."

2522
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:32,830
I said, "I had my hair up yesterday."

2523
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,770
- He said, "You did?"
- Oh, no.

2524
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:36,570
(Thinking)

2525
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,570
Seriously.

2526
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:40,610
She scolded me a lot.

2527
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:42,940
(Closing his eyes)

2528
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,680
- Let's check Ji Min's reaction now.
- My gosh.

2529
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,610
- Hello.
- You drove, right?

2530
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:53,350
- Was your drive back here okay?
- My gosh.

2531
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:54,950
- Oh, no.
- How many minutes did it take you?

2532
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,150
About 50 minutes or so.

2533
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,360
- It was so dark.
- It was no joke.

2534
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,830
It was very foggy.

2535
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:01,130
- It was really foggy.
- Right.

2536
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,730
- Was it cold there?
- No.
- What?
- He did it.

2537
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:04,730
- It was cold there too.
- Why?

2538
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:06,160
- It was cold here too?
- Yes.

2539
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,170
How was it? What did you do?

2540
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:10,100
We...

2541
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,640
- went to a cafe.
- This is crazy.

2542
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,770
- But... Yes.
- We also saw the Christmas tree.

2543
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,880
The tree? I see.

2544
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,210
- The village was nestled in the north.
- What's Ji Min doing right now?

2545
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,250
It was a rural village,
but it was so tiny and cute.

2546
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:22,850
But...

2547
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:26,320
the weather wasn't so good.

2548
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,250
- There were Christmas decorations.
- He can't accept that they were together.

2549
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:32,390
- Right.
- So we checked them out.

2550
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,360
- Cute decorations?
- Yes, cute decorations.

2551
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,830
- Ha Neul can sense it too.
- So...

2552
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:39,230
Woo Jae, why did your voice get so quiet?

2553
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:41,130
- My voice?
- Yes.

2554
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,430
I can't hear you.

2555
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:43,640
- I'll speak up.
- I can't hear him.

2556
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:48,240
- Was it a hard day for you?
- I see.

2557
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:51,280
- I was matching the volume of her voice.
- I see. That's why.

2558
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,780
(Bothered)

2559
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:54,680
- Right?
- Yes.

2560
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:56,350
- I was matching her voice.
- He matched her voice.

2561
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:00,250
You guys didn't drop the honorifics?

2562
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:01,890
We forgot.

2563
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:04,460
We forgot that we decided to do that.
We kept it as usual.

2564
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,320
We were the only ones
who were so friendly.

2565
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,630
Did you guys drop
the honorifics completely?

2566
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:10,630
- Did you?
- We called each other by name too.

2567
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,830
Really?

2568
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,230
(Glancing)

2569
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,030
- You do whatever feels comfortable.
- Yes.

2570
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,570
We did that toward the end.

2571
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,710
Who knows what it will be like
when we meet next week?

2572
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:22,910
We might go back to using honorifics.

2573
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:25,210
- "Hello, Mr. Ji Min." Like this?
- Right.

2574
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:26,650
"Have you been well?"

2575
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,450
- Things might go back in a day.
- Right.

2576
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,250
What did you get as your present?

2577
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:35,790
I got a painting.

2578
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:37,520
- A painting?
- Did she draw it?

2579
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:39,930
She bought a finished painting.

2580
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:41,930
- In a frame?
- It was framed.

2581
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:43,700
- It had all the famous places...
- The streets?

2582
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:44,760
of Florence.

2583
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:48,870
- What?
- Why did you follow me?

2584
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,600
I was here first.

2585
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,410
- Right.
- Yes.

2586
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:56,910
(They picked their presents
at the same shop.)

2587
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,320
The painting with all the famous places...

2588
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
- in Florence.
- Something like that?

2589
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:14,190
- Wasn't it cold?
- It was cold.

2590
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,230
- It was cold.
- Did it rain?

2591
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:20,200
- It rained a little.
- Really? It kept raining for us.

2592
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,330
- Did it keep raining?
- It kept raining.

2593
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,800
- Did you have to carry the umbrella?
- Yes.

2594
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,970
- That must've been tiring.
- It wasn't so bad.

2595
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,840
You know...

2596
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,650
the first memory...

2597
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,950
is always intense.

2598
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,820
The first day...

2599
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:43,490
I arrived at the house...

2600
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:45,660
(First day)

2601
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,090
You were sitting on the chair.

2602
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:54,900
(The first time they met)

2603
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,500
I still remember the look on your face.

2604
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,240
There was a window behind you.

2605
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,910
The sun was shining on you.

2606
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:06,950
It was a memorable moment.

2607
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:11,120
One of the memorable moments was...

2608
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,250
when you were sitting on the chair.

2609
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,250
You were sitting on the chair
when I walked in.

2610
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:17,790
(Smiling)

2611
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,060
We had dinner for a long time.

2612
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,960
- The look on her face.
- We had dinner for a long time too.

2613
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,100
- What did you have?
- We...

2614
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:26,930
We...

2615
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,340
- Gosh.
- We ordered three dishes.

2616
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,800
We had meat again.

2617
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:36,370
That place was decorated for Christmas.

2618
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:38,940
That place itself was basically Christmas.

2619
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,480
When we got there, it was...

2620
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,580
What was that?

2621
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:46,850
- Something wrong?
- I'm ill.

2622
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:48,050
Poor Ji Min.

2623
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:50,420
I think I did everything I had to do
in Italy.

2624
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,690
I did everything I could in Italy.

2625
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,360
Your face got scratched.

2626
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:57,960
- What?
- Your face is scratched.

2627
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:00,830
- Why?
- It's scratched.

2628
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:03,100
She's enthusiastic.

2629
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,240
It must be the blood stain.

2630
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,810
It's not. Do you have a fever?

2631
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:08,440
- I think so.
- That's crazy.

2632
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:11,110
What did you do today?

2633
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,280
We went to Florence.

2634
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,950
It was cold,

2635
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:17,250
so we found a nice and warm restaurant.

2636
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,190
Today,

2637
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:22,150
Florence felt different.

2638
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:24,890
Was it the rain?

2639
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:27,560
That too,
but the whole atmosphere in general.

2640
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,560
My goodness.

2641
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,000
She loves gelato.

2642
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,070
So even though it was cold,

2643
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:37,400
we still went there.
When she saw it, she was like,

2644
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:39,840
"This is the best gelato place."

2645
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,040
That's what she said.

2646
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,240
We had to have it. What else? It was good.

2647
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:46,510
I live and die for gelato,
no matter how cold it is.

2648
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:49,250
- Did you just come up with it?
- I've never heard that before.

2649
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,250
Yes.

2650
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:52,220
You must love gelato.

2651
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,890
That's cute. "Live and die for gelato."

2652
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:55,150
That's cute.

2653
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,020
Can you say, "Iced Americano?"

2654
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,320
(Glaring)

2655
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,360
People from Busan can't say Americano.

2656
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,100
- Do it.
- No.

2657
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,260
I don't say it like that.

2658
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,830
- So do it.
- What?

2659
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:09,130
Can you say, "Americano?"

2660
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:10,440
How do you say donuts?

2661
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,500
- Right?
- He's touching her shoulder.

2662
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,640
(Rubbing)

2663
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,440
- Don't force her.
- Only old people say that.

2664
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,540
Don't force her.

2665
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,750
Sorry.

2666
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:23,880
When he touched her shoulder,

2667
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,350
the look on Ji Min's face...

2668
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:27,850
Some of you probably know
how donuts are pronounced.

2669
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:32,120
But, I...

2670
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:34,830
(Dizzy)

2671
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:37,700
You can't really tell...

2672
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,170
that I'm from Busan...

2673
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:42,730
when I speak,

2674
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,770
but I can't hide it when I say Americano.

2675
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,470
That's not the only one.

2676
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,340
Right.

2677
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,880
So I asked if you were from Busan
on the first day.

2678
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,250
Right.

2679
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:58,350
That's what makes you charming.

2680
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:01,220
Well...

2681
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:03,590
If you...

2682
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,620
- emphasize it...
- Did I take it too far?

2683
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,190
- That was too...
- It makes you just charming enough.

2684
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:12,730
Anyway...

2685
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:15,870
Didn't you say you took a lot of pictures?

2686
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:21,370
We kept taking pictures to remember.

2687
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:24,410
Nice.

2688
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:28,880
What now?

2689
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:32,580
When I first met Je Yeon there,

2690
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:35,290
I approached her from the back.

2691
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,590
- We...
- We met in the alley.

2692
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:39,920
- I came out from an alley.
- Was it a nice alley?

2693
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,390
- It was a nice alley.
- Yes.

2694
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,230
Because the city is already beautiful.

2695
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:47,570
She was surprised to see me. So I was...

2696
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:50,970
- Can I tell them?
- How surprised was she?

2697
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,370
I thought she was surprised to see me.

2698
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,040
But she was rather surprised
to see me on the right...

2699
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,140
when she expected me
to come from the left.

2700
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,510
- This is suffocating.
- That's hilarious.

2701
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:05,850
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won arrive.
The eight of them are all here.)

2702
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:08,220
Hello. Hi.

2703
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,690
Finally.

2704
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:11,920
It's a shame that we have to leave.

2705
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,060
(Write a postcard to the person
who made your heart flutter the most.)

2706
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,130
(Put the postcard in the music box
and close it.)

2707
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:15,190
It's a postcard.

2708
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:18,160
It's quite difficult today.

2709
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,230
It's for the one who made their heart
flutter the most.

2710
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:39,680
(The awkward first meeting)

2711
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:45,690
(Their emotions slowly grew.)

2712
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:52,400
(They were fluttered
and kept a distance repeatedly.)

2713
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:56,300
(With whom...)

2714
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:02,370
(did your heart pair up?)

2715
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:09,110
Let's see the result
of the postcard pairing.

2716
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,080
(What?)

2717
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,950
Wait. It won't be revealed?

2718
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:14,820
- But...
- Do we have to wait until next week?

2719
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:17,990
What... Are you kidding me?

2720
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:22,230
- Their postcards and the music boxes...
- But...

2721
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:24,560
will be revealed...

2722
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:28,200
after the residents return to Seoul...

2723
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,870
- and go back to their lives.
- That's cruel.

2724
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,170
This postcard pairing...

2725
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:36,070
might cause a crisis in Seoul.

2726
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:38,140
- Exactly.
- It's going to be crazy.

2727
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,110
They'll be like,
"Why did you send it to her?"

2728
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,510
- That might come up.
- Right.

2729
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:43,720
- My gosh. That's so scary.
- That is...

2730
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,850
If any of them get married...

2731
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:46,880
Oh, no.

2732
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,850
"You liked that person at first."

2733
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,120
- Yes...
- As they watch it together.

2734
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,690
"I saw that look on your face."

2735
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:55,560
It's going to be crazy in Seoul.

2736
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,760
Will there be any changes...

2737
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,600
in the residents' hearts...

2738
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:03,200
who left the romantic Tuscany
for their lives in Seoul?

2739
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:06,200
Let's meet at 10:50 p.m.
on Friday next week.

2740
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:07,770
- Bye.
- Bye.

2741
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:09,540
(Good night.)

2742
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,150
(The surreal times are over.)

2743
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,620
(They returned to their lives.)

2744
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:23,790
(You'll meet your first pair today.)

2745
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,990
(The fateful first pairing)

2746
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:29,860
It's amazing that we chose each other.

2747
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:32,060
(A new story will begin...)

2748
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,100
(in a new, yet familiar place.)

2749
01:55:35,230 --> 01:55:36,530
(Hello.)

2750
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:39,270
(This is really pretty.)

2751
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,970
(A place to continue their emotions
from Italy)

2752
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,580
(The emotions that began without a clue)

2753
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:48,010
(Will they continue here?)

2754
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:50,110
I'm looking forward
to the next three weeks.

2755
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:51,450
I have a feeling it's going to be fun.

2756
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:53,580
I'm an attorney.

2757
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:55,890
- No way.
- What?

2758
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:57,420
Is she a genius?

2759
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,060
I'm quite old.

2760
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,530
I had a mental breakdown at that moment.

2761
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,560
I'm...

2762
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:06,760
The gap is too big.

2763
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:09,970
He's not going to talk to me again.

2764
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:15,640
Do you want to leave together tomorrow?
