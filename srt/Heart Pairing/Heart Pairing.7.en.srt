1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,270
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,440
(Text announcing
the contract relationship)

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,340
- What's this?
- What is this saying?

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,570
What does this mean?

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,670
Do you think this makes sense?

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,010
A contract relationship?

7
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,980
(Decide on 2 candidates
for a contract relationship by tomorrow.)

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,410
The idea...

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,550
(Think about it for 24 hours from now.)

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,320
Are we going to spend Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday together?

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,290
(The one to spend
the most important 3 days together)

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,190
Well, then...

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,690
(Needless to be considerate...)

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,830
(or pay attention to others.)

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,270
(The two of them
get into a special relationship.)

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,170
But Woo Jae,
even in a contract relationship,

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,470
can you hold hands with your partner?

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,470
- In a contract relationship?
- Yes.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,210
When you're dating someone,

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,510
- it feels so natural to hold hands.
- That's right.

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,850
Holding hands feels so natural.

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,250
(How much can they get close?)

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,020
But in a contract relationship,

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,450
do you think you can
hold your partner's hand?

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,190
(Embarrassed)

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,360
(Would it be possible...)

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,830
(to have a contract relationship
for 3 days?)

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,130
It means we can't go to sleep tonight.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,160
We need to keep thinking about it.

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,070
(Before the contract relationship begins,
24 hours of agony and twists)

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,510
(Woo Jae's heart)

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,480
I thought I didn't have
a deep conversation...

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,580
with Je Yeon.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,550
I haven't had...

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
a deep conversation...

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,220
with Je Yeon yet.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,520
I guess she needs more time to get close.

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,850
Maybe it's because
I couldn't converse with her...

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,860
about her occupation and all.

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,760
And that blocked...

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,230
our conversation...

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,400
from getting deeper.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,500
Jjamppong.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,970
- Jjamppong?
- A contract relationship is different.

45
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,100
It will be nice to do it with Je Yeon.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,940
I wanted to tease you.

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,270
About Ji Won,

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,840
I feel curious about her,

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,610
but I feel she's not interested in me.

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,050
For a person like that,

51
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,980
if I approach too actively,

52
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,780
she might feel uncomfortable.
I thought so from Italy.

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,420
Considering my feelings only...

54
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,860
- Can I hold here?
- Look here.

55
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,790
I had more feelings for Je Yeon.

56
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,800
(Someone you have more feelings for
versus someone you want to get closer to)

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,700
(If there is a priority,)

58
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,000
(who will Woo Jae choose?)

59
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,010
- Section Seven is separated.
- I see.

60
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,940
(Ji Won's worry)

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,110
I thought Chang Hwan...

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,350
was in his mid-30s, maximum.

63
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,390
So I thought Chang Hwan...

64
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,860
might feel uncomfortable.

65
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,160
That was what came to my mind first.

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,990
I worried inside...

67
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,700
that he might feel uncomfortable about me.

68
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,730
I forgot. I need to return his scarf.

69
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,970
- Wait a minute. Sorry.
- It's okay.

70
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,340
(She returns his scarf.)

71
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
Do you go to work tomorrow?

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,470
(Chang Hwan gave it.)

73
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,510
- Don't you have a suitcase?
- Thank you.

74
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,240
(She brought it to work.)

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,380
(Would Chang Hwan receive it?)

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,480
- Here it is.
- You can keep it.

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,950
- Thank you so much.
- You can have it.

78
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,980
Aren't you going to need it?

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,450
What's going on here? It looks romantic.

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,260
- It's because I have other scarves too.
- I see.

81
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,960
- Thank you.
- It's nice, isn't it?

82
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,990
- It is.
- It's good.

83
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,100
(Chang Hwan still cared for Ji Won.)

84
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,100
(However, he didn't text her anymore.)

85
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,970
To be honest,

86
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,900
I was troubled.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,470
Well...

88
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,310
I made a lot of good memories
dating Chang Hwan.

89
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,550
It's not like I can say...

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,250
everything's fine.

91
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,220
I can do my best, you know,

92
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,390
to take care of myself.

93
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not so simple as that.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,430
(That night,
Chang Hwan couldn't go to sleep easily.)

95
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,170
I thought I should step back first.

96
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,540
- Ji Won and you...
- Then...

97
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,940
(Something that doesn't happen
as he wants)

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,740
What's going on between you two?

99
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,050
Hi.

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,050
Hello.

101
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,450
As much as the feelings I had for her,

102
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,120
I was...

103
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,790
- Go and get changed.
- Okay.

104
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,860
Shall I say I was hurt?

105
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
So I hated what was happening.

106
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,470
They have similar vibes.

107
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,300
Both of them are tall, you know.

108
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,070
I felt very disappointed.

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,340
(Ha Neul went outside
to go to a convenience store.)

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,680
I made a suggestion the day before,

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
but he rejected it.

112
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,980
"I want you to reach out your hand."

113
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,690
That was what I wanted.

114
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,450
Move over.

115
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,720
I don't want to.

116
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,690
Seeing him taking care of Je Yeon at home,

117
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,100
I wondered if that showed
he had no feelings for me at all.

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,400
I had a lot on my mind.

119
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,770
Is expressing my feelings
making him uncomfortable?

120
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,470
I guess that was what I felt.

121
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,780
- Among the guys you're considering,
- Yes?

122
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,090
am I one of them?

123
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,460
Is that what you want to know?

124
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,800
- Yes.
- Really?

125
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,200
He said this too.

126
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,970
He thought about
what he wanted to say before coming,

127
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,270
but now that he came to see me,
he forgot everything.

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,540
- I thought a lot...
- Okay.

129
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,310
- about how to tell you this.
- I see.

130
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,880
But now that I see you,

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,550
I can't say it as I thought.

132
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,750
He was honest and transparent.

133
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,720
That's what I felt.

134
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,590
If I didn't have feelings for him at all,

135
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,260
it might have felt uncomfortable.

136
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,760
But I had already decided...

137
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,430
to write his name down as a candidate.

138
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,500
So when he came to me and said that,

139
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,170
it felt positive.

140
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,210
Yes.

141
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,680
I am too embarrassed.

142
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll go downstairs now
and see you in the group later.

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,550
All right.

144
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,990
See you.

145
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,430
You know,

146
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,500
- Yes?
- the brown book.

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,700
- The brown book.
- Yes.

148
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,140
I'd like to read it.

149
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,540
I'll give it to you.

150
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,210
- See you.
- Okay.

151
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,350
See you later.

152
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,850
- Okay.
- All right.

153
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,220
- Write my name.
- Okay.

154
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,390
(24 hours have passed.)

155
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,490
(Decide on two people.)

156
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,930
(In the order the text is sent,)

157
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
(they're paired with the first person.)

158
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,370
(3 days and a messenger
between just the 2 of them)

159
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,110
(How are we like when we're dating?)

160
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,080
(December 13, Friday, 5:00 p.m.)

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,980
(The first contract relationship)

162
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,120
(3 unpredictable days are coming.)

163
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,290
Going beyond simple flirting,

164
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,030
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

165
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,600
someone they want to marry.

166
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Heart Pairing starts again today.

167
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,340
(Super sympathizer, Choi Si Won)

168
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,700
(Welcome to the show.)

169
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,210
There's news that turned
the Pairing House...

170
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,770
- upside down last week.
- Right.

171
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,810
It was announced that they'll be in
a contract relationship with one person,

172
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,810
and it drove them crazy.

173
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,080
A contract relationship...

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,750
- feels different from dating.
- Right.

175
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,950
I can be in a relationship
with one person exclusively.

176
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,060
But to be paired with someone
I have feelings for,

177
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,330
that person needs to write my name too.

178
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,430
Last week,
to express their feelings, the cast...

179
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,600
was very busy.

180
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Gosh.

181
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,500
- They can see no further than their nose.
- That's what I'm saying.

182
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I have no idea.

183
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,040
Last week, the cast...

184
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,470
wrote down two candidates
for the contract relationship...

185
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,570
and sent a text.

186
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,610
But it's a 1st-come, 1st-served pairing
for the contract relationship.

187
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,680
It was a hidden rule.

188
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,420
The ones who send the text first...

189
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
get the priority for the couple pairing.

190
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,990
I think Ji Min is the one
who sent the text first.

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,290
- He must be in first place.
- I think...

192
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,720
he decided to send it first,
no matter what.

193
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,820
He might have been the first one
in Seongbuk-gu.

194
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,830
(He might be the 1st in the neighborhood.)

195
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,160
He might be the one who sent
the first text in Seongbuk-gu.

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,070
Today, the long-awaited contract
relationship couples are revealed.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,400
How would this contract relationship
affect...

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,870
their love lines in the future?
Let's check it out.

199
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,670
(How would the contract relationship
affect their love lines?)

200
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,040
(Time to meet
the contract relationship partner)

201
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,380
(Whose text reached whom?)

202
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,210
(Last night)

203
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,710
Have you read the text?

204
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,820
I've sent one already.

205
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,920
Really?

206
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,950
(Chae Eun sent the text first
among the cast.)

207
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,120
It's tough.

208
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,920
It's best not to think too much
about something like this.

209
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,700
(Ji Min sent the text second.)

210
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,630
I should have
thought about this in advance.

211
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,940
I thought about it in advance.

212
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,580
(Woo Jae is third.)

213
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,750
(Ha Neul is fourth.)

214
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,150
(Chang Hwan is fifth.)

215
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,280
I sent it.

216
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,290
I sent it.

217
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,090
It makes me think a lot.

218
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,160
(Chan Hyeong sent the text sixth
after thinking hard.)

219
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,600
(The seventh, Je Yeon)

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,930
(Last, Ji Won)

221
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,130
Did you send it?

222
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes.

223
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,770
(The texts with everyone's wishes
are sent.)

224
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,340
(Their feelings will lead
to a contract relationship of 3 days.)

225
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,980
(Would the cast be able to meet
the partner they want?)

226
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,450
(Half-excited,)

227
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,550
(half-worried)

228
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,130
(Who will be my partner?)

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Who is it?

230
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,100
- It's Chang Hwan.
- It's Chae Eun.

231
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,170
Chang Hwan is very fun and likable.

232
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,680
- Chae Eun.
- Yes?

233
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,050
Would you like to have some bread?

234
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,020
Honestly, I was feeling hungry in my room.

235
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,550
- And...
- I got something high-calorie.

236
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,160
The age difference is fine.

237
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,920
What really shocked me...

238
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,790
was that he looked so young.

239
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,630
Hello.

240
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,100
- Hello.
- Peekaboo!

241
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,540
You surprised me.

242
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,040
I intentionally...

243
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
- came from behind so you couldn't see.
- I was standing here.

244
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,780
I guess you must have been cold.
You've waited for a long time.

245
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,210
No, I'm fine. You feel cold, right?

246
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes, I feel cold.

247
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,350
Shall we go somewhere warm
and have something to eat?

248
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,650
- All right.
- Let's have dinner.

249
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,090
What would their first date be like?

250
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,290
Have you been here a lot?

251
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,920
- I work near here.
- Really?

252
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,730
There are a lot of restaurants here.

253
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,030
Have you been here often?

254
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,000
There are nice and old restaurants.

255
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,060
- Right.
- I come looking for those places.

256
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,700
There are a lot of places like that here.

257
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,030
Places that sell chicken noodle soup.

258
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,500
- Yes, right.
- There are many places like that.

259
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,040
- I like those places.
- Rice soup places.

260
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,540
- I like those kinds of food.
- Really?

261
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,680
- I guess we're almost there.
- Meat! I love it.

262
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,550
- Chae Eun is a foodie.
- Right.

263
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,780
This is a special grade of sirloin.

264
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,280
- I will grill it on charcoal.
- It looks luxurious.

265
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,050
Is it a special day?

266
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,190
I guess so.

267
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,060
I will cook it nicely for you.

268
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,190
Thank you.

269
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,260
It looks good.

270
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,160
This is the lobster sashimi.

271
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,870
Since this is a fresh lobster,

272
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,730
it might stretch its claws.

273
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,140
It's that fresh.

274
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,340
I feel so sorry. It's still moving.

275
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,340
It looks tasty.

276
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,580
It's my first time
eating such a nice caviar.

277
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,080
It must be good.

278
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,580
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's good.

279
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,650
- The lobster meat is so chewy.
- This is how a caviar tastes.

280
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,490
(A contract is an excuse for dating.)

281
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,630
By the way,

282
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,970
did you expect to see me today?

283
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,770
- This is a 50-50 chance.
- Right.

284
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,010
So I expected this to some extent.

285
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,340
- Did you?
- Yes.

286
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
(I see.)

287
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,610
What about you?

288
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,080
Same here, to some extent.

289
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,320
To be honest, regarding appearance...

290
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
If someone asks me,
"What's your ideal type?"

291
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,760
I think...

292
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,960
at the first impression,

293
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,730
you were closest to my ideal type.

294
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,430
So...

295
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,540
on the first day,

296
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,210
I sent a text to you.

297
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,240
- Really?
- Yes.

298
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,410
Oh, my goodness.

299
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,310
(She carefully conveys
her feelings on the first day.)

300
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,950
(The first day Chae Eun came)

301
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,020
(Chae Eun's ideal type is Ohtani Shohei.)

302
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,720
What aspect of him do you like?

303
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,490
He feels...

304
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
reliable.

305
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,190
His body type.

306
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,160
(The one with a big build among them,
Chang Hwan)

307
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,730
Is it because I did this?

308
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,770
- Talking about how I took showers.
- That's possible.

309
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,500
I might have remembered you
because of that.

310
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
(The water was too hot in Italy.)

311
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,240
My body turned so red.

312
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,940
I was literally cooked red.

313
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
So, do you know what I did?

314
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,580
(Telling them how he takes a shower
like a crybaby)

315
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,720
(Chang Hwan's joke helped Chae Eun
relax on the first day she moved in.)

316
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,120
You might have thought,
"He's not a scary person."

317
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,060
The joke I told...

318
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,730
broke down such a barrier.

319
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,990
That's what happened.

320
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,230
For me, I was very curious about you.

321
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,770
You kept staying in bed,
so it made me curious.

322
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
(Laughing)

323
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,110
We've become a contract couple.

324
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,910
- It's something I haven't tried before...
- Right.

325
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,080
and will not try again in the future.

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,550
This is...

327
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,980
(For 3 days starting today,
they'll be a couple.)

328
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,620
- We're a couple.
- Yes.

329
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,290
- First, I guess we need to talk casually.
- Right.

330
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,120
Then let's start talking...

331
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,530
- casually.
- All right.

332
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,630
- We'll talk casually.
- Okay.

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,060
We're a couple, so...

334
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,100
it's strange to just walk around.

335
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,400
How about holding fingers?

336
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,570
When walking around?

337
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,010
- Holding our pinkies?
- How about walking around like this?

338
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,170
Like this.

339
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,780
- We'll add more fingers if we get closer.
- That was natural.

340
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,950
It'd feel strange
if we held three fingers.

341
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,220
Three will be awkward.

342
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,420
After one finger,
the next level will be all of them.

343
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,190
(Heralding their relationship
would move along fast)

344
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,660
It will work that way.

345
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,860
Do you agree?

346
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
(Nodding)

347
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,160
(Embarrassed)

348
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,260
You're so funny.

349
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,630
(What will happen
during the 3 days they have?)

350
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,140
Both of them get along well
with other people.

351
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,710
To see them reveal
what they really feel inside,

352
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,780
we need to wait until we see them
on the rest of the three days.

353
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,210
I guess they started the relationship
smoothly. Don't you think so?

354
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,210
Yes.

355
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,220
(A woman approaching Chan Hyeong)

356
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,890
Oh, my. She's shining.

357
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,150
Unconsciously,
I found his appearance from the back...

358
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,660
- very glad to see.
- Gosh.

359
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,660
He's a wonderful man,
and I feel comfortable and rely on him.

360
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,100
He looks handsome.

361
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,540
(Hopping)

362
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,180
(Truly surprised)

363
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Chan Hyeong.

364
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,380
- I got you one.
- I was trying to figure out who it was.

365
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,680
- I was like, "Who is it?"
- Do you have one?

366
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,180
- I have two.
- You do?

367
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,950
- I have two.
- They make such a good couple.

368
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,090
It's freezing today.

369
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,220
- Right?
- Right? Yes.

370
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,660
It's freezing.

371
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,190
- This place is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, indeed.

372
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,260
It's no joke, right?

373
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,130
The tree looks really big
when you walk over there.

374
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,730
So are you my boyfriend now?

375
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,070
Right. It somehow turned out that way.

376
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,340
When should we sign the contract?
Should we do it right away?

377
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,510
(After choosing each other's book,
they'll have a contract relationship too.)

378
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,310
(She already called him her boyfriend.
She's fully into it.)

379
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,310
- As expected, she went for it right away.
- She's fast.

380
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,150
Did you have fun yesterday?

381
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,950
Yesterday?

382
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,180
- I heard you guys had drinks too.
- Right.

383
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,050
Is this the first day
of your contract relationship?

384
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,990
- Really?
- Drinks...

385
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,190
- Why?
- What did you do at home yesterday?

386
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,700
- I don't know.
- What did you do?

387
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,030
- You know...
- You can tell me...

388
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,200
because you're my girlfriend now.

389
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,470
(You can tell me
because you're my girlfriend now.)

390
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,400
I was just waiting for you.
It was getting pretty late.

391
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,640
Did you eat today?

392
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,010
I had gimbap.

393
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,210
- Really?
- Yes.

394
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,910
I got hungry.

395
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,910
You got off work early today.

396
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,680
Right. I didn't think...

397
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
we could go on a date today
unless I left early.

398
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,050
I couldn't make you wait.

399
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,450
It's the first day
of our contract relationship.

400
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,460
So I left the office
after handling urgent matters.

401
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,430
He sounds really busy.

402
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,400
(Gazing)

403
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,130
I'll let it slide this time.

404
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,000
(A competent and busy boyfriend)

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
Should I park forward here?

406
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,170
- Sounds good. Nice.
- Great.

407
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,010
Forward parking.

408
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,340
This is going to be so tasty.

409
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,810
- Omakase for their first date.
- It's going to be so good.

410
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,110
How did you find this place?

411
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,750
Despite my busy schedule.

412
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,450
- Right. I know you're busy.
- I did some research.

413
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,150
See how well-prepared I am?

414
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,390
- Are you trying to win brownie points?
- That's right.

415
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,290
I need to win some brownie points first.

416
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,190
This looks great.

417
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,200
We came here for this dish.

418
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,970
It's so good.

419
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,600
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

420
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,770
How cute.

421
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,180
I've been having only gimbap
ever since I moved into the house.

422
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,710
- Really? For lunch?
- For lunch.

423
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,350
- On your way to the office?
- Yes.

424
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,680
- Because you didn't have time?
- In the car.

425
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,220
My gosh.

426
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,220
Gimbap is my staple.

427
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,820
- Really?
- Yes.

428
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,390
It just happened naturally.

429
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,790
- You must eat well.
- It's... Yes.

430
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,090
- My staple...
- Boyfriend, you must eat well.

431
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,390
That's why I'm going to eat well
over the weekend.

432
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,030
I plan to eat good meals.

433
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,930
Ha Neul knows the perfect things to say.

434
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,470
- Right.
- Yes.

435
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,800
She is immersed from Day One.

436
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
- Right.
- Yes.

437
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,210
Ha Neul is very accommodating too.

438
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,340
- She's very accommodating.
- Yes.

439
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,310
Don't you have to go to work tomorrow?

440
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,080
- Just in the morning.
- Yes, in the morning.

441
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,210
At what time?

442
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,780
I always leave at the same time.

443
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,150
- I see. You must be so tired tomorrow.
- I usually leave around 7 a.m.

444
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,920
He's taken aback.

445
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,090
Well, I can...

446
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,930
take a short nap before I begin.

447
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,730
- You will... Yes.
- I just need a quick break.

448
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,640
(The conversation gets slightly awkward.)

449
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
My gosh.

450
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,870
- We don't have to leave early.
- Yes.

451
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,780
(Bothered)

452
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,280
What if we're the last ones to leave?

453
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,620
What if they all leave at dawn?

454
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,050
- Are they going on a trip?
- To go on a trip.

455
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,720
- They'll be gone for 1 night.
- A 1-night trip?

456
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,850
They won't come back?

457
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,490
- "We're going to Busan."
- Exactly.

458
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,490
How interesting.

459
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,560
- You know what? We can...
- Yes?

460
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,330
- get out of the city on Sunday.
- Out of the city?

461
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,340
- That sounds good.
- Yes.

462
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,270
Should we go to an aquarium?

463
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,370
- I like that idea.
- Me too. I like it too.

464
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,340
(Smiling)

465
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,310
That would be lovely.

466
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,610
- Let me get this.
- No.

467
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,180
- It was a nice meal.
- Thank you.

468
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,420
- Thank you for the meal.
- Okay.

469
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,950
What kind of song
do you want to listen to?

470
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,650
Any song. Whatever you listen to.

471
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,050
You must pick a song.

472
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,860
Why did you listen to Roy Kim's songs?

473
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,390
I suddenly liked his songs.

474
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,430
I suddenly liked his songs.

475
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,030
I listened to this playlist.

476
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,500
(He found out about her favorite song
in the Pairing Book.)

477
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,300
How about a romantic song?

478
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,770
- Sure. It's our first day.
- Yes.

479
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,940
- Let's listen to romantic songs.
- Romantic songs.

480
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,200
- How nice.
- They're so cute.

481
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,410
- What?
- What?

482
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,910
No, we have a receipt from the restaurant.

483
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
Could you open it?
They dined at the restaurant.

484
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
- I'm glad she gave us the receipt.
- Right.

485
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,350
Maybe, you could've shown him your belly.

486
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,950
- I can just tap on my belly.
- "We had a meal."

487
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,120
I can tell him how many different types
of sashimi we had.

488
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,290
(A relationship that puts you at ease
and makes you feel full)

489
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,560
I called my older brother
before coming here today.

490
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,890
- I called my brother.
- Really?

491
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,500
He gave me a counseling session.

492
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,530
What was the session about?

493
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,530
I told him that my contract relationship
would begin today.

494
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,870
I feel comfortable around the first guy.

495
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,600
And he is reliable.

496
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,440
The second guy is so charming.

497
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,310
- So I'm attracted to him.
- Okay.

498
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,450
I would want someone...

499
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,450
- Yes?
- I feel comfortable around.

500
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,210
Someone I feel comfortable around? Okay.

501
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,920
When you feel comfortable around him,

502
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,950
- he'll feel the same way about you.
- Yes.

503
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,390
So I think that might be
a better-suited relationship.

504
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,390
I see.

505
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,060
I see. That was the advice.

506
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,700
It's odd because I had no problem
addressing you casually.

507
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,430
- Okay.
- But I can't do the same to the others.

508
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Why not?

509
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,070
Then who do you find it
the hardest to be casual around?

510
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,170
- So you...
- Ji Min.

511
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,870
- Really?
- Yes.

512
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,270
Should I add some tension
to our relationship?

513
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,810
What?

514
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,640
Yes? Should I add some tension?

515
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,750
You can't just feel comfortable...

516
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,850
- or rely on me.
- Why...

517
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,110
- Why do you think I feel...
- I...

518
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,450
comfortable and safe around you?

519
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,480
It's true. I'm reliable, right?

520
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,790
I feel reliable...

521
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,990
- because I'm consistent.
- Yes, that's true.

522
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,790
(Is he declaring to bring in
some tension to the relationship?)

523
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,900
Right.

524
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,600
Yes.

525
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,940
This is fun.

526
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,440
Here's the thing about Chan Hyeong.

527
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
- His self-esteem is quite high.
- Right.

528
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,910
So as long as he makes a serious effort,

529
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,750
he will be able to
improve his relationship...

530
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,680
- with Ha Neul. Yes.
- He thinks he can improve it.

531
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,350
He's certain of that.

532
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,350
(He can do it.)

533
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,750
- I love the vibe here.
- Right.

534
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,220
I love the high ceiling.

535
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,560
(A cocktail bar in Gangnam-gu, Seoul)

536
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,230
- It's the perfect vibe to get tipsy.
- Yes.

537
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,360
It's warm here too.

538
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,960
This is so good.

539
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,630
Hibiscus.

540
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,840
The one we have in the house is porcelain.

541
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,900
- Right?
- Yes.

542
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
- Right, it looks fancy.
- Yes.

543
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Sweetie?

544
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,380
Did you just call me sweetie?
That was smooth.

545
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,950
Without a heads-up?

546
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,880
- Sweetie?
- My gosh.

547
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,790
(Getting drunk on the word, sweetie)

548
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,160
- Let's exchange our social media.
- Right.

549
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,060
- Other people can't add us.
- And...

550
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,430
- Okay.
- when we add each other,

551
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,660
- our nickname shouldn't sound too formal.
- Sure.

552
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,030
- Should we give each other a nickname?
- Yes.

553
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,170
Sweetie?

554
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,330
(Trailing off)

555
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,340
Coming up with a nickname is really hard.

556
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,410
- I have a question.
- Yes?

557
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,540
Do you often give pet names?

558
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,310
(Thinking)

559
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,680
- I like giving my boyfriend pet names.
- I see.

560
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,580
With the pet names,
it feels like we have our own thing.

561
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,120
For the next three days...

562
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,520
(Gazing)

563
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
(Bursting into laughter alone)

564
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,330
I think it's a weird nickname.

565
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,060
- So never mind.
- What is it? Tell me.

566
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,530
- No.
- Tell me.

567
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,670
Well, you have that princess look.

568
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
But you're not just a princess.

569
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,170
But you have this cuteness like a baby.

570
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,780
So you'd be BP.

571
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,180
- BP.
- BP?

572
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,620
- I can call you BP.
- Okay.

573
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,580
- I like BP.
- It's good, right?

574
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,850
- Isn't it a cute nickname?
- It is.

575
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,190
When I call you that,
people will ask what it means.

576
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll say, "She's the Baby Princess."

577
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,490
- That will make everyone laugh.
- I see. Baby Princess.

578
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,090
But this might make me really shy.

579
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,330
It's kind of embarrassing
when you say the entire thing.

580
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,700
Right? So that might happen.

581
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,730
My gosh.

582
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,600
How cute.

583
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,670
- They're so pure.
- How cute.

584
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,710
How did you save your wife on your phone?

585
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,280
I saved her as Jeon Mi Ra.

586
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,510
(Cracking up hard)

587
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,650
Really?

588
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,210
- A princess needs a prince by her side.
- Yes.

589
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
(Feeling shy)

590
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,220
- LP?
- LP?

591
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,390
Does it have to do with my height?

592
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,160
- Long-legged Prince.
- Long-legged Prince. Sure.

593
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,190
- LP. Right?
- That's a nice one.

594
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,660
BP and LP.

595
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,790
- I'll call you like this. "Hey, LP."
- "LP."

596
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,200
- "LP."
- "What is it, BP?"

597
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,070
They're adorable.

598
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,270
But this is such a cringey moment.

599
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,940
I think we already decided
on the nicknames.

600
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,340
Let's change it.

601
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,710
- LP.
- BP.

602
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,180
- We came up with good ones.
- I think I came up with a good one.

603
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,880
I wonder how that feels.

604
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,580
- They'll date for the next three days.
- Right.

605
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,450
They can text each other now.

606
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,350
Being able to spend their weekend together
will be a huge change.

607
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,290
It became even clearer to me that
Chan Hyeong's feelings...

608
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,960
toward Ha Neul were much deeper
than I thought after watching this clip.

609
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,360
When they first met, he seemed so happy.

610
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,600
And he didn't know what to do
because he found her so adorable.

611
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,600
Clearly, Chan Hyeong...

612
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
- likes Ha Neul more than she likes him.
- Yes. And...

613
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,000
I hope you continue...

614
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,870
- to watch their journey.
- Yes.

615
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,110
They're Mimi's favorite.

616
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,840
(I'll be watching you guys.)

617
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,850
(The third couple
in a contract relationship)

618
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,220
It's Woo Jae.

619
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,030
(Woo Jae and Ji Won will begin
their contract relationship.)

620
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,000
What?

621
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

622
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,880
Hello.

623
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,350
- Why are you laughing?
- What?

624
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,180
- Are you coming from work?
- Yes.

625
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,820
- I just got off work.
- I see.

626
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,990
There was traffic, right?

627
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,150
Yes, there was since it's Friday.

628
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,890
- I had to wait a bit here.
- Really?

629
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,930
Are you disappointed?

630
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,690
Maybe you are.

631
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,860
- No.
- No?

632
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,630
I thought...

633
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,200
it might be you.

634
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,370
- Really?
- Yes.

635
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,540
Because...

636
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,510
I picked you.

637
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,310
- Really?
- Yes.

638
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,810
- You didn't know, right?
- No.

639
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,140
- Not at all?
- No.

640
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,880
- Not at all.
- I didn't expect you would pick me.

641
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,080
- Really?
- Yes.

642
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,050
- Because we barely talked.
- Right.

643
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,650
We talked briefly in the car...

644
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,160
when we were heading out to Florence.

645
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,260
Exactly.

646
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,590
We didn't talk afterward.

647
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,160
Besides, we didn't go on any dates.

648
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,600
Right.

649
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,930
This is unexpected.

650
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,070
I thought...

651
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,610
it could be you.

652
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,210
- I see.
- Yes.

653
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,710
How fascinating.

654
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,710
- Should we talk more at the restaurant?
- Sounds good.

655
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,410
- Let's go.
- You must be hungry.

656
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,520
Yes.

657
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,320
- Let's have a meal first.
- Yes.

658
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,850
Spending three days with her...

659
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,520
- can be a nice opportunity for Woo Jae.
- Yes.

660
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,590
- You need...
- I see.

661
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,220
more time to see all of his charms.

662
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,330
Perhaps, Woo Jae was also interested...

663
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,690
in Ji Won.

664
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,200
- On the first day, he was.
- Right.

665
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
They had no idea that
they were interested in each other.

666
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,870
- Right.
- Yes.

667
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
The temperature already feels different.

668
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
- Right?
- Yes.

669
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,740
It's cold tonight.

670
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,840
If it gets colder on the weekend...

671
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,010
(A Western restaurant
in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

672
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
We'd like some rice too.

673
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,380
- Rice? Then...
- Is there a rice dish we can order?

674
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,420
I recommend our risotto.

675
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,190
Which one do you want?

676
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,590
- Should we order this one?
- Okay.

677
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,720
You can spread the cream cheese...

678
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,020
- on the baguette...
- Okay.

679
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

680
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,360
Every good date begins...

681
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,100
- with a good dinner.
- Right.

682
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,000
(Crunchy)

683
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,300
- It's good.
- This one is really good.

684
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,210
We have to think about...

685
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,440
what we'll do tomorrow.

686
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,980
Right.

687
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,050
You're right. You know what?

688
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,950
This doesn't feel real.

689
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,150
- Right?
- Yes.

690
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,590
We'll be in a relationship
only for three days.

691
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,790
I hope...

692
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,490
(Extending)

693
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,330
- My hand is cold.
- It's fine.

694
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,670
- As I told you earlier,
- Yes?

695
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,080
in a way,

696
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,140
I was...

697
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,650
observing you from a distance.

698
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,220
I was just...

699
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,150
Well, I did that...

700
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,520
(I did that because it seemed
you weren't interested in me.)

701
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,460
because it seemed
you weren't interested in me.

702
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,100
Remember the day when we drove...

703
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,570
- into the city together in Italy?
- Yes.

704
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,870
- That day,
- Yes?

705
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,570
you asked Ji Min...

706
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,810
- if you could join him.
- Yes.

707
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,040
I heard that.

708
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,280
(It was the moment...)

709
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,340
(when Ji Won mustered up her courage
and asked Ji Min.)

710
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,580
- Do you want to go together?
- Sounds good.

711
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,020
(Woo Jae was watching Ji Won.)

712
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,790
He was interested in him
from the beginning.

713
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,790
But after hearing that,

714
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,060
when I remembered your ideal type...

715
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,060
and the type of appearance
you looked for in a man,

716
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,260
I thought Ji Min was close
to what you were looking for.

717
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,130
- Really?
- Yes.

718
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,670
So...

719
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,070
- I had to respect people's preferences.
- Yes.

720
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,640
So I thought...

721
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,470
- that you were into someone like him.
- I see.

722
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,450
That's why I felt that
I wasn't a good match to what you wanted.

723
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,110
Naturally, I assumed that
you weren't interested in me.

724
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,880
Afterward,
I think I was just trying to accept that.

725
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,350
- I see.
- To a certain degree,

726
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,820
that's what I was doing.

727
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,560
- I see.
- So...

728
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,030
that's how I felt. And afterward,

729
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,200
- you went on many dates with Chang Hwan.
- Yes.

730
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,900
- You guys crossed paths a lot.
- Right.

731
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,370
So things were progressing with you two.
From what I saw,

732
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
you seemed happy.

733
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,170
- It seemed like you were having fun.
- Right.

734
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,010
So I thought...

735
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,480
that you would pick...

736
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,910
- those two guys for the relationship.
- I see.

737
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,050
- That's what I had in mind. Yes.
- Really?

738
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,690
- That's what I thought.
- By the way,

739
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,890
your hunch is pretty bad.

740
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,030
- Yes, that's true.
- I knew it when you got the book wrong.

741
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,260
I thought your hunch was really bad.

742
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,870
I didn't know that you had the green book.

743
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,970
I was completely off.

744
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,940
- When I read the green book,
- Yes?

745
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,740
there were some parts I liked.

746
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,680
Among the parts I liked from your book,

747
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,980
I felt that the writer and I...

748
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,020
were quite compatible
regarding the practical things in life.

749
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,920
You might not have known,

750
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,760
- but I don't like lavish lifestyles.
- I see.

751
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,730
- I don't like pretentious things.
- Okay.

752
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,000
When you said that
you didn't like pretentious things,

753
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,930
- Right.
- I thought, "She's just like me."

754
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,300
Anyway,

755
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,140
that's not something I like.

756
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,840
Of course,
when I achieve my goals one at a time,

757
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,110
I will live my life...

758
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,450
in accordance with my status.

759
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,850
I thought our viewpoint in practicality
and our values...

760
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,520
were quite compatible
from reading the green book.

761
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,450
So...

762
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,860
when I found out that...

763
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,260
you were the writer of the green book,

764
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,530
it was a positive discovery...

765
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,930
- I see.
- because...

766
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,640
I... Yes.

767
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,140
(Pondering)

768
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,280
The writer of the light blue book
sounded very ambitious.

769
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,350
So I thought,

770
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,550
contrary to the way she spoke and behaved,

771
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,320
she must have big goals.

772
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,950
That crossed my mind.

773
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,320
But now, it feels like
the pieces are coming together.

774
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,590
I'm like, "Oh, I see."

775
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,830
It was a nice feeling.

776
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,300
And....

777
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,100
just like you,

778
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,000
I kept ending up with the same person.

779
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,770
I kept ending up
going on dates with Je Yeon.

780
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,840
That was the case when women picked
the present for the last date in Italy.

781
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,450
When I saw that she was my date,

782
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,610
it did surprise me.

783
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,050
- Really?
- Because I somehow kept getting...

784
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,280
- opportunities to spend time with her.
- Right.

785
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,450
That's true.

786
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,390
Well...

787
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,790
Because she's the one
whom I talked to the most...

788
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,690
So I think we did become close.

789
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,760
But... Maybe, it's her personality.

790
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,460
I don't think we had...

791
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,100
- a deep conversation.
- I see.

792
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,340
I don't think we had a chance.

793
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,440
So I don't feel like...

794
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,310
- I'm leaning toward someone yet.
- I see.

795
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,450
That's unexpected.

796
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,010
That's what I felt.

797
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,520
So when I wrote the name yesterday,
I didn't hesitate.

798
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,590
But I thought,
"I won't get a reply, though."

799
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,660
- That's possible.
- I think I accept the situation well.

800
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,900
I misunderstand the situation
and accept it.

801
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,400
Right.

802
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,970
It was the same for me.

803
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,370
I didn't think you would reply back.

804
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,040
Because to me,

805
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,980
it seemed quite clear.

806
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,050
- You could think that way.
- Right.

807
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,850
She could've thought
he was going for Je Yeon.

808
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,190
So I think I didn't want to...

809
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,490
break it.

810
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,120
Not just me,
but the others would think the same way.

811
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,790
Of course, I think that could be the case.
And I think...

812
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,530
- I did look that way.
- Yes.

813
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,800
- So... Yes.
- I think you did.

814
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,910
- Please drive safely.
- Okay.

815
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,280
I'll take you home safe and sound.

816
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,120
- Giving directions.
- All right.

817
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm so happy that
it's the weekend tomorrow.

818
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
Right.

819
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,970
- It's only for three days.
- Yes.

820
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,600
But it's an opportunity
to spend some time differently.

821
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,640
Right.

822
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,270
As a couple. So...

823
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,010
- During this period...
- Yes?

824
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,910
During this period...

825
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,910
- This is the right thing to do.
- Okay.

826
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,820
- I'm saying what's right.
- Yes.

827
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,480
Let's only look at each other.

828
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
That's good.

829
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,790
- "Let's only look at each other."
- "Let's only look at each other."

830
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
I think that's really important
to Woo Jae.

831
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,690
- Right. Without talking too much.
- Getting the trust.

832
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,200
- Since it's an exclusive relationship.
- Right.

833
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
- Let's focus on each other.
- That's nice.

834
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,700
- Don't think about others.
- Right.

835
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,900
That's what I mean.

836
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,400
That's what I was saying.

837
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,370
And let's do that right.

838
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,440
- I'll be watching you.
- Okay. Me too.

839
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,110
- We're allowed to intervene.
- Right.

840
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,820
- We can say, "Don't do that, okay?"
- "What? What are you doing?"

841
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,590
- "What do you think you're doing?"
- "What was that?"

842
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,920
"What's up with that gaze?"
Something like that.

843
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,160
During this time together,
I think it would be good for you...

844
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,030
to think about your feelings.

845
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,700
- So they want to focus for three days.
- Right.

846
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,530
I think it would be good
to focus on each other.

847
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,870
Right.

848
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,440
It was a real surprise for me.

849
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,210
The fact that you wrote my name.

850
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,710
- Really?
- Yes.

851
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,280
- It's the same for me too.
- I see.

852
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,680
I really thought that...

853
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,620
you had made up your mind.

854
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,890
Approaching the destination.

855
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,590
Anyway, that's what I thought.

856
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,900
The destination is about 300m away.

857
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,310
This is what I thought
as I watched the show.

858
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,580
There are people who know exactly...

859
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,550
the type of people they like.

860
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,680
But some make up their minds...

861
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,620
and express their feelings...

862
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,920
only when others have feelings for them.
That's what I thought.

863
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,190
Ji Min and Je Yeon, for example.

864
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,190
These two are people
who clearly know who they like.

865
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,690
- That's what they are like.
- They are that type. Right.

866
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,800
But Woo Jae, and especially Ji Won...

867
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,970
When they think
someone doesn't have feelings for them,

868
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,570
- they step back a lot.
- Right.

869
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,640
- I could see that in the clips.
- You're right.

870
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,770
Since Woo Jae and Ji Won
are the same type,

871
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,180
and they know that
they are interested in each other,

872
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,750
- I think it could amplify it.
- There could be a synergy.

873
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,320
Let's meet the next contract couple.

874
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,650
I hope it's Ji Min and Je Yeon.

875
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,980
Ji Min and Je Yeon would be amazing.

876
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,520
(We wish it's Ji Min and Je Yeon.)

877
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,290
(The last contract couple)

878
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,960
(His heart flutters,
and he feels nervous as well.)

879
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,030
He seems nervous.

880
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
(Looking around)

881
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,410
(Ji Min smiles.)

882
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,880
(In Florence...)

883
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,880
- Why are you laughing? Tell me.
- What?

884
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,130
(They heard the bell ring.)

885
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,190
(He's reminded
of the date he had in Italy.)

886
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,530
(After listening to the bell,)

887
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,030
It still feels like a dream.

888
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,540
(he remembers the date in Italy
with Je Yeon.)

889
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,340
(Will he be able to have
that dreamlike time...)

890
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,440
(again in Seoul?)

891
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,320
(Ji Min is waiting for one person.)

892
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,190
(Smiling)

893
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,760
(Smiling broadly)

894
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,830
He loves it.

895
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,340
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's
contract relationship begins.)

896
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,810
- Hi.
- It's cold, right?

897
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,380
- Do you have a hand warmer?
- I have one.

898
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,210
- Have one more.
- Thank you.

899
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,780
- It's so cold, right?
- Yes, it's so cold.

900
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,850
Let's hurry and get something tasty.

901
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,520
Gosh, he loves it.

902
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,360
- I was worried.
- Why?

903
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,890
- I was worried you might not come.
- That I might not come?

904
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,830
- We're wearing brown today.
- Oh, right.

905
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,300
Why did you copy me?

906
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,430
Lucky me.

907
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,010
I searched for places...

908
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,110
- that had yellowtail sashimi.
- You did?

909
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,850
- You wanted to have yellowtail sashimi.
- Right.

910
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,050
That's the only place I found.

911
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
- Really?
- It would've been awkward...

912
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,050
if it weren't you.

913
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,220
My gosh.

914
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,320
(This date is only for Je Yeon.)

915
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,550
I can't wait to have it.

916
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,860
- What did you do today?
- Today?

917
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,990
Did you say you were working...

918
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,560
- only in the morning today?
- Right.

919
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,460
Gosh, what a relief.

920
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,000
- First-come, first-served helped Ji Min.
- Right.

921
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Ji Min's first date was really fun,

922
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,140
but it didn't have a bigger impact
on Je Yeon than Woo Jae.

923
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,440
- Right.
- Then...

924
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,950
he should try something different...

925
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,810
or show her different sides of him.

926
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,580
(Will he be able to win her back?)

927
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,020
(An izakaya in Songpa-gu, Seoul)

928
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,690
Do you want to sit here?

929
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,160
- I don't want to sit alone.
- You can sit down.

930
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,110
(Smiling)

931
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,010
(Tapping)

932
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,380
What is it?

933
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,250
Because you looked up...

934
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,980
Why? Was it weird?

935
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,050
No, it felt...

936
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,080
Sit here.

937
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,560
- He must find her cute.
- Right.

938
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,060
Of course, she looks cute.

939
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,460
(Good times.)

940
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,700
Can we get the menu?

941
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,210
- It looks pretty. They have a lot.
- They do.

942
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,410
Yes.

943
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,110
Yellowtail, and...

944
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,380
- Should we order a nabe?
- What type of nabe do you like?

945
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I like...

946
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,290
- this one and this one.
- These two?

947
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,750
Goodness.

948
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,290
This sake is a welcome drink.

949
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,830
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

950
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,560
I think you'll be drunk after that.

951
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,800
(Je Yeon can't drink well.)

952
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,960
Should I not drink it?

953
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,630
- I'm going to.
- You are?

954
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,270
I need something to help me loosen up.

955
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,770
You dressed prettily tonight.

956
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,940
Is it your favorite shearling jacket?

957
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,150
(Impressed)

958
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,450
- That looks great.
- You're bringing us...

959
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,920
- Thank you.
- soy sauce and wasabi on the side, right?

960
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,520
It looks delicious.

961
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,390
I've been dying to eat this.

962
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,390
That's good.
I've only looked for yellowtail sashimi.

963
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,060
Thanks.

964
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,090
- Should we eat?
- Yes. Thank you.

965
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,810
- It's delicious.
- This is so good.

966
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,910
- It's so good.
- So good.

967
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,950
(Very satisfied)

968
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,220
Although...

969
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,520
- it's short...
- Come again?

970
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,620
Although it's short,
we're in a relationship.

971
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,690
- Should we raise our glasses for that?
- Sure.

972
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,400
- Cheers.
- It's a lot.

973
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,330
- This tastes good!
- It's really good.

974
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,670
This one is also good.

975
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,600
They're naturally sharing it.

976
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,110
(Exclaiming)

977
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,110
This one's better.

978
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,210
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

979
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,580
- Have you tried it?
- Yes, I like it.

980
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,890
- I actually enjoy drinking.
- Yes.

981
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,290
But it's been so long since I last drank.

982
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,490
What do you normally do
at the end of the year?

983
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,390
- Hang out with friends?
- There are many gatherings...

984
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,630
- at the end of the year.
- Right.

985
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,430
Strangely, I was swamped with work...

986
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,060
at the beginning and end of the year.

987
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,970
- Oh, your work got busy.
- I was so busy.

988
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,240
So, I didn't get to enjoy it properly.

989
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,270
Do you have some time on your hands
for the first time?

990
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,470
Yes, it's my first time.

991
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,180
- Let's get along, then.
- What? Okay.

992
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,910
I'm your boyfriend now, after all.

993
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,550
I'm sorry?

994
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,380
(He gets playful.)

995
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,790
I'm joking.

996
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,160
(Thinking)

997
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,260
That's true.

998
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,230
Why do I find it so fun...

999
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,230
teasing you?

1000
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,500
Come on.

1001
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,570
When your stomach growled yesterday,

1002
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,770
- it was the most...
- Wait!

1003
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,570
Sorry. That incident was the funniest
while I was here.

1004
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,600
"That incident."

1005
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,270
Of course.

1006
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,110
It's definitely in the top five.

1007
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,080
I was so flustered that I stormed out.

1008
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,610
- Yes, it was hilarious.
- I couldn't stay there.

1009
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,480
Yesterday was my favorite day
of all the days I spent here.

1010
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,890
- It was your favorite?
- Yes.

1011
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,990
Not because of the incident.

1012
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,460
For the first time, we got to talk...

1013
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,390
A lot?

1014
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,830
(Last night, Ji Min and Je Yeon...)

1015
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,770
(talked until late at night.)

1016
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,900
Is your group of close friends
from college?

1017
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,500
From college and law school.

1018
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,910
- Didn't you join any clubs?
- No.

1019
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,310
I was in a society.

1020
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,850
But not in any club.

1021
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,120
That's cool.

1022
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,550
But I regret it a bit.

1023
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,920
- Why?
- I should have joined a club.

1024
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
What's a club
that you wish you had joined?

1025
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm not sure. Now that I have to pick one,
I can't think of any.

1026
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,660
- But...
- That makes no sense.

1027
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,890
But I once joined...

1028
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,600
a kendo club.

1029
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,930
But I quit after one day...

1030
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,130
because they told me...

1031
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,970
that they usually ran 30 laps
before practice.

1032
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,270
- In a kendo club?
- Yes.

1033
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,810
It sounds like she's tattling.

1034
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,080
And I stopped while I was running
as I was out of breath.

1035
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,980
And they came next to me
and forced me to run...

1036
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,150
like, "Run!" So, I quit right away.

1037
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,550
I guess you need to be in shape first.

1038
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,020
You would have looked so funny
playing kendo.

1039
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,020
"Funny?"

1040
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,620
Like how kids go, "Ouch,"
when you hit them on the head.

1041
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,130
You'd look just like that.

1042
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,700
I've never seen Je Yeon
talk so much before.

1043
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,000
(Is she affected by Ji Min?)

1044
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,370
Were you in any clubs?

1045
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,000
I was a student ambassador.

1046
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,240
An ambassador?

1047
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,280
But I didn't do much.

1048
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,410
(Lips twitching)

1049
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,910
I'm not sure...

1050
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,180
if telling you this is any good for me,
but I'll be honest since it's in the past.

1051
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,090
- Do you know why I became one?
- No.

1052
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,120
- To find a girlfriend?
- I joined them...

1053
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,150
to find a girlfriend.

1054
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,820
I see.

1055
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,730
I was so eager to be in a relationship.

1056
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:04,760
Really?

1057
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,730
I graduated from
all-boys middle and high schools.

1058
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,530
- And I was too timid.
- I see.

1059
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,840
I couldn't even make eye contact
when talking to girls.

1060
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,870
Really?

1061
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,610
So, my first relationship was pretty late.

1062
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,280
I was 22.

1063
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,540
When was yours?

1064
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,980
When I was 20.

1065
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,810
You went at it on the campus, didn't you?

1066
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,020
- I see how it is.
- What do you mean?

1067
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,690
On Songdo Campus...

1068
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,960
I never said he was from the same college.

1069
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,960
He wasn't?

1070
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,660
I don't know. I don't remember.

1071
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,890
I don't even remember.

1072
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,830
I have a hard time...

1073
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,460
- remembering the past.
- Right.

1074
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,800
- There's no need to remember it too.
- She's a lawyer,

1075
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,430
so she remains silent.

1076
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,740
- She's good at it.
- I have a feeling...

1077
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,300
you're the type of person...

1078
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,370
to show all the love you have...

1079
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,740
once you're in a relationship.

1080
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,210
You're right.

1081
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,280
I feel like you'll change
once the relationship begins.

1082
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,950
You're right.

1083
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,050
Once you're certain
that you can trust him,

1084
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,390
I'm sure you'll change.

1085
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,390
Right?

1086
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,290
I assume you'll be devoted
once you start believing...

1087
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,960
that you're in love with him.

1088
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,330
(Nodding)

1089
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,600
He's so good at leading the conversation.

1090
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,340
Also,
he must have thought a lot about Je Yeon.

1091
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,770
- Right.
- He must have.

1092
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,540
You've been figuring me out very well
since last night.

1093
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,310
I'm figuring you out?

1094
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,580
- I'm trying to get to know you.
- I see.

1095
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,220
- He's very honest too.
- He is.

1096
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,680
I like it.

1097
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,760
Do you want to figure me out?

1098
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,060
Like, "I'm into you."

1099
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,200
- Figure you out?
- Yes.

1100
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,370
I've already figured you out.

1101
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,870
I see right through you.

1102
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,640
- Do you care to elaborate?
- She's so cute.

1103
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,270
With the logic of a lawyer.

1104
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,570
I usually write my points, so...

1105
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,010
That's so cute.

1106
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,950
(Feeling shy)

1107
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,890
Thank you.

1108
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,300
Do you tend to be
in relationships for a long time?

1109
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,830
Je Yeon started asking questions.

1110
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,130
- All my relationships were long.
- Really?

1111
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,670
Not too long, though.

1112
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,640
She must have found it unexpected.

1113
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,670
I haven't been in that many relationships
considering my age.

1114
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,670
Okay.

1115
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,410
I think I'm very discreet.

1116
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,710
You are?

1117
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,510
I don't think, "Maybe,
I'll start liking her as I date her."

1118
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,950
I'm very discreet.

1119
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,720
Right.

1120
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,490
One could say I'm picky.

1121
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,120
I'm very cautious...

1122
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,420
when I go into a relationship.

1123
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,760
So, my first relationship...

1124
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,330
was very late.

1125
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,700
He's saying, "I'm this discreet,
but I'm into you."

1126
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,500
That's what he means.

1127
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,270
"I'm actually pretty picky."

1128
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,940
You know,

1129
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,150
let's set a rule
for the remaining two days.

1130
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,850
- Like what?
- When we get up in the morning,

1131
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,090
let's find each other and say,
"Good morning."

1132
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,250
In the morning.

1133
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,220
What? Wait.

1134
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,660
But I won't have makeup on.

1135
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,190
It doesn't have to be
the very first thing.

1136
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,330
Right.

1137
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,660
I never thought about that.

1138
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,630
We won't mind the others.

1139
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,240
Let's do that.

1140
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:39,510
(They have a secret promise.)

1141
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,540
- Let's talk about that first.
- What?

1142
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,750
Our wishlists.

1143
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,780
- Wishlists?
- Yes.

1144
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,420
- We'll fulfill each other's wishes...
- Yes.

1145
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,350
- somehow.
- Sure.

1146
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,450
Are you sure?

1147
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,890
I'll listen to it first.

1148
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,990
She got worried.

1149
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,290
When you asked, "Are you sure?"

1150
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,760
it made me worried about
what you were going to say.

1151
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,200
(She's clever.)

1152
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,940
- She won't let him have it that easy.
- Exactly.

1153
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,240
My wish isn't huge, though.

1154
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,010
We'll be...

1155
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,680
in a short relationship, right?

1156
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,450
And you said you liked taking photos.

1157
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,150
- I want to take four-cut photos with you.
- I'd like that.

1158
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,020
That's on my wishlist.

1159
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,250
Do you have a wish?

1160
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,260
Me? I...

1161
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,960
- Should we have a barbecue?
- Should we eat pork belly?

1162
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,090
Should we?

1163
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,630
Sorry. I spoke casually.

1164
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
- Should we drop the honorifics?
- Let's do that.

1165
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,470
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

1166
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,600
Which do you prefer?

1167
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,100
- Casual.
- Casual?

1168
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,200
Just the two of us.

1169
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
(Nodding)

1170
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,070
- Or...
- Just between the two of us?

1171
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,140
- Yes.
- Okay.

1172
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,340
- Just the two of them.
- He doesn't want her...

1173
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
to speak casually with others.

1174
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,740
(Grinning)

1175
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,850
- I'll find one.
- Okay.

1176
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,190
- That was so smooth.
- It was.

1177
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,490
This is insane.

1178
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,160
I just changed my mind.

1179
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,560
- No!
- There you go.

1180
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,560
You've been leaning toward Ji Min
since last week.

1181
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,170
- Single men...
- Yes, single men.

1182
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,430
must learn from him.

1183
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,040
While he showed respect,

1184
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,410
his goal was to drop the honorifics.

1185
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,370
- But he went with it so smoothly.
- Yes.

1186
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,410
- Because...
- You're right.

1187
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,140
if you ask, "Can we drop the honorifics?"

1188
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,280
- without any context,
- Exactly.

1189
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,950
- it feels so strange.
- It's awkward.

1190
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,350
You can't suggest dropping the honorifics
because you don't have anything to say.

1191
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,820
- Should we have a barbecue?
- Should we eat pork belly?

1192
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,850
Should we?

1193
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,360
Sorry. I spoke casually.

1194
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,320
- Should we drop the honorifics?
- Let's do that.

1195
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,360
That sounded fine.

1196
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,060
I learned one trick from him.

1197
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,330
And Je Yeon was...

1198
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,300
uncertain about her second favorite...

1199
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,830
- in the early stage.
- She was.

1200
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,040
Yet, she forgets all about it
when she's with Ji Min.

1201
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,900
- That was like a drama.
- Yes.

1202
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,810
- Since the night before,
- Right.

1203
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,640
Ji Min's loving eyes have been
driving me crazy.

1204
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,180
The look that he gives her...

1205
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,310
every once in a while...

1206
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,320
- seems so genuine.
- It does.

1207
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,850
Now,

1208
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,990
we have four couples
in a contract relationship.

1209
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,890
After their dates are over,

1210
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,990
let's find out what happens at night...

1211
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,730
when they're back at the house.

1212
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,660
I don't think anyone's here.

1213
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,960
- Are we the first ones here?
- Should we go upstairs and check?

1214
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,430
Yes, let's go upstairs.

1215
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,000
- For real?
- I guess we're the first ones.

1216
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,370
Did we come back too soon?

1217
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,270
- Are they all...
- Are they...

1218
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,270
staying out all night?

1219
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,780
- They're all...
- What about tomorrow?

1220
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,010
This is a huge step forward.

1221
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,550
People get closer at incredible speed
once they drop the honorifics.

1222
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,380
You're the first one
I'm speaking casually to.

1223
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,580
- Am I the first one?
- Yes. Totally.

1224
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,850
Except for the girls, though.

1225
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,150
You've passed.

1226
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,350
I've passed?

1227
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,190
Someone's here.

1228
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,530
(Who's the other couple
in a contract relationship?)

1229
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,630
- Wait. Someone's here.
- What?

1230
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,900
- I knew you two would be together.
- What are you two doing?

1231
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,630
When did you come home?

1232
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,870
Are you feeling all right?

1233
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,070
- I'm feeling much better.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1234
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,270
Are you almost better now?

1235
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,210
You two are dressed similarly.

1236
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,180
- Right? It was a coincidence.
- What's going on between you two?

1237
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,410
- It was a coincidence.
- You look like a couple.

1238
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,080
(Teasing them)

1239
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,050
We'll go to the convenience store
and get you things. Ice cream?

1240
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,380
Should we get tea?

1241
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,920
You look like you're in good condition.

1242
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,890
Right now?

1243
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,290
I'm not so tired right now.

1244
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,460
Make up your mind now.

1245
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,860
- About what?
- The profile.

1246
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,030
The name?

1247
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,340
(They exchanged
each other's messenger IDs.)

1248
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,340
- I sent it to you.
- Did you?

1249
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,080
(His first greeting is a shy emoji.)

1250
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,650
We're currently...

1251
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,550
- in a relationship, right?
- Yes.

1252
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,150
Should we change this?

1253
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,690
- The name?
- Yes.

1254
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,550
How do you usually save names?

1255
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,660
(Pondering)

1256
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,500
How about emojis?

1257
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,730
- That's not a bad idea.
- Animals that look like us.

1258
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,570
- That sounds good.
- Right?

1259
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,700
Why don't we find
what animals look like us together?

1260
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,800
- I'll find you one first.
- Okay.

1261
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,870
Je Yeon's tone has changed a bit.

1262
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,480
A monkey?

1263
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,810
- I'm kidding.
- I don't want to do this.

1264
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,450
This looks a bit like you.
What's this? A koala?

1265
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,250
Is it a raccoon?

1266
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,020
I think you resemble a fox too.

1267
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,650
Oh, she does.

1268
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,660
- Let's go with the bunny.
- Okay.

1269
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,990
- You can be the bunny.
- Okay.

1270
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,190
Change mine now.

1271
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,530
(Thinking)

1272
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,370
Let's try and figure out
who the others are.

1273
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,840
I'm not that curious, but...

1274
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,470
(Woo Jae and Ji Won's date ended.)

1275
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,910
Woo Jae and Ji Won are back.

1276
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

1277
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,610
- Hi!
- Hi.

1278
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,150
Hi.

1279
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,220
- Why did you come back so late?
- What were you up to?

1280
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,120
You must have had so much fun.

1281
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,660
We were on a date.

1282
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,990
We're a couple.

1283
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,330
Goodness.

1284
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,270
They linked arms, didn't they?

1285
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,970
- She linked arms with him!
- She linked arms with him!

1286
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,640
- Are they linking arms?
- They are.

1287
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,070
(Surprised)

1288
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,410
- What...
- What just happened?

1289
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,480
Je Yeon is flustered.

1290
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,850
What is this, Ji Won?

1291
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,850
When did you change so much?

1292
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,550
- Ji Won! Weren't you a baby?
- Did you guys drink?

1293
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,520
- Did you drink?
- You were definitely a baby.

1294
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,820
Did you two drink?

1295
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,420
No, we had orange juice.

1296
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,620
- Seriously?
- We had orange juice.

1297
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,630
Where? What did you eat?

1298
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,990
We...

1299
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,400
went to a cafe and went to eat.

1300
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,370
We met...

1301
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,170
I feel shy.

1302
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:45,910
Anyway.

1303
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,380
We met later than expected.

1304
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,680
- Really?
- Yes.

1305
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,920
And we entered the restaurant pretty late.

1306
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,220
- Look at her eyes!
- Get changed first.

1307
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,990
Where are the others?

1308
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,490
Chang Hwan and Chae Eun were here, but...

1309
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,060
- Are those two a couple?
- Yes.

1310
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,430
They went to a convenience store
to buy beer.

1311
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,470
But it's so late.

1312
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,400
Are we keeping the party going?

1313
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,870
- Party?
- If you don't have anything tomorrow.

1314
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,610
What should they do?

1315
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,870
Je Yeon, are you going to bed?

1316
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,410
- Me?
- Do you want to keep going?

1317
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:22,410
I want to.

1318
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,150
- Let's keep hanging out, then.
- We'll go get changed.

1319
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,750
- Let's get changed and meet up.
- Sure.

1320
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:39,930
(Ji Won and Woo Jae went by,)

1321
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,700
(and Je Yeon became silent.)

1322
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,130
And...

1323
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,640
(What's on her mind?)

1324
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,480
He's bothered by it.

1325
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,780
There are so many shoes.
This is one big family.

1326
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,820
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul
are the last ones to return.)

1327
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,090
Hi.

1328
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,620
- Were you two matched?
- Yes.

1329
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,330
Did you have fun?

1330
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,990
You two must have had fun.

1331
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,600
It was cold.

1332
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,530
Are you feeling any better?

1333
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,400
- Much better than last night.
- That's a relief.

1334
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,500
- You certainly look better.
- I'm 90 percent healed.

1335
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,470
Did you drink?

1336
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,100
- Cocktail.
- One cocktail.

1337
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,340
And I got a gift.

1338
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,480
- What are they?
- Open them.

1339
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,710
What are they?

1340
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,950
My LP bought them for me.

1341
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,350
- "LP."
- What does LP mean?

1342
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,550
She's my BP.

1343
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,520
These are our pet names.

1344
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,890
You already have pet names?

1345
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,550
(They found someone to make fun of.)

1346
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,520
- His name is LP.
- My LP bought it for me.

1347
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,060
- Why is he called LP?
- "LP?"

1348
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,760
What does LP mean? I want to know.

1349
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,560
- What's my name?
- BP.

1350
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,760
"BP?"

1351
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,530
I thought that it was BB.

1352
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,730
- BP?
- Yes.

1353
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,700
It's embarrassing to explain.

1354
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,570
I don't think I can tell them.

1355
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,610
Suddenly, it feels annoying.

1356
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:06,880
This is so funny.

1357
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,180
I became curious about something
from watching this.

1358
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,350
They give each other a pet name.

1359
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,790
Under the contract relationship,

1360
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,920
they became each other's
boyfriend or girlfriend.

1361
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,760
Can such a title change someone's heart?

1362
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:21,960
This is also called the uniform effect.

1363
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,330
A group of people were given a role.

1364
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,800
They had to play
either a guard or a prisoner...

1365
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,340
for a week.

1366
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,840
This experiment was stopped
in the middle...

1367
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:35,010
because people became
too absorbed in their role.

1368
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,840
- As guards or prisoners?
- Yes.

1369
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,650
Although it's a contract relationship
of three days,

1370
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,320
they're acting as
the person's significant other.

1371
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,950
They can't help
but be absorbed in their role.

1372
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,060
- They'll be more enthusiastic.
- This could mean trouble.

1373
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,960
- It took a lot of courage, you know that?
- Yes.

1374
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,430
- Of course.
- I thought about it like 100 times.

1375
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,530
- Really?
- Yes.

1376
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,100
I feel grateful.

1377
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,900
Is it too cold for you here?

1378
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,340
- I think it's okay.
- Is it okay?

1379
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,040
- We can go upstairs when it gets cold.
- Okay.

1380
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,510
Weren't we...

1381
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,380
wrong about everyone?

1382
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:09,910
Yes.

1383
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:13,280
I must've gotten it from you.
I became less intuitive.

1384
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,450
I should stop being sure.

1385
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,420
Since I came here, everything
that I'd been sure about was wrong.

1386
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,420
Really?

1387
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,820
Not just the books.

1388
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:27,200
I was convinced that
you had no interest in me...

1389
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,030
at all.

1390
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,800
I thought that I'd look shallow
in front of you.

1391
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,370
Goodness.

1392
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,310
- Because you were wrong about everything?
- Yes.

1393
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,110
No, you didn't seem shallow.

1394
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,110
Anyway, I'm happy that I was wrong.

1395
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,150
About what?

1396
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,080
I'm happy that my conviction is wrong.

1397
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,120
- Seriously.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1398
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,520
Men have to wear a blazer at the wedding.

1399
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,890
I'll put on what I usually wear.

1400
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,460
Do we have to be dressed for a wedding?

1401
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,190
- What?
- Should we be dressed for a wedding?

1402
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,600
- I don't know.
- Why is it so cold here?

1403
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,370
It's slightly chilly here.

1404
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,470
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1405
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,100
What was that about?

1406
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,770
I did it after thinking about it a lot.

1407
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,310
- Since when?
- It's because...

1408
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,340
Before the car arrived?

1409
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,010
When we were coming in,

1410
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,010
Woo Jae said, "Should we go in..."

1411
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,210
"with linked arms?"

1412
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,180
- I was joking.
- So I thought about it.

1413
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,120
It's a little chilly here.

1414
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,620
- Just say that you did it.
- Okay.

1415
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,460
I won't come up with excuses.

1416
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,730
- You know that it took courage, right?
- Yes.

1417
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,830
Could you move over a little? Thank you.

1418
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,800
What are your plans for tomorrow?

1419
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,700
- Tomorrow...
- First...

1420
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,070
We're thinking of going to the aquarium.

1421
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,110
- Where?
- At COEX,

1422
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,410
- or the one in Jamsil.
- In Jamsil.

1423
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:49,040
Since it's cold, that's a good idea.

1424
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,410
We're going to have some coffee
in the morning.

1425
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,720
- Are you going out together?
- She found a cafe.

1426
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,150
After having coffee,
I don't know if we can go,

1427
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,920
but we were thinking of
visiting a gallery.

1428
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:01,620
We were thinking of staying in Seochon.

1429
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,690
- For us...
- Is that right?

1430
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,760
Yes.

1431
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,470
She doesn't look so happy.

1432
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,270
We're going to Tea Omakase in Bukchon.

1433
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,510
- I know that place.
- Me too.

1434
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,510
- You know everything.
- Thankfully, you don't know.

1435
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,740
- It's fascinating.
- I've been wanting to go.

1436
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,720
- She likes desserts.
- Yes, it's served with desserts.

1437
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,450
I heard that they have good desserts,
so we're going there.

1438
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
That's nice.

1439
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,960
We're going to eat pork belly for dinner.

1440
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,660
We're going to have boiled ox knee slices.

1441
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,700
Who is it?

1442
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,970
Knock, knock.

1443
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
- Where's Ji Won?
- She's in here.

1444
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,900
- Shall I get her for you?
- Yes, for a minute.

1445
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,740
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1446
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,610
- Ji Won.
- I'll be back if she's washing up.

1447
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,880
She's not washing up.

1448
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,680
- What is it?
- Woo Jae is calling you.

1449
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,580
How did that happen?

1450
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,190
- There are so many.
- Which one have you been to?

1451
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,290
Shouldn't I send you
many options to choose from?

1452
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:13,630
- I see.
- That's why I sent you a few.

1453
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,160
- Goodness.
- Let's look.

1454
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,800
Okay, so...

1455
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,770
We originally said 10 a.m.,
but we thought it'd be too early.

1456
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,410
Right. I have more,
but should I stop sending them?

1457
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,580
Which one did you like?

1458
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,090
Which one would you like?

1459
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,230
This one.

1460
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,800
To wake up at 7:30 or 8:30 a.m. tomorrow,

1461
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,800
around 1 a.m.?

1462
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,440
- You mean, when to go to bed?
- Yes.

1463
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,210
At 1 a.m.? What time is it now?

1464
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,370
It's a little past 12 a.m.

1465
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,040
Where is your favorite spot?

1466
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:05,310
- Right here.
- Mine too.

1467
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:08,050
- I like it here.
- In this spot,

1468
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,120
the air feels clean.

1469
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,850
It's neither hot nor cold.

1470
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,990
I agree.

1471
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:16,590
(They plan to prepare for their date
at their favorite spot.)

1472
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,040
(The air between them has changed
since their date.)

1473
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,320
What are you doing?

1474
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,390
Didn't Ji Min realize
that Je Yeon got gloomy?

1475
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,460
- He did.
- Yes.

1476
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,630
It was nice that
Ji Min watched her go through it.

1477
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,560
That's better than interfering.

1478
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,400
- In that regard, Ji Min is a good guy.
- He's good.

1479
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,070
Shouldn't you check if there's seaweed?

1480
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,110
I should, but you can't eat it tomorrow.

1481
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,810
You won't have breakfast at all?

1482
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,680
Me? I think not.

1483
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,280
- Because...
- Have a banana before you go.

1484
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,550
A banana? That's a good idea.

1485
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,590
Have a banana and some of your favorite...

1486
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,950
- cherry tomatoes.
- Yes.

1487
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,790
If not a bunny...

1488
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,430
What else is there?

1489
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,570
A deer?

1490
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,610
What's with the look on your face?

1491
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:41,440
- Do you like it?
- No, do it again.

1492
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,810
Okay.

1493
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,210
- I'll do it again.
- Really?

1494
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,310
Yes.

1495
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,280
Then...

1496
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,090
There are more at the bottom.

1497
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,990
(Turning)

1498
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:06,930
A fox?

1499
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,540
Do you like it?

1500
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,010
Or a puppy?

1501
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,740
I see both a fox and a puppy in your face.

1502
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,110
No one has ever said that
I looked like a fox.

1503
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:20,350
- Really?
- My eyes droop a little.

1504
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,680
So a puppy?

1505
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:25,150
Something like...

1506
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,090
- Okay, let's go with the puppy.
- Puppy.

1507
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,090
- I also like the fox.
- Fox? For now...

1508
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,760
This looks fancier.

1509
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,500
Tomorrow, let's change...

1510
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,400
our profile photos to the four-cut photo.

1511
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,770
That's a good idea.

1512
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,940
I have so many ideas right now.

1513
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,380
Extraordinary things might
happen tomorrow.

1514
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:53,310
The looks on their faces
are clearly different...

1515
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,650
in this situation.

1516
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,220
I feel bad for Je Yeon.

1517
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,750
Ji Won linked arms with Woo Jae
as soon as they entered.

1518
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,120
- Right.
- She made an official announcement.

1519
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,360
"I'm going out with Woo Jae
for the next three days."

1520
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,390
"We're a couple."

1521
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,860
- "We're a couple."
- Her linking arms was surprising.

1522
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,000
You mean, the timing?

1523
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,330
Je Yeon knew that her date wasn't...

1524
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,500
Woo Jae.

1525
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,100
Still, she seemed very stunned.

1526
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,310
Implicitly,
Woo Jae and Je Yeon were a couple.

1527
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:22,780
It was clear to everyone.

1528
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,750
But is it possible for Woo Jae
to change so much in one day?

1529
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,720
That's probably what shocked her.

1530
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,320
Je Yeon is someone...

1531
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,190
who's careful about
giving her heart to someone.

1532
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:36,220
She thought that Woo Jae
had his eyes on only one person,

1533
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,330
so she kept watering the idea.

1534
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:41,230
But now,
Ji Min is proving himself as someone...

1535
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,760
who has his eyes on only one person.

1536
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,630
- Right.
- Later on,

1537
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,900
when she becomes more certain
about her feelings,

1538
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,640
this could make her consider Ji Min again.

1539
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,670
You're right.

1540
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,680
They found out
about each other's feelings...

1541
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,140
on the first day
of their contract relationship.

1542
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,180
This is the second day
of their contract relationship.

1543
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,750
What did the four couples do
on their date to get closer?

1544
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,880
Let's watch together.

1545
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,020
(While humming,)

1546
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,090
(Ji Min is heading somewhere.)

1547
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,360
(Excited)

1548
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,190
Ji Min is in a good mood.

1549
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,260
(Starting the day in a good mood)

1550
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,300
(This is Ji Min and Je Yeon's...)

1551
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:24,570
(second day
of their contract relationship.)

1552
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,270
Hi.

1553
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,710
- Are you wearing a scarf?
- What?

1554
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,210
- Are you wearing a scarf?
- Yes.

1555
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,780
Your neck looks very cold.

1556
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:32,880
- My neck?
- Yes.

1557
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,220
- I put on a scarf.
- Your coat is wide open.

1558
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,090
He should open the door for her.

1559
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,950
- Isn't it freezing?
- It's freezing.

1560
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,260
Thank you for coming.

1561
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,060
I'm completely fine.
I'll turn on the heater.

1562
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,590
Thank you for picking me up.

1563
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,260
I wanted to open the door for you,

1564
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,260
- You should have.
- but I didn't want to be cringey.

1565
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,300
It felt too embarrassing.

1566
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,230
- Do you like it when guys open the door?
- I do.

1567
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,770
Okay, I'll open it next time.

1568
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,000
It's nice that he asked.

1569
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,370
- The other person might not want it.
- Right.

1570
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,480
(Common sense in dating)

1571
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,850
I'll drive you safely.

1572
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,850
Okay.

1573
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,350
What time did you get up?
You didn't sleep much, did you?

1574
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,620
I didn't sleep much.

1575
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,750
- Do you want to take a nap...
- What?

1576
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,090
- on our way there?
- No.

1577
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,490
I'm not sleepy now.

1578
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,820
- You aren't sleepy?
- No.

1579
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,660
- How are you feeling?
- I feel good.

1580
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,860
- Are you sure?
- I feel good.

1581
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,430
That's good.

1582
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,070
We're a couple now.

1583
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,130
(Linking arms)

1584
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,270
What are you doing?

1585
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,600
(Tapping)

1586
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,070
(Surprised)

1587
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,810
- What?
- What?

1588
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:34,980
You're good at this.

1589
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,210
What are you doing, Ji Won?

1590
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,180
When have you changed so much?

1591
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,390
(Woo Jae and Ji Won's physical contact
bothered her.)

1592
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,320
You'll get to rest after some tea.

1593
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,630
Today... Did you sleep well?

1594
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,730
Me?

1595
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,360
If you hadn't woken me up,

1596
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,100
- I'd have been late.
- You wouldn't have gotten up?

1597
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,200
- Really?
- I'd have been very late.

1598
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
I see.

1599
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,710
- Did the wedding go well?
- What?

1600
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,110
- Did you attend the wedding?
- Yes.

1601
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,580
The wedding went well.

1602
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,180
Do you want to cover yourself?

1603
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,320
Thank you.

1604
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,980
Keep yourself warm.

1605
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,690
It's warm.

1606
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,820
We won't hang out until too late tonight.

1607
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,830
Okay.

1608
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,060
By the time you get sleepy,

1609
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,570
- we'll go home.
- That sounds good.

1610
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,970
You should've said, "I won't be sleepy."

1611
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,440
I'm not sleepy.

1612
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,470
That's so cute.

1613
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,210
Goodness.

1614
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:45,050
He can't stop smiling.

1615
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,250
The street looks pretty.

1616
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,590
It's pretty near Anguk Station.

1617
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,220
I agree. It's beautiful.

1618
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,830
I want to drive too.

1619
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,130
- Do you want to drive?
- Yes.

1620
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:01,900
How about today?

1621
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,630
No.

1622
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,700
I'll be your guide if you drive.

1623
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,840
- Really?
- Yes.

1624
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,540
If I try, I'll be able to drive.

1625
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,570
I bet you drive well.

1626
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,110
I got 100 points
on my written driving test.

1627
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,380
That's cute.

1628
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,450
- What?
- I'm surprised.

1629
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,680
That's incredible.

1630
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,980
- Isn't it incredible?
- Yes.

1631
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,450
You have a cute charm.

1632
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,990
His heart must be fluttering.

1633
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,320
Do you know the song I listened to...

1634
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,360
when I got up this morning?

1635
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,790
No.

1636
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,860
A song by Sweet Sorrow.

1637
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,900
"The First Date."

1638
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,670
- You know that song?
- No.

1639
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,540
(My eyes open wide
without the wake-up call)

1640
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,910
(Singing)

1641
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,010
You know that song?

1642
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,450
(My first date with her)

1643
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,850
You don't know?

1644
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,580
Why are you laughing?

1645
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,860
I didn't know about that song.

1646
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,920
- You really don't know?
- No.

1647
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:07,230
- I should listen to it.
- It brightens you up.

1648
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:14,500
(Getting ready for a pleasant date
while listening to his morning song)

1649
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,040
(Making her clap automatically)

1650
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,770
- He's a very positive person.
- Yes.

1651
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,010
Ji Min.

1652
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,510
(The thought of going on a date
with Je Yeon...)

1653
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,750
(makes Ji Min very excited.)

1654
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,820
He's cute.

1655
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,520
It's great as a wake-up song
in the morning.

1656
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
I see.

1657
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,920
(Because he's with Je Yeon,)

1658
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,060
(he feels happier.)

1659
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,560
- Doesn't it put you in a good mood?
- Yes.

1660
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,970
- The song is very cute.
- Right.

1661
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,530
- They're cute.
- They are, indeed.

1662
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,270
(Tea Omakase in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

1663
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

1664
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,110
We both like tea.

1665
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,940
I heard about Tea Omakase.

1666
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:58,510
Each tea is paired with food,

1667
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,310
- so you can enjoy them together.
- Thank you.

1668
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,920
Does he remember all of that?

1669
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,050
Gosh, he's so detailed.

1670
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,620
After smelling it,

1671
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,990
exhale to your side.

1672
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,160
(Blowing)

1673
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,330
Did you exhale just now?

1674
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,930
- It smells good.
- Yes.

1675
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,870
It has a tree-like fragrance.

1676
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,970
It smells healthy.

1677
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,710
The tree fragrance feels therapeutic.

1678
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,340
The tree fragrance? I agree.

1679
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,710
- It smells cozy.
- Right, it's cozy.

1680
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,820
Does it warm up your body?

1681
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:37,850
Yes.

1682
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:41,720
I'll serve you the food pairing
right away.

1683
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,460
Pairing. Heart Pairing.

1684
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,400
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's second date)

1685
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:52,770
(A date in a theater at Hyehwa Station)

1686
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,130
Everybody, up.

1687
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,600
(Laughing)

1688
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,940
(Whispering)

1689
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:06,410
(Both their bodies and hearts get closer.)

1690
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,050
I wish it'd last longer than three days.

1691
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,450
(Ha Neul is waiting
for Chan Hyeong alone.)

1692
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,090
Gosh, it's their second day.

1693
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,890
(1 p.m.)

1694
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,560
(Exclaiming)

1695
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,900
I got off work.

1696
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,300
- Well done.
- Really?

1697
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,400
Well done.

1698
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,870
She's waiting for you upstairs.

1699
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,870
- Have a good time today.
- You too.

1700
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,640
- See you later.
- You too.

1701
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,840
(The second day of Chan Hyeong
and Ha Neul's contract relationship)

1702
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,710
- Chan Hyeong.
- Hi.

1703
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:37,950
You're back.

1704
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:39,650
You're dressed for Christmas.

1705
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,680
Your outfit.

1706
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,550
- Did it go well?
- Yes.

1707
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,420
- You should eat something.
- Right.

1708
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,790
Should I make you something?

1709
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,620
Go and get changed.

1710
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,660
- I'll just take this off.
- Okay.

1711
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,430
They're almost like a married couple.

1712
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,830
- Eggs?
- Two eggs.

1713
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,670
Is it because
you haven't been eating two eggs?

1714
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,340
I need to order them.

1715
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,040
(They talked about eggs,
Chan Hyeong's favorite.)

1716
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,710
Take peeled eggs with you.

1717
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,110
When I stop at the light,

1718
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:10,080
- I peel the egg in a hurry.
- You peel it?

1719
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,280
It must be very nice for Chan Hyeong.

1720
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,280
It smells delicious.

1721
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,150
- Are we alone in the house?
- Yes.

1722
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,690
This is what it felt like.

1723
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,560
I felt like a mom wishing her kids
a fun day at school.

1724
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,260
- Even a fried egg?
- Everyone was so cute.

1725
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,530
Could this lunch be more perfect?

1726
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,500
- Didn't she say she was a good cook?
- She did.

1727
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,970
How do you like your eggs?

1728
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,200
I...

1729
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,540
- like a runny yolk.
- A runny yolk? Got it.

1730
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,540
Gosh, this looks delicious.

1731
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,740
Look at Ha Neul.

1732
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,080
She doesn't look that happy.

1733
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,280
My guess is that the wait exhausted her.

1734
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,550
Chan Hyeong's wife...

1735
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,050
- has to be as busy as him.
- I agree.

1736
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,420
- Or someone who doesn't mind being alone.
- Right.

1737
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,450
- Is there more?
- There's a lot more.

1738
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,420
Chang Hwan made a huge batch yesterday.

1739
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,560
(Smiling)

1740
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,890
That's why there's a lot left.

1741
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,700
It's really good.

1742
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,060
- Is it?
- Yes.

1743
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,470
I couldn't find any cooking oil,
so I fried it in some butter.

1744
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,830
That made it so good.

1745
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,500
This is delicious.

1746
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,540
I'm glad to hear that.

1747
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,980
Ji Min and Je Yeon...

1748
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,080
She has to attend a wedding,
so he's picking her up from there.

1749
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,520
(Smirking)

1750
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,650
I see, they're also...

1751
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,850
That's what we talked about. Meanwhile,

1752
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,120
I had no idea Ji Won and Woo Jae
would end up together.

1753
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,320
Tell me about it.

1754
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,860
Have they spoken to one another a lot?

1755
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,130
I highly doubt it.

1756
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,930
Surprisingly enough,
they click in a lot of ways.

1757
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,960
- I can see that.
- In the way they talk.

1758
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,070
(Munching)

1759
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,610
You can take your time.

1760
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,950
Chan Hyeong must feel guilty
but also grateful.

1761
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,550
Why don't we go out later in the day?

1762
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,150
We could go out at about 4 p.m.

1763
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,390
(He feels guilty.)

1764
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,590
- I feel too guilty.
- It's fine.

1765
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,290
It's already 2 p.m.

1766
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,530
- I'm actually not as sleepy anymore.
- Really?

1767
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,500
- I was dying to sleep back at work.
- I know.

1768
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,960
I was so tired...

1769
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,430
- We can go out after you rest up.
- that the nurses were concerned...

1770
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,640
about my health.

1771
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,940
The nurses? I can see why.

1772
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,840
- You must've been tired.
- I'm fascinated by how...

1773
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,080
I can even function.

1774
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,410
I'm impressed, to tell you the truth.

1775
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,680
He's too tired.

1776
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,720
- You should rest up.
- I'll get right on it.

1777
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,020
I'll quickly get...

1778
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,420
- Get some rest.
- some shut-eye.

1779
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,790
- I should rinse these and put them in.
- Well... Sure.

1780
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,590
How about we leave around 4 p.m.?

1781
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,230
- We should leave at 4 p.m.,
- Then...

1782
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:44,500
- so I'll wake up at half past three.
- Sure.

1783
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:47,530
- They wasted half a day on Day Two?
- I'm afraid so.

1784
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,040
Due to the nature of this show,

1785
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,570
the residents learn about
each other's lifestyles.

1786
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:54,110
That affects them as well.

1787
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,240
(That's too bad.)

1788
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,310
Chan Hyeong only gets
about 2 to 3 hours of sleep each day.

1789
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,710
(They spend time alone
before going out on their date.)

1790
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,480
Is this what you have to endure
as a doctor's wife?

1791
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,450
Sure. Starting cleaning.

1792
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,090
(Cleaning that needed to be done)

1793
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,030
(Startled)

1794
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,960
Goodness. He must be exhausted.

1795
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:15,960
(Chan Hyeong wakes up
at the agreed-upon time.)

1796
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,400
He's quick to regain energy.

1797
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,500
Doctors are trained
to recover fast from fatigue.

1798
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,770
(They get ready to go out on a date.)

1799
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:25,640
I'd rather see you in something warmer.

1800
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,540
I wouldn't mind seeing you bundled up.

1801
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,610
Like a bundle.

1802
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,580
It's fascinating...

1803
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,820
to be out with you
when it's still bright outside.

1804
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,450
- In Seoul of all places.
- Right.

1805
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:39,990
(Indoor zoo, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul)

1806
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,920
- I know this place.
- "Time Traveler and the Tree of Life."

1807
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,860
We can go home wearing cute headbands
if they have any.

1808
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,090
- We'll make it seem obvious.
- Obvious?

1809
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,660
- Just for you and me.
- Like matching tops?

1810
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,400
Chan Hyeong. Goodness.

1811
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,670
- It's adorable.
- I know.

1812
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,570
(Quacking)

1813
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,870
- Hold your fist.
- Hold your fist.

1814
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,910
- I'm scared.
- Hold your fist.

1815
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,010
- Oh, no.
- Open when they get here.

1816
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,270
- And go.
- Go.

1817
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,940
(Simultaneous)

1818
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,880
They love to be around people.

1819
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,580
- So it seems. It's climbing over.
- Gosh, it's coming to us.

1820
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:08,650
Can it climb over to us?

1821
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,050
A capybara.

1822
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,920
- This is allowed.
- Of course.

1823
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,650
- It's adorable.
- It's active.

1824
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:16,320
- It should live with us.
- Tell me about it.

1825
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,660
It has the right attitude.

1826
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,830
Would you like some?

1827
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,160
- It's adorable.
- Hi. Aren't you adorable?

1828
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,900
- It's so cute.
- It's like a puppy.

1829
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,600
Goodness.

1830
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,370
It looks a bit like you.

1831
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,900
I'm a kind soul too.

1832
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,710
(It looks just like Chan Hyeong.)

1833
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,110
They do look alike.

1834
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,380
Come here.

1835
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,240
No way.

1836
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,380
- That was so cool.
- How is it?

1837
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,020
It's heavier than it seems.

1838
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,150
Gosh, this is fascinating.

1839
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,590
- No way.
- You should try this. It doesn't hurt.

1840
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,620
Is it eating one at a time?

1841
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,320
Is it eating the feed?

1842
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,360
(Signaling)

1843
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,460
This one will go your way.

1844
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,870
- It's not bad, right?
- It's okay.

1845
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,470
It hit me in the head, though.

1846
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,400
I see they provide
that kind of experience.

1847
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,970
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

1848
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,110
They're adorable.

1849
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,740
They look so cute when they walk.

1850
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,450
- Could you take a photo of us?
- Of course.

1851
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,650
Thank you.

1852
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,550
We're a couple, so let's link arms.

1853
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,590
Here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

1854
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:24,620
(They celebrate their date
by taking photos with penguins.)

1855
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,430
This or that? This?

1856
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,300
- That's cute.
- Let's go with the cute one.

1857
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,860
(They even take four-cut photos.)

1858
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,400
- That's cute.
- Look at Chan Hyeong.

1859
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,140
The shape's off.

1860
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,240
That's cute.

1861
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,640
(They both give themselves flower petals.)

1862
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,910
- This is way better.
- I agree.

1863
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:43,910
(They have their four-cut photos.)

1864
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,050
Here we go.

1865
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:46,810
We look better than I expected.

1866
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,220
- They're not bad.
- I know.

1867
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,380
It's fun to see how each couple
has its own dynamic.

1868
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,850
- This is cute.
- I quite like these. Right?

1869
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,090
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

1870
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,890
Ta-da.

1871
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,390
We even made the same sound effect. Ta-da.

1872
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,700
(They made another unforgettable memory.)

1873
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,430
- Nice.
- Let's go.

1874
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

1875
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,470
- Lamb?
- Let's have the five cuts.

1876
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,200
- Yes, the 5 cuts.
- The 5 cuts.

1877
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,210
Once the griddle is heated,
I'll explain the cuts...

1878
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,370
- and place them on the grill.
- Sure.

1879
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,540
I heard that lamb was your favorite meat.

1880
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,810
It is.

1881
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,050
- You're finally having some.
- Right.

1882
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,720
- That looks good.
- I think they're all cooked.

1883
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,050
Sure, let's eat.

1884
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,360
With some soy sauce.

1885
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,020
(He tries his first bite with soy sauce.)

1886
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,830
(No way.)

1887
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,770
It's good.

1888
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,070
It's really good.

1889
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,740
I'm glad we came here.

1890
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,040
What do you think of my choice today?

1891
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,840
This is the best.

1892
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,210
Didn't I pick the right place?

1893
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,880
I'll look for decent places too
when I get home today.

1894
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:55,320
(She's proud.)

1895
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,750
On our last day,
we'll have something extra delicious.

1896
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,120
This made my day.

1897
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,490
Ha Neul...

1898
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,860
doesn't seem as energetic as usual.

1899
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:04,920
I think...

1900
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,190
Chan Hyeong's demanding
and time-consuming job...

1901
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,600
is weighing on her.

1902
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,230
I doubt it was easy for her...

1903
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,200
to stay alone at home on a weekend while
everyone else went out on their dates.

1904
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,500
I'm comfortable around you,

1905
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,470
which is why I feel relaxed enough to eat.

1906
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,210
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Right.

1907
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:22,380
I noticed that
you tend to eat small amounts.

1908
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,610
- You saw right.
- Sure.

1909
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,810
- I don't eat when I'm not comfortable.
- You don't have an appetite.

1910
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:33,320
When did you experience first love?

1911
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:35,220
After I was of age.

1912
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,120
- Was it a girlfriend?
- Yes.

1913
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,930
- That's what they should talk about.
- Of course.

1914
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,530
During my second year in medical school.

1915
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,930
- That's when I had my first girlfriend.
- I see.

1916
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,070
How was the relationship?
Did you find it awkward?

1917
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,610
I don't remember it clearly,
but I doubt I was smooth.

1918
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,880
- It was your 1st time, so of course.
- At 1st,

1919
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,580
- I didn't know what to say.
- Right.

1920
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,480
But that's the same
with every relationship.

1921
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,820
You feel awkward
when you're around someone you like.

1922
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,120
- Is it because we get nervous?
- Probably.

1923
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,490
(Glancing)

1924
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,420
You seem even more awkward when trying
to express your feelings with words.

1925
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,660
That's true.

1926
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,500
Have you ever...

1927
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,470
asked a guy out?

1928
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,200
- Have I asked a guy out?
- Yes.

1929
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,840
(Pondering)

1930
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:33,080
Have I asked a guy out?

1931
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,520
I don't think so.

1932
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,420
Her expression shifted,
and so did the look in her eyes.

1933
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,530
If you've never made the first move,
it means you've never been rejected.

1934
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,130
A rejection?

1935
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,440
I've been rejected before.

1936
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,670
But you never made the first move.

1937
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:00,970
Did you at least show
that you were interested?

1938
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,810
It wasn't a stone-cold rejection.

1939
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,950
He just didn't want to meet up
when I suggested it.

1940
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,720
It wasn't while you were dating him.
You suggested spending...

1941
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,450
- some time together, but...
- Right.

1942
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,150
That has happened before.

1943
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:28,740
It's nice that we got together
after you were able to rest up.

1944
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,100
You're right. It's way better.

1945
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,540
- We had a better time.
- Exactly.

1946
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,640
If you had been too tired...

1947
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,080
Thanks for being considerate.

1948
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:39,650
No, I know how tired you were.

1949
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:42,420
Ha Neul is nice with her words, isn't she?

1950
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,020
While everyone was leaving,

1951
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,990
they asked when I'd be leaving the house.

1952
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:50,660
I said I'd be leaving
at 3 or maybe 4 p.m.,

1953
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,490
and they felt bad for me
for having a busy boyfriend.

1954
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,500
I responded by saying
I liked it better this way.

1955
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,060
I'm glad.

1956
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:02,100
I've never been one
to go on dates so early in the day.

1957
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,170
- Really?
- Yes.

1958
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,210
- You don't meet up early for a date.
- No.

1959
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,780
You must enjoy relationships
that are laid-back.

1960
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,980
- Nicely said, Chan Hyeong.
- Right.

1961
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,280
(Nodding)

1962
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,520
Out of the two,
you would've gone for being relaxed.

1963
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,050
Why was it a hard choice?

1964
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,390
(Flustered)

1965
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,620
He must be quite the catch.

1966
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,490
Is he that charming?

1967
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,330
- Is he?
- He's taking a straightforward approach.

1968
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,400
You must like
how he keeps you on your toes.

1969
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,740
- That's not exactly how it is.
- I'll have to check it out...

1970
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,040
and see what drew you to him.

1971
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,710
I should take a few notes.

1972
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,470
What's good should be studied.

1973
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,520
You kept me on my toes today.

1974
01:25:54,520 --> 01:26:00,530
(How did today's date
keep them on their toes?)

1975
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,360
(They seem to be walking on a thin line.)

1976
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,530
That was charming.
I actually preferred that.

1977
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:06,500
The date started later on in the day.

1978
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,800
Chan Hyeong's days
are busier than those of most people.

1979
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,070
She was exhausted just waiting for him.

1980
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,110
- Right?
- Right.

1981
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,640
Then after eating his meal,
he went straight to bed.

1982
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,950
She's experiencing
what she'd have to endure...

1983
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:22,220
if things were to progress between her...

1984
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,650
and Chan Hyeong.

1985
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,390
This is her digesting all of it.

1986
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,590
- With a daily experience.
- Right.

1987
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,790
At the end of their conversation,

1988
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:29,620
she stated that
he was keeping her on her toes.

1989
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,990
I think she wants him
to make a stronger move.

1990
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:33,860
- Rather than... That's her type.
- That's what I think.

1991
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,200
Rather than trying to
make her feel comfortable, I mean.

1992
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,100
He could benefit from
telling her not to talk...

1993
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,270
about specific things.

1994
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:41,940
That could get her attention.

1995
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,340
That's what she wants in a man.

1996
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,670
- We must be right.
- I think it'll be better for him...

1997
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,440
not to be so friendly all the time.

1998
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,380
- I agree.
- Right. I also agree.

1999
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,550
- It's not so chilly anymore.
- Right, the weather's not bad.

2000
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,820
(Gosh)

2001
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,490
Why will it take us more than ten minutes?
It's not that far away.

2002
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,860
I should just take the route I know.

2003
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,090
- Are you sure?
- Shouldn't I?

2004
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:08,900
I actually prefer that.

2005
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,000
I like it too.

2006
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:14,530
It's spacious enough to load your things.

2007
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,940
- I usually have paintings in here.
- You're right.

2008
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:18,840
It's a practical car.

2009
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,470
- Ji Min...
- Yes?

2010
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,940
- I don't think he expected this union.
- Really?

2011
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,810
He told me he couldn't read me.

2012
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,920
He was like, "What's going on?"

2013
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,650
He couldn't tell what I was thinking.

2014
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,450
- Of course.
- I can understand why.

2015
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:36,490
Obviously, there are things
we didn't know about each other.

2016
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,260
He didn't expect us to end up together.

2017
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,200
- Even we didn't know.
- It was a surprise to us too.

2018
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,700
- We had no idea.
- Exactly.

2019
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,700
Right.

2020
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,970
- We're in Seochon.
- I didn't expect to be here like this.

2021
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:55,740
(They enter the hot pot restaurant
they had agreed upon.)

2022
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,350
- It's funny.
- What is?

2023
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:03,520
A contract relationship.

2024
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,050
- As you know, we...
- Yes?

2025
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,820
It's been about a day now.

2026
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:07,990
- How is it for you?
- How is it for you?

2027
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:11,160
- I asked you first.
- Sure.

2028
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,460
It feels different.

2029
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,730
- Really?
- It's slightly different.

2030
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,270
It's as if our conversation yesterday...

2031
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,700
untangled the knots
that I felt had existed...

2032
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,140
between us.

2033
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:29,210
To me, that means a lot.

2034
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,010
Anyway...

2035
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:34,810
- Shall we dig in?
- Sure.

2036
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,150
- He must be more certain now.
- Right.

2037
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,320
About their feelings for one another?

2038
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:41,950
Should I cut this for you?

2039
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:45,830
Can we stick our chopsticks in here?

2040
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:49,300
- Is this okay?
- Of course.

2041
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,200
It's really good. I mean it.

2042
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,370
Really?

2043
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,940
It's exactly what I was craving.

2044
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,280
Right?

2045
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,650
I'd love to come back here.

2046
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:06,650
- Really?
- Yes.

2047
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:08,250
- I agree.
- Right.

2048
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,920
We can come here together.

2049
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,980
Sounds good.

2050
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,660
(Next, they go to a cafe in Seochon.)

2051
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,660
- Would you like a sip?
- It's good.

2052
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:20,960
Let's exchange.

2053
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:23,100
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

2054
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,840
This really tastes like strawberries.

2055
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,970
- Right?
- Yes.

2056
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,310
- I prefer coffee over alcohol.
- Right.

2057
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,610
- I don't stay out until late at night.
- I see.

2058
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:42,180
- As you know, I like the color green.
- Right.

2059
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:43,580
I like taking care of plants.

2060
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,690
I like taking care of plants too,

2061
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:48,220
- so I had a lot at some point.
- Right.

2062
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,690
Before you know it,
they've grown several inches.

2063
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,820
- Exactly, which is fascinating.
- It surprises you.

2064
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:52,960
You're right.

2065
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,760
I remember talking together,

2066
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,160
and you mentioning
that you like Haebangchon.

2067
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,270
- That's right.
- It felt nice to hear that.

2068
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,070
- Really?
- As someone...

2069
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:06,840
who likes Haebangchon...

2070
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,810
(Someone who shares my fondness
for the same neighborhood)

2071
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:11,580
I live in Haebangchon
because I like it there,

2072
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,550
so it's nice to know someone
who likes it as well.

2073
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:15,050
He remembers everything.

2074
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:17,080
- It's a humble neighborhood.
- That's true.

2075
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:19,890
- There's a homely feel to it.
- Right.

2076
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,620
- It has lots of bookstores too.
- Exactly.

2077
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,690
I prefer someone
who likes the same things as me.

2078
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,260
They click, don't they?

2079
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:29,200
I personally like places...

2080
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,900
with small, rustic shops.

2081
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:34,770
Places with streets
that have a homely feel to them.

2082
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,740
- This place is like that too.
- Right.

2083
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,910
- This is that exact vibe.
- Haebangchon is like that too.

2084
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,610
- Huam-dong too.
- Right.

2085
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,310
They seem to have a lot in common.

2086
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:43,410
- I know.
- You're right.

2087
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,650
- This is intriguing.
- Earlier,

2088
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,750
I said I drew a lot
while walking these streets.

2089
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,720
I like going
to Gyeongbokgung Palace on weekdays.

2090
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,790
When we have good weather,

2091
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,230
I leave the house...

2092
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:01,390
and buy a few sticky rice donuts.

2093
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,030
- I love those.
- Yes.

2094
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:06,300
I'd ask for some
with sugar sprinkled on top.

2095
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:09,870
I'd then put them in my bag
and buy a carton of milk.

2096
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,440
With those in my bag, I'd enter the gate.

2097
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,710
I used to do that by myself a lot.

2098
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:15,610
I often buy sticky rice donuts
for myself as well.

2099
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:16,640
- Really?
- Yes.

2100
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,410
I'd go inside the palace
and sit on one of the benches.

2101
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:20,650
(On a weekday during the day
at Gyeongbokgung Palace)

2102
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:23,080
- And you have the donuts?
- Yes, with milk.

2103
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,550
- I'd do that.
- That's hilarious.

2104
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:26,690
I'd then look around for a bit.

2105
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:27,690
(What he always does
before getting to work)

2106
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,420
I used to come here every day
so that I could get a clear image...

2107
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,660
of what I'm supposed to draw.

2108
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:36,430
I then drew something,

2109
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,800
which I'll show you later.

2110
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,330
- Right.
- This is what I painted.

2111
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:42,440
(No way.)

2112
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,270
- Can you see it clearly?
- How should I put it?

2113
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:47,040
What's this?

2114
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,580
These are mountains,

2115
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:52,210
- while this could be the moon or the sun.
- Is that the moon?

2116
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:53,910
This is pretty.

2117
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,580
This is actually
one of my bigger paintings.

2118
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,280
- Really?
- It's about this big.

2119
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,390
So...

2120
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,520
I feel it as a creator myself.

2121
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,060
The ideas you have in your head...

2122
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,690
- You want to be able to talk about them?
- You want someone who listens to them.

2123
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,960
It's something only you know.

2124
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,460
A woman who listens is the one for you.

2125
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,200
(I get it now.)

2126
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,300
- Do you have your phone with you?
- Yes.

2127
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:20,010
I couldn't remember to take it...

2128
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,710
- Right?
- and left it on my bedside table.

2129
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,710
I sent you a message,
but you didn't reply.

2130
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,740
For real?

2131
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,350
Sorry. I'll reply to you right now.

2132
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,580
You hurt me. My heart was broken badly...

2133
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,980
- Really?
- before bedtime.

2134
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,720
Seriously?

2135
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,520
- No.
- How cute.

2136
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,690
There must be bits and bobs of fun.

2137
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:37,890
- Exactly.
- Right?

2138
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:39,330
The two look great together.

2139
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,190
Do you like suyuk?

2140
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,330
I can never have enough of it.

2141
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,130
(The queen of must-eat places)

2142
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:46,770
- I can eat it every day.
- Really?

2143
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,470
I hope this place
doesn't get more popular.

2144
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,400
It's a must-eat place that only you know.

2145
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,070
(Dining at the must-eat place she knows
with Chang Hwan)

2146
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,070
Yes.

2147
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:58,140
This is the place.
They make the kimchi themselves.

2148
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,380
The smell is telling me it'll be good.

2149
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,890
The boiled ox knee slices are the best.

2150
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,520
Let's order boiled ox knee slices.

2151
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,420
If there is no soup, I'll act...

2152
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,560
- all charming.
- Okay.

2153
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,860
"One boiled ox knee slices,"

2154
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,800
"but no soup?"

2155
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,500
- Like that.
- Do it, Chang Hwan.

2156
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,630
Okay.

2157
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:21,800
(The mood is nice.)

2158
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,800
Great.

2159
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,700
Chae Eun's smile is really lovely.

2160
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,070
Isn't she pretty?

2161
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,940
- How she smiles.
- She's a bright person.

2162
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,040
(The boiled ox knee slices are here.)

2163
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,110
There's enough soup.

2164
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,850
- It looks good.
- For real.

2165
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:35,650
- I'm taking a photo.
- Oh, right.

2166
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,990
- It looks good.
- It looks good.

2167
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,490
(Its looks make them take photos of it.)

2168
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,050
(Snapping)

2169
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,300
It's good. The slices are so tender.

2170
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:53,830
(Eating)

2171
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:54,870
It looks delicious.

2172
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,910
(Digging in)

2173
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,610
What do you think?

2174
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:02,880
- It's really good.
- Is it?

2175
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,080
When I eat something good,
I frown and get angry.

2176
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,680
- Are you a bit angry?
- I keep furrowing my brows.

2177
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,690
(Chang Hwan's joke makes Chae Eun laugh.)

2178
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,160
Aren't you going to Rome again this month?

2179
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,290
At the end of this month.

2180
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,330
I'm going to get fresh pasta
from the supermarket.

2181
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,700
(Laughing)

2182
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,800
When I visit Rome, Italy,
I always buy fresh pasta...

2183
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,970
and canned tuna...

2184
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:31,070
made with olive oil.

2185
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,810
- Right.
- It's clean and yummy.

2186
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,540
- It sounds good.
- As it's made with olive oil,

2187
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,710
- you can even eat the oil.
- I should've bought some.

2188
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:39,110
I'll bring some over from home later on.

2189
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,680
- Amazing.
- Give it a taste.

2190
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,080
Okay. I'm in.

2191
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,920
I really love olive oil.

2192
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,250
You'll love the tuna.

2193
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,690
Ones from Italy. When I travel abroad,

2194
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,760
I buy ingredients from that country.

2195
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,860
You're interested in ingredients, right?

2196
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,030
- That's just like me.
- Right?

2197
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:56,630
I'm really excited.
I love those kinds of food.

2198
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,900
- It sounds really good.
- It's actually good.

2199
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,170
I might even shop it directly from Italy
if I like it.

2200
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,100
I'm serious.

2201
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,110
I'll get you some every month.

2202
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,210
That'd be amazing.

2203
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,410
Having a hearty first meal is nice.

2204
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:12,880
- Right?
- I like it.

2205
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:15,450
The two get along really well.

2206
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:17,480
Hitting it off well like that
gets you pumped up.

2207
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,190
- Since we had lunch outside,
- Yes?

2208
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,460
let's have homemade food next.

2209
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,490
I have...

2210
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:27,990
fresh pasta at home.

2211
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,990
Okay.

2212
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,930
Let's have that
with canned olive oil tuna.

2213
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:33,970
I love it.

2214
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,540
The base will be aglio e olio.

2215
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,310
- We can eat at the house.
- Okay.

2216
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,480
I'll cook dinner for you.

2217
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,240
That's so nice.

2218
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,080
(He brings a handful of ingredients
for dinner.)

2219
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,420
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

2220
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:59,020
- What? No.
- This is what it looks like.

2221
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:02,560
I absolutely love fresh pasta.
That looks incredible.

2222
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,500
- Water.
- Thank you.

2223
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,500
Here.

2224
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,070
(They return to the house for dinner.)

2225
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:11,740
I can feel Chae Eun's sincerity
whenever she says "I'm in."

2226
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,810
Me too.

2227
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:18,540
(Woo Jae and Ji Won
return with groceries.)

2228
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:19,550
Let's go inside.

2229
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,980
Should we do it? Shall I start?

2230
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:26,290
Why am I nervous?

2231
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,260
(Today's menu is sujebi.)

2232
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,360
What do you think?
Do we need to add something more?

2233
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,730
I remember mixing the dough like this.

2234
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,800
(Pulling up)

2235
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,770
- A bit more?
- Do you want to feel it?

2236
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,200
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

2237
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:49,910
(Impressed)

2238
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:51,140
- Don't you think it'll be okay?
- Yes.

2239
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:53,010
Your first ever sujebi.

2240
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,180
- Right?
- Yes. You too?

2241
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:56,180
Same here.

2242
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,520
(At that moment,)

2243
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,920
(Chang Hwan and Chae Eun appear.)

2244
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,150
- Hi.
- Who is this?

2245
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:02,290
Hi, Chang Hwan.

2246
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,960
- Hi.
- When did you get here?

2247
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,960
- Did you have dinner?
- Us?

2248
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,130
We came just now.

2249
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,730
- Really?
- Did you have dinner?

2250
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:09,660
- We're going to cook.
- What's the menu?

2251
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:11,200
We were thinking sujebi.

2252
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,470
- I see.
- Our menu is pasta.

2253
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,300
- First off...
- This one.

2254
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,000
Why Chang Hwan of all people?

2255
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,780
Tomato.

2256
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,710
- I'm a tomato maniac.
- Tomato...

2257
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:27,950
Are things going well?

2258
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:29,380
Yes.

2259
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:31,350
Of course.

2260
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,690
(Woo Jae is conscious of Chang Hwan.)

2261
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,750
He's conscious of Chang Hwan.

2262
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,590
(Glancing)

2263
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,160
(Glancing)

2264
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:47,800
They can all relax.

2265
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,140
She can't look at Chang Hwan.

2266
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,180
- Woo Jae is aware of it.
- Woo Jae can feel it, right?

2267
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:57,540
(They are both conscious.)

2268
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,410
The ingredients that should go in first...

2269
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:01,350
and last are on the same plate.

2270
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:06,820
(Amazed)

2271
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:08,250
- Right?
- Nice.

2272
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,020
- It feels good. Should we tear some up?
- Yes.

2273
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:12,120
Like this.

2274
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:14,830
The uglier the pieces, the tastier. Right?

2275
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,130
(Chang Hwan is also conscious of Woo Jae.)

2276
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,830
Chang Hwan is also bothered.

2277
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:20,270
Here.

2278
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:22,070
- Should we stop?
- It's quite a lot.

2279
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:23,140
- Right?
- Yes.

2280
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,140
That should be enough.

2281
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,940
- Tomorrow, we...
- Yes.

2282
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:30,140
I have to get married.

2283
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:32,480
Are you ready?

2284
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,680
This is a bridal class.

2285
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:37,850
Kind of.

2286
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,450
- It's going to get soggy.
- What?

2287
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,990
It's a little hot.

2288
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:52,430
(One man is anxious.)

2289
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:53,970
That's not easy at all.

2290
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,600
What now?

2291
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,940
It's all done.

2292
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:01,010
(One man doesn't care.)

2293
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,780
(They're playing mind games.)

2294
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,880
It's a success.

2295
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:05,680
Our first sujebi.

2296
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:14,290
- Gosh.
- What?

2297
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,390
You're a real cook.

2298
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,430
- It's good.
- Is it?

2299
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,460
- I bet it'll be good dipped in soy sauce.
- Yes.

2300
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,530
She gave him her piece, right?

2301
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,060
That's wild.

2302
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,970
What?

2303
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,040
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

2304
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,640
You've got flour on your cheek.

2305
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,680
(Wiping)

2306
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,950
- Not bad, right? We can eat it.
- Yes.

2307
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,610
It's a jumble of various feelings.

2308
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:44,580
(Boiling)

2309
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:51,120
(Chang Hwan cooks without a word.)

2310
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,300
(Beef bone broth spaghetti aglio e olio
is done.)

2311
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,940
It looks great.

2312
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,440
- Beef bone broth spaghetti aglio e olio?
- The broth must be nice.

2313
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,710
Beef bone broth spaghetti aglio e olio.

2314
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,550
- Aglio e olio?
- It looks good.

2315
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,050
Beef bone broth spaghetti aglio e olio.

2316
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,220
- We can dig in.
- Yes.

2317
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:18,220
It's complete.

2318
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,920
Nice.

2319
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,390
Everyone must've been surprised by
what happened.

2320
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,330
They came home for a cozy indoor date,

2321
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:28,860
but of all things,
Chang Hwan and Ji Won met.

2322
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:32,000
When Chang Hwan came to the kitchen,

2323
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,930
Ji Won had her head down...

2324
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:36,340
as if looking for something in the fridge
for too long.

2325
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:39,200
I don't think she knew...

2326
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,410
how to face Chang Hwan.

2327
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,840
She was at a loss.

2328
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,710
Chang Hwan should make things comfortable.

2329
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,910
I'm sure Chang Hwan wants Ji Won
to feel at ease,

2330
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:48,810
- I agree.
- rather than thinking about his emotions.

2331
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,620
- Gosh.
- But to do so,

2332
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,620
Woo Jae and Ji Won...

2333
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,550
should show off...

2334
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,690
- how well they're getting along.
- Yes.

2335
01:40:58,290 --> 01:40:59,690
How much pork belly do you want?

2336
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:01,760
To start off,

2337
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:03,360
three portions?

2338
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,030
- Or two?
- You're a foodie.

2339
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:06,970
- Three is a must.
- Three, right?

2340
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,030
- Three portions for two people.
- Totally.

2341
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,000
Which one do you like?

2342
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,240
- What?
- Which do you like from naengmyeon,

2343
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,640
doenjang stew, and kimchi stew?

2344
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,410
I like doenjang stew.

2345
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:19,180
- You're a real foodie.
- Of course.

2346
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,610
- You're a foodie.
- "Of course."

2347
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,150
- The bridge?
- Do you know the bridge has a name?

2348
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:28,550
- What is it?
- The Bridge of Hope.

2349
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:29,720
- "Hope?"
- Yes.

2350
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,490
That was what was written.

2351
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:33,890
- Are we crossing the Bridge of Hope?
- Yes.

2352
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,370
- What?
- It's just...

2353
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,900
fascinating and fun.

2354
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:50,310
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2355
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:52,850
Welcome. This way, please.

2356
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,120
I'm quite good at making somaek.

2357
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,220
- Really?
- But...

2358
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,920
I'm worried.

2359
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,860
What if you get drunk
because it's so good?

2360
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,160
Here's your beer.

2361
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,030
Why is this making me nervous?

2362
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:11,700
(Making somaek)

2363
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,230
(Focused)

2364
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,010
(A little)

2365
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:25,510
(The golden ratio seems questionable.)

2366
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,250
You didn't put much beer in.

2367
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,150
Should I try it first?
I'll try to see if it's good.

2368
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,490
Cheers.

2369
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,990
(Curious)

2370
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:40,060
- It's delicious.
- It is?

2371
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:46,570
- It's good. But it's quite strong.
- Is it strong?

2372
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:47,900
- Do you want more beer?
- Yes.

2373
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,600
That was amazing for me.

2374
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:53,840
(Je Yeon adds more beer.)

2375
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:54,940
It's good.

2376
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,180
What did you say your drinking habit was?

2377
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:06,220
I just go to sleep.

2378
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,950
But I do get hyper.

2379
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,760
And I...

2380
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,630
become quite honest.

2381
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,760
Although I'm already honest.

2382
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:17,560
- You become more honest?
- Exactly.

2383
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:19,970
I see.

2384
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:21,570
I'm a little worried today.

2385
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,870
- Let's have three bottles today.
- What?

2386
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:24,870
(Shocked)

2387
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,270
I need to see you drunk today.

2388
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,740
(Je Yeon has decided to become proactive.)

2389
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:31,180
Je Yeon!

2390
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,680
- She's hitting on him, right?
- Yes.

2391
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,310
Men love that.

2392
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,350
(Je Yeon's provocation)

2393
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,380
(Clearing his throat)

2394
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,820
I have half of that at a time.

2395
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,430
Half of this?

2396
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:50,160
It's so good.

2397
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,530
- What's your drinking habit?
- What?

2398
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:55,670
Your drinking habit.

2399
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,000
Me? I get sleepy.

2400
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,540
I get sleepy.

2401
01:43:58,540 --> 01:43:59,640
You get sleepy?

2402
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,910
- I do.
- That's bad.

2403
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:05,210
To be honest,

2404
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:06,380
I'm quite curious.

2405
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,410
- My drunk state?
- Yes.

2406
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,520
Not when you're completely drunk,

2407
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,720
- Tipsy?
- but a little tipsy.

2408
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,320
I'm a little curious.

2409
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,260
Je Yeon has never shown her messy self.

2410
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:18,790
I'm tipsy right now.

2411
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:22,390
Ji Min is in total bliss right now.

2412
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,600
I'm serious.

2413
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,730
Stop drinking.

2414
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:29,670
(Je Yeon is tipsy
from three sips of somaek.)

2415
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,140
Should I cut it into small pieces?

2416
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,770
Should I cut it into small pieces?

2417
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:34,940
Yes, please.

2418
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,350
- Tell me if it's too big.
- Okay.

2419
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:45,880
(Watching attentively)

2420
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:48,420
Help her with the perilla leaf.

2421
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:51,960
Let me help.

2422
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:55,690
It's garlic leaf.

2423
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:57,700
(Amazed)

2424
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,760
- Right?
- Yes.

2425
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,300
(Happy)

2426
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:02,570
Do you want it on a plate or as is?

2427
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:04,770
Should I ask for a new plate?
Do you want it cut?

2428
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,840
- He's very sweet.
- Kimchi.

2429
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:11,610
(The man who takes care of everything)

2430
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:14,210
It's not like that
when it's just the two of us outside.

2431
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,780
But when we're at the house
with everyone else,

2432
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,520
you become a hedgehog.

2433
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:27,160
(He's usually quite difficult
like a hedgehog.)

2434
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,890
We talked without a break.

2435
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,930
(He can come off as sharp at times.)

2436
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:33,630
Je Yeon is the type to say things
she doesn't like.

2437
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:35,400
It could be because...

2438
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,370
I'm from Gyeongsang Province.

2439
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,410
When in a crowd, I become awkward.

2440
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:45,410
- You become shy?
- It's awkward to care for you more.

2441
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:49,610
I turn into an elementary school student.

2442
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,220
How frank of him.

2443
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,350
I'll stop.

2444
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:54,120
Really?

2445
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,420
I'll stop.

2446
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,860
(I'll stop.)

2447
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:03,130
I'm easily embarrassed.

2448
01:46:07,230 --> 01:46:09,030
(Making their hearts throb)

2449
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:10,700
What he said was really nice.

2450
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,000
He'll stop.

2451
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,170
(Excited to the maximum)

2452
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:16,910
That's what makes women
fall in love with men.

2453
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:18,510
- Really?
- Totally.

2454
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:21,910
It's not easy for anyone to say
that they'll change.

2455
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:23,520
Putting in the effort...

2456
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,850
- It's cool.
- Putting in the effort...

2457
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:25,920
(Ji Min is the best.)

2458
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,820
Cheers.

2459
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:30,260
(In front of Je Yeon,)

2460
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:34,590
(Ji Min becomes a gentle sheep.)

2461
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,500
Do you think...

2462
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,930
there are aspects
that would make you think,

2463
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:44,700
"He's the one?"

2464
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,870
Is there something
that'll make you feel...

2465
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:52,480
you want to go far
with this certain someone?

2466
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:57,120
(Curious)

2467
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:01,450
When talking with him is fun and relaxing,
and we hit it off well.

2468
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:02,620
When you mix well and feel comfortable?

2469
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:05,090
When you feel at ease with him?

2470
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,990
That's very important.

2471
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,860
- They click in that area, right?
- Yes.

2472
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,130
(When together, they become honest.)

2473
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,570
They had a drawing together.

2474
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:20,070
(Laughing as they are)

2475
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:22,010
A person you can laugh with sincerely.

2476
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:23,340
That's very important.

2477
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,710
(Je Yeon dreams of a relaxed love.)

2478
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:27,410
It looks easy, but it's hard, isn't it?

2479
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:28,480
Yes.

2480
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:32,550
(Nodding)

2481
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,820
What about you?
Do you have such an aspect too?

2482
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:38,760
What? Me?

2483
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:41,030
When I see...

2484
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:45,400
something to admire.

2485
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:52,270
Yes. That's important too.

2486
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,110
The moment I feel that,

2487
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,110
she becomes a much greater person.

2488
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,450
And I like it.

2489
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:06,590
It's like she has my back.

2490
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:16,330
(Glancing)

2491
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:20,170
The questions on today's date
are good ones.

2492
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:21,830
They only have three days together.

2493
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:24,040
Two days should be spent
on such conversations.

2494
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,040
Where was the restroom again?

2495
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:28,040
Restroom? It's outside.

2496
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,410
I'll be right back.

2497
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:37,150
(While Ji Min is using the restroom)

2498
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:41,050
(Looking)

2499
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:43,860
(She digs into the doenjang stew.)

2500
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,960
(Her hand is busy.)

2501
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:51,260
She's even mixing rice.

2502
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,970
Cute.

2503
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:57,400
Je Yeon took a lot of care.

2504
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:05,110
Oh, my.

2505
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:09,150
(She doesn't forget
to check her appearance.)

2506
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,250
She got caught.

2507
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:16,550
- You became fair again.
- I was surprised to look in the mirror.

2508
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,720
I think it was just good enough.

2509
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,630
You were red in a cute way. Elegantly.

2510
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:23,660
You look elegant.

2511
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,130
That will do.

2512
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:28,800
He speaks nicely.

2513
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:31,300
It's fun to drink soju with you.

2514
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,510
How long...

2515
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,810
do you want to date
before getting married?

2516
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:44,450
It doesn't matter, but at least a year?

2517
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,920
Do you keep in touch often?

2518
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,690
I think it should be both ways.

2519
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,560
I have to talk on the phone at night.

2520
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,090
Every night?

2521
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,330
Just do our own things
while on speakerphone.

2522
01:49:58,230 --> 01:50:00,570
I like talking for 2 to 3 hours like that.

2523
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,070
Cheers.

2524
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,240
Any pose you want?

2525
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,540
Do you know this one?

2526
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:08,540
Let's do that.

2527
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:09,870
- Is that okay?
- To each other's faces?

2528
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:11,280
- Yes.
- Then...

2529
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:13,580
(My goodness)

2530
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,080
"To each other's faces?"

2531
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,450
That's so cute.

2532
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:18,620
She's cute.

2533
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:19,720
(Chung Ah also falls for her.)

2534
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,920
- Is that okay?
- To each other's faces?

2535
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,020
- Yes.
- Then...

2536
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:25,190
(Sullen)

2537
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:30,200
But...

2538
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,300
This is good. Eat.

2539
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:33,430
(It's the battle of a spear and a shield.)

2540
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,740
Let's take it here.

2541
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:41,070
- This or that?
- This.

2542
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,280
- What do I do? Is this right?
- Yes.

2543
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,910
That's cute.

2544
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:50,380
Je Yeon's more relaxed now.

2545
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,250
What's the next one? Hurry. Flower petals.

2546
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,090
(Laughing)

2547
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,560
(They fail to hold back.)

2548
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:07,000
One more time?

2549
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:08,730
- One more time?
- One more time?

2550
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:10,270
Let's do it again.

2551
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:12,300
There. Look here.

2552
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,980
- My gosh!
- Yes. That's what they need.

2553
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:19,980
Good.

2554
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:22,980
This looks pretty.

2555
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,820
- That was pretty fun.
- Yes, it was fun.

2556
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,130
- We did what I wanted.
- Yes.

2557
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,300
Let's check each other's appearance.

2558
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,040
- Check each other's appearance?
- Yes.

2559
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,270
No.

2560
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,440
- Let's check each other.
- No.

2561
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:52,640
(On alert)

2562
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:55,410
You can check me.

2563
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:56,410
Okay.

2564
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,550
I can't trust you.

2565
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:03,860
- Why not?
- That was only a split second.

2566
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:06,830
I can tell at a glance.

2567
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:13,730
It's open.

2568
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:15,400
It's been open the whole time.

2569
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,100
(Patting)

2570
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,700
- That was smooth.
- It was open the whole time?

2571
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:20,410
- Yes, the whole time.
- The whole time?

2572
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:22,240
- Yes.
- I didn't know because I sat in front.

2573
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:24,440
I opened it on purpose.

2574
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,740
It'd be nice to see the stars from here.

2575
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,680
Han River.

2576
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,420
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

2577
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,890
You're more charming when you're drunk.

2578
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,920
What are you saying? I'm not drunk.

2579
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,790
You look like a different person.

2580
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,660
- You think so?
- You become more friendly.

2581
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,100
Yes.

2582
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,370
(Glancing)

2583
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:52,000
(Staring)

2584
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,310
- We need to differentiate it.
- I see.

2585
01:53:01,210 --> 01:53:03,010
(Staring)

2586
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,350
Are you opening your eyes wide?

2587
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:07,020
How did you know? Can you tell?

2588
01:53:09,490 --> 01:53:10,890
Can you tell? Really?

2589
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,190
I was practicing...

2590
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:17,730
because that was what I was going to do
once we arrived.

2591
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:22,970
(They spent the day...)

2592
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:26,500
(getting to know each other.)

2593
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,840
(They're funny and cute.)

2594
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,940
That's cute.

2595
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:31,640
I think...

2596
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:35,810
the humble soju place was a good idea
for the date.

2597
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,550
- Yes, with pork belly.
- I agree.

2598
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,820
It was great.

2599
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:40,450
It was nice and relaxing.

2600
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,550
- It was evident...
- Yes.

2601
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:45,160
that he's a very caring person
throughout the date.

2602
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,990
- He's pretty much a butler.
- Right.

2603
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:48,790
- He's basically her butler.
- And...

2604
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:50,430
there was something that impressed me.

2605
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:52,030
She ate only when Ji Min wasn't there.

2606
01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:53,900
(She went for the bowl of rice
when he was away.)

2607
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:57,200
While he went to the restroom,
she almost finished the bowl of rice.

2608
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,700
- I think she ate more than half.
- Yes.

2609
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,270
- Half of it was gone.
- It was gone. She finished it.

2610
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:02,640
(She unlocked her belly.)

2611
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:04,740
Do you think Je Yeon
had a change of heart?

2612
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,580
- I think she did.
- Yes?

2613
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,950
Maybe she took a few steps closer?

2614
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:09,950
I think she saw him in a new light.

2615
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:11,750
- Saw him in a new light?
- Yes.

2616
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:13,480
- She saw him in a new light.
- She saw Ji Min in a new light.

2617
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:16,320
- Right.
- She found a new side of him.

2618
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:17,960
- Yes.
- Right.

2619
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:21,960
- Ji Min.
- Yes?

2620
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,030
Okay. I'll use that tonight.

2621
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:28,930
Je Yeon,
what perfume are you wearing today?

2622
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,040
I'm not wearing any perfume today.

2623
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,070
- What's that smell?
- Maybe the shampoo?

2624
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:34,840
- The shampoo?
- Yes.

2625
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,310
- Let me use it later.
- Sure.

2626
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,940
You said you used this.
I'll shampoo three times.

2627
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,810
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2628
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:46,750
(One sunny day)

2629
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,850
- This place is so pretty.
- Right?

2630
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:53,760
(The female residents are here
for a financial consultation.)

2631
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,560
Has any of you ever received
this consultation before?

2632
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:58,960
Not me.

2633
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,830
- This is my first time too.
- Right.

2634
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

2635
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:06,870
If you get married after dating,

2636
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:09,810
you need to know
each other's financial state.

2637
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:11,010
Do you have any goals?

2638
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:13,240
That you want to get married
before a certain age?

2639
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:15,810
(Shy)

2640
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:19,020
- I want to get married before 30.
- Before 30?

2641
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:22,320
I'll tell you what you need to know
about finance...

2642
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,190
- before you get married.
- Okay.

2643
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,060
You need to share how much you have
and how much you make.

2644
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:30,500
You need to set a financial goal together.

2645
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,060
You also need to check...

2646
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:36,000
each other's spending habits.

2647
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,870
Do any of you have a plan
to have any children?

2648
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,670
- About 2.
- About 2?

2649
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:42,170
- Me too.
- Two?

2650
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:45,810
If you get help from experts...

2651
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:46,910
on your family plan,

2652
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:50,210
it'll help you create a stable family.

2653
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:52,780
The fact that you're here
for a consultation...

2654
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:55,620
means you're a step closer
to creating a happy family.

2655
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:59,020
I'm sure you'll be able to create a family
that is happier than anyone else's.

2656
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:00,590
(The last day
of the contract relationship)

2657
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:02,890
(A special date for the last day)

2658
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:04,430
(This is my type.)

2659
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:05,730
(It's your type.)

2660
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:08,630
(They face their emotions...)

2661
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:10,670
(and feel new emotions.)

2662
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,210
(I wish they'd go,
"Do you want to extend the contract?")

2663
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:16,110
(Anything new
with the contract relationship?)

2664
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:18,310
(I knew we got along.)

2665
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:20,080
(They became more earnest.)

2666
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,180
We've already spent two weeks.

2667
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,920
He was a hedgehog.

2668
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,980
A puppy that wants to be a fox.

2669
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,090
How am I going to see your face tomorrow?

2670
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:30,360
I'll look for you.

2671
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,730
I never expected anyone to come.

2672
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:43,200
That's your second glass already.

2673
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,470
Hi.

2674
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:47,110
I was supposed to come here today.

2675
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:48,510
He looked like a celebrity.

2676
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:49,910
There are many pretty faces.

2677
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:53,750
He could sway anyone.

2678
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,950
Is he here to throw something?

2679
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:59,320
I wanted to talk after reading the book.

2680
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:00,450
You don't know, do you?

2681
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:02,650
I was shocked.

2682
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,420
We should dine out later.

2683
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:05,820
It's unbelievable.

2684
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,190
I want to get to know him.
