1
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,440
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,470
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,670
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,170
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,080
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,140
(Psychology expert, Park Ji Seon)

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,940
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,380
Last week, the second
contract relationships finally began.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,580
Sang Yun and Je Yeon,

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,550
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun,

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,320
Woo Jae and Ha Neul,

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,060
Ji Min and Ji Won,

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,790
and Chang Hwan and Soo Ah.
These five couples were paired.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,630
And the one
who caught the most attention...

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,830
was the second female catfish,

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,730
- Soo Ah.
- Right, Soo Ah.

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,470
Personally, I was impressed...

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,040
- by her intense eyes.
- Yes.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,740
By the way, Chang Hwan...

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,410
couldn't meet Soo Ah's eyes.

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,880
I'm so curious about
what kind of tension he felt.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,510
I wondered, "Is that love at first sight?"

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
I kept thinking about it on my way home.

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,620
I hope things work out well this time.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,520
- Please.
- Please.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,790
- Also, Sang Yun and Je Yeon...
- Yes?

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,890
(They cannot help but watch Sang Yun
and Je Yeon with their hands together.)

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,130
The ice rink in the snow was really...

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,560
- unforgettable.
- A date on an ice rink...

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,630
- is seen in movies.
- I know.

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,200
I guess the viewers...

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
must have been seriously immersed.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- The Almighty helped their date.
- Right.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,500
The weather helped their date.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,810
What I feel a bit sorry about...

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,710
is that it would have been nicer...

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,780
if they had skated a bit better.

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,210
- The skating?
- They were...

39
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,080
walking with quick steps.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,780
For me, the fact that they weren't good
was romantic.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,850
- That was charming as well.
- Right.

42
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,750
They weren't good,
so they could hold hands.

43
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,750
They might have pretended
they weren't good because of that.

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,390
That's possible. They're good actors.

45
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,130
And they didn't talk much,
and I loved that.

46
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,930
With a few words,
it was enough to feel fluttered.

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,100
(They were not talkative,
but their hearts fluttered.)

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,530
Sang Yun and Je Yeon...

49
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,200
had an impressive date,

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,640
and that energy would remain
even after they went home.

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,510
- So I'm excited...
- Yes.

52
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,410
- and worried about someone's heart.
- Right.

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,040
Their date made me feel that.

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,680
He basically is a person...

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,150
who expresses his emotions a lot.

56
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,180
Right.

57
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,380
- Ji Min and Sang Yun are opposites.
- Right.

58
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,720
- I wonder where Je Yeon's heart will go.
- Exactly.

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
- Both are charming.
- Yes.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,020
- They're quite charming.
- And...

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,330
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun were finally...

62
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,330
- paired for a contract relationship.
- Yes.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,230
- I had no idea they had the same hobbies.
- Right.

64
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,200
They must have been married
in their past lives.

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,970
They like to play with Legos
and board games.

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,470
They have things in common,
such as hobbies and tastes.

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,910
- Right.
- It's important.

68
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Then,

69
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,040
let's say you're a resident
of Heart Pairing, Chung Ah.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,980
Among the five residents,
which one charms you the most?

71
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,410
- I'm curious.
- Me?

72
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,150
(Contemplating)

73
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,720
In fact, many friends have
asked me the same question.

74
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,990
(Excited)

75
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,990
My goodness.

76
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,590
- I'm being partial. Can I say it?
- It's okay.

77
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,430
- It's all right.
- Be partial and select only one person.

78
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,030
To be honest,
when Ji Min expressed his feelings,

79
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,800
I was so moved,
and he caught my attention.

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
However, in a long-term perspective,

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,170
I'd choose the one with whom
I expect less emotional turmoil.

82
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,170
You answered ambiguously,

83
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,240
- but it means Sang Yun, after all.
- She chose Sang Yun.

84
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,310
These days, because of Heart Pairing,

85
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm having a mental breakdown.

86
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,150
Which person will match me?

87
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,180
That's what I'm saying.

88
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,050
(Spotting the Difference)

89
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,050
I feel tipsy now.

90
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,790
- Do you?
- Yes.

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,690
You can take a break.

92
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,230
Isn't this glass cute?

93
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,030
I'll bring one more bottle
and heat this up with more water.

94
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,780
How come this place feels so familiar...

95
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,320
already?

96
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,220
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon
are back after their date.)

97
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,660
- It's Sang Yun.
- Hi, Je Yeon.

98
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,790
(Hi.)

99
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,590
(Hi.)

100
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,200
- I'll see you when you're downstairs.
- Okay.

101
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,910
She looks beautiful.

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,610
- Do you want some more?
- Yes.

103
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,120
If they join us, we need to move
to the living room.

104
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,620
Are other people not back yet?

105
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,190
- They just came back.
- We have one couple left.

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,060
You can sit there.

107
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,240
Come here.

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,840
We need to sit on the floor.

110
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,680
Otherwise, we don't have enough space.

111
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,040
Come here.

112
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,780
Sang Yun is taking care of Je Yeon.

113
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,790
I forgot to bring the opener.

114
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,420
It's a bit cold.

115
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,690
Do you feel cold?

116
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,620
Is anyone using that?

117
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,860
- We have one more.
- Do you want to use this?

118
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,290
What a considerate guy.

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,010
How would he feel now?

120
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,140
(Tight-lipped)

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,910
(A sudden silence)

122
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,980
It's not easy.

123
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,750
(Reading the room)

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,520
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm not. I'm fine.

125
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,630
You're wearing a short-sleeved shirt.

126
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,300
Ji Min said he felt hot.

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,700
- Really?
- I feel a little hot.

128
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,960
We drank a lot.

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,500
Did you drink a lot?

130
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,940
We came back early.

131
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,940
We drank two bottles
over spicy chicken stew.

132
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,140
(A moment ago)

133
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,440
I love drinking with my girlfriend.

134
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,380
Je Yeon likes to drink a little,

135
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,220
doesn't she? This tastes good.

136
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,050
Right. I'm not getting drunk.

137
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
(The 1st round is over already.)

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,620
It tastes very good.

139
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,560
(Two bottles?)

140
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,760
No, one bottle.

141
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,730
I didn't know you could drink a lot,
Ji Won.

142
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,570
Why are you feeling so sleepy?

143
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,040
- I guess Ji Won is drunk.
- No, I'm not.

144
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,870
- Is it sesame oil?
- If you add a bit of sesame oil,

145
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,010
it tastes better.

146
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,110
This tastes so good.

147
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,280
Does it? I didn't have enough time
to cook it.

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,350
- It tastes so good.
- I'm glad to hear that.

149
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,020
Did the two of you guess...

150
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,720
- who would be paired with whom?
- We didn't.

151
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,090
You didn't.

152
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,290
It's because...

153
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,420
They didn't need to.

154
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,460
- They didn't have to.
- They didn't have to.

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,860
She's conscious of Ji Min.

156
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,200
Does anyone want this?

157
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,540
I'd like to,
but I think I'll join you a bit later.

158
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,110
Then...

159
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,550
- Chan Hyeong and the catfish...
- Chae Eun.

160
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,990
- It tastes good.
- Is it good?

161
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,790
Are you going to just watch her?

162
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,100
I'll try not to disturb
while they're a couple.

163
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,630
Je Yeon is so sweet...

164
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,600
that she tries to be considerate
of the other person.

165
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,970
That's understandable.

166
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,770
So I don't want to make her
feel uncomfortable,

167
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,270
and I want to behave
like I'm broad-minded,

168
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,580
but I'm struggling inside.

169
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,550
Imagine the 2 of them up there
having a conversation for 4 hours today,

170
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,250
until 3 a.m.

171
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,480
Would you be able to go to sleep?

172
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,650
- I wouldn't.
- That's how I feel.

173
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,160
Even if Woo Jae is on a date,
he'd be conscious of you.

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,230
Woo Jae might not be.

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,190
Anyone can tell he is.
What are you saying?

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Woo Jae and I talk a lot.

177
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,770
He's kind of cute.

178
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Right.

179
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,210
Je Yeon is cute too.

180
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,210
You're solid inside.

181
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,260
She expressed as much as she could.

182
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,360
That's enough.

183
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,390
What happens after that...

184
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,100
isn't something I can control.

185
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,430
So I'd rather just watch it.

186
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Right.

187
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,410
It's cold.

188
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,380
Ji Min has a lot on his mind now.

189
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,110
(Trying to watch her silently)

190
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,120
This is a shirt.
I thought it was a blanket.

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,850
- It's my shirt.
- Isn't it a blanket?

192
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,690
It's a shirt.

193
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,830
Sang Yun is on guard.

194
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,800
I don't know.

195
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,510
(Chang Hwan and Soo Ah
are back after the date.)

196
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,510
Do you feel nervous?

197
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,940
Still, after having a meal,

198
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm relaxed.

199
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm carrying my bag on one shoulder here.

200
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,150
She talks smoothly.

201
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,620
- I know.
- I feel so nervous.

202
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,420
- She's tall too.
- I know how you feel now.

203
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,320
Soo Ah is clearly different from others.

204
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,490
Right. She's definitely different.

205
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,860
She doesn't hesitate, even when she walks.

206
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,860
(Soo Ah enters the Pairing House.)

207
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,630
Oh, my. How would they respond?

208
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,930
Hello.

209
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,970
Someone is here.

210
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
- It's the newcomer.
- It's the newcomer.

211
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,540
- Where?
- It's amazing.

212
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,240
(Nervous feelings...)

213
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,210
- It's unbelievable.
- It's amazing.

214
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,780
- Did you see her?
- Je Yeon is cute.

215
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,450
(Everyone pauses.)

216
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,280
Shall we go meet them first?

217
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

218
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,650
Hello.

219
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,090
Hello.

220
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

221
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Hello.

223
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,730
(Bowing)

224
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,130
- It's nice to meet you.
- This is...

225
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,400
Kim Soo Ah.

226
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
My name is Kim Soo Ah.

227
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,930
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

228
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,970
- Shall we join them?
- Please have a seat. Let's shove up.

229
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,310
- It's like introducing his girlfriend.
- I know.

230
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,940
- But it's true she's his girlfriend.
- They're in a contract relationship.

231
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,210
Give me your coat.

232
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,580
You can have a seat.

233
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,750
He sure is a sweet guy.

234
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

235
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,820
- Is she here?
- Go and see her.

236
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
Really?

237
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,390
- Here she is.
- Is that true?

238
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,090
- I haven't met her.
- Chan Hyeong!

239
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,530
I'll go to the bathroom quickly.

240
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
- Why did you change your clothes?
- It was so hot.

242
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,200
(Flopping down)

243
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,770
Why?

244
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,040
- What is it?
- I was just curious.

245
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,410
(Glancing)

246
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,110
You can put it there. No, give it to me.

247
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,980
Am I dressed too casually now?

248
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,190
I got a call.

249
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,320
I guess I need to wear jeans, at least.

250
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,630
You can go and get changed.

251
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,870
- This tastes good.
- Does it?

252
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,340
Is that how you got changed?

253
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,400
Do you think
I need to change the shirt too?

254
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
You can wear a cardigan over that.

255
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,970
I'll take back my shirt
if Je Yeon doesn't feel cold later.

256
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,010
I think I'll sit here.

257
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
What did you have?

258
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,780
We had grilled eel on rice.

259
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,450
- Like this?
- Really?

260
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,780
It must have been fun.

261
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,150
- Excuse me?
- It must have been fun.

262
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,050
You're such a good cook.

263
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,420
This is very easy to make.

264
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,220
- They weren't paired.
- I see.

265
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,520
I couldn't taste it
after I finished cooking.

266
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,030
- It's perfect for my taste.
- Is it?

267
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,530
If you add a bit more sugar,
it tastes less sour.

268
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,130
So like this?

269
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,500
- Right.
- It's good.

270
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,130
How come you're sitting so far?

271
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,240
There's no space.

272
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,300
- The two of them...
- I see.

273
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,370
Okay.

274
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,140
- There's not enough space.
- I'm curious.

275
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,210
How did we all sit here before?

276
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,910
It's because we have two more people.

277
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,480
- That's why he's sitting there.
- So...

278
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,020
(Silent for a moment)

279
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,990
Do you think it's okay?

280
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,230
You brought this.

281
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,860
It's been a while.

282
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,370
What's this? Did you buy it?

283
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,530
- Yes.
- I see.

284
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,470
What did you have for dinner?

285
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,140
We...

286
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,210
Thank you.

287
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,410
- What did we have?
- Have a drink.

288
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,510
You can have a drink.

289
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,710
Wait a second. I need to gather my wits.

290
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,550
We can wait.

291
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,720
I'm confused now.

292
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,850
He must be feeling nervous.

293
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,090
(Sudden lagging of his mind)

294
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,890
- I guess you're confused.
- You just came back.

295
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,460
(Loading)

296
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
He's feeling shy.

297
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,690
What have you been doing?

298
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I first met her...

299
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,670
It's been a long while...

300
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,470
since I saw Chang Hwan like that,
and I love it.

301
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,470
(Standing up suddenly)

302
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,110
Being considerate is his second nature.

303
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,710
- Have a seat here.
- Thank you.

304
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,980
Shall we toast?

305
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,690
Would you like to have this?
Shall I fill your glass?

306
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,960
Should we...

307
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,990
Would you like some wine?

308
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,860
What?

309
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,370
- Shall I introduce her?
- Yes, please.

310
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,770
I'll give a simple introduction.

311
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
I forgot to wear perfume.

312
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,410
Today?

313
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,470
I thought I'd stop by the house
and take you out.

314
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,480
I was going to wear it then
so that it smells fresh...

315
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,610
and put you in the car.

316
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,680
I wear only a wood scent when I meet you.

317
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
It smelled nice.

318
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,390
I liked the perfume you were wearing.

319
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm not sure when it was.

320
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,760
I smelled it
when you went down the stairs.

321
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,860
- What was I wearing?
- I don't remember when it was.

322
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,400
(Spraying the perfume here and there)

323
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,440
It's a good strategy to make people
remember you by your scent.

324
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,450
Really?

325
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,350
(Only Je Yeon understands
Ji Min's signal.)

326
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,850
Je Yeon must have a lot on her mind now.

327
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,650
Shall we make a toast...

328
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,020
- All right.
- now that all of us are here?

329
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,720
- Okay. Cheers.
- Cheers.

330
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,330
A soju glass too.

331
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,000
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,430
It's crowded now. There are ten people.

333
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,770
(All ten residents are here.)

334
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,770
I'm Kim Soo Ah, born in 1993.

335
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,010
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

336
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,610
And my current occupation is...

337
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,450
- No.
- We need to guess. Wait a minute.

338
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
She might have told us.

339
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,150
- This is fun.
- It was close.

340
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,120
This is our routine.

341
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,150
We guess what you do,

342
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,020
and you guess what we do.

343
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,260
- Right.
- That's how we do it.

344
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,990
Guessing.

345
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,330
(Thinking carefully)

346
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,170
I wonder...

347
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,770
if you're a healthcare worker.

348
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,070
I said exactly the same thing.

349
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
A flight attendant?

350
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,210
Thank you.

351
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,440
That means she isn't one.

352
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,710
That's cute.

353
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,680
This is so fun when I know the answer.

354
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,050
It's fun in a different way.

355
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,390
I never guessed it right.

356
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,460
I think you could be
an instructor for EBS.

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,690
- Like a top-tier instructor?
- Yes.

358
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,690
- That suits her.
- Yes.

359
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
- She fits the image of an ethics teacher.
- Yes.

360
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,700
Or a math teacher.

361
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,230
- That suits her image too.
- She looks like she'd be a good teacher.

362
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,260
- Right.
- Yes.

363
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,970
- Are we all wrong?
- Are we all wrong?

364
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,770
- All of our guesses were wrong.
- What is it? I wonder what it is.

365
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,110
I'm the general manager
of the HR department...

366
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,740
at a fashion company.

367
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,350
As for my age, I was born in 1993.

368
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm an office worker.

369
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,380
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

370
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,190
- Isn't she cool?
- Yes.

371
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,590
- Now, the tables have turned.
- Right.

372
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,790
- You have to guess our job.
- She should try that.

373
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,120
- She should.
- I have to guess everyone's?

374
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,060
- Well, it's for fun.
- You can just guess.

375
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,630
- "He looks like he could be this."
- You can start with him.

376
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,730
I'm getting the feeling
that you work in the IT sector.

377
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,200
You look like a doctor.

378
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,240
Were you in an idol group before?

379
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
I think you might be an instructor.

380
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,670
I think you might be a flight attendant.

381
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,280
You look like a ballet teacher.

382
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
Yes.

383
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,280
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

384
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,850
(Hesitant)

385
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,550
I'm Korean.

386
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,320
He made a joke.

387
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,460
- He's so funny.
- Seriously.

388
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,160
Your jokes are funny today.

389
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,130
Do you run a farm or something?

390
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,100
(He instantly turns into a farm owner.)

391
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,870
- She doesn't feel awkward.
- She has such a bubbly personality.

392
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,270
- Do you run a farm or something?
- Right.

393
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,940
I want to run a farm.

394
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,770
What kind of farm would that be?

395
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,270
- I guess you grow vegetables.
- Chae Eun, you're having too much fun.

396
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,810
- My gosh.
- She's having too much fun.

397
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,310
- She's having a blast.
- Why is she having so much fun?

398
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,380
- You're way too excited.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,750
I'm sorry.

400
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
- She has a day off tomorrow.
- Tell us.

401
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,780
- She's on fire.
- What kind of farm?

402
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,050
A cattle farm.

403
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,090
- A rich farm owner. Like a plantation.
- A plantation.

404
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,120
A plantation.

405
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,360
She's having too much fun.

406
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,330
It was so funny when she mentioned "farm."

407
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,130
Chae Eun, stop it.

408
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I'll behave.

409
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,270
But I like it. A plantation owner.

410
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,670
- Yes, a plantation.
- A plantation.

411
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,700
I knew it.

412
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,640
Usually, he's the life of the party.

413
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,140
- Really?
- Yes.

414
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,650
He's witty.

415
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,810
You should lighten the mood more.

416
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,480
You said you were going to drink
this weekend.

417
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,550
- Right.
- Yes.

418
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,650
- I did. I thought you'd come home early.
- He already drank a few.

419
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,420
I was going to pregame,
so I got into the partying mood.

420
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,690
You already had a head start,

421
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,160
but we came home
when things were dying down for you.

422
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,260
Gosh, he opened a bottle of soju.

423
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,500
- Today...
- Did you drink soju?

424
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,260
Ji Won and I drank pretty fast.

425
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,570
- Ji Min drank more than me.
- Really?

426
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,630
My alcohol tolerance isn't high.

427
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,700
And I drank fast today.

428
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,310
(Staring)

429
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,550
The first person to grab my attention
was Ji Min.

430
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,190
I'm still trying to figure out why.

431
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,860
He was sitting down on the sofa
with a blank expression.

432
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,530
He didn't seem to
have a care in the world.

433
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,060
Sitting there with a blank expression
was quite refreshing on the first day.

434
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,000
- My gosh.
- Should we tell you our name and age?

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,530
- I see.
- Right.

436
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,100
Je Yeon left the strongest impression
on me.

437
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,040
She didn't say anything. She just smiled.

438
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,510
But from the way I sensed it, it seemed...

439
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,380
she was one of them.

440
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,550
My gosh, this is making me nervous.

441
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,350
You're joining us
halfway through this program.

442
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
- Yes.
- You must be quite nervous.

443
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,650
- Right.
- I was very nervous...

444
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,690
because you already spent
three weeks together.

445
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,860
- Right. It's been that long.
- Right?

446
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,490
That's a long time.

447
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,230
Since I would be joining you guys
halfway through the program,

448
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,130
I wondered if I would fit in...

449
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,270
or be able to get to know everyone fast.

450
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,300
But I think that won't be a problem.

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,940
So I feel relieved.

452
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,540
I don't even remember
what we talked about over our meal.

453
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,280
- You're more nervous than her.
- Right, you're more nervous.

454
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
You seem more nervous.

455
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,850
Put yourself in my shoes.
I was completely shocked.

456
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,080
- Why?
- Because...

457
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,450
I had no idea that
I would meet someone new.

458
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,750
Right.

459
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,490
I didn't know that would be me.

460
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,760
He seems a bit intimidated.

461
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,290
You have broad shoulders,
but they look narrow today.

462
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,430
I'll have narrow shoulders today.

463
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,630
- He doesn't know what to do.
- Did you read all the books?

464
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,270
- I read all the books.
- Really?

465
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
- Right.
- Then...

466
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,000
which one was your first pick?

467
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,770
The yellow book was the most...

468
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,900
- memorable.
- That's the most popular one.

469
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,910
Right.

470
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,970
We need to study the yellow book
to see how he answered the questions.

471
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,880
- I guess I did a good job.
- You did a good job.

472
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,010
You really did.

473
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,410
I think the blue book
was my next favorite.

474
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,220
It was a vibrant shade of blue.

475
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,320
- I see.
- The blue book.

476
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
(Nodding)

477
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,450
- Did you also read the brown book?
- Yes.

478
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,820
That was my next choice.

479
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,390
- I won 3rd place.
- You're in the top 3.

480
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,760
- Look at his face.
- I didn't come last.

481
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,490
Did I come last?

482
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't remember the next color.

483
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,400
- They both came in last.
- We both came in last.

484
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,670
I think they were about the same.

485
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,200
- I own a plantation.
- That's understandable.

486
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,310
Did you drop the honorifics?

487
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,510
- Things are more comfortable now.
- We did get more comfortable.

488
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,810
But not yet. It was the same for me.

489
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,680
I became chatty
once I stopped feeling nervous.

490
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
- Right.
- Once I felt comfortable...

491
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,980
- She's the same way. She's way more...
- Yes.

492
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,650
cheerful than she seems.

493
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,060
She might be leading our group
pretty soon.

494
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,730
She's got a great personality.

495
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,860
Having him by your side
would make you feel so safe.

496
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,100
When he thoughtfully
takes care of people around him,

497
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,470
I want to learn from him.
He really inspires me.

498
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,100
- I can tell he's interested in her.
- Yes.

499
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
That's right.

500
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,380
He's my roommate.
The guy I told you about.

501
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,640
- Really?
- The one...

502
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,340
- The guy you're close to.
- I talk to every night.

503
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,810
We can't stop talking at night.

504
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,810
Right.

505
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,550
Why did you tell her that
on your first date?

506
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,950
Well, it's not what you think.

507
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,550
Okay.

508
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,320
I've never seen Chang Hwan
acting cute like that.

509
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,520
- Why are you shy?
- How should I put it?

510
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,090
You're being cute.

511
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,990
I want to bite you.

512
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,160
Please don't do that.

513
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,070
- Everyone...
- She lives...

514
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,400
- around Konkuk University Station.
- Yes.

515
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,970
I live around Konkuk University Station.

516
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,880
- Were you born and raised in Seoul?
- Yes, I was.

517
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,740
- I'm from Pohang.
- Pohang.

518
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm from Busan.

519
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,550
You can tell, right?

520
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,620
- Why did you say that?
- I sensed it.

521
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,120
When I said, "Busan," she nodded.

522
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,060
When I met you for the first time,
I thought you were funny.

523
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,190
- It's...
- Wait.

524
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,890
You weren't like this
when we met for the first time.

525
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,330
- He's feeling comfortable now.
- Right.

526
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,630
- He's...
- He's comfortable around us now.

527
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,000
- He's comfortable.
- The intention...

528
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,430
- Woo Jae enjoys this.
- Enjoy what?

529
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,500
It's great to be the funny guy.

530
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,900
- Right. It can be your strong suit.
- Yes.

531
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,170
But you used to be his subscriber.

532
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
- You were subscribed to his channel.
- Yes.

533
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,410
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

534
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,080
- Tomorrow night,
- Let's drink soju together.

535
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,420
- let's do something fun.
- Let's do that.

536
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,450
- Like what?
- It could be anything.

537
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,520
Like Truth or Dare?

538
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,560
Gosh, that's... Wait,
are you confident that you won't get hurt?

539
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,130
- No.
- Exactly.

540
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,190
I don't feel confident either.

541
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,300
(The pathetic brothers
don't want to get hurt.)

542
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
- They're indeed roommates.
- There are many feeling types here.

543
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
This was clearly a Type F moment.

544
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,630
- This isn't right.
- No.

545
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,570
There's something off
about the energy in our room.

546
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,710
- He's so funny.
- He gets so sentimental...

547
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,140
at night.

548
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,040
We take turns to get sentimental
in our room.

549
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,740
Darkness slowly engulfs our room.

550
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,780
- What? That's not it.
- That's not it.

551
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,180
By the way, the energy is off in our room.

552
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,320
It's mine.

553
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,820
You said
you weren't going to read into this.

554
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,990
"All of the messages for today
have been sent."

555
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,690
My gosh.

556
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,160
Well,
I won't get any votes today for sure.

557
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,360
Is it the energy of this room?

558
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,930
(The energy of their room...)

559
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,070
(doesn't seem favorable to them.)

560
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,270
Should we move out of this room?
I'll sleep in the living room.

561
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
- I want to do it at least once.
- What if it's a bust?

562
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,970
But we can't do it next weekend.

563
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,070
- Not at all?
- Next week,

564
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,880
everyone will feel sentimental
and focus on their own love...

565
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,080
"Love?" No. I mean,
everyone will focus on their feelings.

566
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,710
- You were talking about yourself, right?
- You said, "Love."

567
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,820
- That was obvious.
- That's possible.

568
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,080
So we'll have to focus on our decision.

569
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,650
It will be difficult for us
to interact actively...

570
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,990
when that time comes.

571
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,360
- Tomorrow is probably our last chance.
- Tomorrow sounds good. Right.

572
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,530
So tomorrow...

573
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,290
What a great idea.

574
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,460
Let's give you some time,
so you can feel more comfortable here.

575
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,670
Hearing that makes me feel comfortable.

576
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,670
- Really?
- Yes.

577
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,640
- Let's do that then.
- Do you drink?

578
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
- Yes.
- My gosh.

579
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,670
(Having a blast watching them)

580
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,010
All right. Soo Ah is the last resident
to join the group.

581
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,870
As she's the last one,
she could be nervous.

582
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,210
But she seems comfortable there.

583
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,240
- Right.
- Yes.

584
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,710
I love her because she's so confident
and sure of herself.

585
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,780
The second day
of their contract relationship...

586
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
will begin soon.

587
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,250
Let's check out the date
between Chang Hwan and Soo Ah.

588
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,590
(Anticipating)

589
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,760
- Are you cold?
- No.

590
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,560
She looks prettier today.

591
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,620
- That's good.
- It's warmer than yesterday.

592
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,690
It's not as windy as yesterday.

593
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,230
- Isn't this a nice color for a car?
- Yes.

594
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,500
That's a beautiful color.

595
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,500
- The shape of the car looks great too.
- Yes.

596
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
(He opens the door for her.)

597
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,700
- Thank you.
- Get in.

598
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,710
Okay. My gosh.

599
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,540
Chang Hwan looks great in any outfit.

600
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,640
He's so cool.

601
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,880
This car offers both speed
and great fuel efficiency.

602
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,990
We're already there.

603
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,060
There's snow on that side,
so when you get out of the car,

604
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,860
be careful.

605
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,700
I don't want our next date
to be at a hospital.

606
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,000
At a hospital?

607
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,430
- We can't have a date at an ortho clinic.
- That sounds fun, though.

608
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,300
That was what made Chang Hwan charming.

609
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,170
- We haven't seen that in a while.
- He's charming her little by little.

610
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,510
(A hanok cafe in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

611
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,510
As for this coffee,
you can treat it like vin chaud.

612
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,780
It will taste better then.

613
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,610
Vin chaud.

614
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,610
(A warm cup of coffee)

615
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,250
Her skin is beautiful.

616
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
It's good.

617
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,220
(It warms their bodies.)

618
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,990
It feels good to drink something warm.

619
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,530
(Rummaging)

620
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,560
I brought your book.

621
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,730
(Chang Hwan brought her Pairing Book.)

622
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,930
- Ta-da.
- How thoughtful.

623
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,400
All of my answers are quite long.

624
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
- You were quite detailed.
- Yes.

625
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,870
She's detailed and precise.

626
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,240
You're reading it thoroughly.

627
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,180
I gave it a careful read yesterday
before going to sleep.

628
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,310
And I'm doing the same thing here.

629
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,480
- I also...
- You read it thoroughly yesterday?

630
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes.

631
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,420
I also found your book easy to read.

632
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,390
I know how to write.

633
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,020
That suits her.

634
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,220
My writing easy to read.

635
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,030
- You seem quite sensible.
- Right?

636
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,530
You probably like literature, don't you?

637
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,700
(They seem comfortable enough
to make jokes.)

638
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,230
You should drop the honorifics by now.

639
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,300
Exactly.

640
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,370
(Get closer to each other.)

641
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,070
I like this part very much.

642
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,310
"I try to apologize and thank
as much as possible."

643
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,810
(18. How I'd like to solve problems
after arguing with my significant other)

644
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,280
- That sounds charming.
- Yes.

645
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,310
I think it's important to say sorry...

646
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,550
and thank you whenever it's necessary.

647
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,180
Actually,

648
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,550
- it's not easy to do so.
- It's not easy.

649
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,390
- I didn't do it...
- Right.

650
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,520
so often in the past
because it wasn't easy.

651
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,830
Now, I can easily say those things.

652
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,760
When I was young and immature,

653
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,900
I thought that saying sorry...

654
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,940
damaged my sense of pride.

655
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,970
But when I got older,

656
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,570
I realized that one's sense of pride
is completely useless.

657
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,440
Putting one's ego aside
at the moment is very hard.

658
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,880
At the right moment.

659
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,580
- Right.
- When you can do that,

660
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,950
you're an adult.

661
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,950
(One's ego isn't important in love.)

662
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,190
She's looking at him carefully.

663
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,790
Have you thought about...

664
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,890
getting married for a long time?
Since when?

665
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,200
I always thought that if I got married,

666
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,870
I wouldn't have time on my own.

667
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,070
I didn't think I could do it.

668
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,840
I really enjoy spending time alone,

669
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,140
and it's important for me.

670
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,210
I'd have to do everything...

671
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,510
- with my spouse if I got married.
- Right.

672
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,380
I didn't think that I could do it.

673
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,880
My closest friends are...

674
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,750
very similar to me.

675
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,120
I thought that all of us would...

676
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,220
either get married late
or not get married at all.

677
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,230
Then they started to get married 1 by 1.

678
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,730
I saw my closest friends
live so happily...

679
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,600
in their marriage.

680
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,400
They also have children.

681
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,300
I no longer see traces of them...

682
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,610
from when they were single.

683
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,880
They have become...

684
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,310
moms and wives.

685
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,880
After...

686
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,480
witnessing that,

687
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,250
I thought that I could do it too.

688
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,260
- I might discover a new side of myself.
- Right.

689
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,590
The same goes for me...

690
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,290
- Exactly.
- and you.

691
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,960
It would be happiness
on a different level.

692
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,700
- She's eloquent with her words.
- I agree.

693
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,230
(Soo Ah who liked being alone
considers getting married.)

694
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,800
Here's how I know...

695
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,110
for sure that
I want to be with this person.

696
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,570
The indicator is...

697
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,980
I wonder what it is.

698
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,510
"I like him. He makes my heart flutter."

699
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,150
"I want to be with him forever."

700
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,080
These thoughts are good, of course.

701
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,920
But thoughts like,
"I don't like this about him."

702
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,020
"This is hard to handle,"

703
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,190
"and I even hate this side of him."

704
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,830
"However,
I think I can deal with it somehow."

705
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,100
"I'd like to do that for him."

706
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,000
I feel certain about him
when I have these thoughts.

707
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,870
- So...
- It means that I'm truly ready.

708
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,840
There are sparks in the beginning
of a relationship.

709
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,010
However, what's more important is...

710
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,480
whether you want to work things out...

711
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,180
with this person or not...

712
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,350
- I agree.
- as time goes by.

713
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,010
Working things out is exactly it.

714
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,080
Whether you're willing to do it or not
is important.

715
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,390
They're having a mature conversation.

716
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,720
Yes, it's something to be grateful for.

717
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,360
This is it.

718
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,900
"Being liked by the person you like
is a miracle."

719
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,630
If both you and your partner
are willing...

720
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,470
to live with each other's flaws,

721
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,240
that would be a miracle on another level.

722
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,380
For me, that would be the second spark.

723
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,110
It's the second spark.

724
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,810
- It's very important.
- It's really important.

725
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,950
She's good with words.

726
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,320
(They're on the same wavelength
regarding marriage.)

727
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,790
Maybe it's just me, but Chang Hwan has...

728
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,590
- never looked more serious than now.
- I agree.

729
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,160
Your Pairing Book is red,
which is a pretty color.

730
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,570
We have the fanciest colors.

731
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,870
Yellow and red.

732
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,970
- They're primary colors.
- Primary colors.

733
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,270
Yellow.

734
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,070
I wanted to know why it was yellow.

735
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,780
I have to say this to explain...

736
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,690
why my Pairing Book is yellow.

737
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,820
My father...

738
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,630
What is this about?

739
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,430
He passed away a few years ago.

740
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,140
He was hospitalized for a long time.

741
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,570
He went through a hard time.

742
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,010
He passed away when I was being
trained to become a first officer.

743
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,150
Here's why my book is yellow.

744
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,690
Before he passed away...

745
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,700
(Trying to hold back his tears)

746
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,570
A few days before...

747
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,640
(A few days before he passed away)

748
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,810
In my dream,

749
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,650
he appeared...

750
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,050
as a healthy man
from when he played baseball.

751
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,090
While sitting down like now,
I talked a lot with my father.

752
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
The dream was very heartwarming.

753
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,760
I saw clouds...

754
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,990
of yellow and white.

755
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,060
In your dream?

756
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,330
A few days after that dream,
he passed away.

757
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,140
Whenever I see yellow,

758
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
- it feels warm.
- It reminds you of your father?

759
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,810
Yes, it reminds me of him,
and it feels warm.

760
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,970
(The color yellow
reminds Chang Hwan of his father.)

761
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,410
That's why I chose it.

762
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,580
(The day before,
from Chang Hwan's Pairing Book,)

763
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,290
(Soo Ah mentioned
his memory with his father.)

764
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,960
(She was the first one to mention it.)

765
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,260
I know it's hard to talk about it.

766
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,730
Thank you so much for sharing it with me.

767
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,370
It would have been hard for me.

768
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,370
(They shared an honest talk.)

769
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,040
I wonder how they feel.

770
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,940
(They shared an honest talk.)

771
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,350
(What are they thinking about now?)

772
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,150
Goodness.

773
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,150
(Feeling a lump in her throat)

774
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,180
(Feeling emotional)

775
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,650
I'm sure that...

776
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,790
he felt emotional at that moment.

777
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,390
He could say it...

778
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,490
because Soo Ah brought up his memory...

779
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,560
- about playing baseball with his father.
- Right.

780
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,360
- I thought that it was great.
- Me too.

781
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,430
(They probably got closer to each other.)

782
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,600
Has this happened to you?

783
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
You didn't like the person,

784
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,470
but she expressed her feelings for you
for a long time.

785
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,370
So then, you started to like her.

786
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,180
- No.
- You never liked someone...

787
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,550
- after not liking her?
- No.

788
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Here's why.

789
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,580
To be honest,

790
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,820
I must like her.

791
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,920
You must really like her? Right.

792
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,190
That's the right thing to do.

793
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,730
I make it too obvious.

794
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,060
- Whether you like her or not?
- Yes.

795
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,600
Really?

796
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,300
When I'm interested in her
and she makes my heart flutter,

797
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,740
you can easily tell that I'm nervous.

798
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,280
(Smiling)

799
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,910
I can't look at her in the eyes.

800
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,750
(It's easy to tell how he feels.)

801
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,620
Is he talking about now?

802
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,550
Do your ears turn red?

803
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,990
My ears turn...

804
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,890
so red that they explode.

805
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,660
(He can't hide his honesty.)

806
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,800
His ears are about to explode.

807
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,100
They're really red.

808
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
(Transparent Chang Hwan)

809
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
(After their honest conversation)

810
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,970
Soo Ah is very confident.

811
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,070
By the way,

812
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,740
shall we drop the honorifics?

813
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,440
- They're dropping the honorifics.
- I have a hard time...

814
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,840
- Dropping the honorifics?
- dropping the honorifics.

815
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,380
- Then...
- It takes me some time.

816
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,710
In that case,

817
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,810
it's all right.

818
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,850
How about speaking in half-honorifics?

819
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,890
Okay, that sounds good.

820
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,790
That's good.

821
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,090
As soon as we arrive,

822
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,830
there are some things I'd like to eat.

823
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,860
- Do you like crunchy fried chicken?
- That sounds good.

824
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,900
(Laughing)

825
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,470
Do you eat anything in particular...

826
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,570
- at the traditional market?
- Yes.

827
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,470
It's called offal.

828
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,900
Intestines, ears...

829
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,840
Do you eat tripe and intestine soup?

830
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,310
I love tripe and intestine soup.

831
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,940
You love tripe and intestine soup?

832
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,680
I love it very much.

833
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,210
There's mutton in the soup.

834
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,380
I buy extra frozen mutton
to add in the soup.

835
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,550
You're obsessed.

836
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,020
(Joking)

837
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,490
- You're more obsessed than me.
- Please respect what I like.

838
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,390
I'm very obsessed with what I like.

839
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,720
So you eat intestines.

840
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,890
Spicy marinated crab
or soy sauce marinated crab?

841
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,030
(Taking it seriously)

842
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,260
- Soo Ah is so charming.
- You can only choose one for life.

843
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,470
- Definitely.
- Can you choose one?

844
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,800
- I can choose.
- Soy sauce or spicy sauce?

845
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,930
Let's say it together
in the count of three.

846
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,770
All right. One, two, three.

847
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,810
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

848
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,740
- So you know.
- Soy sauce.

849
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,580
- They make a great couple.
- I'm hungry.

850
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,310
She's very responsive.

851
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,050
(A traditional market in Mapo, Seoul)

852
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,780
Let's pick between left and right.

853
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,850
A date at the traditional market?

854
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,380
- I pick left.
- Left? Okay.

855
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,520
This is Soo Ah's
favorite traditional market.

856
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,620
Which one do you like?

857
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
(Spicy crunchy fried chicken)

858
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,730
(Thinking)

859
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,330
I want garlic soy sauce.

860
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,260
Can we get one medium garlic soy sauce...

861
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,600
and sweet shrimp?

862
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,030
(Looking around)

863
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
It will be delicious.

864
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,840
She seems mature but cute.

865
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm hungry.

866
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,810
(Eating)

867
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,780
(It tastes so good
that it makes her angry.)

868
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,910
She's cute.

869
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,050
(It tastes so good
that it makes her angry.)

870
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,580
It tastes so good that it makes me cry.

871
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,990
I feel much better now.

872
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,820
Let's take some traditional snacks there.

873
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,430
Okay. How do we buy them?

874
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,860
I know how to do this.

875
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,100
Which one do you like? I like this.

876
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,660
- This one?
- Yes. The laver.

877
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,000
This, and...

878
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,600
Oranda, and...

879
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,140
- She seems meticulous.
- I know.

880
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,910
(Chang Hwan is just looking around.)

881
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,310
Please add some of these...

882
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,240
and wrap it up with the sweet potato.

883
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,680
- You want all of those?
- Yes.

884
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,510
(Laughing)

885
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,910
Thank you.

886
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,550
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

887
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,020
(Chang Hwan naturally takes the snacks.)

888
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,560
Gosh, that's so funny.

889
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,220
She got the snacks
and gave them to Chang Hwan...

890
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,260
so he could carry them.

891
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,590
That was so natural.

892
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,300
I think their power structure
would be like this.

893
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,630
- It's so cute.
- Certainly.

894
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,830
I got some change.

895
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,100
- You carry cash around?
- Yes.

896
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,440
- Really?
- Yes.

897
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
(You need to carry cash in winter.)

898
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,870
I always have cash with me.

899
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,070
That's sensible.

900
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,210
Thank you for the food.

901
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,640
Let me hold it.

902
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,440
Hold on.

903
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,450
This is...

904
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,410
Like this.
You should cover it like this, and...

905
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,850
- Eat it.
- Let it go. Like this.

906
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,120
It tastes the same as the old days.

907
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,850
I want to go on a date like that.

908
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,460
(Soo Ah is angry again.)

909
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,060
How come they look so good
with each other?

910
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,630
- It's tasty.
- Your face tells me it's true.

911
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,600
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

912
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,670
- Gosh.
- They look great.

913
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,900
Seriously. I wish the two get married.

914
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,400
I'll go to their wedding no matter what.

915
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,410
- Already?
- Yes. Seriously. I mean it.

916
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,910
As for Chang Hwan, if Soo Ah asks him...

917
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,010
to go to another place,
he will definitely go.

918
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,010
He'll be taken right away.

919
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,780
If a couple gets married,
there are times he has to be like that.

920
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,920
- Yes.
- Were you...

921
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,620
She gets the things and pays for them.

922
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,690
- And I carry them.
- And you carry them?

923
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,990
That's just like Chang Hwan.

924
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,990
If there's too much,
I put them in the car and get back to her.

925
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,790
That's how I do it.

926
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,000
(On Saturday, early in the morning)

927
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,670
Chan Hyeong goes out early as usual.

928
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,800
(He goes to work even on a weekend.)

929
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,270
Gosh, it snowed a lot.

930
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,740
(Snowing)

931
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,680
(He leaves the first footprint
on the snow.)

932
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,420
(Ji Min is up.)

933
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,090
(He looks at the mountain
covered in snow.)

934
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,960
(He starts the day as well.)

935
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,900
(The third one to get up is...)

936
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Who is it?

937
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,670
- Is it Ji Won?
- It's Chae Eun.

938
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,880
Tomorrow, I have to go out...

939
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,510
in the morning.

940
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,280
I see.
When will you come back tomorrow then?

941
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,750
It ends at 12:30 p.m.,
so I'll be back by 1 p.m.

942
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,350
- Right. He said that.
- By 1 p.m.?

943
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,660
I'm leaving. See you later.

944
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,630
I think she's serious about it.

945
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,330
Beef.

946
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,030
- There's no minced beef?
- It's sold out.

947
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,100
Is that so? Goodness. What do I do?

948
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,770
Chan Hyeong must be so happy.

949
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
(Passing by)

950
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,980
- What?
- Is it Chae Eun?

951
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,680
- Why did she go grocery shopping?
- Hold on.

952
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,350
- These two were here.
- She went out so early.

953
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,350
When Chan Hyeong gets back from work,

954
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,220
she'll tell him to get some rest
and prepare a meal for him.

955
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,330
(Exclaiming)

956
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,030
Right?

957
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
The two are so sweet.

958
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,700
I think both families
will accept their marriage right away.

959
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,540
"It's perfect."
I think they would say that.

960
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
They really are...

961
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,610
- the best bride and groom.
- I know.

962
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,240
- She's so cool.
- Do you want to go see what she's doing?

963
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,210
- He works in the morning, and...
- I'll go take a peek.

964
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,350
- It's like a sitcom. Like "Friends."
- I mean...

965
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,020
This is what I like about Ji Min.

966
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,050
You know, in a sitcom,

967
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,050
the main character
plays the supporting role well...

968
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,520
when he's not the focus of the episode.

969
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
He's so good at the supporting role.

970
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,230
(That's a perfect description.)

971
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,200
- Hi.
- Hi, Woo Jae.

972
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,630
Did you have anything for breakfast?

973
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,730
- Are you cooking for Chan Hyeong?
- Yes.

974
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,200
Chae Eun, I heard that
you were preparing a big surprise dish.

975
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,640
Around the time your husband comes back...

976
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,070
What will you cook for him?

977
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,710
Doenjang stew, rolled omelet,
and braised chicken.

978
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,910
- You're going to cook braised chicken?
- Yes.

979
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,780
Gosh, that's not easy.

980
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,010
(She prepares the chicken skillfully.)

981
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,250
It seems like she's used to it.

982
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,250
(Put it in milk to make the meat soft.)

983
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,520
(She prepares the other ingredients
skillfully as well.)

984
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,590
Ma'am.

985
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,730
You're trying to make fun of me again?
My goodness.

986
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
(Putting in)

987
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,830
Gosh, you don't hesitate.

988
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,230
You're actually good at cooking.

989
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,340
Not checking the recipe proves that.

990
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,570
I know.

991
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,770
- She's a good wife.
- She's such a good wife.

992
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,180
- That suits her.
- Thank you.

993
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,310
It's like she's cooking for her husband
who will come back from work.

994
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,350
She'd say, "Honey, come and eat."

995
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,350
(This shows why she's
a perfect daughter-in-law material.)

996
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,050
"Honey, tell me what you did today."

997
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,190
(Trying to act a scene)

998
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,090
My gosh.

999
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,260
She looks so cool.

1000
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,360
(The husband is back from work.)

1001
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,660
These two feel like a real couple.

1002
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,700
- Hi.
- Gosh, you're back.

1003
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

1004
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,370
- You must be tired.
- I'm back. No, I'm okay.

1005
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,370
Good work today.

1006
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,470
Is there anything I can help?

1007
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,270
No. There's nothing.

1008
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,240
Go rest and come back later.

1009
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
I want to help you out.

1010
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,580
There's nothing.

1011
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,840
- Nothing?
- No.

1012
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,380
- She's so sweet.
- Right.

1013
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
(Awkward)

1014
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,410
What should I do?

1015
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,320
Go and take some rest.

1016
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,450
Okay then.
I'll go rest for about 40 minutes.

1017
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

1018
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,760
Thank you so much.

1019
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,960
I should do something for you next time.
What should I do?

1020
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,430
We can have something tasty
for dinner today then.

1021
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,400
- She talks so nicely.
- We'll have a lot for dinner.

1022
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,170
Leave your wallet behind.

1023
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,170
No, I'm not like that.

1024
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,570
- You're not like that?
- No.

1025
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,970
She's so cool.

1026
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,440
"Go take some rest."

1027
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,310
Chan Hyeong was feeling sorry for her.

1028
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,950
But when he got home, she was cooking
and told him to take some rest.

1029
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,050
My goodness.

1030
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,380
It's game over for Chan Hyeong.

1031
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,250
(He goes to his room with light steps.)

1032
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,350
Gosh, it's so...

1033
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,150
They have no pressure on each other.

1034
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,590
(He reads Chae Eun's Pairing Book
before going to sleep.)

1035
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,330
Chan Hyeong, did you read my book?

1036
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,030
- Of course, I did.
- I mean, after that time.

1037
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,270
Not in Italy,
but after we came back to Korea.

1038
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,170
After that, the book...

1039
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,500
You left it there.

1040
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,370
(Embarrassed)

1041
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,140
Tomorrow,

1042
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,650
- I'll give my book to you.
- I should read it again.

1043
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,950
It's amazing that he reads
even when he's so tired.

1044
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,150
I know. Seriously.

1045
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,320
(In the meantime,
the dishes are getting done.)

1046
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,760
(She doesn't miss the eggs,
Chan Hyeong's favorite.)

1047
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
Chae Eun, it smells so good.

1048
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,490
It would be nice
if we could them this together.

1049
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,630
No.

1050
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,300
- Do it for us next time.
- Okay.

1051
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,860
I'll do that no matter what.

1052
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,370
Did you always like cooking?

1053
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,240
Me?
Well, I liked it when I was in college.

1054
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,710
When I was young,
my grandmother would cook for me.

1055
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,610
So I would call my grandmother
and ask her the recipe.

1056
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,280
I tried cooking everything.
I really liked eating.

1057
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,750
That's cute.

1058
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,090
By the way, she's so good at it.

1059
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,360
You're putting in coffee?

1060
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,660
This is for the color.

1061
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,290
Gosh, she's good.

1062
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,330
Chan Hyeong must be so happy.

1063
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,130
I'm jealous of Chan Hyeong.

1064
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,300
- When he wakes up,
- Right.

1065
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,370
he'll find braised chicken.

1066
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,000
You guys should've paired with me then.

1067
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
She's putting in so much effort.

1068
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,640
- She's cute.
- I'm jealous of him.

1069
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I'm jealous of him.

1070
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
She's good, right?

1071
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,980
I messed up my rolled omelet.

1072
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,350
No, you didn't.
You did it so well last time.

1073
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,620
- You did it like this.
- Well...

1074
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
Chan Hyeong.

1075
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,130
Look.

1076
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,790
This is amazing.

1077
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,960
He woke up,
and everyone is jealous of him.

1078
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,200
- It's so cool.
- Look how thick the omelet is.

1079
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,270
You didn't sleep, right?

1080
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,840
I did. I had a good nap.

1081
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,040
- You did?
- Yes.

1082
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,570
I fell asleep right away.

1083
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,340
Sleep some more after eating.

1084
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,170
- Goodness.
- "Sleep some more after eating."

1085
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,880
- That's so nice.
- But seriously, this is so...

1086
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,950
Gosh. Thank you so much.

1087
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,080
Don't mention it.

1088
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,250
I hope it's good.

1089
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,950
I'm worried that it might be salty.

1090
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,290
Try this.

1091
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,690
It might be hot.

1092
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:18,930
This is perfect.

1093
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,760
- Is it okay?
- This is so perfect.

1094
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,370
- Her smile is so beautiful.
- I know.

1095
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,740
- Do you eat glass noodles too?
- Yes.

1096
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,970
I love everything. Seriously.

1097
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,210
- I can turn this off, right?
- This is good.

1098
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,110
(It looks tasty.)

1099
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,150
That's cheating.

1100
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,150
(A sumptuous feast by Chae Eun is ready.)

1101
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,750
- This is amazing.
- My goodness.

1102
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,690
Shall we eat?

1103
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,360
Look at Woo Jae.

1104
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
(Woo Jae is there to watch them.)

1105
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,560
- Woo Jae is so funny.
- That's funny.

1106
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,160
(Photo taken by Chan Hyeong)

1107
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,400
I don't think I can eat them.
What do I do?

1108
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,170
Chan Hyeong, you didn't react like this
when I cooked for you.

1109
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,770
I felt honored, though.

1110
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,010
That makes me sad.

1111
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,040
If I had just an hour more,

1112
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,180
it could've been much better.

1113
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,810
- How can it be better than this?
- I'm disappointed.

1114
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,720
Eat it already.

1115
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,990
I'll enjoy it.

1116
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,320
- I'll enjoy it. Seriously.
- Enjoy your meal.

1117
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,490
Chae Eun is so proud.

1118
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,090
(Biting)

1119
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,160
(Exclaiming)

1120
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,130
- It's so good.
- Really?

1121
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,170
I should learn how to do this.

1122
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,370
I'll teach you how to do it.

1123
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,270
- I'll open a cooking class for you.
- Seriously.

1124
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,770
Gosh,
they really look like a married couple.

1125
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,580
- Is it okay?
- It's so tasty.

1126
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,410
Good to hear that.

1127
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,010
Doenjang stew is so good.

1128
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,480
(Proud)

1129
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,950
- Thanks for enjoying it.
- It's really good.

1130
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,560
When my mom makes doenjang stew,

1131
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,220
she always puts these in.

1132
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,660
- Wild chives?
- Wild chives.

1133
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,560
- Wild chives.
- It only tastes good with wild chives.

1134
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Yes.

1135
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,330
So, it was interesting.

1136
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,830
- Really?
- Yes.

1137
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:06,770
When men sense
familiarity to their mothers,

1138
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,740
- Right.
- their feelings tend to grow.

1139
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,910
It tastes like homemade food, right?

1140
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,680
- I don't use any condiments.
- Right.

1141
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,010
I tend to cook everything that I can.

1142
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,680
Only the ones I like, though.

1143
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,380
- You want to see what I cooked?
- Yes.

1144
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,650
You cooked all that?
Even the ones in the back?

1145
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,790
Yes, the whole table.

1146
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,020
Steamed clams in wine...

1147
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,860
and shrimp.

1148
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,100
- She's actually a good cook.
- That's so...

1149
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,100
It'll be hard to please her
with a regular restaurant.

1150
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,370
Even cakes?

1151
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,040
Are you glad you're paired with me?

1152
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,810
- You're really admirable,
- She's so cute.

1153
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,010
- aren't you?
- You bet.

1154
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,640
You're really cool.

1155
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,850
I feel sorry as I'm eating it.

1156
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,250
Why?

1157
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,620
I feel like I haven't done
anything for you.

1158
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,390
No, you do things for me every day.

1159
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,160
Rather than cooking,

1160
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,230
eating it with someone makes me happier.

1161
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,330
I see.

1162
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,160
What do we do?
I don't think we have enough for others.

1163
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,170
- Don't overeat.
- Is this okay?

1164
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,500
Are you okay with it?

1165
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,240
Sang Yun said he wanted
doenjang stew earlier.

1166
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,940
Who was it for? Wait a second.

1167
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,480
- Can you say that again?
- You'll never be able to finish this.

1168
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,580
Come again?

1169
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,780
I won't give it to him.

1170
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,650
I'll have another bowl of rice.

1171
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,090
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1172
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,850
He must have really liked it.

1173
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,390
He must want to eat more for her.

1174
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,160
Yes, he feels thankful too.

1175
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,830
- You must like carrots.
- I love carrots.

1176
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,430
I usually eat raw carrots.

1177
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,430
- Really?
- Yes.

1178
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,670
I just eat carrot strips as they are.

1179
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,540
Carrots are so tasty.

1180
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,270
- It's so fascinating.
- Why?

1181
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,110
I don't think I've ever seen anyone say,

1182
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,380
"I love carrots."

1183
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,010
- Really?
- Yes.

1184
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,820
Mom would love you.

1185
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,520
- My mom?
- No.

1186
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,050
My mom.

1187
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,860
No way.

1188
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,460
They should set a date
for the formal family meeting.

1189
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,760
I can tell that Chae Eun is serious
about Chan Hyeong.

1190
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,400
She definitely is.

1191
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,670
- That was pretty shocking too.
- What?

1192
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,010
Catching that bug.

1193
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,810
It was a good type of shock. I loved it.

1194
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,240
(A few days ago)

1195
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,650
But the fruits that were here...

1196
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,680
There's a bug next to you.

1197
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,020
(Looking around)

1198
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,550
(Gasping)

1199
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,550
It's huge!

1200
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,590
(Grabbing)

1201
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,390
I have to kill it.

1202
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,890
(Everyone froze.)

1203
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:41,890
Here's a trash can.

1204
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,960
Do you want to wrap it in toilet paper?

1205
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,560
I just heard the sound.

1206
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,260
What sound? The crunch?

1207
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,870
It's been so long since I last saw someone
catch a bug with their bare hands.

1208
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,470
I thought you were grabbing a chip.

1209
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,940
- That's so cool.
- Why?

1210
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,240
- Was the crunch too loud?
- You're amazing.

1211
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,710
- So cool.
- That was awesome.

1212
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,880
You're awesome.

1213
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,050
I never saw it coming.
You just grabbed it.

1214
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,450
(He thinks about it again,
and it still puts him in awe.)

1215
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,950
I can just wash my hands after.

1216
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,050
- It was so admirable, though.
- She's so charming.

1217
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,820
Everyone seemed too appalled, though.

1218
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,820
No, I wasn't appalled.

1219
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,690
It was just my...

1220
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,530
That was one of the qualities
of my ideal type.

1221
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,030
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1222
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,200
- That's a huge compliment.
- Yes.

1223
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,800
Someone easygoing.

1224
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,070
I often went to science museums
when I was little.

1225
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,570
It's in Hyehwa, isn't it?

1226
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,810
- Yes!
- Next to SNU Hospital.

1227
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,810
Yes!

1228
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,980
There was...

1229
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,650
Well, I was kind of gifted.

1230
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,110
Gifted in science.

1231
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,380
They had a program for gifted children.

1232
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,620
- Yes, they do.
- Yes.

1233
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,950
My sister and I were in that program.

1234
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,090
- Oh, both of you?
- Yes.

1235
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,320
We did a lot of science experiments.

1236
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:52,160
Your family seems very similar to mine.

1237
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,560
My older brother and me...

1238
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,800
and you and your older sister.

1239
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,970
- We seem kind of similar.
- That's a very important factor.

1240
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,740
You've always been with her,

1241
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,940
like how I've always been with my brother.

1242
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,940
You first learn how to socialize...

1243
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,680
from the relationship with your siblings.

1244
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,280
- You learn how to yield,
- Exactly.

1245
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,880
- confront, and resolve.
- Yes.

1246
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,720
I think it's important to experience that.

1247
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
I agree.

1248
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,120
You seem very wise.

1249
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,560
Am I wise?

1250
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,490
You look like the type of person
to live with structure.

1251
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,600
They have so many things in common.

1252
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,070
They're very compatible.

1253
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,100
- They are.
- Indeed.

1254
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Look, Chae Eun.

1255
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,270
- That's so pretty!
- Right?

1256
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,970
It's stunning.

1257
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,880
They're left alone?

1258
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,440
Height isn't exactly important to me.

1259
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,810
- No?
- No.

1260
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,680
- That's too bad.
- Why?

1261
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,220
It could have been a plus for me.

1262
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,220
Exactly.

1263
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,750
So, what you look for in a guy
is his personality, and...

1264
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,490
Was it intelligence?

1265
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,530
Yes.

1266
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,230
You know what, though?

1267
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,770
What?

1268
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,630
I'm smart.

1269
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,310
You can be very skillful
when flirting with a girl.

1270
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,010
Me? But that was too obvious.

1271
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,010
That's because you're into him, Chae Eun.

1272
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,780
Yes, the fact that
she perceives it as flirting.

1273
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,780
Yes.

1274
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,550
That was gratifying.

1275
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,880
The relationships are deepening,
now that we're nearing the end.

1276
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,750
I'd say that there were three signs
that could lead to marriage.

1277
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,020
One, "My mother would love you."

1278
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,160
- That leads straight to marriage.
- Right.

1279
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,400
And he said that his ideal type was...

1280
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,230
an easygoing person
when talking about catching bugs.

1281
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,730
Three, wisdom.

1282
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,570
Chan Hyeong telling her that she's wise
was probably...

1283
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,540
the best compliment
he could give to a woman.

1284
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,040
- They're so compatible.
- And she told him...

1285
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,110
to eat and go back to sleep.

1286
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,780
- That was so nice.
- Yes.

1287
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,140
I almost fell in love with her.

1288
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,010
It felt like I got a short peek
into their newlywed life.

1289
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,420
(It's the second morning...)

1290
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,890
(of the contract relationship
between Je Yeon and Sang Yun.)

1291
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,500
(She got her hair done.)

1292
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,910
(Blowing)

1293
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,380
(Meticulous)

1294
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,150
We'll be starving when we get there.

1295
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,180
Right?

1296
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,920
I meant to eat something before leaving,

1297
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,820
but Chae Eun was using the entire stove.

1298
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,390
She was cooking hard,
so I didn't want to get in the way.

1299
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,390
You must be cold.

1300
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,260
I'm wearing two layers of stockings.

1301
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Good.

1302
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,060
Very good.

1303
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,630
Why are they going to a grocery store?

1304
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,870
(They walk into a grocery store?)

1305
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Look.

1306
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,750
(Sang Yun suggested this last night.)

1307
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,420
- It looks fun.
- It does.

1308
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,190
It may feel like glamping with warmth.

1309
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,820
- Right?
- Yes.

1310
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,160
- They're going camping.
- Camping!

1311
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,230
They're going camping?

1312
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,430
- Camping is intense.
- What do we do?

1313
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,330
It makes you very sentimental, right?

1314
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,430
We should get one more potato.

1315
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,040
We'll need it when we make doenjang stew.

1316
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,940
Potatoes, sweet potatoes,

1317
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,040
meat, vegetables...

1318
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,210
- Pork belly.
- You said you liked beef.

1319
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,210
I do.

1320
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,910
- Pork belly looks good too.
- Yes.

1321
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,810
This looks tasty.

1322
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,250
- It does.
- Right?

1323
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,320
(They buy a lot of stuff
as they're excited.)

1324
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,580
Everything looks tasty right now.

1325
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,090
- I'll pay.
- No, it's on me.

1326
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,620
- I got it.
- But...

1327
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,120
- Do you need the receipt?
- No, thank you.

1328
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,290
(Je Yeon paid for it.)

1329
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,490
- I didn't mean to,
- Yes?

1330
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,960
but I feel like I ripped you off.

1331
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,060
You're ripping off an older girl.

1332
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,930
(Laughing)

1333
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,870
I should buy you tastier food.
I'll buy you more.

1334
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,910
I'll make sure to stop
by the first rest area.

1335
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,310
I can't wait.

1336
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,850
- Now, it feels like going on a trip.
- Totally.

1337
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,850
I wish I could go with loud music.

1338
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,880
Me too.

1339
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,250
What's your favorite song by aespa?

1340
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,950
I'd say it's "Whiplash."

1341
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,120
- The recent one?
- Yes.

1342
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,360
I listen to songs by idols
on my way to work.

1343
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,930
Idols? What's your favorite idol group?

1344
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,330
aespa.

1345
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,060
aespa? Me too.

1346
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,130
They're my favorite.

1347
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,340
- KARINA or WINTER?
- That's a tough one.

1348
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,200
I like NINGNING these days.

1349
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,210
NINGNING!

1350
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,140
- They found the perfect style for her...
- They look like a married couple.

1351
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,210
for "Whiplash."

1352
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,240
- She's so pretty, isn't she?
- Yes.

1353
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,980
They gave her black hair...

1354
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,120
and changed her makeup.
That was a great choice.

1355
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,250
You must really like them.

1356
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,990
- That's unexpected.
- It's so...

1357
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,160
I mean, I never expected you...

1358
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,590
- to like idol songs.
- Really?

1359
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,890
Between KARINA and WINTER...

1360
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,530
That was random.

1361
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,840
I was wondering what her true self was.

1362
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,100
You must really like them.

1363
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,840
- That's unexpected.
- It's so...

1364
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,340
Neither of us like
talking about meaningless stuff.

1365
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,980
I wish I could watch you
in a meeting with a client.

1366
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,350
- I want to hide and watch.
- Hide?

1367
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,650
You must be really eloquent.

1368
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,160
You have to be eloquent to be a lawyer.

1369
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,690
Well, yes.

1370
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,500
When it snows on Christmas,

1371
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,430
it's a white Christmas.

1372
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,500
I'll tell them.

1373
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,800
- What?
- I'll tell them to snow.

1374
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,470
Who's "them?"

1375
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,040
- What?
- What?

1376
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,310
They're close friends.

1377
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,680
Really?

1378
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,850
It must be nice.

1379
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,680
That's so cute.

1380
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,420
You know, silly stuff
that we can say in our everyday lives.

1381
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,850
Meaningless things...

1382
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,150
and silly things.

1383
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,990
Usually, those serve as icebreakers.

1384
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,560
- It'll be another fun day.
- I know.

1385
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,830
- I bet it'll be pretty there.
- What?

1386
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,000
- I think it'll be beautiful too.
- Exactly.

1387
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,270
We'll eat something delicious
while enjoying the view,

1388
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,470
and have fun with everyone else
when we get back.

1389
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,110
However,
neither of us says those silly things.

1390
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,680
That's why...

1391
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,180
You see, I tend to be...

1392
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,080
an individualist.

1393
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,550
I know it'd be better for us...

1394
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,980
if we were a little more comfortable
with each other.

1395
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,790
- My ears are on fire.
- You're not wrong.

1396
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,720
Your ears are burning.

1397
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,090
- Are they?
- Yes.

1398
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,390
What about my face?

1399
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,500
You're not flushing at all.

1400
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,560
Do you normally clip
your hairpin on this side?

1401
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,430
- Here.
- Yes, that side.

1402
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,970
I want her to be comfortable around me.

1403
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,970
Will we soon come by a rest area?

1404
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,710
More than when she is with anyone else.

1405
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,510
You must really be hungry.

1406
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,580
I tried to make that happen.

1407
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,280
I was hungry the second I woke up today.

1408
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,250
But you know how it is.

1409
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,320
We can't walk around this house
without getting dressed first.

1410
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,520
Still, I stepped out of my room.

1411
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,160
- It was quiet.
- But everyone was there.

1412
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,290
Yes, I mean...

1413
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,820
- Didn't we cross paths?
- Yes, we did.

1414
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,290
You saw me in my pajamas.

1415
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,560
That's why... I can't believe it.

1416
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,760
(Laughing and chatting,
they arrive at the rest area.)

1417
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,500
Finally.

1418
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,200
- We'll grab a bite to eat.
- Sure.

1419
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,910
- We have to keep it simple, though.
- Of course.

1420
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,210
- We have a lot to eat today.
- We have a lot to eat today.

1421
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,510
(A rest area in Namyangju,
Gyeonggi Province)

1422
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,610
- Squid grilled on stones.
- That looks good.

1423
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,810
Rest areas are the best.

1424
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,820
- No way.
- I'm losing my patience.

1425
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,190
That looks good.
In fact, everything looks good.

1426
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,260
(They return to the car
looking satisfied.)

1427
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,520
- Is it good?
- I'm happy.

1428
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,530
I'm happy too.

1429
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,160
I was close to losing it.

1430
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,360
They're in a good mood.

1431
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,270
Have some of this.

1432
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,840
How can I... How...

1433
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,100
Have all of it.

1434
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,270
- All of it?
- Yes.

1435
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,310
(Biting)

1436
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,710
I can finally function again.

1437
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,010
Tell me about it.

1438
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,950
It wasn't much, but still.

1439
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,280
I'm not as hungry anymore.

1440
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,220
(Glancing)

1441
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,060
- Do you want some?
- Yes.

1442
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Je Yeon's taking the initiative today.

1443
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,230
Thanks.

1444
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,800
- It's really good.
- Is it good?

1445
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,340
It's good.

1446
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,640
- It's really good.
- I know.

1447
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,940
Why is this so good?

1448
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,050
(Their eyes, nose, and mouths widen.)

1449
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,080
Professor.

1450
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,620
That's unbelievable.

1451
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,690
Je Yeon?

1452
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,090
- Check this out. It's beautiful.
- You're right.

1453
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,190
The mountain's covered in snow.

1454
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,360
It's snowing.

1455
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,200
- Actually, it's sleet.
- Really?

1456
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,600
Is it also snowing today?

1457
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,210
This is beautiful.

1458
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,310
It's so pretty.

1459
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,910
That's pretty.

1460
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,140
Look how pretty that is.

1461
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,150
(Gently covered in snow)

1462
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,980
(A picturesque snow-covered landscape)

1463
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,150
It's so pretty.

1464
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,350
The snow from yesterday gave us a treat.

1465
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,850
Right.

1466
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
(A glamping site in Pocheon,
Gyeonggi Province)

1467
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,090
Is there a glamping site?

1468
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,090
(A glamping site in Pocheon,
Gyeonggi Province)

1469
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,140
My gosh.

1470
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,640
- It's so good.
- It's so nice.

1471
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,140
- That's pretty.
- It's pretty.

1472
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,380
- Watch your step.
- Sure.

1473
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,030
You can sit here.

1474
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,130
It's warm.

1475
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,800
The chair's lower than expected.

1476
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,270
- This seems like a great plan for a date.
- I agree.

1477
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,440
(Sitting side by side
in front of the campfire)

1478
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,440
- Can't we add more?
- We can.

1479
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,980
Yes, that'll soon warm us up.

1480
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,610
It's warm.

1481
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,720
- I drew a campfire in my book.
- Right.

1482
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:18,990
It fits.

1483
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,120
This feels a bit close
for an adequate distance.

1484
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,130
"An adequate distance."

1485
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,030
- Not too close, but not too distant.
- Right.

1486
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,540
We're too close right now.

1487
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,310
- This to me feels like enough.
- Likewise.

1488
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,010
I want to stare at the fire.

1489
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,160
(Turning)

1490
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,090
- Look at what's behind us.
- What?

1491
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,060
- It has an unusual atmosphere.
- It's beautiful.

1492
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,300
It's so cool.

1493
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,330
(In the tranquil forest,)

1494
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:06,570
(they enjoy a private winter night
of their own.)

1495
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,300
It'd be even better with music.

1496
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,870
I brought something.

1497
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,240
- A speaker?
- Yes.

1498
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,540
- You hang this somewhere.
- Gosh.

1499
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,810
How thoughtful of him.

1500
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,280
You know the importance of the first song.

1501
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,750
- Goodness.
- It is important.

1502
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,620
Here's a good one.
"The First Snow" by EXO.

1503
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,620
Nice. I love that song.

1504
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,660
- How is it?
- I just love it.

1505
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,300
- This feels like a real trip.
- I know.

1506
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,540
It's so nice.

1507
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,580
Right.

1508
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,140
I like what I'm seeing.

1509
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,180
(Flinching)

1510
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,420
My eyes sting.

1511
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,390
Do they sting?

1512
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:01,820
It got all in my eyes.

1513
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,260
- Let's have one of these.
- Sure.

1514
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,330
It's my first time doing this.

1515
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,970
There we go.

1516
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,000
(Roasting marshmallows over the campfire)

1517
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,610
I'll take a photo.

1518
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,680
That's a good one.

1519
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,850
(Proud)

1520
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,890
All right.

1521
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,160
It's hot.

1522
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,030
(Munching)

1523
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,470
It's delicious.

1524
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,400
Look at her.

1525
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,140
- She's cute.
- She's adorable.

1526
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,480
Have you watched the show,
"Discovery of Love?"

1527
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,210
I love that series.

1528
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,980
"Discovery of Love."

1529
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,390
- Here we go.
- Why are they so close to each other?

1530
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,390
- Music, start!
- Right.

1531
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,720
I remember that.

1532
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,430
It was a memorable scene.

1533
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,360
They click.

1534
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,830
"Why do you keep coming back?"

1535
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,870
"If you keep coming back,
I'll find myself waiting for you."

1536
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,110
Je Yeon's loving this.

1537
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,310
- Goodness.
- You memorized the lines.

1538
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,380
- I've memorized the entire script.
- I see.

1539
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,620
This is one of my favorite drama series.

1540
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,690
Likewise.

1541
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,190
It's my favorite.

1542
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,790
We...

1543
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,560
have the same taste in shows.

1544
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,660
- I know.
- And that's important.

1545
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,730
It is.

1546
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,730
- Have you watched "Mr. Sunshine?"
- What?

1547
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,000
"Mr. Sunshine."

1548
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:53,970
I like that series.

1549
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,040
It's my favorite series.

1550
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,340
- Really?
- Yes.

1551
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,310
- You know what this is.
- It's my favorite too.

1552
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,010
- You know what this is, right?
- I love that series.

1553
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,180
Of course, I know what it is.

1554
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,450
"You should keep going."

1555
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,580
They click.

1556
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,680
- Yes, they click.
- Do you remember that scene?

1557
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,020
I cried while watching that.

1558
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,350
- Same here. I cried my eyes out.
- I was weeping.

1559
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,720
I had no idea...

1560
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,320
things would happen like that.

1561
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,690
Something felt off
when only one bullet remained.

1562
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,030
(Getting emotional)

1563
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,930
(Smirking)

1564
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,970
I love memorizing lines
and repeating them.

1565
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,440
I'll show you
once we get to know each other more.

1566
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,240
Do you just say the lines?

1567
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,810
Or do you also do a voice impression?

1568
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,780
(Pressing his mouth shut)

1569
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,120
Of course, they should have that.

1570
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,560
(The highlight of a campfire,
Sweet potatoes baked in foil)

1571
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,590
(Golden-brown)

1572
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,160
That's so good to have outdoors.
Maybe with some ramyeon.

1573
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,360
(And even perfectly cooked meat)

1574
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,960
Yes, that looks good.

1575
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,800
(Je Yeon tries the meat first.)

1576
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,940
It's good.

1577
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,110
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1578
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,580
- Aren't I good at grilling meat?
- You are.

1579
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,510
I was just about to say that.

1580
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,250
I spoke too soon.

1581
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,950
(He's still at an age
where compliments matter.)

1582
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,290
(Munching)

1583
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,720
Je Yeon's enjoying her dinner today.

1584
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,060
It's really good.

1585
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,130
- Isn't it good?
- It's so good.

1586
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,200
The sausage is good.

1587
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,970
(They each have their own tasks
to complete.)

1588
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:45,250
(Now, they get ready to cook the stew.)

1589
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,920
Should I chop them too?

1590
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,320
Adding a spoonful of homemade doenjang...

1591
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,320
- Did you bring it from your house?
- Yes.

1592
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:57,890
My house.

1593
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,430
It's going to taste good for sure.

1594
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:05,770
(He brought his mother's doenjang
after her aged kimchi.)

1595
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,800
Yes. I think he won her over
when he cooked breakfast for her.

1596
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,300
- Yes.
- I think Je Yeon really liked that.

1597
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,170
There's a German proverb
that goes like this.

1598
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,910
"Love goes through the stomach."

1599
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,910
When someone cooks for you,
it makes a huge difference.

1600
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:16,910
(When one cooks to flirt,
it blossoms into love.)

1601
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,820
Should we have
the rice and the stew inside?

1602
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,420
It's much warmer inside.

1603
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:35,830
Is it ready?

1604
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,260
- Yes, I think it's ready.
- It's warm enough.

1605
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,230
The rice and the stew
will taste so good together.

1606
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,840
I think the doenjang stew will taste good.

1607
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,700
It smelled great.

1608
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,340
- Try it.
- Okay.

1609
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,810
(Humming in approval)

1610
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,880
It's so good.

1611
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,220
It tastes like the doenjang stew
you'd eat at home.

1612
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,520
- It tastes homemade, right?
- This... Yes.

1613
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:00,190
It's so good.

1614
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,560
It tastes like my mom's food.

1615
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,230
- It's...
- I'm glad I added more at the end.

1616
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,560
- Your mother's doenjang is really good.
- It's good.

1617
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,570
(The warmth of homemade food
fills the warm caravan.)

1618
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,240
Should we go to a listening bar?

1619
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,940
Like a listening cafe.

1620
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,910
- A place where we can listen to vinyl.
- That sounds good.

1621
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,650
Is there a place you know?

1622
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,360
That's how it looks.

1623
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,400
(Another night...)

1624
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,730
(deepens.)

1625
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,870
I can smell trouble.

1626
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,470
I don't know anymore.

1627
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,040
I don't know.

1628
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,770
Toward the end,
when Je Yeon looked at him,

1629
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,210
- she flinched slightly.
- Right.

1630
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,780
He was much closer than she thought.

1631
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,180
(They were close enough
to listen to each other's heartbeat.)

1632
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,880
She must've looked at him
because her heart was fluttering.

1633
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,350
That was a heart-fluttering moment.

1634
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:01,350
(There's a 99.99 percent chance
she got the butterflies.)

1635
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,520
They weren't overly flirty...

1636
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,250
or saying romantic things to each other.

1637
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,760
They're taking the time
to get to know each other.

1638
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,920
That's how it seems to me.

1639
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,130
I liked that about their date.

1640
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,860
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

1641
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,100
- I've got a great idea.
- What?

1642
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,100
- How about hitting up a street stall?
- Yes? Sounds good.

1643
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,100
- Doesn't that sound great?
- Yes.

1644
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,800
- How about a street stall after tripe?
- That's nice.

1645
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,440
- The one in Jongno. Sure.
- I love street stalls.

1646
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,310
- But do you like tripe?
- I do.

1647
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,310
- I love it.
- Yes.

1648
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,680
This is a famous place for tripe.
You haven't heard of it?

1649
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,440
- Let's go.
- They really look like siblings.

1650
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,910
I've never seen you drive.

1651
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,720
Gosh, I'm the best driver there is.

1652
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,020
- Please drive safely.
- Okay.

1653
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,290
Je Yeon's outfit didn't look warm enough.

1654
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,320
- What? What did she wear?
- A coat.

1655
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,990
Did she wear thermal clothing underneath?

1656
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,460
He's worried about her.

1657
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,400
I don't think she did.

1658
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,270
She might be really cold.

1659
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:53,100
I don't want her to catch a cold.

1660
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,400
Did you know that
being cute trumps being handsome?

1661
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,110
That's true.

1662
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,640
Let's name one cute thing
about our partner.

1663
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,680
- About Woo Jae?
- Yes.

1664
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,080
- Woo Jae has this habit.
- What is it?

1665
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,120
Smacking his lips.

1666
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,250
How? Can you show it to me?

1667
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,250
(Smacking her lips)

1668
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,650
- Because of the lip balm?
- No, for no reason.

1669
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,420
- He just does that for no reason?
- Yes.

1670
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,820
My mouth feels dry. I'm thirsty.

1671
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,530
(Smacking his lips)

1672
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,760
(This is Woo Jae's cute habit
Ji Won spotted.)

1673
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,570
He does that
when he doesn't know what to do.

1674
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,400
I think I know what you're talking about.

1675
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,870
It's your turn now.

1676
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,440
Have you seen Je Yeon make this face?

1677
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,140
(Looking coy)

1678
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,440
That's rare.

1679
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,780
- She's cute.
- Really?

1680
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,120
(The last day
of their contract relationship)

1681
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,820
Now, I can't be curious about
what you're up to at night.

1682
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,790
Je Yeon is so cute.

1683
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,900
Why did she glare at me?

1684
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,400
I bet she looked cute.

1685
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,630
(Pouting)

1686
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,940
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.

1687
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,940
- We can enjoy the food.
- Yes. Thank you.

1688
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,610
(A tripe restaurant in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

1689
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,870
Thank you.

1690
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,810
I'm going to eat a lot.

1691
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:11,980
Let's eat a lot.

1692
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,410
Here you go.

1693
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,050
- Let's drink with one hand now.
- Okay.

1694
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,420
I'll fill it up halfway.

1695
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Cheers.

1696
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,250
Cheers.

1697
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,920
(Cheers to not pairing together)

1698
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,490
(Hitting the spot)

1699
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,530
I love tripe.

1700
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,700
(It's so good.)

1701
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,740
- It's so good.
- She's cute.

1702
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,640
(Laughing)

1703
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,940
Right away?

1704
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:43,080
(They have another drink right away.)

1705
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,850
It's so good.

1706
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,290
(This is what I'm talking about!)

1707
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,320
Try it with the garlic and chili pepper.

1708
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,260
(They become one through tripe.)

1709
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,660
This is fun.

1710
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
This will be a good memory, right?

1711
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,170
When we didn't know
each other's name or age,

1712
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,140
it's funny how we went on a date together.

1713
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,270
I like pork belly and abomasum.

1714
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,380
There's a really good abomasum restaurant
around my house.

1715
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,380
Where do you live?

1716
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,180
I can't tell you that.

1717
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,880
- I think you can share where you live.
- No.

1718
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,450
Wait, your photo looks better than mine.

1719
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,560
- Really? I feel proud.
- Yes.

1720
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,430
No.

1721
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,630
They seemed to be interested
in each other at first.

1722
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,600
Was there a time you struggled
while filming the program?

1723
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,040
Me? I had a hard time in the beginning.

1724
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Right.

1725
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,040
It was...

1726
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,310
- In Italy?
- Yes.

1727
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,640
Why?

1728
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,610
- Are you setting boundaries with me?
- It's...

1729
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,810
No, that's not what I meant.

1730
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,350
I didn't know what to do.

1731
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:02,320
"What's the right thing to do?"

1732
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,520
I thought about that a lot.

1733
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,290
Right.

1734
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,660
Back then,
I knew you were younger than me.

1735
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
- Really?
- Yes.

1736
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,670
I could tell
you were on the younger side too.

1737
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,100
I thought we would be about the same age.

1738
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,940
- That's understandable.
- On our first day in Italy?

1739
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,840
In hindsight,
I think it might have been Ha Neul.

1740
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,650
I think it was Ha Neul,
knowing what I know now.

1741
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,250
It would be weirder if it were Ji Won.

1742
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,650
This is hard.

1743
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,620
By nature,
I don't think I'm a mature person.

1744
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,890
It's not about maturity.

1745
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,560
I thought we clicked well when we talked.

1746
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,330
I thought we hit it off when we talked.

1747
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,000
Right, it was fun talking to you.

1748
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:46,830
I think your honesty is
what makes you attractive.

1749
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,640
Yes. That's why I really like Je Yeon.

1750
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,810
- I like her.
- That's alcohol courage.

1751
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,370
He's so honest.

1752
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,040
I'm rooting for you.

1753
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,180
I really like you as a person.

1754
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,280
I know that you're honest and kind.

1755
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
So I'm rooting for you.

1756
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,350
If I'm stepping in as your agent,

1757
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,820
Woo Jae is serious about you too.

1758
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,150
It's quid pro quo.

1759
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,520
Trust him. Don't doubt him.

1760
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,130
Just express your feelings to him.

1761
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:12,130
Then you...

1762
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:14,960
will be in a great relationship.

1763
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,460
- They formed an alliance.
- They're so supportive of each other.

1764
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,600
- Yes.
- So this is it.

1765
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,230
"You guys have to date
after things work out for me first."

1766
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,000
- "I hope it works out for both of us."
- Yes.

1767
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,870
(Exchanging support)

1768
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,110
(The 2nd night
of their 2nd contract relationship)

1769
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,610
When it comes to tasty food...

1770
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:30,640
Hello.

1771
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,310
- Hello. You're back.
- Hello.

1772
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,310
Hello.

1773
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,050
It's never been this cold.

1774
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,620
You'll have to wear
a long puffer jacket tomorrow.

1775
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,620
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun come home next.)

1776
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Okay.

1777
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,890
I will.

1778
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,890
(Men's Truth or Dare)

1779
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,590
- I'll sit over there.
- No, sit here.

1780
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,960
- It's warm here.
- Right here.

1781
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,930
- Okay. Scoot over.
- Right now...

1782
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,640
What's going on? How did you end up here?
What happened?

1783
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,540
- We were talking.
- Is this a private chat among the guys?

1784
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,070
I was curious about how Chan Hyeong felt,
so I asked him.

1785
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,510
- Like how he's feeling these days.
- Of course, we're curious.

1786
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,510
Seriously.

1787
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,180
Actually, you've been the subject
of our conversation lately.

1788
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,580
- It's the biggest mystery.
- He's never shared anything with us.

1789
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,610
Seriously.

1790
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,780
Well, so far,

1791
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:11,020
I barely had any chances
to interact with them.

1792
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,520
- Really?
- So this week...

1793
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,520
- You met a lot of people this week.
- In a way...

1794
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,230
I think I ought to talk to everyone
at least once...

1795
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,790
before I make my decision.

1796
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,700
So I tried my best to make time.

1797
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,430
- I took some time off work.
- Yes, you did that a lot.

1798
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:30,000
I did all this
at the cost of shortening my life.

1799
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,510
So that's that. Anyway, I had a chance...

1800
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,380
to be in a contract relationship
with Chae Eun.

1801
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,780
She had this benefit that allowed her...

1802
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,850
- to go on a date with someone.
- Okay.

1803
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,810
So it was my second time
going out with her.

1804
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,220
Then again...

1805
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,050
(A secret guest arrives.)

1806
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,550
It's clear that...

1807
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:47,990
What is it?

1808
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,820
- Are you trying to steal something?
- What?

1809
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,130
- Why are you acting so careful?
- Why are you poking your head out?

1810
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,290
- Where is everyone?
- They're in their rooms.

1811
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,730
All the women are in their rooms.

1812
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,100
Men and women separated for a while.

1813
01:14:58,730 --> 01:14:59,930
That's true.

1814
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,800
I can clearly say...

1815
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,070
The same goes for everyone here.

1816
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,710
The more you talk to them...

1817
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,310
- The more they become charming?
- Yes, they're very charming.

1818
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,340
Right.

1819
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,480
It's fascinating.

1820
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,110
I went out with Chae Eun twice.

1821
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,820
On our second date, I was intrigued...

1822
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:16,980
to find another side of her.

1823
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,550
On our third date...

1824
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,650
It was our third date yesterday.

1825
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,420
I found out more about her
during our conversation.

1826
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:25,030
I found out more today.

1827
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,700
I thought that
people here were fascinating.

1828
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,860
- They're like onions.
- Exactly.

1829
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,230
Everyone has so many layers.

1830
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,270
My curiosity about her...

1831
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,600
has been amplified.

1832
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:40,270
Do you become more curious about her...

1833
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,840
the more you talk to her?

1834
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,440
Yes,
I'm more curious about her than before.

1835
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:46,980
I feel like there's more
to know about her.

1836
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,450
- There are sides of her I don't know.
- That kind of onion?

1837
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,620
- Like an onion.
- Yes.

1838
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,690
- She's like an onion.
- It's fascinating.

1839
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,420
You talked a lot with Je Yeon too.

1840
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,420
For one day.

1841
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,320
- You two...
- You were laughing a lot together.

1842
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,190
- Don't you make her laugh too?
- Not as much as he does.

1843
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,960
- How do you make her laugh so much?
- Right.

1844
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,000
What do you talk about to make her laugh?

1845
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,470
Can you imagine that I'm a girl
and talk to me?

1846
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,170
When I'm driven by a goal,
I get really into it.

1847
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,700
- It's hard to immerse himself in it.
- I want to learn from you.

1848
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,240
I keep thinking that
Chan Hyeong is the real catfish.

1849
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,270
Me too.

1850
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,640
He keeps resetting everything.

1851
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,050
He observed us for the 1st 2 weeks.

1852
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,810
(Bashful)

1853
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,280
After observing all the men,

1854
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,150
he figured out how he should be.

1855
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,220
He turned our weaknesses...

1856
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,990
- He's frightening.
- into his strengths.

1857
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,860
It was like, "Now that I've seen you all,"

1858
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,730
"let me stir things up."

1859
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,990
I wasn't waiting for the right time.

1860
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,430
In our second week,

1861
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,200
I couldn't take action
because I was too busy with work.

1862
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,200
Right.

1863
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,700
Soo Ah joined us as a new member.

1864
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,970
Yes.

1865
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,010
- Don't you want to talk to Soo Ah?
- How would you feel?

1866
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,240
Would you be curious about her?

1867
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,310
- What do you think?
- You know what?

1868
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,940
In terms of the number of people,
I hit my limit.

1869
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,810
Yes.

1870
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,220
- Do you feel relieved now?
- There are people I don't know, but...

1871
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,980
I can never be relieved in front of him.

1872
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,450
He's someone without limits.

1873
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,450
That's not true.

1874
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,260
The world is in the palm of his hand.

1875
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
The world?

1876
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,960
Are you leaning toward anyone?

1877
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,760
- I'm leaning toward...
- I'd like to know.

1878
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,930
There is someone.

1879
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,430
- I do have feelings for someone.
- I was curious.

1880
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,700
That's what I wanted to know.

1881
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,000
I have feelings for someone.

1882
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,670
(Sighing)

1883
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,040
Why are you sighing so heavily?

1884
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,540
- I feel disturbed.
- Why do you feel disturbed?

1885
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,240
I want to hear from you now.

1886
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,340
- It's your turn now.
- I feel disturbed in a good way.

1887
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,380
It's your turn.

1888
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,880
He is in love with Soo Ah.

1889
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,320
- Really?
- What?

1890
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,080
- It's true.
- How do you feel now?

1891
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,250
- How do you feel?
- Right.

1892
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,550
- The blind date...
- I went on...

1893
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,120
a completely blind date.

1894
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,220
No one does that.

1895
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,330
- How could anyone...
- Right.

1896
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,560
- You didn't know anything about her.
- When I turned around,

1897
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,830
I had some anticipation...

1898
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,030
and expectations.

1899
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:46,000
- I can't explain it in words.
- Right.

1900
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,200
- It felt like...
- I can see that.

1901
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,270
facing a spirit.

1902
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,170
- A spirit?
- It wasn't a bad feeling.

1903
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,940
I was like, "What's going on here?"

1904
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,670
It's impossible to explain.

1905
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,980
This is how nervous I was.

1906
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,210
It's normal to remember the person's name.

1907
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,780
- You forgot her name?
- I forgot her name twice.

1908
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,180
You must have been very nervous.

1909
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,320
I had a mental breakdown.

1910
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,390
Honestly, she's an outstanding person.

1911
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:11,320
It was chaotic yesterday.

1912
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,330
Today...

1913
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,330
- She looks round like this.
- Right.

1914
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,630
After our conversation,

1915
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,370
she shook my heart a lot.

1916
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,000
If she hadn't picked my book
and I didn't pick her, we wouldn't...

1917
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,440
We sent a text,

1918
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,070
but she picked your book.

1919
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,110
Exactly.

1920
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,440
- That's why you were matched.
- Yes.

1921
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,510
I didn't know until now.

1922
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,080
Do you have good feelings
about her so far?

1923
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,580
I'm glad to hear that.

1924
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,220
- Yes.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1925
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,420
Seriously.

1926
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,190
Can I tell them
what you told me yesterday?

1927
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:40,490
- No.
- Okay.

1928
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,060
- Did you share something?
- I said it jokingly.

1929
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:45,390
- Before going to bed...
- I'll tell them.

1930
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,830
- Okay.
- I told him jokingly,

1931
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,700
"I'm getting married in January."

1932
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,100
- I mean...
- It would be fun...

1933
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,430
- if we all came to your wedding.
- I agree.

1934
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,800
Please.

1935
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,170
Anyway, it was such a shock...

1936
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,270
that I even made that joke.

1937
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,010
- I see.
- Yes.

1938
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,680
It was a good kind of shock.

1939
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,080
I was very shocked yesterday.

1940
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,510
I see.

1941
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,180
Could you feel that he was that shocked?

1942
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:12,490
I was sleeping,
and he came out after washing up.

1943
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,820
He suddenly said,
"Ji Min, I think I'm getting married."

1944
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,890
That must be real.

1945
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,120
It's clear...

1946
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,290
when you fall for someone.

1947
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,660
It's safer to come this way.

1948
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,670
I put these on to avoid slipping.

1949
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Really?

1950
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,600
- Yes.
- I didn't know about that.

1951
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,700
Okay.

1952
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,910
They look like they've been a couple
for a long time.

1953
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,610
(Checking his hair)

1954
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:38,980
(Glancing)

1955
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,980
He's in a good mood.

1956
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,150
(What happened to Chang Hwan?)

1957
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:47,520
Here's what I honestly thought.

1958
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,260
Could dating be this fun?

1959
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,160
- That's amazing.
- Here's why.

1960
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,230
That's amazing.

1961
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,130
- Let me explain.
- That's truly amazing.

1962
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,060
You're experienced in dating.

1963
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,860
Exactly.

1964
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,970
- I mean...
- With your experience...

1965
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,740
This is what I'm saying.

1966
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:04,370
I thought that you were just being shy...

1967
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,970
after meeting someone new.

1968
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,210
That's all I thought.

1969
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,380
I thought that he was being shy.

1970
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,980
Men become children when they're in love.

1971
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,780
That explains it.

1972
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,320
- He's cute.
- He's cute.

1973
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,120
Why am I sighing?

1974
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,950
(How does Chang Hwan feel...)

1975
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,050
He can't stop smiling.

1976
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,560
People can't hide their feelings.

1977
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,690
(How does Chang Hwan feel about Soo Ah?)

1978
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,960
You know what I noticed?

1979
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,960
I tend to talk more in the car...

1980
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:34,470
than when we're eating.

1981
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,740
I see.

1982
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,870
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

1983
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,840
I get nervous when I'm facing you.

1984
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,870
Right.

1985
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,780
- When we're facing each other,
- Is that normal?

1986
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,810
don't I get more nervous than you?

1987
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:46,280
You get very nervous.

1988
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,420
I like this feeling...

1989
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,620
of nervousness.

1990
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:55,290
- You like it when I'm nervous?
- No, how I feel nervous.

1991
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:59,390
The thought of spending
a good time with you...

1992
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,190
- makes me nervous.
- That's a nice remark.

1993
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,200
(Nervousness that is slightly tickling)

1994
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,860
He knows how to talk so honestly.

1995
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,430
Chang Hwan is so charming.

1996
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,200
I feel reassured.

1997
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,670
It sounds meaningful.

1998
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:11,140
I feel much better.

1999
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,310
The building looks pretty.

2000
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,280
She walks so confidently.

2001
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,480
It's on the left.

2002
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,250
(They arrive at a new place.)

2003
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,720
She opens the door powerfully.

2004
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,390
(They arrive at a new place.)

2005
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,620
Hello.

2006
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,360
Both of you look so beautiful.

2007
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,720
Thank you.

2008
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,990
Please put this on.

2009
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,860
- Shall I put it over my clothes?
- Yes.

2010
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,060
That looks fun.

2011
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,460
(He puts on the vest
for horseback riding.)

2012
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,330
(Stiff)

2013
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:42,970
The outfit looks good on Chang Hwan.

2014
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,240
It's because he's tall.

2015
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,540
(Soo Ah also gets changed.)

2016
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,910
- You look cute.
- He said that she looks cute.

2017
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,080
- You look nice.
- Really?

2018
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
She looks pretty.

2019
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,380
(Quiet)

2020
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,120
Goodness.

2021
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,190
(Chang Hwan takes a photo of Soo Ah.)

2022
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,860
She looks cute. It looks good on her.

2023
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,720
Let's take a photo of our feet.

2024
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,730
Okay.

2025
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,760
Let's take a selfie.

2026
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:09,730
One, two, three.

2027
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,900
- They look so great together.
- Like this?

2028
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,230
- I hope that they get together.
- Goodness.

2029
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,300
(Their first selfie)

2030
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,800
- They were very close.
- Yes.

2031
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,370
This is fascinating.

2032
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:23,340
(How will their first
horseback riding go?)

2033
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,640
I feel nervous.

2034
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,780
It's scarier than you think.

2035
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,780
This is fun.

2036
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,250
It's very high.

2037
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,690
When you set off, you'll make a sound.

2038
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,390
- You'll make a sound like this.
- Okay.

2039
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,590
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

2040
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:38,690
Please make the sound.

2041
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,690
(Clicking sound)

2042
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,860
The rein...

2043
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,400
From here...

2044
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,430
(Chang Hwan goes first.)

2045
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:46,370
Nice. Don't tighten your hands.

2046
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:47,470
- Stay relaxed.
- Okay.

2047
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,770
You'll start moving now.

2048
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,370
(Soo Ah goes after him.)

2049
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,240
Click. That's it.

2050
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,440
(Soo Ah goes after him.)

2051
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:54,870
He's so gentle.

2052
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:57,540
Chang Hwan has a nice posture.

2053
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:59,910
That's it.

2054
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,350
This is so much fun.

2055
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,920
I want to ride the horse
all the way to my house.

2056
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,920
Just like this.

2057
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,690
I'll want to do this again.

2058
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,760
- Right?
- Yes.

2059
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,860
I'll want to do it.

2060
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,830
It's so beautiful.

2061
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,500
Your outfit is perfect for today.

2062
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,930
- Right.
- Seriously.

2063
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:20,470
Seriously.

2064
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,170
You look like a rider.

2065
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,700
I'll never forget it.

2066
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,710
- Really?
- Yes.

2067
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,240
You might come here every weekend.

2068
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,710
We might bump into each other here
every weekend.

2069
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:31,680
Among all the things you've done here,

2070
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,280
- isn't this the best?
- It really is.

2071
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,620
- Among the things you've done here.
- Totally.

2072
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,690
- Time flies.
- Yes.

2073
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,390
That's pretty.

2074
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,120
Hello, Karong. Let me feed you.

2075
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:46,930
It smells...

2076
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,290
very strong.

2077
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,130
Don't eat it.

2078
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,930
- Weren't you going to eat it?
- Yes.

2079
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:54,400
- No, you shouldn't do that.
- I'm curious.

2080
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,370
I understand, but you can't.

2081
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,910
- You didn't expect to feed him?
- He's so cute.

2082
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:00,470
(After enjoying their horseback riding)

2083
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,410
It was much more fun...

2084
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,580
than I expected.

2085
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,280
- More than you expected?
- Yes.

2086
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,780
I didn't feel nervous.
Neither was I scared.

2087
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,620
This place is quite beautiful.

2088
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,890
- Right.
- You can see the snowy mountain.

2089
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,890
She keeps giving him positive feedback.

2090
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,490
I won't forget horseback riding today.

2091
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,560
(Nodding)

2092
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:23,200
We met for the first time
when it was snowing.

2093
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,900
Suddenly,
we got into a contract relationship.

2094
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,940
We spent three days together.

2095
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,410
(Their first meeting
when it was snowing heavily)

2096
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,680
I turned around to meet you
for the first time.

2097
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,310
The moment I saw your eyes
for the first time.

2098
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,510
I don't think I'll ever be able
to forget that.

2099
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,710
It was way too intense.

2100
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,750
(He'll never be able to forget
the first day he met Soo Ah.)

2101
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,050
I was really surprised, in a good way.

2102
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:50,120
My first impression of you
was that intense.

2103
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,130
It was lovely.

2104
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,730
You looked beautiful to me.

2105
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,270
(He honestly told his feelings.)

2106
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,940
(It melts my heart!)

2107
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,640
Today,

2108
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:09,240
I felt that I was being
my true self on the date.

2109
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,510
It took 40 minutes to get here, right?

2110
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,810
You said, "It takes 40 minutes."

2111
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,980
"You don't have to say anything."

2112
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,390
"You can just sit still or take a nap."

2113
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,990
"Do whatever you want."

2114
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,060
It takes 40 minutes.

2115
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,460
Feel free to take a nap
if you're tired or sleepy.

2116
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,730
I'm not the type to feel sleepy
when I drive.

2117
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:31,900
You were being respectful to me.

2118
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:34,100
I was really thankful...

2119
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,600
for that.

2120
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,140
(She noticed
his respect and consideration.)

2121
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:41,980
For the last three days,
I've watched you...

2122
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,180
wait for me and help me feel comfortable.

2123
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:47,750
I'd never take it for granted.

2124
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,820
I was genuinely happy today.

2125
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,120
Thank you for saying that.

2126
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,560
Even when the contract relationship ends,

2127
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,930
- it's not like we'll be strangers.
- Right.

2128
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,360
To be...

2129
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:06,270
true to my current feelings,

2130
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:12,340
I'll try not to let go of this connection.

2131
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,940
(Nodding)

2132
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,880
(He realized his feelings
during the date.)

2133
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,680
We'll be forced to spend time with others,
right?

2134
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,580
And I feel like...

2135
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:27,290
you'll be on my mind when I do.

2136
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,390
Oh, my.

2137
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,320
(They feel regretful,
frustrated, and conflicted.)

2138
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,790
I...

2139
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:35,500
(They feel regretful,
frustrated, and conflicted.)

2140
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,900
wonder...

2141
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,600
what you think.

2142
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,530
But...

2143
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,100
it's not like you've talked
to others enough.

2144
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,270
It's only the beginning for you.

2145
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,950
So, feel no pressure to tell me.

2146
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,280
Your charms that I noticed today...

2147
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,920
and everything else.

2148
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,990
They'll realize them as well.

2149
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,650
Will they?

2150
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:04,290
I'm sure they'll realize them soon.

2151
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,490
Chang Hwan is certainly broad-minded.

2152
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:09,460
What he just said got to Soo Ah.

2153
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,430
And you're so easygoing and kind.

2154
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,370
But, as I said,

2155
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,140
I won't just sit there.

2156
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,240
- Great!
- Great.

2157
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,480
Have fun on the trip.

2158
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,580
Maybe a domestic trip.

2159
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,280
That's what it feels like.

2160
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,920
Travel safely, and...

2161
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:33,420
And come back home?

2162
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,790
You'll have to come home eventually.

2163
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,860
(How will the trip end?)

2164
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,900
Gosh.

2165
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,630
Chang Hwan...

2166
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,300
made himself clear.

2167
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,400
- Yes.
- Right?

2168
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,470
- I feel like crying.
- He did his best.

2169
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:53,540
Why are you sad?

2170
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:54,910
On top of everything else,

2171
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:57,580
I feel like...

2172
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,910
he's been lost for a long time.

2173
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,380
He finally met a good woman after so long,

2174
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,150
and he must be having
such mixed and subtle emotions.

2175
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:09,090
Please be a couple in the end.

2176
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,430
Let's go to a Lego store.

2177
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,960
- Sure.
- Let's enjoy the date.

2178
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,460
They're going to a Lego store.

2179
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,130
- I can tell it's for experienced people.
- They share the same hobby.

2180
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,130
(A Lego store in Yongsan, Seoul)

2181
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,600
- Look.
- This is paradise for me.

2182
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,900
You would have been far happier...

2183
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,570
if you had come sooner.

2184
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,470
(Excited)

2185
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,780
It's so pretty.

2186
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
- That's cute.
- It really is.

2187
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:34,580
- They have a variety.
- So cute!

2188
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,880
This one's cute.

2189
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,750
- It's adorable.
- Right?

2190
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,890
(They find all types of Legos cute.)

2191
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,420
The older version of this shark
was better.

2192
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,490
I don't like the look on this one.

2193
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,020
They made the eyes too radiant.

2194
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,190
This just looks like a toy.

2195
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,630
- I think I get what you mean.
- Don't you agree?

2196
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,630
The eyes are too radiant.

2197
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,200
This one is Christmas-themed.

2198
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,900
- There's a tree.
- Yes.

2199
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,840
Let's build these two
and put them by the tree in the house.

2200
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,010
- These two?
- Yes.

2201
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,740
This one's cute too.

2202
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:04,510
I'm so happy!

2203
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:06,050
You can go first.

2204
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:08,050
Thank you.

2205
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,350
(They return home with both hands full.)

2206
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,250
Let's start building them
before our food arrives.

2207
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,320
Sure.

2208
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,090
- Look! So nice.
- They never disappoint.

2209
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,860
- Oh, my gosh! I'm thrilled.
- This is incredible.

2210
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,600
- I'm so thrilled right now.
- Look.

2211
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,160
- It's so pretty.
- That's awesome.

2212
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,400
It really is pretty.
I've never seen anything like it.

2213
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,400
And we're building them
in front of a tree.

2214
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,200
This tree, my Rudolph socks,

2215
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,510
and your Santa cup
will look so cute together.

2216
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,540
Let's start from number one.

2217
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:37,980
Check this out.

2218
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,150
Pretzel.

2219
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:42,380
Pretzel! It must be tasty.

2220
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,720
Even a Lego pretzel looks tasty.

2221
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,290
This, and...

2222
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,820
(Their lunch arrives at the perfect time.)

2223
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,230
- That must be our food.
- Yes.

2224
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,960
- I'll go and get it.
- Thank you.

2225
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,930
They look like a married couple
spending time on a weekend.

2226
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,730
Here you go.

2227
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:02,500
(They're eating burgers for lunch
as it's convenient.)

2228
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,770
Fries, nuggets...

2229
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,770
Shrimp... No, these are nuggets.

2230
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:07,840
This is fried shrimp.
And those are mozzarella sticks.

2231
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:08,880
Great.

2232
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,110
I love their burgers.

2233
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,350
It looks so good.

2234
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,680
- Try this too.
- Yes.

2235
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,750
I'll try it.

2236
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,490
(A big bite)

2237
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:21,020
Chae Eun is such a big eater.

2238
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,260
- It's so good.
- Yes.

2239
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,260
- It's good, right?
- It's delicious.

2240
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,730
But I have to keep going.

2241
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:32,630
- I think it's a present.
- Yes.

2242
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,130
I'll do this one.

2243
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,370
- They're alike in many ways.
- Yes.

2244
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,040
- They like building things like that.
- A present.

2245
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,870
That was quick.

2246
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,240
(Load the sleigh with presents.)

2247
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,980
- They're done?
- They're done.

2248
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,150
- They're good.
- Ta-da.

2249
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,950
(And it's finished.)

2250
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,220
That's adorable.

2251
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:55,420
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

2252
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,190
They're so similar, and I love it.

2253
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,360
(Their contract relationship ends soon.)

2254
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,600
I think we have less than an hour.

2255
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,570
- You're right.
- We only have 18 minutes.

2256
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:09,770
- It's so soon.
- Yes.

2257
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:10,800
They feel bad.

2258
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,510
This can't be.

2259
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,680
(Upset)

2260
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,310
Right. Time flies.

2261
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,050
When are you going to read this, though?

2262
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,850
My message.

2263
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,650
He didn't read her text yet?

2264
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,290
You can't read it once it's gone.

2265
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,090
After 5 p.m...

2266
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:32,530
I love how she says that
with a smile on her face.

2267
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:34,230
- You're so mean.
- Wait.

2268
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,300
So, you sent it last night...

2269
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,700
- before bed?
- Yes.

2270
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,800
- I wanted to thank you.
- She's touching her hair.

2271
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,470
I should reply.

2272
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:43,600
- You will?
- Yes.

2273
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,410
He's replying
when she's right in front of him.

2274
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:49,980
- It's obviously your tone.
- Is it?

2275
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,610
- Do I have a tone?
- Yes, a unique tone.

2276
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:53,610
You sound so benevolent.

2277
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:55,080
(It was so tasty that it moved my heart!
I'll remember your food. Thank you.)

2278
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,790
It's true that people look
the most beautiful when they're in love.

2279
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,030
You know,

2280
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,590
when you get to know someone,

2281
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,660
new things often make you go, "What?"

2282
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:13,900
- It can also be negative.
- Yes.

2283
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:16,440
Like, "That's unusual."

2284
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,970
"That's not really my type."

2285
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,240
You may come to find that.

2286
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,710
You realize,
"She's a little different from me."

2287
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:25,040
But honestly, all the new things
I found out about you...

2288
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:26,910
were attractive to me.

2289
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,950
- Really?
- Yes.

2290
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,680
That's the best compliment.

2291
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,320
- How...
- From catching bugs.

2292
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,320
I listened to your stories...

2293
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,360
and got to know you better.

2294
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,990
Chan Hyeong must have
genuinely enjoyed it.

2295
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,530
The contract relationship with you...

2296
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:49,200
was quieter than I expected.

2297
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,200
It was like...

2298
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,010
Do you get what I mean?

2299
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:54,240
- It was quiet?
- Yes.

2300
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,440
It was really...

2301
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,750
- I feel like my true self.
- Oh, right.

2302
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,050
- I feel like my true self too.
- Yes.

2303
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,550
I'm not overly excited.

2304
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:06,890
And you were considerate enough
to help me feel that.

2305
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,090
I'm really thankful.

2306
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,090
No, I received more from you this time.

2307
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:14,230
Nothing can beat that food.

2308
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,430
I don't think anyone can beat
what you cooked for me.

2309
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:18,760
- Really?
- I doubt it.

2310
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,500
He must have really liked it.

2311
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,640
I should have made it tastier.

2312
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,870
Those kind smiles.

2313
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,510
I hope...

2314
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,240
they actually get married.

2315
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,280
Certainly.

2316
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,610
(What did the 3 days mean to them?)

2317
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,950
(I'm rooting for this couple.)

2318
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,250
When they were building the blocks,

2319
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,720
they looked like newlyweds
enjoying the same hobby...

2320
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,790
- on a weekend.
- Yes.

2321
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,820
You also play tennis...

2322
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,460
- with your wife.
- I do.

2323
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,790
That's how I met her, after all.

2324
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,000
(Oh, right.)

2325
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,100
Having a shared hobby can be nice.

2326
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,600
But the good thing is that
I don't think...

2327
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,330
either of them will be involved
with anyone else.

2328
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,370
- Never. Not anymore.
- Right.

2329
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,870
They're the perfect match now.

2330
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,070
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun
are looking solid.

2331
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,380
(A new day begins.)

2332
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,680
(Moist)

2333
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,980
- Is that a lip balm?
- Yes.

2334
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,950
My lips have been feeling dry,
so I often apply it.

2335
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:14,220
I have another one. Do you want it?

2336
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:16,790
Sure. Thank you.

2337
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,430
- The sky is so clear.
- Right?

2338
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:23,100
- It was kind of cloudy yesterday.
- It was.

2339
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,160
- Right?
- Yes.

2340
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,300
And it's so sunny today.

2341
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,600
It's their last day.

2342
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,740
(It's especially sunny on the last day
of their contract relationship.)

2343
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,210
What was the toughest place
that you ate alone?

2344
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,540
- The toughest?
- Yes.

2345
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,340
A pork belly place
where they cook it for you.

2346
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,980
That's incredible.

2347
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,280
I'm impressed
that you ate at a pork belly place.

2348
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,280
- Really?
- Yes.

2349
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,250
A pork belly place...

2350
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,820
has a difficulty level of about 3.5
among places you can eat alone.

2351
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,820
- Right.
- Right.

2352
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:52,430
I'm one to be like this while working.

2353
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:54,830
If I'm in the zone
while writing something,

2354
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,460
- I don't want to stop.
- I know what you mean.

2355
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,770
- I need to finish it at that moment.
- Right.

2356
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,200
So I stay behind until I'm done...

2357
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,900
and leave the office
at around 2 a.m. at times.

2358
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,400
You lose all your ideas
if you're interrupted.

2359
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,410
Exactly.

2360
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,210
You know that writing that first word
is always the hardest.

2361
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,240
Exactly.

2362
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:14,850
That first sentence is the highest hurdle.

2363
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,450
I know.

2364
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,920
That's why I eat alone often.

2365
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:23,260
Today,
we'll enjoy a delicious meal together.

2366
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,990
Sure.

2367
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:29,560
(A Chinese restaurant in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

2368
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:33,670
(A mysterious vibe)

2369
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:34,930
What is this place?

2370
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:37,600
It's fascinating.

2371
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,610
- It's really nice.
- I know.

2372
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,940
It's like a movie set...

2373
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,510
- of a Hong Kong film.
- Right.

2374
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,510
Let's take one.

2375
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,780
Where do we sit? Come this way.

2376
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:53,190
(Taking a photo using the device
provided inside the restaurant)

2377
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:56,560
(Pouting)

2378
01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:58,960
Did you just inflate your cheeks?

2379
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,860
- Of course not.
- I think you just tried to look cute.

2380
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,760
- Well, I'm naturally cute.
- You are.

2381
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,670
That looks fascinating.

2382
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:07,970
(Their food is served.)

2383
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,470
- What's that?
- We serve cotton candy with guobaorou.

2384
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,670
(Fascinated)

2385
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:16,210
(She's adorable.)

2386
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,980
Where should I put the soup?

2387
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:21,150
- She ordered the hongtang.
- The hongtang is for me.

2388
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:23,780
The soup is redder than I expected.

2389
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:24,780
Isn't it spicy?

2390
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,220
I think it could be spicy.

2391
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:27,420
Then have mine.

2392
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,220
You can't eat spicy food, though.

2393
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:30,720
Right.

2394
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,660
- I'll have it.
- We can share.

2395
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,660
We can share.

2396
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:37,830
Thanks.

2397
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,170
He's very kind.

2398
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,370
- How is it? Is it?
- It's good. Yes.

2399
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:49,510
(Gazing)

2400
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,420
The weekend went by in a flash.

2401
01:36:58,580 --> 01:36:59,850
Time really flew.

2402
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,990
Maybe it's because we met up so late.

2403
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:09,900
We met up late on Friday, and yesterday...

2404
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,160
Well, we met at 5 p.m.

2405
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,140
- Are you sad about it?
- What? Yes.

2406
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:19,910
She didn't even hesitate.

2407
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:22,340
With him, Je Yeon doesn't hold back.

2408
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,710
Have weekends always been this short?

2409
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,250
Tell me about it.

2410
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,950
Still, it was fun.

2411
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,450
Right.

2412
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,250
- Shall we get going?
- Sure.

2413
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,850
We'll get some coffee.

2414
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:41,930
Thanks to you, I was able to experience...

2415
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,630
such nice things.

2416
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,170
And it...

2417
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,740
It was nice.

2418
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,910
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

2419
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,210
There's no better way to put it.

2420
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,650
The weather feels warmer
than it did before.

2421
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,890
- You're right.
- Right?

2422
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:10,160
This...

2423
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,520
(A cafe in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul)

2424
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,130
It's nice to be up so high.

2425
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,430
It's so pretty here.

2426
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,430
(Gosh)

2427
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,600
(They arrive at a coffee shop
with a view of Seoul.)

2428
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,200
(They receive their order.)

2429
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,570
He placed the spoon within her reach.

2430
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,440
He's attentive, isn't he?

2431
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,240
(She's Adorable, and So Is He.)

2432
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,050
It's super sweet.

2433
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,580
(Bursting into laughter)

2434
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,020
It's really sweet.

2435
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:41,490
Of course.

2436
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,120
That was cute.

2437
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,460
You seem to wear a lot
of brightly colored clothes.

2438
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:46,730
- Me?
- Yes.

2439
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,090
- You wear a lot of white.
- Right.

2440
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,770
Meanwhile, my clothes are mostly dark.

2441
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,470
- I don't wear white a lot.
- Why not?

2442
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,110
I'm not the kind of person
who's careful about everything.

2443
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:07,710
Do you get things on your clothes?

2444
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:09,050
They get dirty easily,

2445
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:10,480
and I have trouble managing them.

2446
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,520
I'm amazed at how people who wear white...

2447
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,190
manage to keep their clothes
so clean all the time.

2448
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,760
That's admirable.

2449
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:22,560
I bet you thought that was odd.

2450
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:25,530
Gosh, no.

2451
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,470
We only have about a week left now.

2452
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,710
Is it a week?

2453
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,980
More or less.

2454
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,580
I hate that we only get one weekend.

2455
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,790
It seems like yesterday
that I waited for you outside...

2456
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,120
in the snow.

2457
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,790
Time went by so fast.

2458
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,290
- Already.
- Wasn't it yesterday?

2459
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,530
- What?
- Wasn't it yesterday?

2460
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,560
The day before that.

2461
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:00,970
You're a Type T, aren't you?

2462
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,640
It was...

2463
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:14,110
so much fun.

2464
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,950
(Nodding)

2465
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,150
I know. I had a blast too.

2466
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,950
(Nodding)

2467
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,690
So tell me about this weekend.

2468
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,400
How was it for you?

2469
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,200
(Pondering)

2470
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,370
How was it for me?

2471
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,780
(Nervous)

2472
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,280
Describe how you felt.

2473
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,680
That's your question.

2474
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:51,450
There's no right answer.

2475
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:53,220
- There's adorable.
- "There's no right answer."

2476
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,590
It's hard to write that first line.

2477
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,130
You can give me your answer in 30 minutes.

2478
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:08,200
Sang Yun's so witty, isn't he?

2479
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:12,970
Remember when we had that meal?

2480
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:15,410
The day after your first night with us.

2481
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,340
I'm not the type to express my feelings...

2482
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,080
when things get tough.

2483
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,580
I tend to handle it internally.

2484
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:29,320
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon
shared a heartfelt conversation.)

2485
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:34,290
You seem like someone
who shares my values.

2486
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,370
And the thoughts and views on life.

2487
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,170
I felt like you knew me,

2488
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,940
even though I hardly said anything.

2489
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,280
Because of that,
it was easy to be around you.

2490
01:41:55,450 --> 01:42:00,020
Being with you felt different
from being with everyone else.

2491
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:03,290
She's telling him how she felt.
How honest of her.

2492
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:05,290
Some couples put in effort
to be compatible,

2493
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,530
while others connect instantly.

2494
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,200
I felt like we were compatible
from the start.

2495
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:16,870
That's why I wanted to talk to you more.

2496
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:27,110
To me,

2497
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:31,520
you felt like someone...

2498
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,420
I wouldn't easily come across.

2499
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,960
That's why I wanted to know you.

2500
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,130
I can tell...

2501
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,930
that you are someone incredible.

2502
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,170
During this contract relationship,

2503
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,740
did you ever feel like...

2504
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:58,610
you truly wanted to date me?

2505
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,950
- Goodness.
- No way.

2506
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,620
He asked her point-blank.

2507
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,350
The timing was great.

2508
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:06,650
- They only have a week left.
- Right.

2509
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:07,720
(Time is running out.)

2510
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:11,390
Did you ever feel like
you truly wanted to date me?

2511
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:16,860
He's nervous.

2512
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,410
Yes.

2513
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:33,610
He's thrilled.

2514
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,050
You can see his dimples.

2515
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,720
At the glamping site,

2516
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,320
you made doenjang stew for me.

2517
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:42,190
It's really good.

2518
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,720
It tastes like it was homemade.

2519
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,060
- Like it's made with homemade doenjang.
- Yes.

2520
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:49,560
I thought having dinner with you like that
would make me happy.

2521
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:56,370
(32. A daily moment
you'd love to share with your spouse)

2522
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:58,040
(A trivial everyday moment
Je Yeon wants to share with her spouse)

2523
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,670
(Talking about our day over dinner)

2524
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,540
Remember how I said...

2525
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:04,480
that it tasted like it was homemade?

2526
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:06,780
- Yes, you said that.
- That's how I felt.

2527
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,320
- It's really good.
- I'll cook for you again.

2528
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:15,650
Maybe something else.
I even brought some doenjang.

2529
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:16,820
- Really?
- Yes.

2530
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:19,690
I could've done a better job.

2531
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:21,390
It was delicious.

2532
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:24,830
I doubt it could've been any better.

2533
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:28,970
Next time,
adding beef brisket or wild chives...

2534
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,340
will make it even better.

2535
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,770
(Nodding)

2536
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,970
- That's how I'll make it next time.
- Sure.

2537
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,480
What about you?

2538
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,720
She asked. Oh, my gosh.

2539
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,120
"What about you?"

2540
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,450
(What will Sang Yun say?)

2541
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,160
What about you?

2542
01:44:58,830 --> 01:44:59,830
Me too.

2543
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:03,340
(Me too.)

2544
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,300
I felt a little something.

2545
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:07,570
When?

2546
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:09,810
- What?
- When?

2547
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,510
I...

2548
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,750
(Fidgeting)

2549
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,850
If I had to answer yes or no,

2550
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,120
I'd be lying if I said no.

2551
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,390
So when was it?

2552
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:28,830
Honestly,

2553
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:31,860
it wasn't a specific moment.

2554
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,770
You were...

2555
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:40,170
always...

2556
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,910
all ears.

2557
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:48,410
I realized you were a great listener.

2558
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:54,690
That was what I felt.

2559
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:57,090
- That wasn't the answer Je Yeon wanted.
- No.

2560
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,260
I see.

2561
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:07,530
She moved her foot back.

2562
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,500
What does that mean, Professor?

2563
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,770
Je Yeon might take the answer as,

2564
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:14,740
"There were no such moments for me."

2565
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:15,810
I would too.

2566
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:17,610
In an attorney's term,

2567
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:19,410
it had no concreteness.

2568
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,450
Exactly.

2569
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:21,910
(Why make such a mistake?)

2570
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:36,130
But ice skating, camping,

2571
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:38,130
and having meals with you...

2572
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,430
Although
this is our first coffee together...

2573
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,670
We shared countless conversations.

2574
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:51,340
We did to the point
where there's almost nothing...

2575
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,810
to talk about now.

2576
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:57,620
I enjoyed every moment of it.

2577
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,520
It was nice.

2578
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,520
Oh, no.

2579
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,100
I feel like I was incoherent.

2580
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,200
You spoke well.

2581
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,110
That's...

2582
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:29,510
Things suddenly got awkward.

2583
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,790
It's pretty.

2584
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,560
Isn't it?

2585
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,730
Oh, no.

2586
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:43,460
She changed the subject.

2587
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,900
There must be a lot on her mind.

2588
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,730
(Turning)

2589
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:52,770
(Turning)

2590
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,280
(Moving)

2591
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:05,380
If we were to go on a date again,

2592
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,820
is there something you want to do?

2593
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:13,390
I have yet to make my wish.

2594
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:16,260
What should I ask for? I'll have you cook.

2595
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:18,760
- What?
- I'll ask you to cook.

2596
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,370
(He won a wish voucher
from the skate race.)

2597
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,140
Ask for something simple.

2598
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:26,440
- What?
- Ask for something simple.

2599
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,940
(Laughing)

2600
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,040
- Something simple?
- Yes.

2601
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:37,120
Something like spaghetti alle vongole?

2602
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,680
You are...

2603
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:40,950
craving...

2604
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,660
- vongole the most?
- I've never had it before.

2605
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,560
- You never had it?
- No.

2606
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,230
But why that?

2607
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:50,460
Because I never tried it before.

2608
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:52,600
I can't compare it with anything else.

2609
01:48:56,770 --> 01:49:00,010
Even if you screw up,
I'd think that's how it usually tastes.

2610
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:04,640
You have low expectations, don't you?

2611
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:07,080
- What?
- It's like you have no expectations.

2612
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,750
The fact that someone who doesn't cook...

2613
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:15,520
cooks for me is more than enough.

2614
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,560
With that dish...

2615
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,560
Yes?

2616
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,030
and all the lights off,

2617
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:30,670
we should eat
with white wine or something.

2618
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:34,170
I'm in.

2619
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,780
(Staring)

2620
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:41,850
I also...

2621
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:44,820
had that feeling.

2622
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,480
Especially since the skating rink,

2623
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:50,760
it was as if we were actually dating.

2624
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,860
(Sang Yun felt the same as Je Yeon.)

2625
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:59,300
I wanted to put it into cool words.

2626
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:03,700
Looking back,
it was the most memorable moment.

2627
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,570
(Did Sang Yun's feelings reach Je Yeon?)

2628
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,470
What now?

2629
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,810
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon's
contract relationship has ended.)

2630
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,780
- The ending was...
- I don't know anymore.

2631
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,780
(How it ended is unsettling.)

2632
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:13,780
The ending...

2633
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:15,410
That was ambiguous.

2634
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,220
Je Yeon asked exactly when...

2635
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,320
- he felt it.
- Right.

2636
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,990
Je Yeon answered
with the doenjang stew moment.

2637
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,860
But Sang Yun's answer was unclear.

2638
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:26,460
Je Yeon didn't get
the answer she anticipated.

2639
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,090
- Everything was great...
- Right.

2640
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:29,590
except for the last part
of their conversation.

2641
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,160
I totally agree.

2642
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,730
- Let's clean up before we eat.
- Okay.

2643
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,770
All right.

2644
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,800
- Hey, Rocky.
- Yes, I'm right here.

2645
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,370
Start cleaning.

2646
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:41,670
Okay, I will start cleaning.

2647
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,140
- Isn't it smart?
- Yes.

2648
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,980
- It understood everything.
- Exactly.

2649
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:46,980
(Cleaning thoroughly)

2650
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,380
(Amazed)

2651
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,790
- Why is it cute?
- It's adorable.

2652
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,550
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

2653
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:58,060
It was a good choice.

2654
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:59,320
- After this,
- Yes?

2655
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:01,960
let's head out for some tea.

2656
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:02,990
Okay.

2657
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2658
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,300
(A cafe in Mapo-gu, Seoul)

2659
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,900
This place has a Korean vibe.

2660
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,940
A Korean vibe with French desserts.

2661
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,940
You're right.

2662
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:15,110
- Now that the time to choose is nearing,
- Yes?

2663
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,940
- we need time to focus...
- To focus...

2664
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,980
on our potential partner.

2665
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:22,250
I want to have a chat with Ji Min.

2666
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,310
Right.

2667
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:25,020
You need to...

2668
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:27,020
spend some time with Ji Min.

2669
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,850
I think I do too.

2670
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:32,520
Only then can you make a better decision.

2671
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,060
- If I get a chance,
- Yes?

2672
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,300
I want to talk to him.

2673
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:41,330
I really enjoyed
the time I had with him in Italy.

2674
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:45,970
I want to spend time with Ji Min...

2675
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:47,140
and get to know him.

2676
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:48,910
It was great back then.

2677
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:51,940
But I'm not sure if it was enjoyable...

2678
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:55,850
because of the vibe in Italy...

2679
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:59,650
or if it just felt that way
because we haven't talked much.

2680
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:02,190
I want an answer to it.

2681
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:04,720
But from what I see,
Ji Min is very transparent.

2682
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:09,860
Even I could tell
he only had eyes for one person.

2683
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:12,430
It was quite tiresome.

2684
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:15,700
I expressed myself openly to Ji Min.

2685
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:17,600
Have some of it.

2686
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,770
This is amazing. How witty.

2687
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:22,370
Praise me.

2688
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:24,510
- You've got great taste, Joo Ha Neul.
- Praise me.

2689
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:27,080
- Hurry up and praise me.
- Good job.

2690
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,150
You want me to pat you?

2691
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,880
(Laughing)

2692
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:37,490
- I want to confirm it.
- Check again?

2693
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:44,500
(Late at night
after the contract relationships ended)

2694
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:56,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

2695
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,310
I see that you're getting a massage.

2696
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,750
I walked a lot today,

2697
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,510
so my legs are swollen.
So I'm getting a massage.

2698
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:05,050
Let's buy some gifts.

2699
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:08,850
(During her contract relationship
with Ji Min,)

2700
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:11,990
(Ji Won walked around a lot
to find gifts.)

2701
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,890
- Does it feel good?
- Yes.

2702
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,700
- Do you want to try?
- What?

2703
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,000
- Can I?
- Yes.

2704
01:53:21,370 --> 01:53:23,130
My calves feel heavy today.

2705
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,040
(During his contract relationship
with Ha Neul,)

2706
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,740
(Woo Jae made a rug standing up all day.)

2707
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:31,110
Really? This massages the whole leg.

2708
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,140
It hits the spot.

2709
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:34,410
(Rushing)

2710
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:37,850
(Woo Jae helps Ji Won with her slippers.)

2711
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:44,490
(Pressing)

2712
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,230
- It's relaxing.
- Right?

2713
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:50,230
Yes.

2714
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,200
My legs feel super heavy.

2715
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,870
(The night before
the contract relationships ended)

2716
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,210
(Bothered)

2717
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:02,340
I hung around a lot.

2718
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,610
I could tell
you were trying to be with him.

2719
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,910
- Is your throat okay?
- What?

2720
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:11,120
(It’s time to make the final move.)

2721
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,990
Hi.

2722
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,260
- Let's have...
- Yes?

2723
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,930
- dinner together today.
- Okay.

2724
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,330
I was looking for you.

2725
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,930
Me?

2726
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:30,570
I'm still considering one person.

2727
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:33,070
Soo Ah is having dinner outside.

2728
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:42,080
Where the tree is?

2729
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:49,820
It made me really happy.

2730
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,260
My head was filled with so many thoughts.

2731
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,460
Isn't it like a postcard
from somewhere far away?

2732
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:02,100
Did you think it'd be me?

2733
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:03,870
This is tough.

2734
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:16,110
The thought
of being able to talk to you...

2735
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:17,650
made me excited.

2736
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:19,480
In a way, it's sad.

2737
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:27,030
Can we talk for a minute?

2738
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,830
It's nothing serious.
