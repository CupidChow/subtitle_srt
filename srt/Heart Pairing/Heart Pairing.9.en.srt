1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,370
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,540
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,740
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,540
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,810
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,950
(The door to Heart Pairing is open.)

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,820
Last week, after
the first contract relationship ended,

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,850
- viewers showed passionate responses.
- Right.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,220
Ji Min and Je Yeon,

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,650
(Couple Number 1, Ji Min and Je Yeon)

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,990
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul,

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,160
(Couple Number 2, Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul)

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,660
Chang Hwan and Chae Eun,

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,790
(Couple Number 3, Chang Hwan and Chae Eun)

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,660
and Woo Jae and Ji Won.
Four couples in total were paired.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,260
Which contract relationship
impressed you the most?

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,730
- I can't forget Ji Min and Je Yeon.
- Right.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,800
We can't forget them.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Ji Min's strength...

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,870
is being honest, I think.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,710
(I think I'll get jealous.)

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,080
(Do you want to be in this relationship
again for 3 days?)

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,780
He expresses his feelings well...

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,610
- without being afraid.
- Exactly.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,610
- He should be in Kim Eun Sook's...
- That's right.

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,550
work, I think.

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,620
- Everything he said was a real gem.
- Right.

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,790
We saw him giving her a hand warmer...

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,960
and taking off his coat for her.

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,590
(I'll do it.)

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,560
- He cut...
- Right.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,700
the eel so that she could eat it.

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
(A man like a character in a drama)

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,300
He cared for her voluntarily.

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,730
- That's right.
- Right.

36
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,570
I think Ji Min,

37
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,470
for men who don't have
much knowledge about dating,

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,140
- is like a textbook.
- A textbook. Right.

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,180
Chan Hyeong and He Neul
confirmed that it was over between them.

40
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,310
Their relationship ended there.

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,950
"Chan Hyeong is someone
who wants to live for other people,"

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,080
"while my occupation
is something I do for myself."

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,890
"Would things work out between us?"

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,420
She asked such a question,
and I loved that.

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,590
I truly realized why they needed
a contract relationship.

46
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,560
Including a weekend, over two days,

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,530
they spent time together...

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,830
and checked out their differences.

49
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,970
Finishing a relationship
in such a healthy manner...

50
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,940
- Right.
- looked very ideal.

51
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,410
Watching Heart Pairing these days,

52
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,850
my views on relationships
and marriage are changing.

53
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,320
These days, I'm going through
profound changes in perspectives.

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,950
I realize that timing does matter.

55
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,720
However, we need to watch until the end.

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,290
- Right.
- Their relationships are not decided yet.

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,990
Right. Things can go crazy from now on.

58
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,160
(They still have many chances left
for a dopamine party.)

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,360
Before the second contract relationship
began,

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
there was a big incident.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,130
For the first time
in the history of "Heart Signal,"

62
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,670
a third catfish appeared.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
The catfish, Lee Sang Yun, appeared.

64
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,540
He made an intense entrance
when he was the youngest.

65
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,280
I read his Pairing Book,

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,840
and nothing was expressed with ambiguity.

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,310
Everything was clear,

68
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,980
it showed a strong ability
to maintain his livelihood...

69
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,650
and a strong desire to get on track fast.

70
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,320
I thought a person like him
could be charming.

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
(A different charm from the other cast)

72
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,220
And Sang Yun is the only man
who chose Je Yeon's Pairing Book.

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,290
That might stir up her heart.

74
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,460
- She might feel, "He saw the real me."
- Right.

75
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,230
Not her looks, right?

76
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,730
Before him, no one chose her Pairing Book.

77
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,040
- Things are getting worse for Ji Min.
- I know.

78
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,070
(What will Ji Min do in such a crisis?)

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,010
While staying there for a month...

80
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,680
If I were to choose
the most surprising moment,

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,910
it would be that day.

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,550
I thought,
"He shouldn't be so good-looking."

83
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,990
I wondered, "How old is he?"

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm 29 years old.

85
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
You look so younger than your age.

86
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,460
Anyway, people can see that he looks good.

87
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,460
I thought he could stir Ji Won's heart.

88
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,430
Because he looked so outstanding.

89
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,070
He made me very tense.

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,870
And...

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,970
(Men got tense.)

92
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,710
The steak...

93
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,640
I can't eat anymore.

94
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,210
He really surprised me.

95
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,520
And I saw Je Yeon's response.

96
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,250
She still looked down.

97
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,720
Although I was sitting
at the farthest seat,

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,490
I could see him clearly.

99
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,860
(Joking)

100
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,790
He just looked like an idol.

101
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,300
He had great looks.

102
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,670
I saw that Woo Jae was very upset.

103
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,340
He really looked like a sculpture.

104
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,140
But why are you using
the international age? It's confusing.

105
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,910
His personality was great for me.

106
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,510
It means he looks good.

107
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,510
Thirty-three years old.

108
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,220
He could go with any category.

109
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,350
Light blue?
Whose Pairing Book is this? I see.

110
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,590
She looked very happy.

111
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,060
I understand, though.

112
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,430
Since my Pairing Book
hasn't been selected,

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
I understand how she felt, but...

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,330
Now that he has joined us,
why don't we make a toast?

115
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,700
I was very sensitive.

116
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,800
(A young and unfamiliar guy)

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,170
The food is served quickly, though.

118
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,410
I didn't imagine we'd have
another member in Korea.

119
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,910
(A bad feeling)

120
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,620
Woo Jae, why are you silent?

121
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,550
I asked why you're silent.

122
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,260
You used to make a lot of funny jokes.

123
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,000
- This is bad.
- I can't look at him as he looks so good.

124
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,530
You look good, Chang Hwan.
Every guy here looks good.

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,470
Don't get intimidated.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,340
I'm not intimidated.

127
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,640
Why are you saying that I'm intimidated?

128
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,080
"I'm not intimidated!"

129
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,680
He usually talks a lot.

130
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,180
This is so funny.

131
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,890
Can you guess what our occupations are?

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
You all look good, though.

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,460
You mean it, right?

134
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,630
I do.

135
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,070
He appeared when we were exhausted.

136
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,230
I guess so.

137
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,240
When the rest of us look haggard.

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,270
Exactly.

139
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,440
(A reasonable doubt)

140
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
That's possible.

141
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,040
When all of us are exhausted...

142
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,640
and when it's late.

143
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,110
They look tired.

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,220
- When we look all haggard...
- After...

145
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,080
You don't look haggard at all.

146
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,690
We usually look better.

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,290
(Yes, that's right.)

148
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,030
This is fun.

149
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,990
Right. He looks better.

150
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
(Agreeing)

151
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,300
What? This is embarrassing.

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,370
(See?)

153
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,540
I think you're always in charge
of a new person.

154
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,010
I'm always next to the new person.

155
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,750
We'll tell you about us.

156
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
- Okay.
- Right.

157
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,550
I work at Samsung Electronics.

158
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,390
I'm in the Strategy Development Team.

159
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,860
I've been working there
for about six years.

160
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,090
You're such an elite.

161
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,290
(Embarrassed)

162
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,690
Shall we move on to the next one here?

163
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm a doctor and CEO of a startup company.

164
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm a painter.

165
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,740
- Really?
- I paint.

166
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,610
- Are you from Gyeongsang Province?
- Yes.

167
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,640
Where?

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm from Busan.

169
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,810
- Many people here are from Busan.
- I'm from Busan too.

170
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,610
- Your hometown is a nice place.
- Of course.

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,350
- Chan Hyeong.
- I fly. I'm a pilot.

172
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,690
- The captain?
- Yes.

173
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,860
You're all amazing.

174
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,790
I'm a lawyer.

175
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,360
(Surprised)

176
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,700
I'm a model and dancer.

177
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,330
I work as a semiconductor engineer
at Samsung Electronics.

178
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,500
- Really?
- Yes.

179
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,770
Have you met her before?

180
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,740
No, we work at different locations.

181
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm a researcher
at an economics institute.

182
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,050
- You didn't get anyone right.
- I got everyone wrong.

183
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,850
- You got everyone wrong.
- Really?

184
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,050
- Since he came late.
- You got it all wrong.

185
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,380
I guess I'm not sharp-sighted.

186
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,350
But Ha Neul here...

187
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,260
works as a model.

188
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,590
Since she knows you,
I'm guessing you're a model.

189
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,860
- Really?
- Yes.

190
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,560
You got it. Yes, I'm a model.

191
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,600
Is he a model?

192
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,300
Model Lee Sang Yun.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,470
He seemed really tall.

194
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,670
(Model Lee Sang Yun)

195
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,440
How long have you been a model?

196
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,910
I started it when I was in college,

197
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,850
so it's been about six years.

198
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I see.

199
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,990
- You've been at it for a while.
- Right.

200
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,360
What kind of modeling do you do?
Do you model in fashion?

201
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,730
If I had to give a ratio,

202
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,860
it'd be seven for fashion...

203
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,870
- and two for weddings.
- I see.

204
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
These days,
I mostly take photos for fashion brands.

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Right.

206
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,610
She's also from Busan.

207
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,780
- Yes, I'm from Busan.
- Really?

208
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,080
- Which school did you graduate?
- Pusan Foreign Language High School.

209
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,820
Sorry?

210
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,450
- The foreign language high school.
- Oh, Pusan Foreign Language High School.

211
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,190
I graduated Busan High School,
so I was startled.

212
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,250
- I see.
- Right.

213
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,390
It's an all-boys school, you see.

214
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,990
- Maybe...
- Is she going to confess?

215
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,260
Do we have 6 men and 3 women here?

216
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,930
Six men and three women?

217
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,340
- I'll pick you, then.
- Sure.

218
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,940
He's interested in her.

219
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,510
Do you do sports?

220
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,210
- Me?
- Yes.

221
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,150
- I love to run.
- I see.

222
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,820
These days, I run and work out at the gym.

223
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,420
You all seem like you work out.

224
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,990
I can tell by how fit you all seem.

225
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,730
He's the real deal.

226
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
- Tell him about your past.
- Exactly.

227
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,600
I played soccer competitively.

228
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,800
- Really? I played baseball.
- In high school?

229
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,900
- In a prestigious school.
- It's famous for its baseball team.

230
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,770
- Which school did you graduate?
- Dongnae High School.

231
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,670
Dongnae High is known for its soccer team.

232
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,940
So you played baseball. Up until when?

233
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,750
- My third year in college.
- I see.

234
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,550
- That's a long time.
- He played for a long time.

235
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,250
He's a former baseball player.

236
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,320
Busan High School is known
for its baseball team.

237
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,920
Look at him!

238
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,020
You were born in 1999.
So when did you start working there?

239
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,230
It's my third year.

240
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,160
Your third year?

241
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,100
- You got a job right out of college.
- Yes.

242
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,840
What's your MBTI?

243
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm an ISFJ.

244
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,810
An ISFJ?

245
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,010
Do you like to exercise?

246
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,080
It's a question.

247
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,390
Yes, I do.

248
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,420
Why is Chae Eun laughing?

249
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,290
(She can't help but laugh.)

250
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,060
I do Pilates and yoga,
and I also lift weights.

251
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,330
Do you do it all?

252
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,000
These days, I do yoga and lift weights.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,430
He is paying close attention
to their conversation.

254
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,470
What do you like to do?

255
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,110
I play golf and lift weights.

256
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,010
Do you play golf? I like playing golf too.

257
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Really?

258
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,080
I've been playing golf
for about six years now.

259
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,350
Six years?

260
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,180
You started out young.

261
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,980
Yes, my parents suggested it.

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,320
(I see.)

263
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,590
They said it would help.

264
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,090
Are you any good?

265
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,660
I guess a little.

266
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,770
(Je Yeon is zoning out.)

267
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,900
(Delighted)

268
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,340
Doesn't he keep looking at Je Yeon?

269
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
Ms. Lawyer, don't you work out?

270
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,980
- I practice Pilates.
- "Ms. Lawyer?"

271
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,790
I used to practice Pilates,

272
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,890
but now, I lift weights.

273
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,460
(Wary)

274
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,060
Who do you see as your ideal woman?

275
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,870
- Me?
- Yes.

276
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,570
If it were your girlfriend...

277
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,280
I was curious about what he looks for
in a woman.

278
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,350
I...

279
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,020
I like someone
with a solid set of values...

280
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,720
who truly loves...

281
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,760
her work.

282
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,360
- That's enough for me.
- Of course.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,730
What about her looks?

284
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,840
Her appearance?

285
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,670
- Someone with pretty eyes.
- Someone with pretty eyes?

286
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,720
I also like someone with a nice smile.

287
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,430
Out of everyone here,

288
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,200
does someone match your ideal type,
based on first impressions?

289
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
(Well...)

290
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,800
That's a good question.

291
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,300
Yes.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,540
It'd be weird to say there isn't someone.

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,440
- "No one."
- "No one impressed me."

294
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,210
"I need to get to know them better."

295
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,110
I wonder who it is.

296
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,120
- Someone grabbed my attention.
- I see.

297
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,120
Aren't you going to tell us who it is?

298
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,190
Do I have to?

299
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,990
Wasn't he asked who he liked
based on first impressions?

300
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,430
- Who comes close to his ideal type.
- Who comes close to his ideal type.

301
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,630
- Among them.
- He asked me point blank.

302
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,100
- I must've been mistaken.
- I see.

303
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,470
- That can happen.
- "That can happen?"

304
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,840
- He's a feisty one.
- Nice!

305
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,070
That's what a catfish should be.

306
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,710
(The lengthy dinner has come to an end.)

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,980
- Was this a room?
- Was this a room?

308
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,810
- Did it always have curtains?
- I had no idea.

309
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,080
- Where?
- It's so nice.

310
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,210
- It was a room all along.
- No way.

311
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,220
I expected it.

312
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,120
- This was a room.
- I had no idea.

313
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,250
(Sang Yun's room on the 1st floor)

314
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,960
- There's another book here.
- I'm curious.

315
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,290
- Here.
- I'd love to read it.

316
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,390
It's dark blue.

317
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,100
(Gosh)

318
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,030
Dark blue? Come to think of it,
no one had that color.

319
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,800
That's a fire.

320
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,240
My dad said...

321
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,410
- something similar.
- Where is it?

322
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,910
You're right.

323
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,280
It can seem like nothing,

324
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,650
but it's something we often forget.

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,220
(Send a text message to the person
who interests you tonight.)

326
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
- Did you send your text?
- Not yet.

327
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,990
I bet he's still on the fence.

328
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,630
He can't send it just yet.

329
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,830
Is he heading
to where the ladies are staying?

330
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,500
Right away?

331
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,570
May I come in?

332
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,940
- Sure.
- Sure.

333
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,380
Je Yeon, what do you have planned
for tomorrow night?

334
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,680
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

335
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,710
Sorry?

336
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,150
I wanted to talk to you
after reading your book.

337
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,550
The light blue one?

338
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,760
- We should grab a meal.
- Sounds good.

339
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,590
- Good night.
- He asked her out on his first day.

340
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,030
- A catfish should be like that.
- I know.

341
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,900
That's Chae Eun.

342
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,770
(One by one, they head off to work.)

343
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,140
(After moving in...)

344
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,540
Lee Sang Yun, the catfish.

345
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,540
(Sang Yun's first morning after moving in)

346
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,580
(Sang Yun got up early.)

347
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,220
(First, he cleans up the kitchen.)

348
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,620
He's cleaning the kitchen.

349
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,860
(He even washes the dishes.)

350
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,390
It's his first morning after moving in,

351
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,960
but he seems relaxed.

352
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,100
(Wiping)

353
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,700
That's a great attitude to have
as the new resident.

354
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,970
- Absolutely.
- Right?

355
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,870
(Organizing the slippers
based on his own system)

356
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,940
I like him.

357
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,240
(While he's at it,
he checks the living room as well.)

358
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,480
The cleaning will begin.

359
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,620
(Whirring)

360
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,150
The cleaning will begin.

361
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,290
(A cleaning fairy moved
into the Pairing House.)

362
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,130
- I read your book last night.
- Really?

363
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,630
It sounded like you.

364
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,270
- Really?
- The other guys...

365
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,970
- This...
- wrote down their answers...

366
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,170
in sentences starting with, "I think."

367
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,870
Meanwhile, you wrote down words...

368
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,140
like "responsibility" and "trust"
as your answer.

369
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,110
That was a reflection of your personality.

370
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,080
I was surprised by how I could tell
by just reading your book.

371
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,380
Yes.

372
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,920
Did you ask Je Yeon out to dinner today?

373
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Yes.

374
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,560
Out of the four of us,

375
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,260
she's the least talkative.

376
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,160
I wonder how they'll engage
in a conversation.

377
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,900
Je Yeon's book...

378
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,600
- Did you read each other's books?
- Yes.

379
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,370
- Did you?
- Yes, briefly.

380
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,500
Did you read each other's books?

381
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,940
I clicked with what she wrote
as her answer.

382
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,740
- Really?
- I see.

383
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,140
You both have a Type T personality.

384
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,310
- Is she a Type T?
- Yes, she's the only Type T among us.

385
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,810
- Really? As expected.
- Yes.

386
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,380
A Type T can tell a Type T, right?

387
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,960
What are you having for dinner today?

388
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,930
- Didn't you decide on it?
- No, not yet.

389
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,960
(Je Yeon and Ji Won talk
in the dressing room.)

390
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,260
- I don't know what we'll have.
- Don't you know where you're going?

391
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,670
I don't even know where we're going.

392
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,670
(Knocking)

393
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,300
It was so late last night,

394
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,800
- so we couldn't decide on anything.
- I bet...

395
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,900
it'll be awkward.

396
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,110
- What?
- I know.

397
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,380
It's Woo Jae.

398
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,840
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

399
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,710
- Are you washing up?
- Yes.

400
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,750
I see.

401
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,420
Once you're done, join me when you can.

402
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,450
Sure.

403
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,250
He came looking for her
while Je Yeon was also in the room.

404
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,990
You scared me. What's up?

405
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,330
What is it?

406
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,130
(Well...)

407
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,330
They want us to come out.

408
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,760
- Who?
- Oh, I meant me.

409
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm...

410
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,100
supposed to have dinner with him later,

411
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,700
so I think he wants to pick
the restaurant.

412
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,140
- Dinner?
- Yes. With Woo Jae.

413
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,540
- Really?
- Yes.

414
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,710
You two must have gotten really close.

415
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,310
I could tell, though.

416
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,550
- Could you?
- Yes.

417
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,620
Je Yeon must have
mixed feelings right now.

418
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,690
(Hi.)

419
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,250
You didn't leave early?

420
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,520
What's your schedule like?

421
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
- Today?
- Yes.

422
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm...

423
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,690
thinking of leaving at noon.

424
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,230
- For work?
- Yes.

425
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,300
I had something to say to you.

426
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,200
- Sure.
- That's why I'm here.

427
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,570
Should we talk at the table?

428
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,370
- Okay. Let's go to the table.
- Okay.

429
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,340
- The weather seems nice.
- Yes.

430
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,780
That spot gets good sunlight.

431
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,810
Yes.

432
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
How do you feel,
now that we have two weeks left?

433
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,750
- How do I feel?
- Yes.

434
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,420
Do you think time went by fast, or...

435
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,890
- It went by pretty fast.
- Really?

436
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,560
I wish we had more time.

437
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,230
Did it feel short?

438
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,370
- Yes, it felt short.
- It did.

439
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,440
She seems to be in a different mood now.

440
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,770
In Italy,

441
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
time flew.

442
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,310
Right.

443
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,710
You know, I was going to...

444
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,680
No, what did you want to say?

445
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,020
- Me?
- Yes, you can go first.

446
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,490
What are you doing tomorrow afternoon?

447
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,220
Tomorrow afternoon...

448
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,090
I don't have anything yet.
But I usually...

449
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,190
go to my studio.

450
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,160
But I can reschedule that.

451
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,630
Do you want to talk...

452
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,330
- Over lunch?
- tomorrow afternoon?

453
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,330
Sure.

454
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,730
- And have lunch.
- Sure.

455
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,200
What time?

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,770
(Tomorrow at lunch,)

457
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,940
(they'll finally face each other again.)

458
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,420
- Hi.
- Did I come out too late?

459
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,080
- No.
- Okay.

460
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,750
- I got ready slowly.
- What?

461
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,950
- I got...
- Good.

462
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,390
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

463
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,560
That's good.

464
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,830
- Did you get up early?
- I...

465
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,760
- I slept in too.
- Did you?

466
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,130
- That's good.
- So...

467
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,570
I was sitting and looking up restaurants.

468
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,100
(Hesitating)

469
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,010
- And Je Yeon...
- Yes?

470
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,740
wanted to talk to me.

471
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,110
- Seriously?
- Yes.

472
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,240
- So, I was here talking to her.
- Okay.

473
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,180
- Tomorrow,
- Yes?

474
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,350
she wants to have lunch with me.

475
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,620
So, we're going.

476
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,450
I realized yesterday...

477
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,090
that Je Yeon was pretty busy.

478
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,330
She has many appointments in the evening.

479
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,160
She asked me
if I'd be free tomorrow lunch,

480
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,130
so...

481
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,240
Yes.

482
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,470
So,
I'm going to talk to her tomorrow lunch.

483
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,740
- Okay.
- Yes.

484
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,250
She's bothered by it.

485
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,230
(Around the time the sky
is colored by the sunset)

486
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,730
Who is Ha Neul meeting?

487
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,900
(Who is she waiting for?)

488
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,040
Who's that?

489
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,710
- Hey.
- It's a guy.

490
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,940
- Were you at work?
- Yes.

491
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,540
- That's her brother?
- Her older brother!

492
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,780
- It's so cold out, isn't it?
- It's freezing.

493
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,110
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

494
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,950
- It's been so long since we last met.
- I know.

495
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,620
They're some good-looking siblings.

496
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,850
- I have a worry.
- Okay.

497
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,420
I feel very comfortable...

498
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,820
around the male participants...

499
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,020
on the show.

500
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,430
And I got the feeling...

501
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,560
that they didn't notice me as a woman.

502
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,300
Why did you create that image
about yourself?

503
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,170
It was too awkward at first,

504
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,800
so my first goal was...

505
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,600
- to be good friends with them.
- Right.

506
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,110
But I guess I did something wrong there.

507
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,040
They don't notice me as a woman.

508
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,180
I feel like I'm just
a comfortable female friend...

509
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,810
to them.

510
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,480
You got off on the wrong foot.

511
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,590
You should start over.

512
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,290
I wish I could.

513
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,760
The other guy I told you about
last time...

514
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,260
makes my heart flutter when I'm with him.

515
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,490
And there's a bit of tension too.

516
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,770
On the last day in Italy,
we went out on a date.

517
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,140
And I told him I'd come to pick him up.

518
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,000
He had an appointment in Suwon,

519
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,510
so I told him I'd pick him up...

520
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,710
on my way home.

521
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,810
But he said that he'd go by himself.

522
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,350
- He refused?
- Yes.

523
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,280
I said it was fine...

524
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,590
as if it were totally okay with me,

525
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,790
but it wasn't.

526
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,220
That could be why I feel distant.

527
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,190
I find it difficult to ask him out too.

528
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,760
Maybe I've gotten timid.

529
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,230
- Right. I could tell from her face.
- Of course, it's not okay.

530
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,830
That would break her brother's heart.

531
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,000
- Right.
- Right.

532
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,470
When you have such negative thoughts...

533
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,170
- Right.
- about a relationship,

534
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,140
it wears you out.

535
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,980
So, you don't have the energy
to be brave or put in the effort.

536
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,480
Try to think as positively as possible.

537
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,620
Even if it means getting hurt,

538
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,720
you might as well give it a try
and get hurt.

539
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Rather than not trying and regretting it.

540
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,060
Okay. I'll talk to him
about picking him up again.

541
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
That's admirable.

542
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,230
When you pick him up, you can naturally...

543
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,500
- have dinner with him on the way back.
- Yes, we could share a meal.

544
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,030
Make it natural.

545
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,800
That means I have to go
all the way to Suwon again.

546
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,340
(After consulting with her brother,)

547
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,570
It's called effort.

548
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,540
(she seems to be in a better mood.)

549
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,910
(Will she be able
to pluck up her courage again?)

550
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,650
- She has a wise brother.
- He's so wise.

551
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,650
He's smart.

552
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,520
That was a much-needed conversation
for Ha Neul at this point.

553
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,600
(The afternoon goes by busily.)

554
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,460
Chae Eun is so charming.

555
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,800
- I bet she's sharp.
- Absolutely.

556
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,770
(She waits for someone after work.)

557
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,770
How gorgeous.

558
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,970
(Her first day in Seoul)

559
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,850
Her uniqueness hasn't shown that much yet.

560
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,920
(Who would you like to go
on a date with right now?)

561
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,250
(She wrote the name of her date.)

562
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,290
Who would it be?

563
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,060
(Smiling)

564
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,370
(The date that she chose was Chan Hyeong.)

565
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,010
Right. I should have opened the door.

566
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,040
- Gosh.
- Many people around me...

567
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,540
- hope that they get married.
- I know, right?

568
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,580
(They already look like a married couple.)

569
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,350
- It's cold, isn't it?
- Hi!

570
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,510
It's freezing out there, right?

571
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,150
- It's pretty cold today.
- Did you wait long?

572
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,890
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you?

573
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,490
Where is it? Where are we going?

574
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,290
I'll tell you.

575
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,190
It's a spicy chicken stew place.

576
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,030
That sounds delicious.

577
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,230
You can look forward to it.

578
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,030
- We're eating what you like.
- This looks awesome.

579
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,400
(Smiling)

580
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
I can't wait.

581
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,740
(They spend time for the first time
after Italy.)

582
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,010
Chae Eun is...

583
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,780
- How...
- She's genuinely happy.

584
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
I don't think she'll sleep
in the car today.

585
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,480
(Laughing)

586
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,520
- This date was...
- Yes?

587
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,720
supposed to happen only a few days...

588
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,020
- after I joined you guys.
- Right.

589
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,820
But...

590
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,560
- you got sick.
- I got sick.

591
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,330
Don't tell me...

592
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,560
you had a change of heart by now.

593
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,470
Like, "I should have chosen someone else."

594
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,440
- No!
- No?

595
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,840
You could have changed your mind.

596
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,370
I think I saw you pretty often...

597
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,940
- with Chang Hwan.
- Right.

598
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,080
- Right?
- Yes.

599
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,450
Most of the time.

600
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,420
Anyone else?

601
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,050
Did you want to get to know anyone else?

602
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,050
(Thinking)

603
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,590
But...

604
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,360
you were the one
that I was most curious about,

605
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,860
so I...

606
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,430
asked you out for dinner.

607
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,200
What was that?

608
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
(Shy)

609
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,370
I'm still curious about you.

610
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,770
Goodness.

611
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,640
Sure. Let's talk about a lot of stuff.

612
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,910
Spicy chicken stew.

613
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,710
A whole chicken stew.

614
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,610
- Should we order?
- Yes.

615
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,110
Let's see what they have.

616
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,950
They must specialize in chickens.

617
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,780
They're all chicken dishes.

618
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I should eat a spicy stew.

619
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
- Really?
- Yes, I'm craving spicy soup.

620
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,990
But I want a mild stew.

621
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,220
I want a spicy stew.

622
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,530
- Then, let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Should we?

623
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,930
And the winner gets to choose.

624
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,960
Okay. I should win.

625
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,430
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

626
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,530
- Okay.
- She lost.

627
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,530
Then,

628
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,240
spicy chicken stew.

629
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,870
- I wanted to try their signature dish.
- Is that right?

630
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,210
I saw people at another table
eat the spicy one.

631
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,980
Are you okay with it?

632
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,820
- You said it was your comfort food, so...
- It is.

633
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,290
(Chae Eun kept in mind
what was said in his Pairing Book.)

634
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,590
Right.

635
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,620
(My comfort food is a whole chicken stew.)

636
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,960
So, I wanted to try this with you.

637
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,760
I'd be honored.

638
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,860
She picked the perfect place.

639
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,900
I'd be honored.

640
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,500
I've only tried it once.

641
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,700
In Anam, there's a famous
whole chicken stew place...

642
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,640
- by the school.
- There is.

643
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,540
I've also gone to that place
in Anam a lot.

644
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,210
- Seriously? That one.
- Yes.

645
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,110
A branch of my company was...

646
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,050
located by the university.

647
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,680
- Are you serious?
- And there's another branch.

648
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,920
- Is there?
- Yes.

649
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,550
They turned it into a laboratory, though.

650
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,550
- I love whole chicken stew,
- Yes.

651
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,490
so I used to go there when I was free.

652
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,990
It must be the same place.

653
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,900
That was my first and last
whole chicken stew.

654
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,330
Today is my second time.

655
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,330
I feel so honored.

656
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,800
It looks very delicious.

657
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,640
(Their first spicy chicken stew together)

658
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,640
(One scoop of the broth)

659
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,380
- I don't want any broth.
- You don't?

660
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,150
I have a hard time eating spicy food.

661
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,980
- Seriously? I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

662
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,290
I can eat the meat and vegetables.

663
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,920
- She can't eat spicy food.
- I'm sorry.

664
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,990
(Flustered)

665
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,090
It's okay.

666
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,560
(Laughing)

667
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,600
- If I had known,
- It's okay.

668
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,000
I wouldn't have played
rock-paper-scissors.

669
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,170
It's okay.

670
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,000
He's so cute.

671
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,470
It doesn't look that spicy.

672
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,070
Should I add some water to the stew?

673
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,070
No.

674
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,670
(Taking a bite)

675
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,780
He's being extremely cautious.

676
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,050
It isn't very spicy.

677
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,450
- Should we order another one?
- No.

678
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,990
- Should we order the clear broth?
- No.

679
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,660
The meat and vegetables
aren't spicy at all.

680
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
- Chan Hyeong is so kind.
- I agree.

681
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,390
How about someone like him
as your son-in-law?

682
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,290
I like Chan Hyeong.
He'd make the best son-in-law.

683
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,430
I'm going to enjoy it very much.

684
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,270
(Eating)

685
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,630
- Seriously,
- Yes?

686
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,570
I kept saying that you seemed innocuous.

687
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,710
(Eating)

688
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,880
It really suits you. You can't eat
chili powder because it's too spicy.

689
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,880
- That's not true.
- You can't eat food that's too salty.

690
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,580
Yes, I can.

691
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,250
Both of them look very excited.

692
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,320
You seem...

693
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,060
very good-natured.

694
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,990
That's what I also look for.

695
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,130
Here's what I always thought.

696
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,230
The working environment
at the hospital is difficult.

697
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,300
It wears me out a lot.

698
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,300
And so...

699
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,840
I wanted to maintain my innocence.

700
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,810
I always thought that to myself.

701
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,550
It seems like it's the same for you.

702
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,520
When I look at you,
you're completely innocuous.

703
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,620
- Chan Hyeong seems way too excited.
- You're like an unpolluted area.

704
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,660
At this point,
it sounds like you're teasing me.

705
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,060
No, I'm being serious.

706
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,960
- It's a compliment.
- Really?

707
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,100
I also consider the look
in a person's eyes important.

708
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,370
Right.

709
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,510
(Chan Hyeong said that the look
in a person's eyes is important.)

710
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,840
(Chae Eun also considers
a person's pupils.)

711
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,180
To be honest,

712
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,320
when you were talking about
what you do for a living,

713
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,620
your eyes were sparkling.

714
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,320
I could tell how much
you enjoy your work...

715
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,630
and how certain you are of it.

716
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,730
I got a glimpse of that.

717
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,930
(Different from the look
in Chan Hyeong's eyes in Italy)

718
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,440
(A strong look of certainty in his eyes)

719
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,500
(She became more curious about him.)

720
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,870
(The moment when
she couldn't take her eyes off of him)

721
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,010
So I wanted to talk to you more.

722
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,510
Now that I think of it,
we didn't get the chance to talk.

723
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,220
After that, you got sick.

724
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,720
- That's right.
- Right.

725
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,920
Then you brought me a humidifier.

726
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,090
To be honest,
I was feeling very sad at that time.

727
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,760
(At an unfamiliar place,)

728
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,690
(Chae Eun was sick all alone.)

729
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,400
(While she was feeling sad,
he reached out his hand toward her.)

730
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,630
The air is too dry here.

731
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,970
(That moment left a strong mark
in Chae Eun's heart.)

732
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,570
(Get some good rest and get well soon!)

733
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,610
I was very moved.

734
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,540
I couldn't ignore someone sick.

735
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,910
I felt terrible for you.

736
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,950
- I got sick as soon as we got back.
- As soon as we got back.

737
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,860
Have a chicken leg.

738
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,660
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

739
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,060
- Isn't it?
- It's very delicious.

740
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,230
- Right?
- Yes.

741
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,970
(He's finally relieved and digs in.)

742
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,130
Both of them are positive.

743
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,040
The chicken isn't very spicy.

744
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm glad to hear that.

745
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,370
- It's so good.
- Right?

746
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,440
Yes.

747
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,410
(Why is Ji Seon laughing?)

748
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,980
Ji Seon,

749
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,550
is Chae Eun concentrating on food
making you laugh?

750
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,450
Normally, she can't eat spicy food.

751
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,690
To keep Chan Hyeong
from feeling uncomfortable,

752
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,920
- she's eating enthusiastically.
- That must be it.

753
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,060
It must be spicy for her.

754
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,930
(Struggling)

755
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,130
(Watching)

756
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,670
It tastes better
when you eat with your hands.

757
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,810
- Should I eat with my hands?
- Yes.

758
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,070
You already washed your hands.

759
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,070
(Foodie Chae Eun is here.)

760
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,340
Let's eat with our hands.

761
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,710
(Eating)

762
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,350
- Isn't it easier to eat with your hands?
- It's much tastier.

763
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,850
Chan Hyeong
suggested eating with her hands...

764
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,850
so that she can eat more comfortably.

765
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,190
Have you read my Pairing Book?

766
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,960
Of course.

767
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,760
I wrote in the book that
one of my comfort foods is chicken soup.

768
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,760
There are also eggs on the list.

769
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,030
(A lot of Chae Eun and Chan Hyeong's
comfort foods overlap.)

770
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,200
She's telling him
what they have in common.

771
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,470
(A lot of Chae Eun and Chan Hyeong's
comfort foods overlap.)

772
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,470
(It's needless to say
that they both like eggs.)

773
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,110
Do you eat sundaeguk?

774
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,640
I love sundaeguk.

775
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,950
- Really?
- Yes.

776
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,680
I know an excellent sundaeguk restaurant.

777
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,280
They sell sundae
made with large intestines.

778
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,350
Sundae made with large intestines?

779
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,820
Their sundae made with large intestines
and sundaeguk are amazing.

780
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,360
I didn't expect you to like it.

781
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,030
- Really?
- I imagined you eating salads...

782
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,200
and desserts.

783
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,870
I have the palate of a middle-aged man.

784
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,840
Why don't we go there for lunch?

785
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,040
- Lunch is good too.
- Let's schedule it.

786
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,880
You'll pass out when you taste their food.

787
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,780
Can you leave your office for lunch?

788
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,350
- You really can?
- Yes.

789
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,850
- Don't you have to be careful about it?
- I can come out.

790
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,560
When they say,
"Chae Eun, come and join us for lunch,"

791
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,090
do you have to say,
"I have an appointment?"

792
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,830
This is what I'll say.

793
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,330
"I can't because I have an appointment
with Lee Chan Hyeong."

794
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,030
(Laughing)

795
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,270
(Does that mean she'll be frank about it?)

796
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,740
What is this?

797
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,600
Chan Hyeong looked so happy right now.

798
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,770
You should tell them that.

799
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,080
They'd go, "What's wrong with her?"

800
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,580
"She's being weird."

801
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,580
Chan Hyeong looks so joyful
around Chae Eun.

802
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,350
You don't drink
when you work the next day, do you?

803
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,760
I don't, but I can drink tonight.

804
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,330
- Really? Shall we have a little?
- Okay.

805
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,830
- Today is a special day.
- Right.

806
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,030
What would you like? I'm okay with soju.

807
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,830
Soju sounds good.

808
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,170
Soju sounds good.

809
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,540
After drinking soju,

810
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,470
I should ask you everything
I wanted to know.

811
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,710
- He has a huge smile on his face.
- He can't keep his eyes off of her.

812
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,510
I can't believe
that we get to drink together.

813
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,190
- The way he drinks looks delicious.
- He's a man.

814
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,420
(Exclaiming)

815
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,550
It's very...

816
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,890
We're in trouble.

817
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,630
We're in trouble.

818
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,500
Chan Hyeong came out tonight
while feeling 50 percent sure about her,

819
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,200
- but he opened up to her.
- Exactly.

820
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,930
You have to meet someone
you hit it off with.

821
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,400
I totally agree.

822
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,270
Something about you...

823
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,810
- I'll drink a little more.
- Okay.

824
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,390
To be honest,

825
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,020
I was wondering...

826
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,890
if it was impolite...

827
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,530
to ask you out at this point.

828
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,670
- I was wondering about that.
- That's not impolite.

829
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,640
She doesn't know what's going on
between him and Ha Neul.

830
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,170
To be honest,

831
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,440
I thought that you made up your mind.

832
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
- Me?
- Yes.

833
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,850
I see.

834
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,820
I wasn't sure if I could...

835
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,990
still ask you out like this.

836
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,090
(Thinking)

837
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,090
She knows everything.

838
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,130
First of all...

839
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,000
Yesterday,

840
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,470
I got zero votes.

841
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,440
I got zero texts.

842
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,580
- Texts?
- Yes.

843
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,150
- You got zero?
- Yes.

844
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,650
- You got zero?
- Yes.

845
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,580
- Chae Eun looks shocked.
- That's not true.

846
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,650
Yes, I got zero texts yesterday.

847
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,890
- Yesterday?
- Yes. Yesterday.

848
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,860
(Embarrassed)

849
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,560
But I sent one to you.

850
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,800
Chae Eun sent it to Ji Min.

851
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,870
Yesterday?

852
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,230
Yes.

853
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,500
Is it Chae Eun's misunderstanding?

854
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,640
I think Chae Eun sent it
to the wrong person.

855
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,010
But I didn't receive anything.

856
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,350
- Both of them are frozen.
- Right.

857
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,750
(Confused)

858
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,120
I sent one to you.

859
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,920
Seriously, I got zero votes.

860
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,930
Did my message not get delivered?

861
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,360
Did you really send it?

862
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,030
I received no text yesterday.

863
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,670
I sent mine to you.

864
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,170
I even sent a photo that we took together.

865
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,270
(Last night)

866
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,240
(After working hard to pick
a photo of gelato)

867
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,480
(I'm craving some gelato.)

868
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,580
(She sent it to someone else by mistake.)

869
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,220
- Do you know my name?
- Lee Chan Hyeong.

870
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,450
(Shocked)

871
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,290
Then who did I send the photo
we took together to?

872
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,620
You weren't around,
so I checked my texts alone.

873
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,860
Were you lonely?

874
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,360
Yes.

875
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,030
Does one of our girls like gelato?

876
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,730
(My gosh, Ji Min.)

877
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,370
- No way.
- This is hilarious.

878
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,270
She's only half-smart. Oh, dear.

879
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,980
Doesn't everyone like gelato?

880
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,250
(Who are you?)

881
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,450
"Who are you?"

882
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,750
(Feeling wronged)

883
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,120
Whoever got that photo would've wondered,
"What's with this gelato?"

884
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,390
He would've thought that.

885
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,030
He would've smiled,
even though he didn't know what it meant.

886
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,360
(Scratching)

887
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,300
This is insane.

888
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
(Beaming)

889
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,670
I'm glad you told me
no one sent you a text.

890
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,870
Tell me about it.

891
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,740
Having drinks was the best choice.

892
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,610
Otherwise, I might not have told you...

893
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,180
that I didn't get any texts.

894
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,650
There's something I wanted to ask you.

895
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,950
Okay.

896
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,060
If you already had...

897
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,730
something serious with someone else,

898
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,830
our dinner date would've been meaningless
to you.

899
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,830
(I see...)

900
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,900
That weighed on my mind.

901
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,900
- You weren't sure about this dinner?
- That's right.

902
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,740
(The day they returned to Seoul,)

903
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,110
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul were paired
through their books.)

904
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,110
(Staring)

905
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,340
- It's nice.
- I got a gift.

906
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,380
- What's this?
- Open it.

907
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,650
What is this?

908
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,120
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul seemed to be
enjoying their time as a couple.)

909
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,250
(Chae Eun thought
things were getting serious between them.)

910
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,720
She laughed,
but there was bitterness in it.

911
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,260
- Here's how it was for me.
- Okay.

912
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,600
You chose the yellow book, right?

913
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,500
Yes, but I thought it was yours.

914
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,440
That was Chang Hwan's book.

915
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,770
You were dating Chang Hwan at the time,

916
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,240
- so I thought...
- Of course.

917
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,970
You seemed to get along as well.

918
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,980
I see.

919
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,880
(Chae Eun chose the yellow book.)

920
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,010
(He thought she had feelings
for Chang Hwan.)

921
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,620
I briefly fell asleep in the car.

922
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,050
That made me smile in a good way.

923
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,290
- Was it adorable?
- Yes.

924
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,390
I felt like we were a real couple.

925
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,160
Yes, like a long-term relationship.

926
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,190
- Right.
- Of course.

927
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,460
- When you got in the car earlier,
- Yes?

928
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,170
I asked if you'd choose differently
if you got to choose now.

929
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:35,270
(Chan Hyeong was sure that
she was no longer interested in him.)

930
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,940
- Did you mean that?
- Yes.

931
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,510
Because of that, I was self-conscious.

932
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,580
I believe it's better...

933
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,180
that we got to talk sometime later.

934
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,750
- Because...
- Of course.

935
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,250
some time has passed.

936
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,120
I believe...

937
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,430
we somewhat know what our hearts want now.

938
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,900
With that in mind,
I can finally see where you stand.

939
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,730
That's why I thought...

940
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,740
this was a better time to go on the date.

941
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,870
Chae Eun's been waiting
to tell him how she feels.

942
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,580
I'm glad we got together today.

943
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,080
I'm really glad.

944
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Right.

945
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,410
Besides,
we should get to know each other better.

946
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,420
I doubt you know everything about me.

947
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,120
I don't.

948
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,420
- You probably don't.
- I don't.

949
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,890
Anyway...

950
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,930
- The same goes for me with you.
- Sure.

951
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,560
(Had it not been for this date,
they wouldn't have cleared the air.)

952
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,830
- They make a nice couple.
- Right.

953
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,830
They're compatible.

954
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,770
It's good we went on this date.

955
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,910
I see them as a healthy couple.

956
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,910
Right.

957
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,410
I have a feeling they'll share a vision.

958
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,180
(A bar in Jongno, Seoul)

959
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,280
- It's beautiful.
- No way.

960
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,350
It's stunning.

961
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,150
This is great.

962
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,590
Chae Eun looks excited.

963
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,920
Should we order?

964
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,290
- Maybe we should.
- Well...

965
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,360
How tipsy are you right now?

966
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,230
- I'm lightly buzzed, but it feels good.
- Here you go.

967
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,070
Thank you.

968
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,370
How about this, then?

969
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,510
Have you thought about...

970
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,210
when you want to get married?

971
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,240
Actually, I...

972
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,250
- What?
- They're talking about marriage.

973
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,380
Before,
I wanted to get married before I hit 30.

974
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,890
I see.

975
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,750
Before I turned 30.

976
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,520
You said, "Before."
Does that mean you've changed your mind?

977
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,890
Well, I'm almost 30 now, so...

978
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,430
I see.

979
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,930
What about you? Is marriage on your mind?

980
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,500
As of now, yes.

981
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,770
I'm at that age,

982
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,340
and time is precious.

983
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,180
I want to quickly move on
if things aren't meant to be.

984
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,810
Marriage?

985
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,050
I don't think I date people now
just to be in a relationship.

986
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,920
Chae Eun's listening to him seriously.

987
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,220
I don't think I can.

988
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,290
I can only date someone
if marriage is an option for us.

989
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,530
- Really?
- I see.

990
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,530
I'll think about that more
while dating her, but...

991
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,770
I was able to acknowledge
his realistic thoughts on marriage...

992
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,040
and recognize how seriously
he's taking this.

993
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,110
That's right.

994
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,340
I think we share the same view
when it comes to dating.

995
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,210
- Really?
- Chan Hyeong and me.

996
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,150
You'll only date someone
if marriage is on the table.

997
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,580
I'm only able to date someone
whom I can see...

998
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,420
- having a future with.
- Only then will you date her.

999
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,920
Do you remember how they both froze...

1000
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,290
when they heard about
the mix-up with the text?

1001
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,690
"I sent it. I texted you."

1002
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,360
"But I didn't receive any texts."

1003
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,960
Don't you think they should go back...

1004
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,070
and try to figure out
who got the gelato photo?

1005
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,500
- "Who got the photo?"
- Shouldn't they?

1006
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,140
"That was meant for me, not you."

1007
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,870
Chan Hyeong should go to Ji Min.

1008
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,210
Ji Min's reaction was hilarious.

1009
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,150
- "Does one of our girls..."
- "One of our girls" was hilarious.

1010
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,480
"Does one of our girls like gelato?"

1011
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,020
That was funny.

1012
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,650
If that text and photo
had gone to the right person,

1013
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,890
Chan Hyeong could've come prepared.

1014
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,620
- That's right.
- He wouldn't have been on the fence.

1015
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,790
When we finally learned that
the gelato photo was meant for him,

1016
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,560
- he began thinking.
- That's right.

1017
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,400
Isn't it more thrilling...

1018
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,300
- to unexpectedly find out the truth?
- Absolutely.

1019
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,870
- He had no idea,
- That's right.

1020
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,370
- but suddenly felt a rush of emotions.
- Exactly.

1021
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,210
That moment of silence
had an impact of a tidal wave.

1022
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,540
- They're meant to be.
- Exactly.

1023
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,110
- I know.
- This isn't like...

1024
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,180
hard-earned money.

1025
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,480
It's like winning the lottery.

1026
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,680
- That's how it feels.
- But the money...

1027
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,550
- was already his.
- It's way more enjoyable.

1028
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,480
Winning the lottery is more thrilling...

1029
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,150
- than money that was earned over years.
- That's...

1030
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,390
- That's more thrilling.
- Absolutely.

1031
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,660
Dopamine levels will skyrocket.

1032
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,070
(Brushing)

1033
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,000
I wonder how Sang Yun dresses.

1034
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,070
She looks pretty.

1035
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,670
(Checking how she looks)

1036
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,320
Je Yeon caught my attention the most.

1037
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,450
She had porcelain skin...

1038
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,320
and looked so kind.

1039
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,990
She seemed like a kind person
with porcelain skin.

1040
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,660
But with a touch of elegance.

1041
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,930
She had to run a business...

1042
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,630
or have a specialized job.

1043
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,770
I think you run your own business.

1044
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,510
Don't you think...

1045
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,040
You're boldly speaking your mind.

1046
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,740
I can't really tell.

1047
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,580
- I guess that's how it is.
- Sure.

1048
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,180
(Before going out on his date,)

1049
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,620
(he carefully rereads
Je Yeon's Pairing Book.)

1050
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,460
(She checks to see
if she has his Pairing Book.)

1051
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,660
(Sang Yun also takes
Je Yeon's Pairing Book.)

1052
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,800
- He's taking the Pairing Book.
- He's taking the book.

1053
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,130
- Goodness.
- Shall we?

1054
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,100
He's younger than her.

1055
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,370
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon
begin their first date.)

1056
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,210
- Aren't you tired?
- I'm good.

1057
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,610
I'm not tired.

1058
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,020
I bet it wasn't easy yesterday.

1059
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,620
It was your first day.

1060
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,990
It's all right. I have good stamina.

1061
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,960
Of course.
You played sports for a long time.

1062
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,630
You played baseball, right?

1063
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,060
That's right.

1064
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,300
When you played baseball,
what was your position on the team?

1065
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,640
- What position did you play?
- I was a pitcher.

1066
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,740
- A pitcher?
- Yes.

1067
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,140
(Sang Yun was a pitcher
during his competitive days.)

1068
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,470
Does he throw with his left hand?

1069
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,940
- That was incredible.
- Nice!

1070
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:50,950
That's so cool.

1071
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,590
Didn't you say you've been modeling
for about six years?

1072
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,260
How did you get into this line of work?

1073
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,900
Should I try to sound impressive...

1074
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,230
or just say it like it is?

1075
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,100
Are they two very different stories?

1076
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,140
Not really.

1077
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,900
I'd like the truth.

1078
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,870
- I graduated from this university.
- Right.

1079
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,340
The school is known
for its theater department.

1080
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,210
A friend told me
I could be good at modeling.

1081
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,950
But I didn't have any connections...

1082
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,450
and didn't know what I needed to do,

1083
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,050
so I looked for jobs online.

1084
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,090
I see.

1085
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,760
I was able to land a gig.

1086
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,990
(I see.)

1087
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,330
That's how I got started.

1088
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,090
(I see.)

1089
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,460
I was only going to model...

1090
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,700
so that I could earn enough money
for graduate school,

1091
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,370
- but things panned out for me.
- I see.

1092
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,740
I didn't know I'd still be doing this.

1093
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,440
That was honest of him.

1094
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,850
Did you study law in college?

1095
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,080
No, I majored in public administration.

1096
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
- Public administration?
- Yes.

1097
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,990
- You then got into law school.
- That's right.

1098
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,050
It seems like he knows the field.

1099
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,820
- He brought up law school instantly.
- I know.

1100
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,730
So, being a lawyer wasn't
your childhood dream?

1101
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,560
Me? But...

1102
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,130
I wanted to be a lawyer
since middle school.

1103
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,440
They got rid of the Department of Law
and changed it into a law school, and...

1104
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,840
- Right.
- Yes.

1105
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,080
How long has it been
since you got your job?

1106
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,540
- I...
- At the office.

1107
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,280
I had been in a law firm
for a little over three years,

1108
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,480
then I was an in-house lawyer for a while.

1109
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,720
- An in-house lawyer?
- Yes.

1110
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,490
I recently quit.

1111
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,660
So, I'm preparing to set up my own office.

1112
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,030
What's your specialty?

1113
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,960
Corporate law...

1114
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,130
and real estate.

1115
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,370
- Their chat seems to flow smoothly.
- Totally.

1116
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,040
You must be really competent.

1117
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,570
(Shy)

1118
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,970
So, you graduated right away.

1119
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,210
I did.

1120
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,980
It sounds like you know this line of work.

1121
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,790
Take a right turn.

1122
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,460
I didn't see this coming at all.

1123
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,920
I was so surprised.

1124
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,090
- Were you?
- Yes.

1125
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,490
Why is that?

1126
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,030
(Laughing)

1127
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,730
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1128
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,930
- I was reading your book at first.
- Okay.

1129
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,970
I was like,

1130
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,910
"Wait.
This is incredibly similar to my book."

1131
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,010
I bet a lot of guys chose your book.

1132
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,580
Nobody chose me.

1133
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,720
Are you serious?

1134
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,780
So, I was exhilarated yesterday.

1135
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,920
You were the first guy
to choose me for my book.

1136
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,460
She was exhilarated!

1137
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,020
- Who is it?
- Me.

1138
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,390
- I see.
- She looks so happy.

1139
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,130
She's been chosen for her book.

1140
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,460
I thought we'd be so compatible.

1141
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,860
- Did you?
- Yes.

1142
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,730
- Your values resonated with me.
- This is my first time.

1143
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,440
"Your values resonated with me"
sounds so nice.

1144
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,240
(A man who appreciates my values
has finally appeared.)

1145
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,970
I was so certain at first.

1146
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,310
- Really?
- Yes.

1147
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,510
Your book was my favorite...

1148
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,850
in general.

1149
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,480
First off,

1150
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,120
her words were clear,

1151
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,190
concise, and precise.

1152
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,700
She seemed to be using
similar sentences to mine.

1153
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,900
But her words were neater.

1154
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,340
We really were similar.

1155
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,000
"Similar."

1156
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,440
So,

1157
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,610
it surprised me.

1158
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,840
And your words seemed concise.

1159
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,150
Yes, they were concise.

1160
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,780
I noticed that you and I
wrote similar things.

1161
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,780
That's what I felt.

1162
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,920
Yes.

1163
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,690
(Je Yeon's Pairing Book
and Sang Yun's Pairing Book)

1164
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,560
That's so important in a relationship.

1165
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,830
They're very similar.

1166
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,530
The strongest similarity comes...

1167
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,100
from the similarity of values.

1168
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,070
It works as a meaningful sign of fondness.

1169
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,140
(The strongest sign of fondness)

1170
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,140
I'd write the same thing
if they asked me to write it again.

1171
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,340
So would I! I said the same thing.

1172
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,640
- Did you?
- Yes.

1173
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,840
- I said I'd write the same answers.
- It's who I am.

1174
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,610
- They're compatible.
- That's true.

1175
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,350
(They see more similarities
as they get to know each other.)

1176
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,590
Would you like some candy?

1177
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,720
- What kind of candy?
- Do you want one?

1178
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,920
Sure.

1179
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,060
It's pretty strong, though.

1180
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,430
It might sting your nose.

1181
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1182
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,340
(The candy hits stronger
than he expected.)

1183
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,810
- It's strong!
- That's cute.

1184
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,250
(Shutting his eyes)

1185
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,980
It makes you shed tears.

1186
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,920
My throat hurts,

1187
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,390
so I need some mint.

1188
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,860
- Your throat hurts? Why?
- Yes.

1189
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,160
My throat keeps feeling strained.

1190
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,960
It's cold, isn't it?

1191
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,290
A little bit.

1192
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,360
He's sweet.

1193
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,960
- I'll set the AC to floor mode.
- Sure.

1194
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,510
Ji Min is at risk.

1195
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,010
Who did you go on dates with
while you were here?

1196
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,750
I went on dates with...

1197
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,420
Woo Jae and Ji Min.

1198
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,750
- Ji Min?
- Yes.

1199
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,730
We're actually going to
an Italian restaurant.

1200
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,860
Really?

1201
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,500
(Ttukseom Station)

1202
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,840
Do you drive?

1203
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,170
I got my driver's license
a bit later than others.

1204
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,470
I got it only a month ago.

1205
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,510
- Because you recently had the time?
- That's right.

1206
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,710
I was too busy before that.

1207
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,350
I didn't have the time to drive.

1208
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,580
- But when you have your own practice,
- Yes?

1209
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,720
- you need a car.
- I'd need a car.

1210
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,920
Where are you looking to open your office?

1211
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,220
I thought it should be near
the Supreme Court, so...

1212
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,520
- In Seocho?
- Yes.

1213
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,860
What kind of car do you want to drive?

1214
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,600
Your answer was, "Up to 200,000 dollars."

1215
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,800
Did he ask the same question?

1216
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,300
- He asked the same question.
- Right.

1217
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,440
That's just a wish.

1218
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,610
- You know, it's a dream car.
- What's your dream car?

1219
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,670
It's...

1220
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,610
(Je Yeon's dream car)

1221
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,840
That doesn't cost 200,000 dollars.

1222
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,310
- But if I went for the top trim,
- Oh, the top trim.

1223
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,950
I thought it might cost that much.

1224
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,380
So, I wrote my wish.

1225
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,850
You could definitely buy it.

1226
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,120
That's nice.

1227
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,620
I feel like this is going to
make some changes.

1228
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,930
I know, right? He's a strong contestant.

1229
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,960
I was thinking,

1230
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,800
"I don't think he stands a chance
against Ji Min, though."

1231
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,830
But he's getting there.

1232
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,370
(Is he getting to her heart?)

1233
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,670
What are you doing tomorrow? Work?

1234
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,840
Yes, I leave for work
around 7:30 or 8 a.m.

1235
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,510
You leave early, don't you?

1236
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,410
(Guiding her)

1237
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,610
In the peak season,

1238
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,350
the most times I got changed was...

1239
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,790
- a hundred times a day. Yes.
- A hundred times?

1240
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,090
- In a day?
- Yes.

1241
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,390
That's admirable.

1242
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,260
- They make a pretty cute couple.
- Yes.

1243
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,600
You said you wanted to live in Jamsil.

1244
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,500
- That's right.
- They're even talking about that.

1245
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,700
I want to live near Seoul Forest
or Seongsu.

1246
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,300
- Seongsu?
- Seoul Forest.

1247
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,870
(Exclaiming)

1248
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,870
Seoul Forest seemed really nice.

1249
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,580
I also like Seoul Forest.

1250
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,940
- Jamsil or Seoul Forest sounds nice.
- Totally.

1251
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,650
- They look cute together.
- They do.

1252
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,220
- He thoroughly read her Pairing Book.
- Yes.

1253
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,590
They're mostly talking
about realistic stuff.

1254
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,860
Hello.

1255
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,640
It finally feels...

1256
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,250
like I'm on my first date.

1257
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,950
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my.

1258
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,380
It's a really nice interior design
behind you.

1259
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,550
- Right?
- Yes.

1260
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,420
(The restaurant he picked for Je Yeon)

1261
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,760
It makes you feel like
you're invited to a home.

1262
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,090
- I thought it'd feel more comfortable.
- It does.

1263
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,030
- The chef there...
- Yes?

1264
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,070
- wasn't a chef at first.
- Okay.

1265
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,540
She was an office worker.

1266
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,970
She often invited people to her house
and served them course meals.

1267
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,710
She gained popularity by word of mouth,

1268
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,910
so she opened a restaurant.

1269
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,250
(Amazed)

1270
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
Are you a regular there?

1271
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,620
Do you know the chef personally?

1272
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,020
- I looked it up.
- Oh, I see.

1273
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,160
That's so cute.

1274
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,090
When it first opened,

1275
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,630
I heard the story,

1276
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,990
wanted to check it out,

1277
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,800
and went there for the first time.

1278
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,000
I think I go there at least once a year.

1279
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,170
(Amazed)

1280
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,470
I really like delicious food.

1281
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,440
I remember you wrote a lot of foods
as your comfort food.

1282
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,840
I actually had to narrow them down.

1283
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,510
(Apples, eggs, burgers, pizza,
meat, sushi, and fried chicken)

1284
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,280
I actually wanted to add an explanation
to every food.

1285
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,450
Like, "This when I feel like this,
and that when I feel like that."

1286
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,350
They're so compatible.

1287
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,320
The Pairing Book is very important.

1288
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,920
(They even have similar tastes in food.)

1289
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,830
I wonder how this will go.

1290
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,600
What type of wine do you prefer?

1291
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,040
White wine.

1292
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,710
Do you prefer Sauvignon blanc
or Chardonnay?

1293
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,840
(He asks pretty detailed questions.)

1294
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,740
(Thinking)

1295
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,180
I don't really know.

1296
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,580
I don't know that much either.

1297
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,380
I'll just order one on my own.

1298
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,320
Sure.

1299
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,190
I like how it's going.

1300
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,650
It looks like he knows his wine.

1301
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,620
Can you recommend a white wine...

1302
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,530
with a touch of oak?

1303
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,200
See? He knows his wine.

1304
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,730
But he said, "I don't know either."

1305
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,500
He's such a nice guy.

1306
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,570
(Bursting into laughter)

1307
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,030
It looks like you're in love with him.

1308
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,240
(Fascinated)

1309
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,040
It's not easy for a guy
who knows the stuff...

1310
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,310
- to be like that.
- He's being considerate.

1311
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,940
I like the new catfish.

1312
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,310
Can you recommend a white wine
with a touch of oak?

1313
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,850
This is Chardonnay,

1314
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,650
and it will go well with these.

1315
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,180
Sure. We'll have that.

1316
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,480
- Two glasses?
- Yes.

1317
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:36,490
The food here can be greasy,

1318
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,590
so I think a dry one will be nice.

1319
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,670
It's good.

1320
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,980
(It's right up her alley.)

1321
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,610
Do you like oysters?

1322
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,680
Yes.

1323
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,150
We sprinkled a gin
called Monkey 47 on top.

1324
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,380
- That looks delicious.
- Thank you.

1325
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,720
- It looks tasty.
- Thank you.

1326
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
(Interested)

1327
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,690
The oyster is really delicious.

1328
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,130
Is it?

1329
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,500
It's good.

1330
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,470
Why did I hear her say,
"You look amazing?"

1331
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,570
I'm glad.

1332
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,110
It's really good.

1333
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,040
- This is quite nice.
- I like it.

1334
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,820
When guessing my occupation,
why did you say...

1335
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,050
that I looked like someone
who runs a business?

1336
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,590
There was something...

1337
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,490
professional about you.

1338
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,620
- Even though I was just sitting down?
- Yes.

1339
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,560
It was something about your aura.

1340
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,130
You seemed elegant,

1341
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,770
- so I thought that you were a CEO.
- A CEO?

1342
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,570
- You'll be a CEO soon.
- That's true.

1343
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,480
You must be very nervous
about starting your practice.

1344
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,250
Yes, I feel very nervous.

1345
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,720
I would have to take on
a lot of responsibility.

1346
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,730
You must be sure about yourself
to a degree.

1347
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,030
Isn't that why you're starting?

1348
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,730
I don't know if I'm sure about myself.

1349
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
It's more like a challenge.

1350
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,040
A challenge?

1351
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,070
Confidence out of nowhere?
Do you know what I mean?

1352
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,840
That's the most important in business.

1353
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Really?

1354
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,010
Things don't go the way you planned.

1355
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,750
That's why.

1356
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,490
- Their conversation is going smoothly.
- Right.

1357
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,560
He seems very witty.

1358
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,460
Although he's younger than her,
he's leading the conversation.

1359
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,360
He's at ease, which is what Je Yeon likes.

1360
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,100
He has that quality too.

1361
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,230
She seems comfortable around him.

1362
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,740
- Their conversation...
- They're compatible.

1363
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,940
continues.

1364
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,300
It keeps flowing.

1365
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,840
- They're not just having fun.
- Right.

1366
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,180
(The sky got darker.)

1367
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:14,150
(At 7:10 p.m., Ji Min gets off work.)

1368
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,120
- He got home early tonight.
- I know.

1369
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:24,190
(He starts freshening up
as soon as he returns home.)

1370
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,660
(He goes directly to the 2nd floor
with a big smile.)

1371
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,670
(Looking around)

1372
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,340
No one is here.

1373
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,210
Is anyone home?

1374
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,910
He came back home early to see Je Yeon.

1375
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,080
There's really no one.

1376
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,550
Is he not aware that she's on a date?

1377
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,450
That's possible.

1378
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,850
Ji Min.

1379
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,050
- Hello.
- Chang Hwan got off work early.

1380
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,820
You're back. Aren't you tired?

1381
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,990
- Is anyone upstairs?
- No.

1382
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,590
We're alone at home.

1383
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,260
Do you want to order jjajangmyeon?

1384
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,060
Tonight? Not tonight.

1385
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,730
- I have a lot on my mind.
- Really?

1386
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,130
- Chang Hwan does?
- Of course, he does.

1387
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,270
- It's not simply a relationship.
- It's marriage.

1388
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:10,470
It's a serious relationship
with your future partner.

1389
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,040
In my opinion,
he's the extreme opposite of me.

1390
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,710
- You mean, Sang Yun?
- Yes.

1391
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,640
Our age difference is over ten years.

1392
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,050
I'm a salaried worker,

1393
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,480
which is stable.

1394
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,820
Although he's not financially stable,

1395
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,590
he's working hard for his future,
and he has a young spirit.

1396
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,490
Even I think that we're clearly different.

1397
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,630
Is that what's weighing you down?

1398
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,430
- He seems very concerned.
- I agree.

1399
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:35,430
I understand.

1400
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:39,000
I understand what you mean,

1401
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,600
but it wouldn't ruin your motive...

1402
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,970
for being here.

1403
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,740
You should continue being yourself.

1404
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,580
It could be a test.

1405
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,440
Imagine yourself being married.

1406
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,850
When your partner sees
a young, handsome man,

1407
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,680
you might be curious about her reaction.

1408
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,880
That's another way to think about it.

1409
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,150
These don't match, do they?

1410
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,220
They match.

1411
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,020
I can't believe that everyone is out.

1412
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,330
I won't come home early anymore.
You just wait and see.

1413
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,830
I was planning to make
spaghetti aglio e olio.

1414
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,830
- That's good too.
- Aglio e olio instead of jjajangmyeon.

1415
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,400
No one is back when it's 8 p.m.?

1416
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,400
(The two of them get cozy
and prepare dinner.)

1417
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,600
Unbelievable. Shall we grill some duck?

1418
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,640
Let's eat everything in the fridge.

1419
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,040
Why don't we cook while having some beer?

1420
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,250
- That sounds good. Shall we start?
- Right.

1421
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,380
- I'm in a bad mood right now.
- Let's open it now.

1422
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,820
- Well done.
- You too.

1423
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,950
Everyone is... Gosh.

1424
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,220
They're building a friendship.
That's nice.

1425
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,390
What's the point of coming home early
because I miss them?

1426
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,330
- They won't be here anyway.
- Exactly.

1427
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,860
- This is disappointing.
- They look so close.

1428
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,630
Did you have a lot on your mind at work?

1429
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,470
On my way back here on the bus,

1430
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,840
the more I thought,

1431
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,340
the worse I felt.

1432
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,070
We got such a powerful competitor.

1433
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,540
He's so handsome.

1434
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,510
I shouldn't have, but I looked him up.

1435
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,250
He isn't so photogenic.
He looks better in real life.

1436
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,580
I agree.

1437
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,620
He should look better in photos.

1438
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,990
(Complimenting his rival's looks)

1439
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,390
The amount...

1440
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,890
- It's like jjajangmyeon in a pot.
- I like it.

1441
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,130
I doubled the size.

1442
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,300
I love it.

1443
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,060
I wanted to make braised spicy chicken
for Je Yeon,

1444
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,600
- but she's eating out instead.
- What braised spicy chicken?

1445
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,370
This is great. Let's drink.

1446
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,600
Well done.

1447
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,540
They're compatible.

1448
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,240
(Chang Hwan and Ji Min should be paired?)

1449
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,740
(Humming)

1450
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,750
- This is the authentic taste.
- Right?

1451
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,390
I knew that there could be more catfish.

1452
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,120
- Really?
- However,

1453
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,820
I didn't expect it to be yesterday.

1454
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,960
- Seriously.
- I was very surprised.

1455
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,460
Momentarily,

1456
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,500
I thought that he was just a customer.

1457
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,330
You know what?

1458
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
Neither of us is...

1459
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,870
less charming than him...

1460
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,270
in front of the girls.

1461
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,680
Both of us are wearing a cap.

1462
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,710
We're also wearing the same color.

1463
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,620
I should take a photo of us.

1464
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,420
They look good together.

1465
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,720
- Chang Hwan and Ji Min are a couple.
- I support Chang Hwan and Ji Min.

1466
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,820
(Meanwhile, Ha Neul returns home
after seeing her older brother.)

1467
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:16,860
She's finally home.

1468
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,160
It's Ha Neul.

1469
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,700
Hello.

1470
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,900
The lost three are together.

1471
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,200
Are you the only ones home?

1472
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,270
We cooked for ourselves.

1473
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,810
- Really?
- This is our third can of beer.

1474
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:34,180
- We're pathetic brothers.
- Then let me join you.

1475
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:36,010
- "Pathetic brothers."
- I'm glad that you're here.

1476
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,080
(The pathetic brothers have a sister now.)

1477
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,750
We weren't the only ones
who got abandoned.

1478
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,380
Chae Eun must be on a date with him.

1479
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,550
I want to go to karaoke.

1480
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,620
- I also like coin karaoke.
<i>- I want to go to karaoke</i>

1481
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,830
Even the camera angle looks sad.

1482
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,600
(The pathetic brothers' duet
echoes at night.)

1483
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Here's some octopus for you.

1484
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,670
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

1485
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,880
What were we talking about?

1486
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,110
I forgot.

1487
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,680
Why did you want to practice law...

1488
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,180
since you were in middle school?

1489
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,490
Me?

1490
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,920
I always...

1491
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,890
liked writing.

1492
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,160
Being a lawyer looked cool.

1493
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,470
- Since you were in middle school?
- That's right.

1494
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,700
As a lawyer,

1495
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,310
you get to represent someone
who's been wronged.

1496
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,270
That seemed cool.

1497
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,140
- It should be cool.
- It should be cool.

1498
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,790
Aren't you still working in that field
because you think it's cool?

1499
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:51,850
Your current job.

1500
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,790
It's amazing.
This is what I like about it.

1501
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,930
Now, I'm at the age...

1502
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,660
- when I look my best.
- Right.

1503
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,070
It's good to leave photos...

1504
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,070
of myself when I look my best.

1505
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,410
My final goal is to run a business.

1506
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,980
It's good for saving funds
to start a business.

1507
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,880
He seems realistic. That's amazing.

1508
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,190
It's for saving funds?

1509
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,830
I want to work for myself.

1510
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,530
What type of business
do you want to start?

1511
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,830
I have something I'm thinking about.

1512
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,170
I need to do more research
and find out what I'm best at.

1513
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:45,610
That's why...

1514
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:49,010
I'm figuring out what I like
by making investments.

1515
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,080
I spent...

1516
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,480
most of my 20s earning money.

1517
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,620
I worked hard to save money and invest.

1518
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,250
"I should earn more."

1519
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,860
"Traveling is an extravagance."

1520
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,430
When it came to wine,

1521
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:11,030
I thought, "Why would I drink it
when it's just expensive?"

1522
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,330
- That's what I thought.
- He's honest.

1523
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,600
They're having
a very realistic conversation.

1524
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,140
My values have changed recently.

1525
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,680
It's not bad to spend time and money...

1526
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,550
to understand what I like. It's necessary.

1527
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,080
That's what I think these days.

1528
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,290
So I'm trying to figure out
more of myself.

1529
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,220
- His thoughts are healthy.
- He seems like a good man.

1530
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,260
I agree.

1531
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:41,100
Being clear about what one likes.

1532
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,230
That's amazing.

1533
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,470
I want to find more of what I like.

1534
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,370
For the last four years,

1535
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:56,280
I didn't have much life.

1536
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,310
All I did was work.

1537
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,150
You worked hard.

1538
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,050
He's so charming.

1539
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,690
But now that I'm taking a break,

1540
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,490
I realized...

1541
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,590
that I needed small achievements
here and there.

1542
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:15,760
When I was working a lot,

1543
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,700
I just wanted to rest mindlessly.

1544
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,640
But now that I'm taking a break,
it feels somewhat boring.

1545
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,140
- Right.
- Right?

1546
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,080
I consider getting my driver's license
a small achievement.

1547
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,110
I was so thrilled when I got it.
So I need things like that in my life.

1548
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,980
I think I'm someone who values
small achievements like this.

1549
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,390
I think staying busy leads people
to live more diligently.

1550
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,620
Right.

1551
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,590
I think I'm like that too.

1552
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,300
- They're diving into a different topic.
- Yes.

1553
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,270
Their conversation now
sounds more sincere.

1554
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:55,100
And she initiated the talk
when he didn't ask her first.

1555
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,200
Sang Yun's honesty is...

1556
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,470
a breath of fresh air.

1557
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:01,240
So Je Yeon is opening up to him
and talking to him about herself.

1558
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,810
(It's a new side of Je Yeon.)

1559
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,050
Here you go.

1560
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,080
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1561
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,380
- That looks good.
- Shrimps are...

1562
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,450
- the most expensive in the world.
- It looks really good.

1563
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:11,050
- This is really good.
- Really?

1564
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,990
- Seriously.
- It looks good.

1565
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,820
Let me peel it for you.

1566
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,030
How sweet.

1567
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,370
Thank you.

1568
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,040
This is my favorite type of shrimp.

1569
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,550
(Eye-opening)

1570
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,350
It's good.

1571
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,680
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1572
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,290
This is good. It's nice and salty.

1573
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,290
Yes.

1574
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,190
This is so tasty.

1575
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,800
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes.

1576
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,770
- By the way,
- Yes?

1577
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,040
how was my first impression?

1578
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,710
Your first impression?

1579
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,740
- Be honest.
- Your first impression...

1580
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,810
Right. You looked like an actor.

1581
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,380
Wait, no. An idol star. That was the vibe.

1582
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:17,950
You have such big
and strong facial features.

1583
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,490
- I have strong facial features?
- Yes.

1584
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,620
- Really?
- So I was surprised to see you.

1585
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,660
You sort of gave off this cold vibe.

1586
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,100
- A cold vibe?
- Yes.

1587
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:35,940
Now that I've talked to you today,
you don't seem like a cold person.

1588
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,270
(Smiling)

1589
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,940
What you wrote in the book
was really cool.

1590
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,180
You wrote that you worked really hard
and had no regrets...

1591
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,350
while you played baseball.

1592
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,350
You read my book very thoroughly.

1593
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,150
- I read the book meticulously yesterday.
- She's talking like a lawyer.

1594
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,420
What time is it now?

1595
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,290
This one is too hard.

1596
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,160
(Checking)

1597
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:03,430
I had a drink,
so my superpower can't be activated.

1598
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,230
She's cute.

1599
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,700
I can't even guess what time it is now.

1600
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,500
You dodged that one well.

1601
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,070
- You're spot on.
- Right.

1602
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,350
Whenever I watched baseball games,
I always wondered about this.

1603
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,150
Your shoulder must have hurt a lot
when you were a pitcher.

1604
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,780
Well,

1605
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,290
many people say that the arm of a pitcher
has an expiration date.

1606
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,290
- An expiration date.
- Right.

1607
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,360
There's an expiration date on it.

1608
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,790
Here's the thing
about ligaments and cartilages.

1609
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:34,160
They're bound to rupture at one point.

1610
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,930
So most pitchers
end up getting this surgery...

1611
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,300
called the ligament reconstruction.

1612
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,000
They take the ligament from here...

1613
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,710
and transplant it to the shoulder.

1614
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,070
More than half of the pitchers
get the surgery.

1615
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,340
I've gotten one too.

1616
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,680
(Startled)

1617
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,010
So I'm missing a ligament here.

1618
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,480
Really?

1619
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,920
Seriously. That was it.

1620
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,290
(His days as a baseball player
had been intense.)

1621
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:03,620
I...

1622
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,330
kept pushing myself
until people around me told me to stop.

1623
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,160
Here's what I was thinking.

1624
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:12,930
Quitting baseball
because my arm couldn't withstand it...

1625
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,500
or quitting
because I wasn't good enough...

1626
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,310
I thought they were the same.

1627
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,240
It was better to quit
because of an injury.

1628
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,380
I see.

1629
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,850
"He quit because he wasn't good enough."

1630
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,420
I thought that wasn't cool.

1631
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,450
I see.

1632
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,090
I thought that since high school.

1633
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:35,760
I was confident that I would do well too.

1634
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,590
But it didn't end well for me.

1635
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,160
He's so handsome.

1636
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,360
So when I look back on my life,

1637
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,070
I have no regrets.

1638
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,770
If there is one thing I regret, it's this.

1639
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,940
"I shouldn't have been so foolish."

1640
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,110
- Really?
- He's so honest and cool.

1641
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,080
"I should have rested more."

1642
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,110
I see.

1643
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:00,880
But I also believe...

1644
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,850
I'm where I am today
thanks to those experiences.

1645
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:04,890
Yes.

1646
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,890
- He's so cool.
- He's amazing.

1647
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:11,990
(He's given everything to baseball.)

1648
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:17,330
This is fun.
I didn't know I'd talk this much.

1649
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,030
Same here.

1650
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,100
We're more similar than I expected.

1651
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,970
He will be hard to beat.

1652
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,840
Ji Min has a strong rival now.

1653
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,280
Oh, no. Poor Ji Min.

1654
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,740
She just started to open up to him.

1655
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,280
It seemed Je Yeon came to the date...

1656
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,380
- without expecting much.
- Right.

1657
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,420
- Right? Yes.
- She's starting to expect more now.

1658
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,350
Then who are your close friends?

1659
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:41,090
Your college friends? Or...

1660
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,360
I have two friends
whom I can have heart-to-heart chats with.

1661
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,830
I rarely talk to my friends
when I have a hard time.

1662
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,530
I tend to work things out on my own.

1663
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,670
- I bet we're similar in that way.
- We are.

1664
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,740
You wrote that
one of your strengths was...

1665
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,310
- that you didn't have mood swings.
- Right.

1666
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,310
- My gosh.
- Yes.

1667
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,780
He remembers everything.

1668
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,580
That'd be perfect for investing in stocks.

1669
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,620
Your mindset is perfect for stocks.

1670
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,620
I see.

1671
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,720
I should do my best
with the stock investments.

1672
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,160
- You can't do your best.
- I can't?

1673
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,330
It won't work out then.

1674
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:24,000
- If you try too hard,
- Will I get my heart broken?

1675
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,230
you'll end up at Seoul Station.

1676
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,640
- You must do a half-hearted job.
- A half-hearted job.

1677
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,840
Je Yeon seems a lot more relaxed
compared to before.

1678
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,440
- She's laughing a lot too.
- Yes.

1679
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,040
- So...
- Yes?

1680
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,250
you've been interacting with them
for two weeks.

1681
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,680
Was there someone you were interested in?

1682
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,720
(Nodding)

1683
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,890
Oh, no.

1684
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:55,300
It would've been better
if you had joined us from the beginning.

1685
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,770
You might be sad about that.

1686
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,670
Oh, my.

1687
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,570
I'm not that sad.

1688
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,480
- The weekend will be fun.
- The weekend?

1689
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,880
I don't know what will happen.

1690
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,550
Having a contract relationship
with Sang Yun will leave an impression.

1691
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,260
It might be game over.

1692
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,660
We're taking Polaroid pictures
as an event.

1693
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,890
Would you like to participate?

1694
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,600
- Sure.
- Then...

1695
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,270
The Polaroid camera.

1696
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,700
You're far away.

1697
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,010
One, two, three.

1698
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,810
- What are we going to do?
- They make a great couple.

1699
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:47,850
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun's first date)

1700
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:53,790
- It was fun.
- Yes.

1701
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,090
It was fun.

1702
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,260
I think I got to know you really fast.

1703
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,630
- Really?
- Yes.

1704
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,430
That's all I need then.

1705
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,030
- "That's all I need then."
- "That's all I need then."

1706
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,640
(That's all I need then.)

1707
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,170
(The feelings linger.)

1708
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,980
- He's a great guy.
- Yes.

1709
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:17,040
- I mean it. He's a great guy.
- And charming too.

1710
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,010
Yes. He was injured and quit baseball.

1711
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,280
The fact that he went through
an experience like this...

1712
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,050
- Right. He has many life experiences.
- Yes.

1713
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,260
She must have found that charming
about him.

1714
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,290
I liked what he said about modeling.
It was realistic.

1715
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,490
He admitted that...

1716
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:34,090
modeling was a temporary career for him.

1717
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,230
- Right.
- So...

1718
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,260
when she asked him about his job,

1719
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,370
he could have had a sense of pride
and made it sound fancy.

1720
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,040
(It's the perfect job
to save up money for a business.)

1721
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,540
- Isn't that such an honest answer?
- Yes.

1722
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,740
It makes me think that he's an open book.

1723
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,080
- Right.
- He won't hide things.

1724
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,380
Because his goals are clear.

1725
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,050
- he can confidently talk about this,
- Yes.

1726
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,680
- instead of feeling inferior.
- Right.

1727
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:59,090
Two of the same topics were discussed
by both Sang Yun and Woo Jae.

1728
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,250
- Her dream car.
- Her dream car.

1729
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,890
And the place they wanted to live.

1730
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,320
They handled the discussions
very differently.

1731
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,390
- Right.
- They were very different.

1732
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:10,000
(Sang Yun continued the conversation
while recognizing Je Yeon's capability.)

1733
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,730
They work in very different fields,
so they might not have clicked.

1734
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,630
- Right.
- But they clicked well.

1735
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,470
- Totally.
- Sang Yun must not feel intimidated...

1736
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,700
around Je Yeon,

1737
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:20,810
a female lawyer.

1738
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:23,110
He's the ideal type
when dating a younger guy.

1739
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,410
- Right. My gosh.
- That's how I feel.

1740
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,210
I feel bad for Ji Min.

1741
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,450
- He's a strong rival.
- I...

1742
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,720
Both of them are great for her.

1743
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,020
- Right.
- Ji Min and Sang Yun.

1744
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,750
But Ji Min is so genuine about her.

1745
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,890
So far, given his behavior,
he gives off this vibe that...

1746
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:40,090
he would be there for Je Yeon
and be supportive.

1747
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,930
So she must have had a lot on her mind...

1748
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,460
after going on that date.

1749
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,900
(I have a lot on my mind too.)

1750
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,500
(The pathetic sister joins them.)

1751
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,740
I have no idea where everyone is.

1752
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,710
- Right, Ji Won is with Woo Jae.
- Yes.

1753
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,610
Je Yeon and Sang Yun
are having dinner too.

1754
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,780
(Stopping)

1755
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,380
That's when he found out.

1756
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,620
(The night before)

1757
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,120
This is such a long table.

1758
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,390
Would you like to sit over there
for a second?

1759
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,820
That's a good idea.

1760
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,960
That sounds like a good idea.

1761
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,330
You can grab your wine glass.

1762
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,690
I'm sure I'll have another opportunity.

1763
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,030
(Sang Yun seized an opportunity
without Ji Min's knowledge.)

1764
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,870
That's the kind of facial expression
actors make.

1765
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,180
(Sighing)

1766
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,650
He's feeling down all of a sudden.

1767
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,350
This will help me fall asleep.

1768
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,620
Are you going to sleep right away?

1769
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,250
- Seriously?
- No, I'll have another can.

1770
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:45,090
I don't think Ha Neul will get a chance.

1771
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:46,490
What's this? Isn't this new?

1772
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:47,630
I finished that.

1773
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,000
(They suppress their disappointment
and clink their cans.)

1774
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,230
Did you have dinner?

1775
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,930
You didn't have dinner?

1776
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,970
- It's fine. I can have this.
- We've been whining.

1777
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,440
- Yes.
- Really? Shouldn't I feel more bitter?

1778
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,610
- Why?
- No one asked me out on a date.

1779
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,280
That's true.

1780
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,680
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going to cry.

1781
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,080
Maybe,
you're treating everyone like a friend.

1782
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,690
My gosh.

1783
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,590
Ha Neul's first impression was so chic.

1784
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,920
- Is that so?
- Yes, when we first met.

1785
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,160
She was dressed in black
at our first meeting.

1786
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,430
She walked in while making
clacking sounds with high heels.

1787
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,700
She has a well-defined face too.

1788
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:27,930
But the moment she started talking,

1789
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,740
she was so cheerful.

1790
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,640
I thought she'd be so aloof.

1791
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,280
But she's so energetic.

1792
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,940
I should've been more aloof.

1793
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,950
No, being cheerful is your charm.

1794
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,150
Making people comfortable is your charm.

1795
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,650
My gosh, she must have a lot on her mind
after hearing this.

1796
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,550
She said, "I can't be with someone
who makes me feel comfortable."

1797
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,860
"I'll pick someone
who makes my heart race."

1798
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,120
But the guy she's interested in said,

1799
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,830
"Ha Neul makes me feel so comfortable."

1800
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,290
If you think about it,

1801
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,430
that was the expression
Ha Neul didn't want to hear.

1802
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,100
- She didn't want to hear that.
- Right.

1803
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,440
We're the pitiful trio.

1804
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,940
What if the three of us end up doing
the same thing on Christmas?

1805
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,380
(Woo Jae and Ji Won come back
after their date.)

1806
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,350
I can hear Ha Neul's laughter.

1807
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,780
- Was it not her?
- I think it was.

1808
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,820
No one is in the living room.

1809
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,930
Right. We can't be the first ones, right?

1810
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,560
You're not.

1811
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,260
(Happy to see them)

1812
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,430
- Hello.
- Did you have fun?

1813
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,530
- Hello.
- Who is it?

1814
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,740
- We're not doing well.
- What's wrong?

1815
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,870
Aren't you cold?

1816
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,810
- I'm cold at heart.
- What's going on?

1817
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,240
What was that about?

1818
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,740
This is a meeting for the heartbroken.

1819
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,610
- Why?
- Oh, no. Poor Chang Hwan.

1820
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:48,320
Chang Hwan and I had aglio e olio
and gambas.

1821
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,820
- Nice.
- "Nice?"

1822
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,150
That sounds tasty.

1823
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,720
- What?
- Let's take off our coats.

1824
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,220
- Okay.
- Forget it.

1825
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,360
(They retreat at the frosty vibe.)

1826
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:00,360
(Spotting)

1827
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,530
- This is...
- Look at this.

1828
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,130
(Feeling somewhat comforted)

1829
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,200
Hello.

1830
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,770
Why are you hugging that?

1831
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,340
I'm lonely, so I'm hugging the doll.

1832
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,170
Mr. Yellow is hugging a yellow doll.

1833
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,410
Did the meeting go well?

1834
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,010
Yes.

1835
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,740
You guys are feeling down for real.

1836
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,250
- It's past 11 p.m.? Yes.
- It's 11 p.m.?

1837
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:26,350
I should wash up and go to sleep.

1838
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,990
- Right. Let's wash up and go to sleep.
- What time is it?

1839
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,760
- It's 11 p.m.
- Already?

1840
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,820
Yes.

1841
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,860
Ji Min seems sad.

1842
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,600
Hold on. Here.

1843
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,930
(As he consoles his aching heart,)

1844
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:42,300
(he runs the vacuum cleaner.)

1845
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,170
(Thorough)

1846
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,110
Chang Hwan.

1847
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,450
Do you know
what the most important thing for men is?

1848
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,180
We have to be relaxed.

1849
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,380
Actually, that's what I need.

1850
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:00,850
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun
return after their date.)

1851
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,190
Oh, no. They're home.

1852
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:03,220
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun
return after their date.)

1853
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,720
- Shall we go upstairs?
- Yes.

1854
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,160
- They must be upstairs.
- Yes.

1855
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,430
Everyone must be upstairs.

1856
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,530
- They're not here.
- Everyone...

1857
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:11,870
No one is here.

1858
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,370
How come they're not together?

1859
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

1860
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,840
- No one is here?
- No, there are some people.

1861
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,080
- Where?
- They're downstairs.

1862
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,310
- They're downstairs.
- In the living room?

1863
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,310
What? I didn't see them. No one was there.

1864
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,380
(Glancing)

1865
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:35,960
(He can somewhat sense
someone's presence.)

1866
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,290
(More voices are heard in the foyer.)

1867
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,660
Put on the slippers.

1868
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,500
- That's the last pair.
- Thank you.

1869
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:44,760
(Rushing)

1870
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:47,530
My gosh, he rushed to the door.

1871
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,240
(He rushes out, but it's not the person
he's been waiting for.)

1872
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,840
Nothing for me.

1873
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,470
- Did you just get home?
- What?

1874
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,970
- Did you just get home?
- Yes, we did.

1875
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,880
- Where did you go?
- We had a drink. We had wine.

1876
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,650
You know the most about him among us now.

1877
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,420
- Right. I know the most about him now.
- You're the only one.

1878
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,750
You must take good care of him.

1879
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,690
- Yes, I should take good care of him.
- Right.

1880
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,320
(He hears the sound
of Je Yeon's laughter.)

1881
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
Oh, no.

1882
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,830
Je Yeon must be home.

1883
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Go to her and say hello.

1884
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,030
- Check the text message.
- Okay.

1885
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,940
- You know what? I think...
- Are you drunk?

1886
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:24,940
Yes, I am.

1887
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,140
- I get chatty when I'm drunk.
- Seriously. He's so funny.

1888
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,280
I think I can outdrink him.

1889
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:30,810
- What did you say?
- That's cute.

1890
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:33,680
- He's lightweight. I can outdrink him.
- I drank more than you. I finished it.

1891
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,680
- Things are going well for them.
- Oh, my. I'm getting butterflies!

1892
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,820
- What's going on with them?
- They have the vibe of a married couple.

1893
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:40,890
Right.

1894
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,290
(Chuckling)

1895
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,190
I drank more than you.

1896
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,360
Yes, you did.

1897
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:48,030
Can't she pop in to say hello...

1898
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:49,460
after the date?

1899
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:55,200
Oh, no. He wants to see her,
but he won't go to her.

1900
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:57,070
When I got home,

1901
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,210
- Ha Neul, Chang Hwan,
- Yes?

1902
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,010
and Ji Min were already home.

1903
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:07,210
I think the three of them are quite upset.

1904
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,220
- Because they feel left behind?
- Yes.

1905
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,220
It was...

1906
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,620
(Feeling bothered)

1907
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,750
It seemed...

1908
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,490
(Ji Min tries to fall asleep.)

1909
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:20,590
Oh, no.

1910
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,800
Being on the first floor is boring.

1911
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,440
You didn't go inside?

1912
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,610
The door was closed, so I couldn't enter.

1913
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,240
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

1914
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,080
How was talking to Je Yeon today?

1915
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:41,550
- Our conversation flowed well.
- Really?

1916
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,620
- It was much better than I expected.
- I see.

1917
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,250
- I asked her out as my first date...
- Yes?

1918
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,260
because I thought
we were on the same wavelength.

1919
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:53,160
Then when we met,
there was a hint of nervousness...

1920
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,490
because we didn't drink a lot.

1921
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,470
I thought it wasn't so bad.

1922
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,140
I should flip the photo today
and go to sleep.

1923
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,670
(Flipping over)

1924
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:07,710
- He doesn't want to see her.
- He doesn't want to see her. How cute.

1925
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:08,980
He's upset.

1926
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,240
He's upset.

1927
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,150
(He bullies the photo
for no reason tonight.)

1928
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,250
- My gosh.
- He must be upset.

1929
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,920
This is profound.

1930
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,390
The three of them were
so heartbroken today.

1931
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:23,620
After coming home,
he put on glasses and wore cologne.

1932
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,820
- He even wore cologne.
- He did all that.

1933
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,230
But no one was home.

1934
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:29,600
He didn't go to sleep and waited
in his room for Je Yeon to come home.

1935
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,500
Seeing how he didn't go out to see her...

1936
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,330
- made me think he was already hurt.
- Right.

1937
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,540
Ji Min can't lower his guard.

1938
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,800
- He must keep taking the initiative.
- Right.

1939
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,940
- He must approach her more actively.
- Right.

1940
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,840
Following through all the way
is what the game is about.

1941
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,410
- It's not over until it is.
- Right.

1942
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,550
(Keep that in mind.)

1943
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,020
(Ji Min comes home after work
the next day.)

1944
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,290
(The cake he baked in the cooking class
at his company)

1945
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,190
(Exhaling)

1946
01:25:56,190 --> 01:26:00,390
(He has a dinner date with Je Yeon.)

1947
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,960
(He wears cologne...)

1948
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:08,270
(and eats mint candy.
Now, he's ready for his date.)

1949
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:19,680
(The day Sang Yun and Je Yeon
came home late after their date)

1950
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:22,350
Je Yeon must be hooked
on his handsome face.

1951
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:30,660
(Ji Min didn't even get to see Je Yeon.)

1952
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,500
(Looking around)

1953
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,000
Je Yeon?

1954
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,740
Hey. Hi.

1955
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,010
- Did you have to wait long?
- What?

1956
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,650
No, I didn't have to wait long.

1957
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,920
I'm taking you to a bar
that serves Korean food. Is that okay?

1958
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,680
Sure, sounds good. Are we leaving now?

1959
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,920
- Yes.
- Great.

1960
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:03,160
We had a cooking class at work today,

1961
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,590
- so I brought a dessert.
- Is it this one?

1962
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:06,960
- Yes.
- Really?

1963
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:09,230
- I'm not sure if it's a present, though.
- What?

1964
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:11,230
I'm not sure if it can be a present
because I didn't do a good job.

1965
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,730
Shall I have it after we come back?
We haven't had dinner yet.

1966
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,900
Right, after we come back.

1967
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,240
- Shall I put it in here?
- Yes, you should have it later.

1968
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,140
- Or we can have it together.
- All right. Let's have it together.

1969
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,080
Let's hide it...

1970
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,240
deep in the fridge.

1971
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,950
(Hiding it deep in the fridge)

1972
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,250
- Did you catch a cold?
- Slightly.

1973
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,350
- Again?
- Yes.

1974
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,850
I wonder if I have something for you.
Do you want a heating pad?

1975
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,060
I have one.

1976
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:39,490
- Don't smile. I still hate you.
- What?

1977
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,030
(It's cold.)

1978
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:47,670
It's a place in Yeoksam.

1979
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,440
- There's traffic,
- I see.

1980
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,170
- so it will take 30 to 40 minutes.
- Okay.

1981
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:55,270
- Would it make you too hungry?
- No, it will be fine.

1982
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,540
- Are you going to be all right?
- Yes.

1983
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,620
Wasn't it too busy at work today?

1984
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:06,450
It was fine today. How about you?

1985
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:08,690
- I could apply for many classes...
- I see.

1986
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,890
like a leather craft workshop
or a screen golf game.

1987
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:14,930
It was my first time trying baking.

1988
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,400
Did you select it on purpose?

1989
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,030
You said you like sweets,
so I wanted to try it.

1990
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,730
(Italy)

1991
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,770
If I happen to see chocolates and all,
I'll bring you one.

1992
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,010
Thank you.

1993
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,240
I'm not sure if you will.

1994
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,380
(Laughing)

1995
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:36,420
Let's eat it together
when we get back later.

1996
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,950
Let's eat it together.

1997
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,650
All right.

1998
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,490
We're going to get back late.
How can we eat it?

1999
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,390
What?

2000
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,530
I'm going to get back at midnight.

2001
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,530
I wonder how we would eat it.

2002
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,800
We can eat it at midnight.

2003
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,870
Seriously.

2004
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:57,270
Since you're not going to be around
tomorrow,

2005
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:58,810
I'll make it my work day.

2006
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,210
Maybe I shouldn't.
Maybe I should have dinner.

2007
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,610
I'm curious about the others.

2008
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,210
I haven't talked much with other people.

2009
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,080
You don't have much time left.
Time's short.

2010
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:12,820
I know. I don't have much time left.

2011
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:15,350
(Scratching)

2012
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:23,300
By the way, I can feel that
you're much more comfortable with me.

2013
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:24,730
How?

2014
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,870
- I can just feel it.
- Really?

2015
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,940
I can feel it too.

2016
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,300
- You feel it yourself?
- Yes.

2017
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,010
I feel glad, and I like that.

2018
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,750
I smiled the moment I saw you.

2019
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:49,320
I thought about going to your room.

2020
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,120
- Where?
- Your room.

2021
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,230
- My room?
- Yes.

2022
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,060
But you were sleeping,
and you had to go to work the next day.

2023
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:58,630
So I was afraid I might wake you up.

2024
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,470
It felt like he was sulking.

2025
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,340
Because three people were left at home?

2026
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,400
It's...

2027
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:07,740
because...

2028
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:11,510
- he came back early for dinner together.
- I see.

2029
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,850
What did three of them have for dinner?
Jjajangmyeon?

2030
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,550
Ha Neul came back late.

2031
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,920
Ji Min and Chang Hwan
cooked aglio e olio pasta, I heard.

2032
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,050
Really?

2033
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,990
Yesterday,
he said he wanted to have jjajangmyeon.

2034
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,660
(Je Yeon cared for Ji Min.)

2035
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,960
- Is Ji Min sleeping?
- Yes.

2036
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,600
- He's in the room.
- Really?

2037
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:39,240
(Thinking)

2038
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,510
Then...

2039
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,480
I'm glad.

2040
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:48,150
Chang Hwan and I
finished up the fresh pasta.

2041
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,350
- You ate all of it?
- It was better than jjajang ramyeon.

2042
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,780
Do we have jjajang ramyeon at home?

2043
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,520
We have eight of them.

2044
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,550
(We have 8 jjajang ramyeons.)

2045
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,590
(Laughing)

2046
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,400
I decided to respect that...

2047
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,200
you'd get to know about other people.

2048
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,840
However, I couldn't meet you at all,

2049
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,910
and I couldn't guess how your day was.

2050
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,640
So it made...

2051
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,350
me got narrow-minded.

2052
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,680
- Really?
- Yes.

2053
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,520
He did get narrow-minded.

2054
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,750
I used a facial mask yesterday.

2055
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,490
I guess I should get some more.

2056
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:31,320
(Glaring)

2057
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,890
He's cute.

2058
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,130
(A Korean dining bar in Gangnam-gu, Seoul)

2059
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,070
Tell me the dishes that you want.

2060
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:48,670
(Thinking)

2061
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,710
- This one?
- This one?

2062
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,610
We'll have chicken pancake...

2063
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:54,510
and braised short ribs.

2064
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,180
I want either yuju or plum.

2065
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,750
Do you? One of these?

2066
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,620
- If you drink that much,
- "That much?"

2067
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,490
will you be all right?

2068
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:03,890
I'll be fine.

2069
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,230
(Clinking)

2070
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,730
(Surprised)

2071
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:12,500
- It tastes good.
- It tastes so good.

2072
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:16,100
(Steaming)

2073
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,340
I'm doing a good job at cutting this.

2074
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,870
We're supposed to wrap this with seaweed.

2075
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,480
Thanks.

2076
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,280
I met Woo Jae for lunch today.

2077
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,080
- What?
- For lunch.

2078
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,650
Why?

2079
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,520
Really? How?

2080
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,190
I asked if he was available for lunch.

2081
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:38,560
I had something I wanted to know.

2082
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:41,230
- She had something she wanted to know.
- What was it?

2083
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,330
What?

2084
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,660
I'm curious about everything.

2085
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,100
- Can we have one more drink?
- Sure.

2086
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,400
What was it about?

2087
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,140
I wasn't sure about
the feelings I had for him.

2088
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,750
We barely talked
after we came back to Korea.

2089
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,010
We didn't have time for that.

2090
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:04,150
You spent a lot of time together
at Florence.

2091
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,390
- You happened to meet many times too.
- Right.

2092
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,120
So I wanted to figure out my feelings.

2093
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:11,620
"I wanted to figure out my feelings."

2094
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,960
You did the right thing.

2095
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,000
Ji Min is so good at times like this.

2096
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,830
This is what I was going to tell you
in the car.

2097
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:18,900
Is it?

2098
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,330
I was going to tell you something
when we got there.

2099
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,870
Then let's talk about it
when we get there.

2100
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:26,170
- Shall I tell you now?
- I'll tell you later.

2101
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:28,640
(Thinking)

2102
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,210
It was a good thing you said that.

2103
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,650
That can take a load off your mind.

2104
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,250
If I had come home late,
you might have stayed alone.

2105
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,390
I might have caused big trouble.

2106
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:41,520
I'm glad that I came back early.

2107
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,220
Yes, I'm glad you came early.

2108
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,730
I never imagined
there would be no one at home.

2109
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:55,030
So do you feel easy and free
after you spent time with him?

2110
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,840
Yes.

2111
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,940
- You felt uncomfortable all along.
- Right.

2112
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:01,210
"How do you feel about me?"
Was this your question?

2113
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,340
No.

2114
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,040
I didn't ask him anything.

2115
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,280
Did you just spend time together?

2116
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,550
- We only had a casual conversation.
- I see.

2117
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:09,650
I just checked out my feelings...

2118
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:13,020
by seeing
whether our conversation was fun...

2119
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,720
and whether we spoke the same language.

2120
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,400
Still, you're being honest with me.

2121
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,570
You could have chosen
not to speak about it.

2122
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,170
I appreciate that you told me about it.

2123
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,370
Oh, my.

2124
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,600
I didn't hear it from Woo Jae.

2125
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,540
You're telling me about it now,
and I like that.

2126
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,280
You're telling me this,

2127
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,410
and I feel that
you're being considerate of me.

2128
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:46,350
(Nodding)

2129
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:48,350
Right.

2130
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,860
I think...

2131
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,160
you're very prudent.

2132
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,660
Aren't you?

2133
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,940
And I guess you're open about it too.

2134
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,170
Do you want me to
date all the other girls first,

2135
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,610
compare them, and decide?

2136
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,720
(Nodding)

2137
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,890
Do you want me to do as I like?

2138
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,360
I guess you're feeling at ease.

2139
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:33,030
It's not that I'm feeling at ease.

2140
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,300
But that's the right thing to do.

2141
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,710
You're strong inside.

2142
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,210
(Strong-minded)

2143
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,650
- You're funny.
- I know.

2144
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,420
So did you do as you liked?

2145
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,550
Did you try everything you wanted?

2146
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,720
Today, I really got myself sorted.

2147
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:02,230
You know,

2148
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:05,730
depending on which person I'm with,

2149
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:08,100
- the way I am becomes different.
- Yes.

2150
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,640
I think I should like how I am
with someone.

2151
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,970
- That's important.
- Yes.

2152
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:16,710
However,

2153
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,640
I don't think I liked myself
when I was with him.

2154
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:28,520
I've been thinking that
I needed to have a talk with you.

2155
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,520
(Lunchtime today)

2156
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,820
- It's been a long time.
- We didn't have a chance.

2157
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,390
- Right?
- Right.

2158
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,200
- How have you been?
- Me?

2159
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:39,230
- You have your own pace.
- Yes.

2160
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,270
Of course,

2161
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,840
- during the time we have here,
- Yes?

2162
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,970
getting close to you deeply...

2163
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,280
isn't easy.

2164
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:53,250
Actually, it's the same with most people.

2165
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:59,150
Are you rather calm like this
when you're usually dating?

2166
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:01,890
- When dating?
- Yes.

2167
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:08,530
For someone like you...

2168
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,630
It might be faster than your own pace.

2169
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,900
He's such an honest guy.

2170
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,070
- True.
- Yes.

2171
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,970
It makes me become honest too.

2172
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,010
I see.

2173
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:25,580
You must get along well with him now.

2174
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,380
He's fun to be with. Okay.

2175
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,220
I feel lighthearted now.

2176
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:42,360
When you're with me,

2177
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,900
are you more mischievous?

2178
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,330
Do you feel comfortable?

2179
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,470
I do.

2180
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,970
It feels like I show my true self more.

2181
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,310
I see.

2182
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,320
What's this?

2183
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,520
I'm curious. What was he like?

2184
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,860
- What?
- What was Sang Yun like?

2185
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,590
- Sang Yun?
- Yes.

2186
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,460
- I don't know anything about him.
- Right.

2187
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,640
He's very confident about himself.

2188
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:28,040
Like what?

2189
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,110
Let's see. Sang Yun seemed confident...

2190
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:34,780
that he's doing great right now
and that things will work out for him.

2191
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:35,850
- Career-wise?
- Yes.

2192
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:39,050
- Why would he talk about that with you?
- What?

2193
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:40,250
(Taken aback)

2194
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,390
Do people usually do that?

2195
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,220
When my clients send me gifts,

2196
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:46,990
thanking me
for wrapping up their case well,

2197
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:48,560
I feel rewarded.

2198
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,700
Tell me more.

2199
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,160
- More?
- Yes. With more details.

2200
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,460
- More details?
- Yes.

2201
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:53,900
Do people usually do that?

2202
01:38:54,170 --> 01:39:00,110
(They shared more stories
regarding the topic.)

2203
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,780
Was that all you two talked about?

2204
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,350
We talked about our books as well.

2205
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:08,750
- The books we wrote?
- He picked my book, after all.

2206
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,850
Why did he pick yours?

2207
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,520
He liked mine the most.

2208
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,720
Nothing left him with a sense of doubt.

2209
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:16,790
- Really?
- Yes.

2210
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,190
But is that even important?

2211
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,830
People don't have to think the same way.

2212
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,400
You must meet them in person
and get drawn into the vibe.

2213
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,700
I agree.

2214
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,430
The book doesn't matter.

2215
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:29,670
You can change it.

2216
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:32,600
True.

2217
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:36,680
But it's the priority
for those who think it's important.

2218
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,980
Right.

2219
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:40,780
That's what you call a feeling of fate.

2220
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:42,780
Your soulmate.

2221
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,920
But I don't believe in fate.

2222
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:51,520
If I'm attracted, I adjust to that person.

2223
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,560
(If I'm attracted,
I adjust to that person.)

2224
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:55,860
I'll keep reminding myself.

2225
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:57,730
"Become a bigger person."

2226
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,940
- Cheers?
- Okay.

2227
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,040
I wanted to bring the topic up.

2228
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,720
- I can't.
- Let's see.

2229
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:22,920
This is a different photo.

2230
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,990
- Hold on.
- Do you take photos at the pool?

2231
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:26,890
I do. This is when I went glamping.

2232
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,160
I see.

2233
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,260
As for selfies...

2234
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,030
I think it's a no.

2235
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,930
This is a bit...

2236
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:38,140
- Forget it.
- Show me.

2237
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,240
Give it back.

2238
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,310
Why did you lock it? Unlock it.

2239
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:47,310
No.

2240
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:50,220
There's good news for Ji Min.

2241
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,420
She and Woo Jae...

2242
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,020
- were breaking things off...
- Right?

2243
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,720
for good. Ji Min was informed.

2244
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,220
- Yes.
- Je Yeon told him that.

2245
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,460
- He's been relieved of a heavy load.
- Exactly.

2246
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,590
That was what Woo Jae felt like to Ji Min.

2247
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,730
But the second Woo Jae
is out of the picture,

2248
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,570
- Sang Yun.
- Sang Yun appears.

2249
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:10,300
- A stronger opponent has appeared.
- Right.

2250
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,370
Ji Min might get tired,

2251
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,670
- but he won't give up.
- No.

2252
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:15,710
That's a relief.

2253
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,540
- He's like candy.
- Right?

2254
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,310
- Please don't get tired, Ji Min.
- He won't cry.

2255
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:20,410
You can do it.

2256
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,180
Ji Min isn't an easy opponent.

2257
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,320
(Courage wins the heart.)

2258
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:26,250
(A sparkling city night)

2259
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:28,190
It's nice having a girls' night out.

2260
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:29,960
- Is this a secret night out?
- Let's have fun.

2261
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,560
A girls' night out.

2262
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,490
- A girls' secret night out.
- A girls' secret night out.

2263
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,200
The coffee shop. Third floor.

2264
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:44,440
Chatting among just us is a first, right?

2265
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Yes.

2266
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,810
I thought
it'd be all four of the girls tonight.

2267
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,710
Couldn't it be that Je Yeon is popular?

2268
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:52,140
She's a popular girl.

2269
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,180
- I'm jealous.
- She's popular.

2270
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,820
(How cute.)

2271
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,820
You're funny.

2272
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,220
- Excuse me. Here's your order.
- Gosh.

2273
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,490
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

2274
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:03,490
(Pink desserts have been served.)

2275
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,520
- Does it taste of caffe latte?
- Yes.

2276
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,660
I think I can taste
a bit of orange on top.

2277
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,430
- Would you like to try it?
- Chae Eun's eyes are big now.

2278
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:12,230
- Chae Eun has woken up.
- It woke me up.

2279
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,230
(I love dessert.)

2280
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,770
For next week's contract relationship,

2281
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,770
we'd be closer to each other
than last week.

2282
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,140
- And I mean with everyone.
- Right.

2283
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,340
Do you think it'll feel different?

2284
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:28,310
Compared to last week's
contract relationship?

2285
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,950
I think it'll be different.

2286
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:31,580
Same here. It'll be totally different.

2287
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,650
As for me,

2288
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:35,290
if the person changes,

2289
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:37,460
the mood will change too.

2290
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,660
I'll be experiencing
this kind of relationship...

2291
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:42,430
and that kind of relationship.

2292
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:43,430
Exactly.

2293
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:44,860
(They're worried too.)

2294
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,030
For the upcoming contract relationship,

2295
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:49,740
what kind of relationship do you want?

2296
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:51,840
Last week,

2297
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,670
the relationship with Chan Hyeong
was very comfortable.

2298
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,740
This time, I want my relationship
to have some tension.

2299
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:01,880
- What about you?
- Me?

2300
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,720
Last week's contract relationship
was quite calm.

2301
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,390
This time,

2302
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,760
I want it to be more entertaining.

2303
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,130
- Entertaining.
- I do think having fun is important.

2304
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:17,330
- That means you get along really well.
- Right?

2305
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:21,230
But when it comes to my spouse,

2306
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:23,670
I don't know which is better.

2307
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:24,700
I get it.

2308
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,940
- A stable relationship.
- A stable relationship.

2309
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:30,110
Someone who accepts everything.

2310
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:32,710
Or someone I can have fun with.

2311
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:35,750
I have no idea who would be better.

2312
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:40,220
But to get married,
you need to start by dating.

2313
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,750
Exactly.

2314
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:45,760
You can enjoy dating
only when you're having fun.

2315
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,990
- That might be true.
- Right?

2316
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,190
(They feel more troubled
before the new contract relationship.)

2317
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:51,160
Honestly, I think...

2318
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,400
a lot will change
after the upcoming contract relationship.

2319
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,570
- It totally can.
- Nobody knows what'll happen.

2320
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,240
I'd better do a lot of thinking this week.

2321
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,440
(Worried)

2322
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:06,140
(That evening,
each shared their concerns.)

2323
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:08,250
- Please drive safely.
- Of course.

2324
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:10,850
I'm turning the fare meter on.

2325
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,290
How thorough of you.

2326
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:16,760
You're driving fast,
but the car is very stable.

2327
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:19,160
Isn't it because I drive well?

2328
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:23,060
But the car itself is very quiet.

2329
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,960
I kind of dozed off.

2330
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,570
- Because it was too quiet?
- Yes.

2331
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:30,900
(Ji Min and Je Yeon
have arrived at the house.)

2332
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,640
- Head inside.
- Okay.

2333
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,910
I'll go upstairs after I take my coat off.

2334
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,780
(Rushing)

2335
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,880
Wait for me.

2336
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,510
- What?
- Wait for me.

2337
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:42,710
- What?
- He's a puppy.

2338
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,380
- Wait for me.
- Wait for you?

2339
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:48,420
What tea would you like?

2340
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,120
- Someone's here.
- What?

2341
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:54,190
What?

2342
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,390
- Okay.
- Right.

2343
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:56,530
- Someone's here.
- What?

2344
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:58,760
What?

2345
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:00,700
- Hi.
- Why are you four here?

2346
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:02,100
- Why are you four up here?
- What?

2347
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,740
- Who else would be here...
- Where...

2348
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,870
besides us four?

2349
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:06,440
I told you it was a guys' night out today.

2350
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,470
Why didn't you come?

2351
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:08,840
What? Didn't you have a date?

2352
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,910
He must not be a guy.

2353
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,880
- The elephant in the room shall leave.
- "Elephant?"

2354
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,950
Why would you spend
the precious night with guys?

2355
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:15,950
(Joking)

2356
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:17,420
The girls went out too.

2357
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,080
Judging by his happy face,
the talk must've gone well.

2358
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,650
- Sit down, will you?
- I...

2359
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:22,290
- Come here.
- I'm jealous.

2360
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:23,490
Can you sit down?

2361
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:25,320
Bring me a beer.

2362
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:30,600
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

2363
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,670
(Bothered)

2364
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:37,200
Sang Yun is very bothered by him.

2365
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:40,340
She's changing. She'll come out.

2366
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,110
- She's here.
- Hi.

2367
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:48,010
(Clapping)

2368
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:49,150
Okay.

2369
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:50,580
- Sorry.
- You were coming.

2370
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,850
- Sorry.
- Finally.

2371
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:54,020
You clapped so that I'd go back, right?

2372
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,750
"Go back?"

2373
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:57,960
No way.

2374
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,660
What time are you going to work tomorrow?

2375
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,270
Tomorrow? At around 9:30 a.m.

2376
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:08,870
At 9:30 a.m.? That's early.

2377
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,370
Are you going to work tomorrow?

2378
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,710
No, not tomorrow.
I only have something in the afternoon.

2379
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,980
(Drinking)

2380
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:21,280
(Why is this sad but hilarious?)

2381
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,250
No wonder Ji Min is bothered...

2382
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:24,650
- Right?
- by the situation.

2383
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:26,380
- Let's see if he can defend it.
- Yes.

2384
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,860
Something could happen if he lets
his guard down even for a split second.

2385
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:40,230
- Hurry.
- What?

2386
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:42,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

2387
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,670
I didn't know everyone was here.

2388
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,570
The four guys were chatting.

2389
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:48,140
We were talking
when the two returned from their date.

2390
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,410
You must've been busy, Je Yeon.

2391
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:53,310
(Nodding)

2392
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,810
- She was busy.
- Yes, she was.

2393
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:56,280
Ji Won is concerned...

2394
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,480
about the date with Woo Jae.

2395
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2396
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,920
(All the residents drink together.)

2397
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,550
It's good. I like this beer.

2398
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,190
This beer is quite tasty.

2399
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:06,790
Were you able to talk casually
with everyone?

2400
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,530
Maybe not with Je Yeon?

2401
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:10,030
- Not yet.
- No, not yet.

2402
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:12,160
How was your date with a younger guy?

2403
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,830
- He's younger.
- Date with a younger guy?

2404
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:15,000
(Staring)

2405
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,200
Nice, right?

2406
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,600
"Nice, right?"

2407
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:20,170
You're missing the subject.

2408
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:21,310
Add the subject.

2409
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,440
A younger partner is nice.

2410
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,010
- That was a provocation.
- Oh, no.

2411
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,920
(Ji Min is the only one who can't laugh.)

2412
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,650
Oh, no.

2413
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,820
How funny.

2414
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:39,060
(Drinking)

2415
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,830
Ji Min must feel extremely thirsty.

2416
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:42,560
I would be too.

2417
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,060
It's natural for Ji Min to feel anxious.

2418
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,140
I had a good conversation today.

2419
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,540
I could tell from your face.

2420
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:58,180
But seeing her having
a sweet conversation with Sang Yun...

2421
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,540
made me jealous.

2422
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,510
(I see.)

2423
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,380
Je Yeon has this unique way
of smiling with her eyes and cute side.

2424
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,490
She's like a newborn baby.

2425
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:10,190
"A newborn baby?"

2426
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:11,890
Yes, she looks like a newborn baby.

2427
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:14,890
Seeing that melts my heart.

2428
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,560
The atmosphere melts.

2429
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:21,270
You must be tired
from driving too much today.

2430
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,610
Gosh.

2431
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,050
Does it feel good?

2432
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,950
It feels amazing.

2433
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:38,480
- Isn't it pretty too?
- It is.

2434
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,490
Right? And it really hits the spot.

2435
01:48:40,490 --> 01:48:42,050
I want to try too.

2436
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,720
You really should after me.

2437
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:51,960
(Glancing)

2438
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,030
Will they meet?

2439
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,400
Oh, dear. Is it going to be a second war?
Hold on.

2440
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:03,610
(Getting up)

2441
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:04,810
What's going on?

2442
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:06,410
Did he pass without stopping by?

2443
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:08,310
What's happening?

2444
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:13,550
(Sang Yun heads to Je Yeon's room.)

2445
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:21,930
Over there.

2446
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:24,130
This is really...

2447
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,330
- Are you two going to talk?
- Yes.

2448
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:26,530
- Really?
- Yes.

2449
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:27,870
- But I came too.
- What?

2450
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:29,200
- It's nothing. Go and talk.
- Okay.

2451
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,870
- I'll be downstairs.
- Okay.

2452
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:38,410
- Was it fun today?
- Today?

2453
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:39,610
What did you eat?

2454
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:42,580
Today, we went to a Korean dining bar.

2455
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,290
(Bothered)

2456
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:52,020
Actually, here.

2457
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:54,660
- What is it?
- You said your throat hurt.

2458
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:55,690
Really?

2459
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,760
- Because Je Yeon said her throat hurt.
- This is better.

2460
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,500
- You suck on it.
- Okay.

2461
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:02,800
Did you buy these today?

2462
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,900
I found them.

2463
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:05,940
- Where?
- He found them.

2464
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,270
Thank you.

2465
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:15,310
(The night deepens with heavy thoughts.)

2466
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:17,050
Je Yeon must have it tough.

2467
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:18,750
(But it's fun!)

2468
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:20,790
By watching him,

2469
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:23,790
Sang Yun must've figured Ji Min out.

2470
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,120
That's why he's provoking him bit by bit.

2471
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,660
What an assertive catfish.

2472
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:30,000
Ji Min must protect Je Yeon.

2473
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:40,470
(From Chae Eun:
No more mistakes from now on!)

2474
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:44,580
(From Chan Hyeong:
Let's have tomatoes and rest again.)

2475
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:47,810
(From Woo Jae: I want to know
more about you! Let's hang out more.)

2476
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,120
(From Ji Won: I want to hang out with you
during the day.)

2477
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:58,090
Now that it's bigger,
I can feel it a lot better.

2478
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,760
- What?
- I...

2479
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:02,860
can't just take it easy...

2480
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,030
and shrug it off.

2481
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:05,800
- I'm lost in it now.
- Right?

2482
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,600
That's why I feel...

2483
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,070
happy, yet uncomfortable.

2484
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,580
(From Ji Min: Thanks. Good night.
I'll see you in two days.)

2485
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,720
(From Je Yeon: I'm grateful and happy
you shared your feelings and thoughts.)

2486
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,850
(The dessert was also good.
Thanks for making it for me.)

2487
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,550
I can take a shower now.

2488
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:31,760
I got my text. The end.

2489
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,960
You're different from last night.

2490
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,260
I'm flipping one over.

2491
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,870
I'll flip both if I get a text tomorrow.

2492
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:42,300
Don't check it.
