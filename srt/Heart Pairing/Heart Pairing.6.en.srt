1
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,140
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,540
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,810
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,370
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,110
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,640
(Super sympathizer, Choi Si Won)

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,180
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,450
Last week, three couples were paired.

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,680
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,790
(Woo Jae and Je Yeon were paired again
in Korea as well as in Italy.)

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,990
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,420
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul
picked each other's Pairing Book.)

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,460
And Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,820
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won
have similar tastes.)

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,060
From Italy, they moved
to the Pairing House in Seoul.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,830
(Pairing House in Seongbuk-dong)

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,670
(A new space for them
to stay together for 20 days)

18
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,840
(And their information was revealed.)

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,070
(Their occupations and ages
were unexpected.)

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,580
Even after their occupations
and ages were revealed,

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,980
their Love Lines haven't changed much.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,680
I think Chang Hwan...

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,820
Right.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,080
His age was revealed,

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,950
and Ji Won showed a response.

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,990
Would their age gap...

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,690
become a factor?

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,630
As I see it, they were shocked at first,

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,500
but after getting over the hump,

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,400
their relationship will progress.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,540
And in the text messages
they sent to each other,

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,640
they showed consideration.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,410
Chang Hwan didn't say much,

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,440
but his text was neat. "Unexpected charm."

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,810
And Ji Won also said,
"Keep talking to me."

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,750
I could understand why
Chang Hwan looked out of the window.

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,190
However, in spite of that,

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,260
when they talk or date from now on,

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,020
the age factor...

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,090
- will linger in their minds.
- Right.

41
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,260
The cast whose occupation
surprised the others the most...

42
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,330
was Chan Hyeong with the best
qualification ever in a dating show.

43
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,670
Before he introduced himself,

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,700
- he turned his wine glass about twice.
- Right.

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,140
Like he was saying,
"Get ready for a surprise."

46
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,010
- "Listen carefully."
- "Listen carefully."

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,380
And among the female cast,

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,810
the one whose occupation and age
were most unexpected...

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,680
- was Je Yeon.
- Right.

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,950
And Woo Jae is a painter.

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,090
(Her pairing partner,
Painter Shin Woo Jae)

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,990
They work in such different fields.

53
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,320
This is what I thought.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,790
Je Yeon is so beautiful...

55
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,260
and has a nice occupation.

56
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,900
I suppose she's had a lot of offers
for blind dates.

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,130
She must have been offered many meetings
for a prospective marriage partner.

58
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,840
However,

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,510
it seems that she has a specific type
of a future spouse in mind.

60
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,210
So the personality...

61
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,780
Woo Jae has...

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,080
is the top priority in her mind,
I suppose.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,850
I feel that Je Yeon considers
a man's personality important.

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,450
According to what I heard,

65
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,420
in the Pairing House in Seoul,
everything will be shaken...

66
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,330
- after a new dating rule is revealed.
- What?

67
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,760
With this rule, the Love Lines so far
can totally be changed.

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,530
- That's cruel.
- This is insane.

69
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,070
I had a feeling that
things were determined too quickly,

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,940
and now it will be changed?

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,640
It's not fun when things go too smoothly.

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,480
In the everyday life of the cast
who came back to Seoul,

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,810
what new incidents will happen?

74
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,110
Let's check it out now.

75
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,550
What will happen?

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,380
(Their first morning in Seoul)

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,850
The morning came.

78
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,050
(Their first morning in Seoul)

79
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,920
(Chan Hyeong wakes up at 6 a.m.)

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,160
He wakes up at 6 a.m.

81
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,600
(Springing up)

82
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,770
- He's so diligent.
- He's amazing.

83
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,510
Is he making the bed too?

84
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,710
He's a right-minded person.

85
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,180
He grew up to be a nice person.

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,150
(Chan Hyeong goes to work at 6:30 a.m.)

87
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,120
- Who is that?
- It's Ji Min.

88
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,730
(Precise)

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,100
- He goes to work early.
- That's right.

90
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
(Ji Min goes to work at 7:40 a.m.)

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,180
Fourteen minutes.

92
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,350
(Each of them goes to work.)

93
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,150
(Meanwhile, in the Pairing House...)

94
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,890
Ha Neul is beautiful.

95
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,860
(Washing the dishes before going to work)

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
Is she going somewhere?

97
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,610
(She goes to work with a huge suitcase.)

98
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,350
I guess she carries her costumes and all.

99
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,990
(Their ordinary day in Seoul begins.)

100
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,570
- See you, Ji Won.
- See you.

101
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,440
- It's Ji Won.
- She's an office worker.

102
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,080
(Je Yeon is getting ready to go to work.)

103
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,220
(And Woo Jae)

104
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,150
It's 9:15 a.m.

105
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,390
(Last night)

106
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,530
You said you'd leave around 10 a.m.
tomorrow. Where are you heading?

107
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,890
I go to Gwanghwamun Station.

108
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,260
It's very near.

109
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,700
- How are you getting there?
- Excuse me?

110
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,870
What are you going to take to get there?

111
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm not sure. A taxi, maybe.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,940
Would you like to go with me tomorrow?

113
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,070
Okay.

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,870
What time are you leaving?

115
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,940
- I'll leave around the same time.
- All right.

116
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,550
How about 9:30 or 9:40 a.m.?

117
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,380
Let's meet here at 9:50 a.m.

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,850
At 9:50 a.m.? Okay.

119
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,020
He asked if she wanted to go together.

120
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,190
Giving a ride is nice.

121
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,930
(Applying perfume)

122
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,600
(Turning)

123
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,410
Good morning.

124
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,980
- I'm ready.
- What?

125
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,180
- I'm ready.
- Are you ready?

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,050
- I'll drive you to work.
- Okay.

127
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,980
When are you getting off?

128
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,480
I think it will be around 6 p.m.

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,650
- At 6 p.m.?
- Yes.

130
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,990
How about I pick you up on the way back?

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,390
- Would it be convenient for you?
- Yes.

132
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,260
On their way back too.

133
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,400
He made an appointment after work too.

134
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,770
He's really active.

135
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,240
My guess was so wrong, right?

136
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't you think so?

137
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,310
- No one expected it, though.
- Everyone...

138
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,620
Starting from the book...

139
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,020
"Starting from the book."

140
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,220
- So yesterday, I...
- What did you do yesterday?

141
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,590
- I read Ji Won's book yesterday.
- I see.

142
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,630
I could understand why you were confused.

143
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,530
- You could understand, right?
- Yes.

144
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,370
Exactly.

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,300
That's why she read it again.

146
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,170
Je Yeon is making an effort
to understand Woo Jae.

147
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,110
She could understand why he was confused.

148
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,740
All right.

149
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,950
You asked me about mood swings...

150
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,480
- in Italy.
- Right.

151
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,150
Do you usually have calm mood swings?

152
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,920
"Calm..."

153
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,920
I think I'm a calm person.

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,900
In the light blue book,
you wrote that you rarely had mood swings.

155
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,030
That's right.

156
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,470
It was really fun.

157
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,210
Who surprised you the most, then?

158
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,780
- You.
- Me?

159
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Yes.

160
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,680
So it was very fun.

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,520
- Right. It was fun.
- It was fun. Anyway,

162
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,350
you showed the most unexpected aspect.

163
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,090
- The most unexpected?
- Yes.

164
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,890
Woo Jae is lost in thought.

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,130
(Wiggling)

166
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,040
(Touching)

167
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,810
After finding out the occupations
and ages, how did you feel?

168
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Well...

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,150
How did you feel?

170
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,790
- How did I feel?
- Yes.

171
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,790
Well...

172
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,590
I think it feels better.

173
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,430
I feel that I know them better.

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,000
I was curious about their everyday lives.

175
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,540
- I wondered about their day.
- I see.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,310
And now, I think I can picture that.

177
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,310
So I feel good.

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,910
You're right.

179
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,450
I thought the same thing.

180
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,620
- I feel we have more to talk about now.
- Yes.

181
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,990
I think it's better,
considering those things.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
(Glancing)

183
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,340
(Turning)

184
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,310
Bye.

185
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,720
(Focused)

186
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,960
(They found out
about each other's occupation.)

187
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,700
Anyway,
they work in such different fields.

188
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,000
(They have a lot of things
to find out about each other.)

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,540
I don't need to take a taxi.

190
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,510
I can take public transportation
if that's available.

191
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,510
All right. Have a seat here.

192
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,450
- No, I'm fine.
- Sit here.

193
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,950
I can sit here.

194
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,180
- No.
- I'm fine.

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,750
- Are you going to sit there?
- Yes.

196
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,290
You look stylish, though.

197
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,220
- Do we have only two chairs here?
- Wait a minute.

198
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,260
- Shall I bring one?
- I'll do that.

199
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,930
I feel a bit sorry.

200
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,400
- I know.
- No, it's fine.

201
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,160
I can sit on the street too.

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
- "On the street."
- "On the street."

203
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,300
I had a life on the road, anyway.

204
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,910
"A life on the road?"

205
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,540
But painting on the street
sounds very romantic.

206
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,580
- I've led a rough life.
- I'm curious about your painting style.

207
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,410
Same here.

208
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Shall I show...

209
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,790
- Do you like paintings?
- Pardon?

210
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,250
- Do you like paintings?
- Yes.

211
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,590
- Do you?
- Yes.

212
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,360
What kind of painting do you like?

213
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,220
- I like abstract painting.
- Abstract?

214
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,360
Do you remember when...

215
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,560
we walked on the streets in Florence,
entered a gallery,

216
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,830
- and I asked what painting you liked?
- Right.

217
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,600
I was curious about your taste,
so I asked that.

218
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,310
(The painting Je Yeon liked)

219
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,040
- You said you liked abstract painting.
- Right.

220
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,510
I usually draw abstract paintings.

221
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,950
Are you going to show us
your paintings now?

222
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,580
- Yes.
- Gosh.

223
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,750
I scanned my work on paper.

224
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,590
This is what I do.

225
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,890
(Woo Jae shows his paintings.)

226
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,060
This is awesome.

227
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,160
- He wanted to show what he did.
- Some of my friends bought my works.

228
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,130
What are these?

229
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,370
Are they lotus flowers?

230
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,170
- I have this too.
- That's nice.

231
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,410
Je Yeon is very active.

232
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,770
I guess it's her first time...

233
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,180
- meeting an artist.
- I guess so.

234
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,610
- I have this too.
- That's nice.

235
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,980
The album is...

236
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,720
(Laughing)

237
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,050
Je Yeon is so happy.

238
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,090
Are the paintings hung in your studio?

239
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,930
Yes, they are.

240
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,730
This is a large painting I did.

241
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,400
It's on the wall of a cafe.

242
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,770
This is a very large one.

243
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,470
- How large is it?
- This one...

244
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,670
is about as big as that window.

245
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,410
- Really?
- Yes.

246
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,610
You're a great artist.

247
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,910
(Welcome to Woo Jae's world.)

248
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,150
How long did you work on this?

249
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,580
- This is awesome.
- For something like this...

250
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,620
She's so happy.

251
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,290
You're competent in painting.
That's a talent.

252
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,790
- Exactly. You need to be born with this.
- Right.

253
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,930
I just draw what I like.

254
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,630
I paint only because I love painting.

255
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,840
I... When I really...

256
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,940
After I quit playing sports,

257
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,480
I went through a period
where I had no dream.

258
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,740
That's when I was in my 20s.

259
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,810
Before that, I...

260
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,120
ran ahead,
only to make my dream come true.

261
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,050
I always had a dream,

262
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,720
so when I had no dream
for the first time in my life,

263
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,030
it really made me
think about things a lot.

264
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,130
I reflected on myself a lot too,
although I usually do that.

265
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,930
After that,

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,800
I think more about what I like.

267
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,040
So,

268
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,170
when I wrote the answers
to the realistic questions,

269
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,940
it made me think a lot.

270
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
Well, honestly,

271
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,350
I'm not someone...

272
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,750
who would bury my head in the sand,

273
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,090
but still,

274
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,690
- when I wrote about the car and all...
- I see. The cost.

275
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,130
Something like,
"My annual income after five years?"

276
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,160
About that, I wrote this.

277
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,300
For a minimum of five years...

278
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,340
and a maximum of ten years,

279
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,040
I should just apply myself to painting.

280
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,180
So in that period,

281
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,010
I don't want much in return
for my paintings.

282
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,920
- So...
- What you're saying now...

283
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,820
- is that it's time you get seasoned.
- Right.

284
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,250
That was what I thought.

285
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,160
Actually, five years is really short.

286
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,330
You need at least ten years.

287
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,230
I chose this because I want to do it
my whole life.

288
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,400
You have a good mindset.

289
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,470
There might be many people
who want to see an outcome quickly.

290
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,310
I always have a priority in my mind.

291
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,640
That's what I think.

292
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,320
(The world of Woo Jae, a painter,)

293
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,990
(and the world of Je Yeon, an attorney,)

294
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,260
(are meeting now.)

295
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,270
(What story will they share?)

296
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,180
They're both calm. What did you think?

297
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,710
I feel it just started.

298
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,020
I feel that they're entering
the new real chapter.

299
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,390
- It's real now.
- Yes.

300
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,620
(What stories in their reality
will unfold?)

301
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,130
(The sunset colors the sky.)

302
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,260
He must have done some grocery shopping.

303
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,200
(Chang Hwan is home
with things in both his hands.)

304
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,500
That's kimchi.

305
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,410
- Hi.
- You're back early.

306
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,710
I took a day off today because I'm sick.

307
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,950
- Oh, no.
- I didn't go to work.

308
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,180
- Goodness.
- Really?

309
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Yes.

310
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,650
(Alarm ringing)

311
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,930
(Walking noiselessly)

312
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,840
(Chae Eun couldn't wake up
despite the alarm.)

313
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,940
(Coughing)

314
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,210
It seems that she's got a cold.

315
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,070
(Chae Eun couldn't go to work.)

316
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,980
I was diagnosed with Influenza A.

317
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,710
It's not just a cold? It's the flu?

318
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,810
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

319
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,080
Why are you doing the dishes
when you're sick?

320
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,680
- Well, it's nothing.
- We can do that later.

321
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,390
Leave them in the corner,
and I'll do them later.

322
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Did you take any medicine?

323
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,530
I just took some earlier.

324
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,830
- And you went to the hospital?
- Yes.

325
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,600
I went and got an IV shot.

326
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,260
- Oh, no.
- And I came back.

327
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,470
What about food?

328
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,900
I had a light meal.

329
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,500
(Stirring)

330
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,380
(Thoroughly washing the tomatoes)

331
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,010
(Popping off the stem)

332
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,950
(Cutting the toppings for her yogurt)

333
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,490
(Her food is ready.)

334
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,390
(She and her sister have gotten used to it
since middle school.)

335
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,760
(She's been living alone for 14 years.)

336
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,590
(Her survival instinct kicks in
when she's sick.)

337
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,330
(Chewing)

338
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,100
(She makes sure to eat a proper meal,
even when she's sick.)

339
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,880
I just ate.

340
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,320
- This is bad.
- Did you shop for groceries?

341
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,120
Yes, I got some groceries
and my mom's kimchi.

342
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,690
Really?

343
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,720
That looks tasty. It's aged kimchi.

344
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,890
I'll cook something with it,
so eat it later.

345
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,590
- His mother's kimchi?
- Okay. Thank you so much.

346
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,130
I need to move some more things, so...

347
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,660
- Sure.
- Leave them there for now.

348
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Okay.

349
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,670
(Rushing down)

350
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,940
The oldest guy is
in charge of all those things.

351
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,840
(While Chang Hwan brings the necessities,)

352
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,310
(Chae Eun gets some rest.)

353
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,370
Oh, no.

354
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,850
(Cautious)

355
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,490
Chae Eun?

356
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,390
Yes?

357
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,620
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

358
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,430
- Do you have a fever?
- Yes.

359
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,130
It's pretty high.

360
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,430
What did you eat?

361
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,230
An egg,

362
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,170
tomatoes, and yogurt.

363
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,670
You should have a better meal.

364
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,640
You need a high-calorie meal
that will energize you.

365
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,840
Will it be hard for you
to join us at dinner later?

366
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,180
If I fall asleep...

367
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,910
- He's so kind-hearted.
- Yes.

368
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,980
- He's well-mannered and warmhearted.
- He is.

369
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,480
He's going to be like a black hole.

370
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,190
You won't be able to get away from him.

371
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,120
(You'll never get enough of him.)

372
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Chae Eun!

373
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,160
Hi!

374
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,860
- Welcome home.
- I bought bread.

375
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,590
- She's sick.
- She is?

376
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,430
I have Influenza A.

377
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,100
- What?
- Influenza A.

378
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Seriously?

379
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Her fever went
all the way up to 39°C last night.

380
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,270
- Are you okay now?
- I put on a mask, just in case.

381
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, no.

382
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,910
She's too tired...

383
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,710
- to eat a proper meal.
- Should we get her porridge?

384
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,280
Do you want to eat porridge?
Like egg porridge.

385
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,010
That's easy to make.

386
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,750
Yes. Like egg porridge.

387
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,680
- We can just have it made.
- Yes.

388
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,880
I feel so bad for you!

389
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,420
- What did you buy?
- Some bread.

390
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,490
Really?

391
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,590
Is the fever high?

392
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,160
- I think it's...
- It's so hot!

393
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,390
- Is it?
- Yes.

394
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,230
- Do you want bread?
- Last night...

395
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,600
Right. Bread.

396
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,230
- I got a lot of sweets.
- When you're sick,

397
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,500
- you need to eat sweet food.
- Yes, I got a lot of sweet food.

398
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,340
- You need high-calorie food.
- I got all the high-calorie bread.

399
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,940
I think you should eat the whole thing...

400
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,140
- to get well soon.
- Yes.

401
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,570
I'll cut it up and bring you some.

402
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,040
You're so sweet.

403
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,380
- Am I a sweet girl?
- Yes.

404
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,050
(For sick Chae Eun,
this sweet girl makes egg porridge.)

405
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,280
The color looks great.

406
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,580
- It does, right?
- It looks delicious.

407
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,690
(Chae Eun goes back to bed,
feeling their warmth.)

408
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,690
(Gasping)

409
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,860
We're going to eat duck tonight.

410
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,460
- You also bought this.
- Yes.

411
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,890
I got 200 dollars' worth of groceries.

412
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,930
- So...
- How long are you planning on staying?

413
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,970
- So, I...
- How long are you going to stay here?

414
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,070
I mean, it's not just for me,
and I happened to...

415
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,540
- How long are you going to stay here?
- buy a lot.

416
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,610
- Chang Hwan is so likable.
- Yes.

417
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,640
What are you making tonight? Kimchi stew?

418
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,380
- I brought this kimchi.
- Seriously?

419
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,920
- Is this your mother's?
- Yes.

420
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,350
- It used to be...
- That's awesome.

421
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,650
regular kimchi,

422
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,150
and I turned it into aged kimchi
by mistake.

423
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,690
That's awesome.

424
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,090
- It's even better.
- Even better.

425
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
(Sizzling)

426
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,210
What's this? Oh, my.

427
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,580
- It's for the stew.
- It looks delicious.

428
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,410
It's beef bone soup powder.

429
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,610
I see.

430
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,710
And the magic powder made of anchovies.

431
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,950
I have a variety of powders.

432
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,190
(Adding all types of secret powders)

433
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,690
Well done.

434
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,990
That kimchi looks scrumptious.

435
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,060
It was aged perfectly.

436
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,860
A man who can make a good kimchi stew.

437
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,960
(It turned into a delicious stew.)

438
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I don't know about anything else,

439
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,430
- but I can make a good stew.
- You're right.

440
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Yes.

441
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,040
- Perfect?
- Yes.

442
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,710
(Ha Neul's egg porridge is also finished.)

443
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,180
- Ha Neul is a good cook.
- Yes.

444
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,980
Can you give this a taste?

445
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,920
- Yes.
- Is it okay?

446
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,120
I should turn the heat off.

447
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,820
Thank you so much
for going grocery shopping today.

448
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,590
I love shopping for groceries.

449
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,490
When I'm on a trip
or fly to another country,

450
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,660
- while others go to see the Colosseum,
- Yes.

451
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,670
I go to the grocery store first.

452
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,800
- Really?
- Yes.

453
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,200
- To buy things?
- To buy things.

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,170
- Like pasta...
- Yes.

455
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,010
or things that you can't find in Korea.

456
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,010
My role model is Cha Seung Won.

457
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,410
He made all the weaning food...

458
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,980
- All of them?
- for his daughter.

459
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,920
And I heard that making weaning food...

460
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,220
- was really tough.
- It's difficult.

461
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,420
That's what I heard.

462
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,390
- A dad who makes weaning food?
- Yes.

463
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,890
I want to be a dad who makes weaning food
with organic ingredients.

464
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,690
He's so warmhearted.

465
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,600
(At 7 p.m., Gwanghwamun Station)

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,030
Is it Woo Jae?

467
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,940
(Woo Jae and Je Yeon...)

468
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,410
(wrapped up their days.)

469
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,840
(He waits for Je Yeon
at the appointed place.)

470
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,950
They're meeting up.

471
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,620
- There you are.
- She's gorgeous.

472
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,650
(Hi.)

473
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,550
(Glad to see her)

474
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,060
Did you change?

475
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,290
Just the jacket.

476
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,330
- Did you put on a jacket?
- Yes, it was cold.

477
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,360
I see.

478
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,730
- By the way,
- Yes?

479
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,030
where's your office?

480
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,830
- Me? I was at a coffee shop today.
- Is it nearby?

481
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,870
A coffee shop?

482
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,340
(Back in Italy,)

483
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,640
(they went on a 1-on-1 date.)

484
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
(They met in the morning...)

485
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,240
- It's cold, isn't it?
- It is.

486
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,710
- Do you want a hand warmer?
- I have one.

487
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,780
- Did you work at the coffee shop?
- Yes.

488
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,980
They're sharing their days.

489
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,520
- I was also working before I came here.
- Right.

490
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,290
- You haven't eaten yet, right?
- I haven't.

491
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,560
- Should we get something to eat first?
- Should we?

492
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,990
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

493
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,460
They sell pork cutlets and stuff.

494
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,470
Okay.

495
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,930
- Do you like pork cutlets?
- I do.

496
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,970
Were you busy? Did you have a lot of work?

497
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,070
- I just took my time today.
- Did you?

498
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,240
I had lunch with a friend...

499
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,740
and went to a coffee shop to work.

500
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,410
- You've been outside for a while.
- I have.

501
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,050
Back in Italy,
you didn't want to go back home.

502
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,190
Right.

503
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,990
- I prefer the outside, even here.
- Is that right?

504
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,390
I wish I could keep staying outside.

505
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,390
(I love going out.)

506
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,400
I don't exactly prefer staying at home.

507
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,270
Are you all right with the food I picked?

508
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,870
- Yes. I like pork cutlets.
- Do you?

509
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,240
How was your day?

510
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
My studio was...

511
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,240
pretty messy, so...

512
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,850
People might visit,

513
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,620
so I cleaned it up.

514
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,720
I also got some work done.

515
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,260
He should have said,
"You should come by next time."

516
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,760
- Exactly.
- Yes.

517
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,090
That's what she wants to see.

518
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,590
She also texted him
that she wanted to check out...

519
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,160
- his studio.
- Yes.

520
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,330
Maybe Woo Jae is the type
to take things slow.

521
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,670
What kind of coffee did you have today?

522
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,000
I had a decaf iced Americano.

523
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,110
Okay.

524
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,910
At Starbucks,
I had Grapefruit Honey Black Tea.

525
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,710
- I like that drink too. Yes.
- Do you?

526
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,980
- It's tasty.
- It is.

527
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,620
What's your schedule tomorrow?

528
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,080
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

529
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,320
I have a meeting at 1 p.m., so...

530
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,420
What kind of meeting is it? For paintings?

531
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,090
- For an exhibition.
- An exhibition?

532
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,290
Do you have an exhibition coming up?

533
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,260
We're discussing it at the moment.

534
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,070
You'll come if I hold one, right?

535
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,200
(Nodding)

536
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,640
Of course.

537
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,640
I bet it'll be fascinating.

538
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,170
- Fascinating?
- Yes.

539
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,610
I'll...

540
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,050
- invite you to my studio soon.
- Okay.

541
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,350
There you go.

542
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,190
I can't wait to find out
what your studio is like.

543
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,990
I tried to clean it up today,

544
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,530
but it was a total mess.

545
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,560
It's not that big,

546
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,570
but there was a renovation this year.

547
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,310
I had to get a large rack.

548
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,410
Still,

549
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,180
I think it's clean enough
to invite someone.

550
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,480
I think he cleaned it up
so that he could invite Je Yeon.

551
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,880
I agree.

552
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
It's the place
where he can look the coolest.

553
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,250
(That's true.)

554
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,420
(A cold buckwheat noodles place
near Gwanghwamun)

555
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,520
- This is a Michelin-star restaurant.
- Is it?

556
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,960
Oh, it is! I can't wait to try it.

557
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,860
You can go first.

558
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,970
(They have dinner by themselves
before going back home.)

559
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,100
Upstairs.

560
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,100
(Cold buckwheat noodles)

561
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,910
(The menu)

562
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,170
They serve...

563
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,840
- What are the good ones?
- good pork cutlets and cold noodles.

564
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,750
But if you want something warm,

565
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,380
you can get udon.

566
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,650
Do you prefer buckwheat noodles or udon?

567
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,980
- Buckwheat noodles.
- Buckwheat noodles?

568
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,620
- We'll have one pork cutlet...
- Yes?

569
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,120
and warm buckwheat noodles.

570
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,260
Warm buckwheat noodles and a pork cutlet.

571
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
Yes.

572
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,730
(While he orders the food,
she puts the spoons down.)

573
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,660
I did wash my hands,

574
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,430
but I still have paint on them.

575
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,000
- Paint?
- Yes.

576
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,370
Show me.

577
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,440
It looks dirty, though.

578
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm embarrassed to show you.

579
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,610
(Laughing)

580
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,350
Your warm buckwheat noodles
and pork cutlet are here.

581
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,650
Thank you.

582
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,980
- They look tasty.
- Thank you.

583
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,820
- You can scoop some and eat it.
- Right.

584
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,320
It's such a big portion.

585
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,420
- Right? It is.
- Yes.

586
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,660
Why didn't you eat lunch?

587
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,600
Lunch...

588
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,660
- Were you busy?
- I forgot.

589
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,000
- Seriously?
- Yes.

590
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,540
(Steaming)

591
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,670
Were you unable to eat
because you were cleaning?

592
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,540
- The studio?
- Yes.

593
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,610
You can have the rest.

594
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,880
- All of it?
- Yes.

595
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,080
It's a lot.

596
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,420
(Slurping)

597
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,090
There's usually a long line
when it's mealtime.

598
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,220
- This restaurant?
- Yes.

599
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,690
There are like three long lines.

600
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,860
Fortunately,
there aren't many people tonight.

601
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,300
I guess it's because it's past mealtime.

602
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,970
- It's warm.
- Is it warm?

603
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,000
I like it.

604
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,470
- I got up this morning...
- Yes?

605
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,810
and went out on the terrace
by the living room,

606
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,340
- and the view was fabulous.
- Really?

607
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,310
- I missed it this morning.
- I didn't.

608
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,080
I'll make sure to see it tomorrow morning.

609
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,230
She's so cute.

610
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,130
- Does it suit you?
- Yes.

611
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,830
- It's tasty.
- Do you like it?

612
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,270
You can eat more noodles now, right?

613
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,530
You told me to eat the rest.

614
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,270
I thought you'd be hungry.

615
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,740
You said you didn't even have lunch.

616
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,880
(Touched)

617
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,510
(She was being considerate to Woo Jae
as he skipped lunch.)

618
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,640
I know.

619
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
(Slurping)

620
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,720
- Have some more.
- Thank you.

621
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,720
What kind of painting did you make today?

622
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,760
- Je Yeon is so enthusiastic.
- There was...

623
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,290
a painting I was working on
before going to Italy.

624
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,030
I had finished the underpainting before.

625
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,700
And I added a little more to that.

626
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,840
If it weren't for the meeting tomorrow,

627
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,010
I would have invited you to my studio.

628
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,740
- Oh, your studio.
- I would have invited you.

629
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,150
But I'm not the only one preparing for it.

630
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,950
- There are others working on it with me.
- I see.

631
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,680
Will there be multiple artists
for the exhibition as well?

632
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,820
Probably.

633
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,060
I had one exhibition last year,

634
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,960
and I realized
that I needed more paintings.

635
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,000
I thought I should work harder.

636
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,040
I was thinking of
having an exhibition next year,

637
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,540
but I ended up holding this one.

638
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,280
You don't have the exact date yet, right?

639
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,580
No. We'll talk about the details
in the meeting tomorrow.

640
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,850
I'll tell you again
when we decide on things.

641
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,630
What kind of work did you do today?

642
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,300
- Today?
- Yes.

643
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,760
Today...

644
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,270
What was it? Real estate.

645
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,940
Real estate?

646
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,010
I conducted due diligence...

647
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,750
before buying buildings or lands.

648
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,950
- Stuff like that.
- That...

649
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,480
Were you working on that?

650
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,690
I'm not so familiar with that field.

651
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,740
(Their conversation naturally stopped.)

652
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,370
- He can't ask the next question.
- Their conversation stopped.

653
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
- He should ask her more.
- Exactly.

654
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,380
- Like, "How does it work?"
- If you don't know...

655
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,480
You don't have to know everything.

656
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,750
- Right.
- Woo Jae must think...

657
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,150
that he needs to know all of those.

658
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,150
- He could have said, "What's that like?"
- He thinks you can talk only if you know.

659
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,060
- Is your friend nearby?
- Yes.

660
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,290
A close friend?

661
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,360
Yes.

662
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,230
Is she from Busan?

663
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,830
No, from law school.

664
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,260
Oh, law school.

665
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,400
(He keeps his gaze low.)

666
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,270
You must have talked about
a lot of stuff with your friend.

667
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,770
You know, about the trip to Italy.

668
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,440
She didn't know about this show,
so she kept asking...

669
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,910
why I wouldn't go on a blind date.

670
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,710
(Laughing)

671
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,480
And...

672
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,250
(Thinking)

673
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:58,520
Have you gone on blind dates before?

674
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,390
- Blind dates?
- Yes.

675
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
- I have gone on blind dates.
- Have you?

676
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,760
- You haven't?
- I have.

677
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,160
But I'm not such a fan.

678
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,400
- Of blind dates?
- Yes.

679
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,770
I don't like how awkward it is.

680
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,780
Why is their conversation so out of tune?

681
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,910
(They keep failing
to understand each other.)

682
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,350
But it gets rarer to meet someone
organically.

683
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,550
Exactly.

684
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,420
Then, you should go on blind dates.

685
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,420
- If that's the case.
- Right.

686
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,690
If you think about it,
that's how we gathered here.

687
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,060
But doesn't it feel more natural...

688
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,630
now that we're living together?

689
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,100
- It does.
- Right?

690
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,730
I feel like I've already grown
attached to them.

691
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,600
Even now, we're eating outside,

692
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,310
- and I'm worried that they'll wait.
- That's true.

693
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,080
(Ji Min comes back home after work.)

694
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,550
Ji Min is home.

695
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,190
Really?

696
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,320
It can't be extended?

697
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,160
- Good evening.
- You're home earlier than I thought.

698
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,390
- Hi.
- I didn't know I'd come home so soon.

699
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,360
- Did you eat?
- No.

700
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,030
- Your eyes turned into vampire's eyes.
- They did.

701
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,330
- You must be tired.
- Did you cry?

702
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,500
Ha Neul is adorable.

703
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,270
- I didn't cry.
- Did you cry?

704
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,430
Maybe he did.

705
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,840
(He tastes Chang Hwan's food.)

706
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,670
- Did I pass? Did I?
- Gosh, it's so tasty.

707
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,710
It's even better than the last time.

708
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,840
- Now, I will...
- Did you add tuna too?

709
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,010
No. Just a few magical powders.

710
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,550
Gosh, it's so good. Seriously.

711
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,320
By the way, you got off work early.

712
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,190
Well, I didn't get off work early.

713
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,550
I hurried because I thought
everyone would be gathered together.

714
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,590
I should take some time tomorrow.

715
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,690
- It wasn't necessary today?
- Aren't we gathered right now?

716
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,990
- I know. Why aren't we included?
- What about us?

717
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,090
I thought everyone
would be eating together.

718
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,960
- Why did you leave us out?
- We were working so hard here.

719
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,160
- We worked on this.
- I'm a little upset.

720
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,700
Seriously. It makes me upset.

721
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,130
- Of course, I'm so thankful.
- Really.

722
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,070
I was walking on eggshells
when I left work.

723
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,170
- Were you?
- It made me feel uncomfortable.

724
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,540
Ha Neul is...

725
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,910
- One of my seniors...
- Did he do this? "I'm watching you."

726
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,880
He was joking, but he did this.

727
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,540
So I left like this.

728
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,610
- I'll go hang my jacket.
- Okay.

729
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,190
(He Neul is conscious of Ji Min.)

730
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,550
Today, we'll have some ducks.

731
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,030
We should make a salad too.
Since we have a lot.

732
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,990
We can make it easily just by cutting it.

733
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,000
- Let me use the bathroom.
- Good job.

734
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,730
(Touching her hair)

735
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,470
(She went to her room
instead of the bathroom.)

736
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,240
(She fixes her makeup in a hurry.)

737
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,470
There's a reason for this.

738
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,740
- Why is she doing that?
- To look pretty.

739
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,140
- She really is conscious of Ji Min a lot.
- Right.

740
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,090
(Woo Jae and Je Yeon are still eating.)

741
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,020
(Cold buckwheat noodles)

742
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,860
(Moving the bowl)

743
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,290
Try this too.

744
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,930
- Is it cold buckwheat noodles?
- Yes.

745
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,440
Cold buckwheat noodles and pork cutlets
go well together in summer.

746
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,280
(Savoring)

747
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,780
- It's good, right? Yes.
- This is better.

748
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,510
Have some more.

749
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,490
Thank you. We enjoyed it.

750
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,150
- We enjoyed it.
- Bye.

751
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,990
- I enjoyed it.
- Good.

752
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,890
Next time, it's on me.

753
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,930
Sounds good.

754
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Promise.

755
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,930
(They are on their way
to the Seoul Pairing House.)

756
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,400
- The food wasn't bad, right?
- It was tasty.

757
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,280
Next time, let's have something better.

758
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,280
So, you've been living in Seoul...

759
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,720
for ten years now?

760
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,620
(Nodding)

761
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,920
Then you came to Seoul earlier than I did.

762
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,130
You're a senior, then.

763
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
A senior Seoul citizen.

764
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,170
- That's true.
- The two have this young and fresh vibe.

765
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,140
Which neighborhood did you live in?

766
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,170
I stayed in Sinchon for most of the time.

767
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,470
You lived in that area.

768
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,110
If you like soccer,
the Seoul World Cup Stadium is...

769
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,280
I think I said this to you in Italy.

770
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,180
It felt like you were good at soccer.

771
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,490
- We talked about soccer, and...
- Right?

772
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,120
- Were you startled?
- Yes. It made me feel nervous.

773
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,660
I think I said, "I'm really good at it."

774
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,160
- Something like that.
- Right.

775
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,030
When did you come to Seoul?

776
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,200
- Maybe in 2016?
- In 2016?

777
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,730
I lived in Haebangchon, Huam-dong
for eight years.

778
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,800
In Seoul...

779
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,170
I lived in this area for most of the time
after coming to Seoul.

780
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,370
Yes, so...

781
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,910
For me,

782
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,180
Haebangchon feels like my hometown.

783
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,880
Another hometown, besides Busan.

784
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,890
I feel comfortable in this neighborhood.

785
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,620
Before coming to Seoul,
I thought Seoul would be...

786
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,430
a concrete jungle...

787
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,760
with heartless people.

788
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,230
A neighborhood with studio apartments.

789
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,170
You know, people from other regions
live in those places.

790
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,270
But this place, Haebangchon, feels warm.

791
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,140
There are many elderly people.

792
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,550
I can feel the warmth here.

793
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,020
- This place feels warm. So...
- Really?

794
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,280
I can enjoy the nature here too.

795
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,950
So it's a nice place for me in many ways.

796
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,290
- Instead of a complex neighborhood...
- Right.

797
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,230
So when we had to write down
the place we wanted to live in,

798
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,700
I wrote "Huam-dong" and "Buam-dong."

799
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,700
Right. He wrote them in his book.

800
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,880
So for me, living in Gangnam is...

801
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Right.

802
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,280
It sure feels different
compared to Gangnam.

803
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,850
People have different tastes, but...

804
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,100
She wrote "Jamsil."

805
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,560
So the two have different tastes.

806
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,570
(Their tastes didn't match.)

807
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,800
(Fidgeting)

808
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,970
(She couldn't talk for a while.)

809
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,340
Those two cars look cool.

810
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,880
(Woo Jae noticed the two cars.)

811
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,710
What's your dream car?

812
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,810
- My dream car?
- Yes.

813
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,580
Well...

814
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,850
(She shyly tells him her dream car.)

815
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,190
That's a nice car. It's cool.

816
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,860
Actually,

817
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,100
I wrote, "It depends on the situation."

818
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,910
That's what I'm like. I...

819
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,640
I take my situation into consideration...

820
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,550
- and live in accordance with it.
- I see.

821
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,850
Everyone would be the same, though.

822
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,160
Right. You wrote that
you were never luxurious.

823
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,260
Yes.

824
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,500
(I don't remember being luxurious.)

825
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,330
(He was never luxurious.)

826
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,430
(It depends on my situation.)

827
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,540
(Woo Jae wrote that 60,000 dollars
was the limit for a car.)

828
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,140
When I bought my car,

829
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,750
I chose the one that suited my situation,

830
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,650
and I'm riding it well even now.

831
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,620
(The atmosphere somehow became awkward.)

832
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,290
(Fidgeting)

833
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,930
You didn't finish unpacking your bags?

834
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,600
- I didn't even start it.
- I see.

835
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,270
I should finish it when I go back.

836
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,770
(They found out that they had
different tastes during the dinner date.)

837
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,940
Goodness. It made me feel sad.

838
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,440
- Gosh. I have no idea.
- I think...

839
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,750
The two looked good together,

840
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,250
and we could feel that
they had feelings for each other.

841
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,950
I think things got tangled at that point.

842
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,320
"What kind of work did you do today?"

843
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,190
"I conducted due diligence."

844
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,320
At that moment, I think Woo Jae thought...

845
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,790
he had nothing to say about that subject.

846
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,100
And Je Yeon was ready to talk about
the things she did.

847
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,830
But Woo Jae avoided the subject
he didn't know about.

848
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,270
Would it have been better this way?
If Woo Jae had said,

849
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,370
"I don't know about that field."

850
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,710
"What do you do
when you conduct due diligence?"

851
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,970
What if he said something like this?

852
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,440
- Yes. "What's due diligence?"
- Right. That would've been better.

853
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,610
- I would ask like this.
- I see. Right.

854
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,650
In the process of
getting to know each other,

855
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,050
- they would find something in common.
- Right.

856
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,920
I think Woo Jae is careful...

857
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,520
when he talks to Je Yeon.

858
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,960
I think Je Yeon liked Woo Jae...

859
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,460
because he seemed relaxed.

860
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,760
But he's losing that side of him.

861
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,330
Oh, right. That's true.

862
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
- I'll go get a chair.
- You...

863
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
- Here.
- You can sit here.

864
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,630
I'll sit over there.

865
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,670
(The House Trio is in the kitchen.)

866
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,740
- We mean nothing to you?
- Gosh, what are you saying?

867
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,570
I put in so much effort
to come home early.

868
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,870
Right. I thought you'd be home late,
but you came early.

869
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,080
It was because...

870
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,740
Since it was the first time
coming back from work,

871
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,010
I wanted to put some effort in
to come home early.

872
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,480
When did you go to work?

873
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,180
- When did I go to work?
- Yes.

874
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,650
I left late today. It was around...

875
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,190
Maybe around 7 a.m.?

876
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,820
You left late.

877
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,560
Yes. I just couldn't get up.

878
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,230
Does it take about an hour and a half?

879
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,160
One hour and thirty to forty minutes?

880
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,270
Do you pass... Is it around Pangyo?

881
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,430
No, I don't.

882
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,140
Because I take the highway.

883
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,710
Then where's your place?
Where do you live?

884
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,740
In Pangyo.

885
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,970
But I'm from Pohang.

886
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,080
- Do you live in Pangyo?
- Yes.

887
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,450
I'll be in Gyeonggi Province
around that area tomorrow...

888
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,420
and thought about picking you up.

889
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,750
- Gyeonggi Province?
- Yes.

890
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,690
I have to stop by my house.

891
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,890
You'll pick me up?

892
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,590
- Really?
- That was the idea.

893
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,760
- At what time?
- On her way back?

894
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,560
I thought I'd wait for you.

895
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,230
I'll be there anyway.

896
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,870
When will you get off work?

897
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,770
A little after 7 p.m.

898
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,840
When will you be done?

899
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,040
(Well...)

900
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,870
Tomorrow?

901
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,840
I was going to stay
until later in the night.

902
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,750
Oh, no.

903
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,550
- I'm not one to leave work early.
- They might think something's off.

904
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,180
I left the office
at 4:40 p.m. yesterday too.

905
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,950
- I see.
- They might think...

906
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,390
you're looking for another job.

907
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,390
That's possible.

908
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,520
- For some reason...
- Their paths won't align.

909
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,930
It's better to make good
on the hours one day...

910
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,860
- Yes, that's why.
- to make it easier on yourself.

911
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,930
And that's tomorrow.
I can't get off work early.

912
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
I see.

913
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,270
Work until 10 p.m. tomorrow...

914
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,400
Come on.

915
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,640
- We have a party on Friday.
- Right.

916
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,070
- So around 4 p.m...
- Should he leave early?

917
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,110
- Maybe around 2 p.m.
- That's right.

918
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,170
But that's...

919
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,840
- Have him work late hours.
- Leave at 2 p.m.

920
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,640
Yes.

921
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,020
They know how I usually work.

922
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
I see.

923
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,690
I can't act out of the ordinary.

924
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,590
- He turned her down in a way.
- He definitely rejected her.

925
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,430
(Maybe they'll carpool some other time.)

926
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,830
I'm done with that.

927
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,940
She suggested that they carpool
on the way back from work,

928
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
which was her asking him out.

929
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
Exactly.

930
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,070
It could've led to having dinner together.

931
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,110
However, I don't think Ha Neul...

932
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,280
will give up on Ji Min just yet.

933
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,480
Right.

934
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,950
Chan Hyeong's here.

935
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,250
(Around that time,
Chan Hyeong's back from work.)

936
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,190
Some rooms had it, and some rooms didn't.

937
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,320
- Product placement...
- Hey.

938
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,360
Hey.

939
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,790
- You're here.
- Hey.

940
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Have you had dinner?

941
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,600
- No, we were waiting.
- We're waiting for everyone.

942
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,970
He made kimchi stew.

943
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,130
Gosh, I'm sorry for getting here late.

944
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,140
It's all right.

945
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,100
Just hurry up and get changed.

946
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,570
- You're here.
- Good work.

947
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,380
- I'm finally here.
- That was out of the blue.

948
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,710
But how...

949
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,650
How did you make it here so early?

950
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,250
Why am I seeing a halo behind you?

951
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,150
- What...
- Seriously?

952
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,220
What's with him?

953
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,190
For dinner, we're having
kimchi stew and duck.

954
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,490
Duck?

955
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,990
Chang Hwan stocked the fridge for us...

956
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,060
- and brought his mom's kimchi.
- I even got us beer.

957
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,660
There's beer.

958
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
- Why don't we grill the duck meat?
- Smoked duck?

959
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,160
- Is it smoked duck?
- How about at 8 p.m.?

960
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,770
We should eat around 8 p.m.

961
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,870
Does everyone get home late?

962
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,070
- Je Yeon...
- Maybe not her.

963
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,000
Isn't Woo Jae...

964
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,400
Are the two on a date?

965
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,210
They must be eating together.

966
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,610
But what about Ji Won?

967
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
I meant...

968
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,380
- Je Yeon and Woo Jae.
- Right.

969
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,380
I see.

970
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,020
I think I saw them leave together
this morning.

971
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,450
- Are they on a date?
- He's conscious of them.

972
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,520
- Already?
- I see.

973
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,120
Cooking should be
the least of my concerns.

974
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,160
This isn't the time for me
to play the role of a maid.

975
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,630
- Cooking, and...
- I left this morning too,

976
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,830
but this is what I did
because I had nothing better to do.

977
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,030
Really?

978
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,340
- I'll grill these.
- Let's eat.

979
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,940
Let's just eat.

980
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,780
Ji Won's here.

981
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,350
Was she too sick to go to work today?

982
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,480
- She called in sick.
- Right.

983
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,920
She said she'd be calling in sick today.

984
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,420
- Really?
- It's too bad...

985
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,690
that she got sick as soon as she moved in.

986
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,390
- Hi, guys.
- You're here.

987
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,490
- You're here.
- Welcome.

988
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,290
- You're right on time.
- This is the perfect timing.

989
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,290
Really?

990
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,530
- Have you not eaten?
- We were just about to eat.

991
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,060
- We agreed on 7:30 p.m.
- Have you eaten?

992
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,400
Something came up at work.

993
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
- Have you eaten?
- You must be hungry.

994
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
I haven't eaten yet.

995
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,730
- Should we...
- You should go get changed...

996
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,670
- so that we can eat.
- Really...

997
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,670
She bowed to him.

998
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,710
Ji Won, why did you bow to him?

999
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,580
Why would you bow to him?

1000
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,180
- Scratch it with a fork.
- Je Yeon...

1001
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,410
and Woo Jae will get here later.

1002
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,810
Right.

1003
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,320
- That must be it.
- Exactly.

1004
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,850
I'm sure they agreed on that this morning.

1005
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,190
- On their way out?
- We left before they did.

1006
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,790
They also left together.

1007
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,290
- I see.
- Cooking should've been...

1008
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,430
the least of my concerns.

1009
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,990
I'm grateful, though.
You're looking out for us.

1010
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,000
Exactly.

1011
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,360
I'll make it up to you somehow.

1012
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,500
- I'll put this up there for now.
- Hey.

1013
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,370
- Later...
- Can you get me another bowl of rice?

1014
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,940
- Sure.
- We're five people now.

1015
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,670
Ji Won's getting the last portion of rice.

1016
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,740
You made the exact amount.

1017
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,610
I'm sorry.

1018
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,440
I'll do the dishes later.

1019
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,050
- We didn't do anything.
- It's fine.

1020
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,080
- Really?
- Yes.

1021
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,720
- It was all Chang Hwan.
- Chang Hwan cooked for us.

1022
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,750
- I'll do the dishes.
- It's fine.

1023
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,450
Please just enjoy.

1024
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,460
Were you able to rest a lot today?

1025
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,160
I actually had a busy day.

1026
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,730
- Really?
- I went grocery shopping...

1027
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,760
and played with my cats.

1028
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,800
You had a day even busier than mine.

1029
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,470
You were really busy.

1030
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,070
I found it.

1031
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,770
The kimchi stew is amazing.

1032
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,140
Really? Finally.

1033
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,340
- I added some magic powder.
- We're having...

1034
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,080
an authentic kimchi stew.

1035
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,450
It's never wise to get your hopes up,
though.

1036
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,210
Come on. This looks great.

1037
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,450
Maybe another one.

1038
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,350
One more would do.

1039
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,450
- I'd also like some.
- Isn't it too far away?

1040
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,630
Chang Hwan, thank you so much.

1041
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,160
- I made better use of my time.
- You're the best.

1042
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,600
Thanks to you...

1043
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,200
We'll cook together next time.

1044
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
(We'll cook together next time.)

1045
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,740
- I thought...
- The cucumber?

1046
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,770
- I love cucumbers.
- Should we try it?

1047
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,470
- I love cucumbers.
- I'll enjoy it.

1048
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,410
This is better than
anything I've ordered in.

1049
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,080
Really? I'll try even harder next time.

1050
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,090
This was made with aged kimchi.

1051
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,560
It's so good.

1052
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,160
- It's really good.
- Really?

1053
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,800
It's delicious.

1054
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,800
It's so good.

1055
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,170
(Munching)

1056
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,680
- It's like I gained a new family.
- I know.

1057
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,720
You come home,

1058
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,720
excited that someone is waiting for you.

1059
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,120
- That's part of the fun.
- Right.

1060
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,120
You're right.

1061
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,890
Meanwhile, I'm always here.

1062
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,530
It's like, "Mom, we're home!"

1063
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,600
It's delicious.

1064
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,500
I live alone,

1065
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,530
so I rarely cook.

1066
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,900
I order in all the time or eat out.

1067
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,110
(He's mindful of a certain someone.)

1068
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,740
I also had something to ask.

1069
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,680
Why octopus balls in particular?

1070
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,710
Oh, that.

1071
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,450
It's my way of giving myself some love.

1072
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:35,480
When I buy some and have them at home,

1073
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,120
- they couldn't taste any better.
- I totally get it.

1074
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,460
(Eating something delicious
makes her day.)

1075
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,690
It's really good.

1076
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,930
(That might be why
Chang Hwan cooked today.)

1077
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,930
It's good.

1078
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,170
(Glancing)

1079
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,570
(Savoring)

1080
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,110
(Smiling)

1081
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,510
This is insane.

1082
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,710
How is it?

1083
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,480
It's so good.

1084
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,120
You could sell this at a restaurant.

1085
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,220
It's really good.

1086
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,720
(Someone's compliment
sounds louder to him.)

1087
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,020
It'll be even better tomorrow.

1088
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,260
- Yes, after a day...
- It's even better the next day.

1089
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,960
(Savoring)

1090
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,470
When did you head to work this morning?

1091
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,040
In the morning?

1092
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,070
Around 8 a.m.

1093
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,510
I left at 7:40 a.m.

1094
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,310
- You left appropriately.
- Right.

1095
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,280
How many hours of sleep did you get?

1096
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,820
I doubt you got many hours in.

1097
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,190
- About four hours.
- Four?

1098
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,620
I know. Everyone's...

1099
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,420
- We're all powering through.
- Exactly.

1100
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,260
Chang Hwan, when do you fly out?

1101
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,000
- Next Tuesday?
- I fly next Tuesday...

1102
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,230
and in the week after that.

1103
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,040
- But it's not long-distance?
- No.

1104
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,640
- You'll be getting off work, right?
- Yes.

1105
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,040
Can't you give us a chance
to try what you do?

1106
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,080
What?

1107
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,750
There's a flight simulator
that's available.

1108
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,050
- Really?
- In Gimpo.

1109
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,410
It's run by another airline, but still.

1110
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,880
- Next time...
- You can take off and land the plane.

1111
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,890
- You can go there on your date.
- Take-off and landing.

1112
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,090
- Really?
- What?

1113
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,790
Take someone there on your next date.

1114
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,890
(He suddenly falls silent
at the sound of a date.)

1115
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,500
What should we do on Friday?

1116
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,010
- We're having a party.
- Right.

1117
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,240
Should I buy a cake?

1118
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,580
- Should I buy a cake?
- When?

1119
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,410
- On Friday.
- On Friday. For our party.

1120
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,650
Right, on Friday.

1121
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,550
Will there be others
going on a date that day?

1122
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,780
That might be true.

1123
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,620
- Why not take advantage of the weekend?
- Right.

1124
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,790
We shouldn't make plans just yet.

1125
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,330
- Some of us might be going on a date.
- Right.

1126
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,570
Is that so?

1127
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:14,480
(He sips cold water
rather than answering.)

1128
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,980
The cucumber's tasty.

1129
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,450
I should have more of the porridge.

1130
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,250
(Glancing)

1131
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,030
(The one she thought was her destiny...)

1132
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,400
(seems to be miles away for some reason.)

1133
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,080
Was it chilly outside?

1134
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,410
(Whenever she takes a step forward,)

1135
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,950
- Your nose is red again.
- Is my nose red?

1136
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,520
(he takes a step back.)

1137
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,750
We can guess the weather
depending on how Ji Won is.

1138
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,720
If her nose is red,
it means it's cold outside.

1139
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,890
(They want to reach each other,)

1140
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,960
(but they can't.)

1141
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,830
The dinner left them thinking
about a lot of things.

1142
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,170
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1143
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,940
This being water is killing the vibe.

1144
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,740
- I know.
- I should have a beer too.

1145
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,310
- Bottoms up once again?
- Yes.

1146
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,550
Everyone's there.

1147
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,350
- We...
- They're here.

1148
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,590
- They're here.
- Hey!

1149
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,290
- Unbelievable.
- Hey, there.

1150
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,790
- The slippers...
- Our slippers are gone.

1151
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,130
They're gone.

1152
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,900
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1153
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,660
They're huge.

1154
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,330
- What do you have in your hands?
- What did you two do?

1155
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,040
Look at Ji Min.

1156
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,440
"What did you two do?"

1157
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,470
- We had dinner.
- Join us.

1158
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,140
Go get changed first.

1159
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,980
- Change into something comfortable.
- Change first...

1160
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,710
- and then join us.
- Don't join us.

1161
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,920
Change into something comfortable.

1162
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,720
I should ask who suggested the date.

1163
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,820
- It could've been Je Yeon.
- Right.

1164
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,350
- She...
- Did she put her foot down?

1165
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,390
- "Do you want to go out with me or not?"
- You know,

1166
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,430
I see her differently,
now that I know she's a lawyer.

1167
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,360
What a relief.

1168
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,160
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

1169
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,730
What did you have for dinner?

1170
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,700
- Pork cutlet.
- Pork cutlet?

1171
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,930
Pork cutlet?

1172
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,570
Did you eat?

1173
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,340
We had the most delicious kimchi stew.

1174
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,810
Chang Hwan made kimchi stew,
and we left some for you.

1175
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,310
- Tomorrow morning...
- We should have it tomorrow.

1176
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,140
Have it for breakfast tomorrow.
It's delicious.

1177
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,550
We got off work...

1178
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,880
around the same time, so I picked her up.

1179
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,850
We then had dinner.

1180
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,720
- It was planned since this morning.
- We waited for you.

1181
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,290
- Exactly. We waited for you.
- Really?

1182
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,420
But you were running late.

1183
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,690
When did you have dinner?

1184
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,890
At 8 p.m.

1185
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,260
He keeps touching his glasses
because he feels bad.

1186
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,700
What did you have?

1187
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,470
We had pork cutlet and buckwheat noodles.

1188
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,900
- Buckwheat noodles?
- Yes, buckwheat noodles.

1189
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
- Where did you go?
- A restaurant in Gwanghwamun.

1190
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,370
- That place is delicious.
- Right.

1191
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,470
- It must be famous.
- That's where we went.

1192
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,710
Ji Min's feeling bitter.

1193
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,380
We'll have to cook dinner tomorrow, right?

1194
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,850
He can't always cook for us,
so we should take turns.

1195
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,550
I actually like cooking for others.

1196
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,190
- I want to cook for you guys too.
- Right.

1197
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,650
We should decide...

1198
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,590
who will cook on which day.

1199
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,390
I'll cook this Saturday, then.

1200
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,360
- Saturday lunch?
- What if we all have dates?

1201
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,800
- He can eat alone.
- It'll all be for me.

1202
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,270
- "I eat alone."
- Is this "Home Alone?"

1203
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,370
I'm sleepy.

1204
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,940
(Joking)

1205
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,010
I'll cook dinner tomorrow.

1206
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,310
She'll cook dinner tomorrow.

1207
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,510
I won't be here, so it's a bummer.

1208
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,880
- What will you cook?
- What will you cook?

1209
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,250
What should I cook?

1210
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,520
Name it.

1211
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,750
- I see.
- She's confident.

1212
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,520
Why isn't she like the person
I met in Italy?

1213
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,790
She's not the same person.

1214
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,660
- Can you make kkanpunggi?
- I can look up the recipe on my phone.

1215
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,130
Ji Min's head over heels about her.

1216
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Is there anything you'd like...

1217
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,400
to eat?

1218
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,670
Jjamppong.

1219
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,000
Jjamppong?

1220
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,600
- Unbelievable.
- Ji Min, come on.

1221
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,870
What's the matter with you?

1222
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,640
Meal kits could solve that problem.

1223
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,910
I'm sure they have things
like jjamppong with soft tofu.

1224
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,180
I wanted to tease her, that's all.

1225
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,080
- Ji Min's humorous.
- I know.

1226
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,690
- Goodness.
- They can't hide...

1227
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,790
their bitter expressions.

1228
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,490
(Second day in Korea)

1229
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,930
(Looking back on today,)

1230
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:36,070
(who left the best impression?)

1231
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,380
(Who chose whom to text today?)

1232
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,680
I'm curious.

1233
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,610
I'm no longer bothered by
not receiving any texts.

1234
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,380
I don't get my hopes up anymore.

1235
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,880
Same here.

1236
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,460
My head hurts.

1237
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,160
I can understand why.

1238
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,060
(Pondering)

1239
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,430
I'm finding it tough today...

1240
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,870
- to choose.
- What?

1241
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,800
Can't you tell me
the people you have in mind?

1242
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,310
(Well...)

1243
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,480
The tension is different
from what we experienced in Italy.

1244
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,080
Won't things change more...

1245
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,520
- once that important moment draws nearer?
- You're right.

1246
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,490
I can't tell who Ji Min...

1247
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,620
wants to go on a date with.

1248
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,120
- Really?
- Yes.

1249
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,930
- That's dumb of him.
- How could he not know?

1250
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,030
- They must not be able to tell.
- Really?

1251
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,030
He got good grades in school,
but failed at taking a hint.

1252
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,700
- You're right.
- Right?

1253
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,700
I also want to know...

1254
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,340
who Ji Min's interested in.

1255
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,890
"We didn't get to spend
a lot of time together today."

1256
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,120
(From Ji Min: We didn't get to spend
a lot of time together today.)

1257
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,160
(I hope that changes tomorrow.)

1258
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,500
(From Je Yeon: It was a long day today.)

1259
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,130
(I wish you a good day tomorrow!)

1260
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,700
(From Ha Neul: I loved
our relaxing conversation today!)

1261
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,570
(Thank you for being nice to me.)

1262
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,410
(From Chan Hyeong:
Here's to another long day.)

1263
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,350
(Get a good night's rest
and sweet dreams.)

1264
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:30,890
(From Chae Eun:
I appreciate your concern.)

1265
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,500
(From Ji Won: Please make
kimchi stew again and again!)

1266
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,930
This is tough.

1267
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,070
(From Ji Won: Please make
kimchi stew again and again!)

1268
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,580
(From Woo Jae: Sleep warmly tonight!
I had another great day.)

1269
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,280
Oh, no.

1270
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,990
(Today's texts were all delivered.)

1271
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,720
She didn't receive a text.

1272
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,290
- No one sent Ji Won a text.
- The text she sent today was,

1273
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:12,660
"Please make kimchi stew..."

1274
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,230
- "again and again."
- Tell me about it.

1275
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,960
There isn't enough time
to also take detours.

1276
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,640
She appears to be upset by this.

1277
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,110
(From Chang Hwan:
With you, I become positive.)

1278
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,270
Oh, no.

1279
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,710
(Chang Hwan sent a message
to someone else.)

1280
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
This is hard.

1281
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,860
We have to send a message every day.

1282
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,900
Some of us might go on a date that day.

1283
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,730
(Chang Hwan was deep in thought
throughout the day.)

1284
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,470
(Getting in the way
of his feelings toward Ji Won...)

1285
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,840
(is an unexpected variable)

1286
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,880
I felt very worried at that moment.

1287
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,480
(He's worried more than anything.)

1288
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,080
I didn't expect such a young age.

1289
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,630
I don't think it's a question of interest.

1290
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,500
It's much bigger than that.

1291
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,940
We were probably both surprised.

1292
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,440
I'm sure that Ji Won also has a lot
on her mind.

1293
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,080
I should take one step back.

1294
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,150
Being considerate of her that way
would make her...

1295
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,460
feel more comfortable.

1296
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,360
I tried to appease myself.

1297
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,260
(Appeasing himself)

1298
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,400
(He decided to think of her
before himself.)

1299
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,710
Gosh.

1300
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,940
(The air got heavy
with each of their concerns.)

1301
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,010
Right.

1302
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,150
You...

1303
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,350
- Gosh.
- That's for me.

1304
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,050
You said that
you wouldn't take it seriously.

1305
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,390
(Smiling)

1306
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,620
All messages have been delivered today.

1307
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,020
Goodness.

1308
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,060
(In despair)

1309
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,960
- He's so cute.
- I love Ji Min.

1310
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,300
- That was cute.
- No way.

1311
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,570
Oh, no.

1312
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,370
- He's amazing.
- Oh, no.

1313
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,010
- I like Ji Min so much.
- Me too.

1314
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,670
Seriously, he's amazing.

1315
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,340
(Embarrassed)

1316
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,340
Ji Min is so great.

1317
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
Seriously?

1318
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
Yes.

1319
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,820
"Today's texts were all delivered."

1320
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,820
(He checks it again.)

1321
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,890
- This is so embarrassing.
- A moment ago,

1322
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,160
you said, "I'm not going to care anymore."

1323
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,830
As soon as you heard...

1324
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,860
(Flopping down)

1325
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,530
I'm not hurt.

1326
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,340
The look on your face says otherwise.

1327
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,040
You collapsed while throwing your phone.

1328
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,310
- That's funny.
- It could happen.

1329
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,780
- I like Ji Min so much.
- Right.

1330
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,080
I should've come home early tomorrow
instead of today.

1331
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,090
I'll think about what to wear tomorrow.

1332
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,720
That's the right thing to do.

1333
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,860
(The phone beeps again.)

1334
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,000
You have a message.

1335
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,170
If it's the same message...

1336
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,100
(Nervous)

1337
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,510
It's not it.

1338
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,310
What message would we get at this hour?

1339
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,680
They sent us a rule. Take a look.

1340
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,320
- What's this?
- What does it mean?

1341
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,390
What does it mean?

1342
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,350
Does it make sense?

1343
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,290
What? You probably got a text.

1344
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,390
(It's been a week on Heart Pairing.)

1345
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,700
(Is there anyone you're interested in?)

1346
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,370
(Think of two people you want to get
to know seriously by tomorrow.)

1347
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:15,240
(You can be in a contract relationship
with 1 of them for 3 days.)

1348
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,410
(Contract relationship period:
From December 13 to December 15)

1349
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,070
They can be in a contract relationship.

1350
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:22,480
(The residents will be in a 3-day contract
relationship with whom they match.)

1351
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,880
(The pair
in a contract relationship can send...)

1352
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,980
(private messages to each other
for 3 days.)

1353
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,220
(Their relationships will be renewed.)

1354
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,220
Hi.

1355
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:37,020
(The time to take one step closer
to each other's heart)

1356
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,630
(Having a relationship for 3 days)

1357
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,230
(How will it change them?)

1358
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,100
- What?
- This is Heart Pairing.

1359
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,470
A new rule has been revealed.

1360
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,570
The residents'
contract relationships will begin.

1361
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,310
- They will become couples.
- It's intense.

1362
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,370
They will be in exclusive relationships...

1363
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,610
- for three days.
- That's right.

1364
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,880
They can't approach
someone else's girlfriend...

1365
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,310
- or boyfriend.
- Exactly.

1366
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,920
- Gosh, this is...
- They'll focus on 1 person for 3 days.

1367
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,680
This will definitely shake things up.

1368
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,650
A contract relationship?

1369
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,320
What does it mean?

1370
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,760
We'll be in a relationship
with 1 person for 3 days?

1371
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,960
- We'll be their boyfriend.
- We'll be their significant other...

1372
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,270
under a contract.

1373
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,870
We'll truly get to spend the weekend
with one person.

1374
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,380
We get to concentrate on that person...

1375
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,940
- Right.
- and choose an itinerary for the date.

1376
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,510
Our mindset could be different.

1377
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,710
It will be different.

1378
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,950
- Now, we're careful around each other.
- Right.

1379
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,350
What about you?

1380
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:40,090
Who do you have in mind?

1381
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,620
Who's on my mind now?

1382
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,160
I've been seeing...

1383
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,670
- Je Yeon only.
- Right.

1384
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,070
- That's true.
- But we haven't had...

1385
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,110
many deep conversations yet.

1386
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,710
Just once, while driving to Florence,

1387
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:07,920
I talked to Ji Won in the car
for 30 minutes.

1388
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,620
- That's short.
- That was all.

1389
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,120
I spent the rest of the time with Je Yeon.

1390
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,360
But...

1391
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,260
I still don't know much...

1392
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,530
- about other women.
- Right.

1393
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:22,830
What about Ji Min?

1394
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:26,170
Didn't he go out with more women?

1395
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,440
He went out with Ha Neul on the last day.
Before that...

1396
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,440
- Ha Neul, Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

1397
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,610
Did he go out with Ji Won too?

1398
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,280
Yes, on the first day.

1399
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,680
Ji Min went out with many people.

1400
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,190
This is interesting.

1401
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
If I had been younger,
I wouldn't even have thought about it.

1402
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,860
I would've picked Je Yeon and Ha Neul.

1403
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,500
I know very well that
I won't be matched with Je Yeon.

1404
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,170
- Why not?
- It's already so obvious.

1405
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,900
I know very well that we won't be matched.

1406
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,570
You should still try.

1407
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,980
It scares me a little.

1408
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,510
Don't put all the eggs in one basket.

1409
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,480
That's not what I think.

1410
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,380
I won't change my mind.

1411
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,950
Je Yeon is my type.

1412
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,590
She's the best match for me.

1413
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:23,060
As the person I want to marry
or be in a relationship with,

1414
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,890
Je Yeon is the best fit.

1415
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:29,560
However,
if I spend some time with Ha Neul,

1416
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,900
I might be able...

1417
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,740
to think differently.

1418
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,240
- That's all the more reason to pick her.
- I don't want to create that situation.

1419
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,710
- He's sincere about her.
- Right.

1420
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,180
Ji Min is a real man.

1421
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,150
Asserting could be dangerous.

1422
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,280
- I'm not asserting it.
- I get that she's your type.

1423
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,780
I just think...

1424
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,250
that dedicating all my time
to her won't be enough.

1425
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,020
Even if I dedicate all my time,
I won't end up with Je Yeon.

1426
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,790
I know who my ideal type is.

1427
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,530
He's amazing.

1428
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:00,590
That's why picking my number two...

1429
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,500
- Yes, that's the problem.
- Picking her as my number two...

1430
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,600
could be rude.

1431
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,170
That's not being rude.

1432
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,540
You shouldn't feel so pressured
about picking her as number two.

1433
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,840
Ji Min is a good guy.

1434
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,170
He's a good person.

1435
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,710
I think I made up my mind.

1436
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,510
- Who?
- I decided after talking with you.

1437
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,720
- You made a decision?
- I think so.

1438
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,150
Could it be Ha Neul?

1439
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,850
(They have a lot on their mind
about the contract relationship.)

1440
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:28,320
(Chan Hyeong and Woo Jae are moving
a mattress for Chae Eun and Ha Neul.)

1441
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,690
- I...
- That's good.

1442
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,790
Which way should I go?

1443
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,230
Go straight.

1444
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,230
- Yes.
- They're moving a mattress for them.

1445
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,570
I can't see where I'm going.

1446
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,000
- Like this?
- Yes.

1447
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,240
- It's done.
- It fits perfectly.

1448
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,170
(Their temporary moving is over.)

1449
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,340
This is even better.

1450
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,170
- Bye.
- Rest up.

1451
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,040
Thank you.

1452
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,050
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

1453
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,380
Don't mention it.

1454
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,980
(Ji Won follows them.)

1455
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,250
Chan Hyeong.

1456
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,420
Where will you get off work tomorrow?

1457
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,520
Me? In Gongdeok.

1458
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,360
What time do you get off work?

1459
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,290
I get off at 10 p.m. How about you?

1460
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,860
At 8:30 p.m.?

1461
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,300
I can get off then.

1462
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,330
- Really?
- Yes.

1463
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,530
I can speed up the meeting.

1464
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,600
At Gongdeok Station at 8:30 p.m.?

1465
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,200
At Gongdeok Station at 8:30 p.m.?

1466
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,340
- See you tomorrow.
- We'll get off work together.

1467
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,340
Get some rest.

1468
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,380
Ji Won and Chan Hyeong?

1469
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,680
(Instead of going to his room,
Chan Hyeong heads somewhere else.)

1470
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,950
I brought a humidifier.

1471
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,250
- Really?
- It's in my car.

1472
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,420
- It's in your car?
- Really?

1473
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,790
(He remembers to bring the humidifier
from his car.)

1474
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:33,890
Who is it for?

1475
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,720
(Meticulous)

1476
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,600
(Hesitant)

1477
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,230
(He writes a note to Chae Eun who's sick.)

1478
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,570
- He's even writing a note.
- Everyone is...

1479
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
He's so sweet.

1480
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,740
He's a doctor.
He brought some nutritional supplements.

1481
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,740
Right.

1482
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,350
(Knocking)

1483
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,010
- What?
- Excuse me, Chae Eun.

1484
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,850
- I'll leave the humidifier.
- What?

1485
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,420
I'll leave the humidifier.

1486
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,850
- The humidifier.
- The humidifier?

1487
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,560
Yes, it's very dry.

1488
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,160
- Really?
- I brought it from home.

1489
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,300
I'll just leave it here.

1490
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,800
It'll be working soon. Get some rest.

1491
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,330
Thank you.

1492
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,600
(Moved)

1493
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,040
I'll leave this here. Get some rest.

1494
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,770
Thank you.

1495
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,140
Goodness.

1496
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:34,110
(Getting up quietly
after Chan Hyeong left)

1497
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:39,220
(She finds his note.)

1498
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,890
(Rest well and get better soon!)

1499
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,160
(Let's have good times together soon.)

1500
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,960
"Let's have good times together soon."

1501
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,600
(Chan Hyeong's note from the heart
makes her feel warm inside.)

1502
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,570
(Touching)

1503
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,170
- She seems very moved.
- Yes.

1504
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,500
(Touching)

1505
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,770
(She leaves the nutritional supplements
carefully by her bed.)

1506
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:02,580
(She goes back to sleep.)

1507
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,580
Gosh.

1508
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,550
(The day with so many emotions passes by.)

1509
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,250
This episode has been intense.

1510
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,560
Based on what we've seen,

1511
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,760
Chang Hwan didn't send...

1512
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,330
- a message to Ji Won.
- Exactly.

1513
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,360
About that, I felt...

1514
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,260
- Ji Won sent one to him.
- Exactly.

1515
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,260
- Ji Won didn't look so happy.
- Exactly.

1516
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,300
(Ji Won's somber look)

1517
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,270
Then Ji Won suggested carpooling
with Chan Hyeong.

1518
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,570
- That's what happened.
- Yes.

1519
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,770
I understand how Chang Hwan feels.

1520
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:32,770
- Me too.
- Right.

1521
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,110
"I shouldn't approach her."

1522
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,180
After seeing the message from Ji Won,

1523
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,220
he probably thought,
"This is hard. What should I do?"

1524
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,550
Because he's suppressing his feelings
for Ji Won,

1525
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,690
- he sent a message to Ha Neul.
- I think so too.

1526
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,790
Didn't you become fond of Ji Min
all of a sudden?

1527
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,030
I love him.

1528
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:54,060
Our prediction
about Ji Min's feelings was right.

1529
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,830
- Seriously.
- Ji Min just wanted...

1530
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,830
to be clear.

1531
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,970
- He doesn't dislike Ha Neul.
- Right.

1532
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,470
- However...
- He feels bad about it.

1533
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,200
Ji Min knows that it won't work out,
but what else can he do?

1534
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,410
He's only interested in Je Yeon.

1535
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,040
- Isn't he great?
- He's amazing.

1536
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,440
He knows that he'll be destroyed,

1537
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,310
- but he's going for it anyway.
- Right.

1538
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,950
He thinks that picking someone else
as his number two...

1539
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,280
- is impolite.
- It's not polite.

1540
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,580
- Right.
- Ji Min's feelings for her will make...

1541
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,320
Je Yeon turn around and look at him.

1542
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,820
After seeing her date with Woo Jae today,

1543
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,590
I thought that she could choose Ji Min.

1544
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,060
- Me too.
- Yes.

1545
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,660
Isn't it time for her...

1546
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,960
to get to know Ji Min better?

1547
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,200
Our first pairs are starting to break up.

1548
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,670
Right. There will be a tectonic change.

1549
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:34,870
Will our intuition be correct?

1550
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,770
Let's keep watching.

1551
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,180
- Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon will be cooking today.

1552
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,020
(Je Yeon is looking up recipes.)

1553
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,950
Where's Chae Eun?

1554
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,620
- She's sick.
- Right.

1555
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,650
She has the flu.

1556
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,960
(Je Yeon was worried about Chae Eun...)

1557
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,860
(who caught the flu.)

1558
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,660
(Thinking)

1559
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,760
Oh, no.

1560
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,700
(She makes egg porridge
for Chae Eun who's sick.)

1561
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,940
(Startled)

1562
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,270
She doesn't seem experienced.

1563
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,510
Gosh.

1564
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,040
(In fact,
Je Yeon is a beginner in cooking.)

1565
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,940
(Her shabby cooking skills are obvious.)

1566
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,380
That's cute.

1567
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:32,690
(She can't take her eyes off
of the recipe.)

1568
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,170
(Focused)

1569
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,170
She's cute.

1570
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,670
(Squeezing)

1571
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,120
(She's clumsy,
but she tries hard to make it.)

1572
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,050
(Surprised)

1573
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,090
What are you doing, Je Yeon?

1574
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,190
I'm making you porridge.

1575
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,220
Really?

1576
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,160
There's a porridge that's already made.

1577
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,630
There is? I didn't see it.

1578
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,660
This.

1579
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,000
- Oh, no.
- Ha Neul made it yesterday.

1580
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,130
- Is it porridge?
- Yes.

1581
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,130
She said that it's egg porridge.

1582
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,800
I was also making egg porridge.

1583
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,940
- Really?
- Yes.

1584
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,870
I'll eat yours first.

1585
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,810
It looks quite good.

1586
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:24,810
I see.

1587
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,550
(Je Yeon's first egg porridge)

1588
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,080
Do you like eggs?

1589
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,120
I love eggs.

1590
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,290
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

1591
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,320
- I used two eggs.
- I see.

1592
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,120
I think there's too much egg...

1593
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,230
compared to the rice.

1594
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,900
I'll bring it to your room.

1595
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,730
- I'll take...
- No, I'll do it.

1596
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,300
You're sick. Let's go.

1597
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,440
Goodness.

1598
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,840
Enjoy it. See you later.

1599
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,180
Let's go to the hospital together.

1600
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,480
(Eating)

1601
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,150
(Eating)

1602
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,860
Je Yeon has a warm heart.

1603
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,790
She's kind.

1604
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,890
She takes care of Chae Eun meticulously.

1605
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,530
She's the type that everyone loves.

1606
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,430
We get to see new sides...

1607
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,830
- of her today.
- Yes.

1608
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,740
Go and rest in your room.

1609
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,240
Did it taste okay?

1610
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,340
Yes, the egg porridge was very good.

1611
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,810
- Really?
- I like eggs very much.

1612
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,080
I'm glad to hear that.

1613
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:32,080
When I was eating it, I thought,
"It tastes better than I thought."

1614
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,350
That's cute.

1615
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,120
That's a relief.

1616
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,750
She feels proud of it.

1617
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,920
(After sending Chae Eun to her room)

1618
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,420
Goodness.

1619
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,620
- Gosh.
- She's being the mom today.

1620
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,630
Yes.

1621
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,360
(She goes to the hospital with Chae Eun.)

1622
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,860
She's like the eldest sister.

1623
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,770
Je Yeon isn't feeling well either.

1624
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,650
(Woo Jae comes back after his daily work.)

1625
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,820
Woo Jae is back.

1626
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,190
Tomatoes.

1627
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,720
Let's buy pretty ones.

1628
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,860
Chang Hwan is helping out.

1629
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,790
- With colors.
- The ones with colors.

1630
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,790
- There's rice cake.
- Rice cake.

1631
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:26,500
(Woo Jae is absorbed in his work
alone at home.)

1632
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,080
(Meanwhile, Ha Neul also returns.)

1633
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,510
Ha Neul is back.

1634
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,750
Chang Hwan.

1635
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,690
Who is it? Welcome.

1636
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,460
- Did you get groceries?
- Yes.

1637
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

1638
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,530
You got here early.

1639
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,860
I got here 30 minutes ago.

1640
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,930
- Thirty minutes ago?
- Yes.

1641
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,060
What have you been doing?

1642
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:00,270
I was reviewing meeting notes
in the living room.

1643
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,900
Are you alone or is someone else here?

1644
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,240
Someone went upstairs,
but I didn't catch who it was.

1645
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,540
- Hi.
- So it was Ha Neul.

1646
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,280
Two people were startled.

1647
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,180
I didn't get startled. Did you?

1648
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,720
I almost twisted my ankle.

1649
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,720
(Thinking)

1650
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,620
- Let's start.
- Did you go grocery shopping again?

1651
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,890
It's for today's dinner.

1652
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,690
What's more dinner today?

1653
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,420
It's dumpling soup with rice cakes.

1654
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,190
- I was actually craving tteokguk.
- Really?

1655
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,330
Great.

1656
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,330
You bought quite some stuff.

1657
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:32,770
- We bought a lot.
- It's for all of us.

1658
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,940
Dinner is at 8 p.m., right?

1659
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,140
- What time is it, Je Yeon?
- It's 7:16 p.m.

1660
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,210
- We should cook.
- Yes, we should.

1661
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,680
- I don't think...
- Quite a few people will eat.

1662
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,850
we'll even have seven people.

1663
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,880
From what I heard yesterday,

1664
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,080
Ji Won and Chan Hyeong
were coming together.

1665
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,250
- Then...
- The two won't join us.

1666
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,420
Five people?

1667
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,260
The rest might have dinner outside.

1668
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,160
Probably.

1669
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,630
Je Yeon.
You felt the pressure today, didn't you?

1670
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,260
- You felt the pressure, right?
- Today?

1671
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,530
Making dinner.

1672
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,370
- Why did you volunteer to do it?
- Sorry?

1673
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,570
Why did you volunteer?

1674
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,540
- I'm cooking all day today.
- Exactly.

1675
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,110
I cooked egg porridge for Chae Eun
during lunch.

1676
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,940
(Boasting)

1677
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,710
She's boasting about it.

1678
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:19,710
(Good job, Je Yeon.)

1679
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,580
- This will be great with kimchi.
- Kimchi?

1680
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,450
There's dried seaweed.
How about we cut some up on top?

1681
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,020
What?

1682
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:34,860
(Ji Min arrives at 8 p.m.)

1683
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,700
(He joins them in the kitchen right away.)

1684
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,200
- He's here.
- He's here.

1685
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,370
You're not late.

1686
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,840
- I'm actually back late.
- Really?

1687
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,570
Tomorrow?

1688
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,410
I was going to stay
until later in the night.

1689
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,750
(Glancing)

1690
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,420
Really? Oh, no.

1691
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,020
What did you make today?

1692
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,390
Dumpling soup with rice cakes.

1693
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,250
- Sounds good, right?
- How witty of you.

1694
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,220
Is there something I can help with?

1695
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,330
Dumpling soup with rice cakes.

1696
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,100
It's nice when it's made
with beef bone broth.

1697
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,230
- It's beef bone broth.
- Is it?

1698
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,630
You already know what's good.

1699
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,200
- This one.
- Yes, this is the one.

1700
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,970
Anything turns out great
if you use this broth.

1701
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,840
It's boiling right now. So...

1702
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,020
But why tteokguk out of the blue?

1703
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,180
He's helping her.

1704
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,450
- I wanted warm soup since it's cold.
- Is that so?

1705
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,050
And Chae Eun isn't feeling well.

1706
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,890
You're right. Is she still in bed?

1707
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,820
- She's still sleeping.
- Still?

1708
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,960
- Did she go to a hospital?
- Yes, she did.

1709
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,660
We went together.

1710
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,130
You're good with the knife.

1711
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,400
- I am?
- You are.

1712
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,370
You're good at cutting it sideways.

1713
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,340
- Don't look at me.
- Okay.

1714
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,580
What did you do during the day?

1715
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,710
Did you work?

1716
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:00,350
I was with Chae Eun.

1717
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,380
- I cooked lunch for Chae Eun.
- Did you eat together?

1718
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,890
I made egg porridge
and then went to the hospital with her.

1719
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,890
- So she did wake up for a bit.
- Yes.

1720
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,990
It smells good.

1721
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,130
I'm going to change into
comfortable clothes.

1722
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,040
I checked if the rice was done.

1723
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,740
(Looking far away)

1724
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,510
(There's an awkwardness between them.)

1725
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,880
She's become stiff.

1726
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,180
Ha Neul's not in a good mood.

1727
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,390
(Blinking)

1728
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,520
(Turning)

1729
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,860
I don't think it's necessary
with the large amount of mushrooms.

1730
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,330
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1731
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,300
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1732
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,840
It's good.

1733
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,140
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

1734
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
- I'm relieved.
- You're good.

1735
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,170
You're a pro at boiling beef bone soup.

1736
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,780
- It's really good.
- Really?

1737
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,110
How did you make the broth? It's amazing.

1738
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,350
It's a secret.

1739
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,320
If we're here for a while, can you
make tteokguk at the year's end?

1740
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,750
- Sure. Anytime.
- Aren't we here until January 1?

1741
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,760
January 1? On New Year's Day?

1742
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,490
- Are we?
- It's a wish.

1743
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,000
It's good.

1744
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,370
What time did your work end in Suwon?

1745
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,800
When I came back,
it was a little over 7 p.m.

1746
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,810
Thank goodness you didn't wait for me.

1747
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:35,110
I left work at around 6 p.m.

1748
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,310
Had you waited for me,
we would've arrived now.

1749
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:38,780
If it weren't for the bus-only lane.

1750
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,320
(Heartbroken)

1751
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,720
It's quite clear that
Ha Neul has feelings for him.

1752
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,060
She's trying to look aloof on purpose.

1753
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,530
(You're right.)

1754
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,760
But it's not going well.

1755
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,160
(She feels bad for her.)

1756
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,630
Is today Ji Won and Chan Hyeong's day?

1757
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,170
It's happening to each couple.

1758
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,600
Or is today Day Two?

1759
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,240
Are they getting off work late?

1760
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,340
Are they returning in the same car?

1761
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,110
Ji Won asked Chan Hyeong to pick her up...

1762
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,240
somewhere.

1763
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:13,110
Chang Hwan needs to become wary.

1764
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,480
(Meanwhile, Ji Won has gotten off work.)

1765
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,350
- Their story has piqued my interest.
- Right?

1766
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,720
The two aren't the couple we imagined.

1767
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,820
- No.
- For real.

1768
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,160
Little did I think we'd meet here.

1769
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,230
When did you get off work?

1770
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:30,200
Actually, I just got off work.

1771
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,400
- Really?
- Meetings kept me at work.

1772
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,600
Great work.

1773
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,730
Thank you.

1774
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,500
(The previous night)

1775
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,170
Chan Hyeong.
Where will you get off work tomorrow?

1776
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,880
- Me? In Gongdeok.
- Gongdeok?

1777
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,110
Gongdeok.

1778
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,110
What time do you get off work?

1779
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,180
I get off at 10 p.m.

1780
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,420
- At 10 p.m.?
- Yes.

1781
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,620
That's quite late.

1782
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,790
What about you?

1783
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,920
I was thinking...

1784
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,230
about 8:30 p.m.

1785
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:01,060
(Chan Hyeong and Ji Won
made plans after work.)

1786
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,660
I know a place nearby.

1787
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,470
- Are you fine with Western cuisine?
- Yes.

1788
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,370
- This place is pretty.
- Right?

1789
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,000
Let's order first.

1790
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,440
(Their first date alone)

1791
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,770
- A place like this is better for talking.
- True.

1792
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,040
When we were in Italy,

1793
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,280
we talked when it was the three of us...

1794
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,320
- with Ha Neul.
- Yes.

1795
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:26,090
- I always wanted to talk to you,
- Right.

1796
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,850
- but I had no opportunity.
- Really?

1797
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:31,090
We revealed our jobs and ages, right?

1798
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,590
Did your image of anyone
change after that?

1799
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,960
- The image?
- Yes.

1800
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,600
(Curious)

1801
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,700
The one with the biggest change...

1802
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,140
(Thinking)

1803
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,940
was Chang Hwan.

1804
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,880
It's just that...

1805
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,050
his job was unpredictable.

1806
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,280
Totally.

1807
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,780
I was surprised by it.

1808
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:02,220
(Ji Won received a text from Chang Hwan
on the introduction day.)

1809
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,090
It was really interesting.

1810
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,930
I couldn't guess anyone's job.

1811
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:10,500
- What made you think he was a pilot?
- I know.

1812
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,230
- It gave me goosebumps.
- He suddenly looked like a pilot.

1813
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,840
- But the moment you brought up a pilot,
- It was sudden.

1814
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,870
- he did look like one.
- He looked like a pilot.

1815
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,940
(Laughing)

1816
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,410
That was...

1817
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,710
Really.

1818
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,410
- Seriously.
- Even I think...

1819
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,520
The information fell into place,
like how he's a light sleeper...

1820
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,580
and can't sleep much.

1821
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,650
- He had the perfect image of a pilot.
- Right.

1822
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,160
It gave me goosebumps.

1823
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,360
- And you were right.
- Exactly.

1824
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:44,560
- It's really interesting.
- Right?

1825
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,000
Do I treat you like an elder?

1826
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,100
You're so cute.

1827
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,770
(Laughing)

1828
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,140
This is so...

1829
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,340
You can call me whatever you like.

1830
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,650
How adorable.

1831
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,950
I think so.

1832
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,320
You must've been surprised
when he revealed his age.

1833
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,560
But...

1834
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,090
I don't want anyone
to distance themselves...

1835
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:16,300
because of the age difference.

1836
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,530
- But he didn't look his age.
- No.

1837
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,600
I think that's why...

1838
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,470
- we were given some time in Italy.
- I agree with you.

1839
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:24,540
Had we known how old we all were,

1840
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,040
age would've been...

1841
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,510
the first topic of our dates,

1842
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:29,840
saying, "Are you okay with the age gap?"

1843
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,380
With that, we would've been more careful.

1844
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,010
- Right.
- But we spent time...

1845
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:36,450
without knowing our ages.

1846
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,390
Although we now know.

1847
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
Exactly.

1848
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,460
- The two look good together.
- Right?

1849
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,060
Anyway, you are...

1850
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,800
the youngest among us.

1851
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,540
Do you have thoughts of marriage?

1852
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,170
Like when you want to get married.

1853
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,470
As for me,

1854
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,180
this has never changed since I was little.

1855
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:06,050
I've always thought the faster
I meet my spouse, the better.

1856
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:10,120
I have no intention
of getting married late.

1857
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,120
What do you think is the ideal age?

1858
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,990
My late 20s.

1859
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,120
But to make it happen,
I have to start preparing now.

1860
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,990
You can't delay it any longer.

1861
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,030
Exactly.

1862
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:24,260
But I can't even guess...

1863
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,970
when I'll be able to get married.

1864
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:30,340
What about you? Did you want
to get married at a certain age?

1865
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,070
Like you, it was my late 20s.

1866
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,270
He missed it.

1867
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:35,610
I wanted to in my late 20s.

1868
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,910
My parents met
when they were in their late 20s.

1869
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:41,680
I thought that when you became an adult,

1870
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,380
you got married in your late 20s.

1871
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:45,650
I thought so.

1872
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,320
But my will alone
couldn't make that happen.

1873
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,660
It's not something I can do alone
because I want to.

1874
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,260
The two get along well and have chemistry.

1875
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,030
- I agree.
- Ji Won is different from when she was...

1876
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,130
with Chang Hwan.

1877
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,700
Ji Won looked comfortable.
They had a realistic talk.

1878
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,070
- Totally.
- But...

1879
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,200
Ji Won unconsciously...

1880
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:08,110
said not to bother with the age...

1881
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,540
and hoped to get along.

1882
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,580
- She said that to Chan Hyeong.
- Right.

1883
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,510
But she could unconsciously
be thinking about Chang Hwan.

1884
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,650
- That's my guess.
- I do think so too.

1885
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,150
Here's what has me curious.

1886
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,950
When Ji Won finds out Woo Jae...

1887
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,790
is thinking about her
as a serious partner,

1888
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,990
- what kind of situation will she be in?
- Same here.

1889
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,330
What will happen?

1890
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,160
(After the dinner)

1891
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,000
You get a pass as today's chef.

1892
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,530
The dinner today was delicious.

1893
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,340
- Really? That's a relief.
- Yes.

1894
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,940
She's proud.

1895
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,510
(Glancing)

1896
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,580
The food was amazing.

1897
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,180
- How about seaweed soup on Saturday?
- I'm in.

1898
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,020
Seaweed soup sounds good.

1899
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,420
- We have delicious kimchi too.
- Do you season with soy sauce?

1900
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,620
Yes, with soy sauce for soup.

1901
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:55,690
The soy sauce for soup
is in the sink base cabinet.

1902
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,490
- You're like a guest house owner.
- Stir-fry the beef, right?

1903
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,960
Do you know how to make it?

1904
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:03,360
- I've never made it, but yes.
- A guest house owner.

1905
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
So you do?

1906
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,170
If I have the recipe.

1907
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,300
- If you have one?
- Yes.

1908
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,440
Made by the Pohang guy.

1909
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,940
- Pohang seaweed soup.
- Yes.

1910
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:16,740
- Let's see how Pohang's will taste.
- Should I put oysters in?

1911
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,880
Pohang seaweed soup.

1912
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,220
(Je Yeon laughs belatedly.)

1913
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,720
She couldn't help but laugh.

1914
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,460
Ji Min must really like her.

1915
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,170
Is it okay to drink coffee at this hour?

1916
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,170
Yes.

1917
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,670
We're not going to work tomorrow, right?

1918
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,580
You don't have work tomorrow?

1919
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,810
No.

1920
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,410
Ask me too.

1921
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,620
No way.

1922
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,820
I'll take the whole of next week off.

1923
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:00,020
Let's all leave that week...

1924
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:01,920
so that he's alone.

1925
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,760
He takes the whole week off,
but nobody is here.

1926
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,560
(Ji Min is fun to tease today.)

1927
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:09,700
- You have to go grocery shopping alone.
- Exactly.

1928
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:21,410
The two must be having...

1929
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:22,940
an in-depth conversation.

1930
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,450
Maybe they started
the contract relationship.

1931
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,980
- A day early?
- What if they mistook the date...

1932
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,720
- as today?
- I know, right?

1933
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:32,920
Imagine them holding hands
when they return.

1934
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,520
(Thinking)

1935
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,790
Not with Ji Won.

1936
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,190
Does that mean...

1937
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:42,230
we have to write...

1938
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:44,160
two names,

1939
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:47,970
and not one today?

1940
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:51,300
(They must decide on two people
for the contract relationship.)

1941
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,610
Yes.

1942
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,180
(Who will end up with whom?)

1943
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,250
It's tough.

1944
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,020
(The growling incident)

1945
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,020
"Growling?"

1946
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:08,990
(Growling)

1947
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,560
(Glancing)

1948
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,930
Why are you looking at me?

1949
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,200
- I thought you called for me.
- Seriously.

1950
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,770
- Didn't you call for me?
- I'm going to run away.

1951
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,440
- How cute.
- She's cute.

1952
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:27,570
- Okay.
- Really.

1953
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:28,910
I thought you called for me.

1954
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,280
I mistook it for calling me.

1955
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,980
(Je Yeon leaves in embarrassment.)

1956
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,050
That's so cute.

1957
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,720
Ji Min really adores Je Yeon.

1958
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,650
- You're so mean.
- It's like their own little world.

1959
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,460
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

1960
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,070
Come back. Did she really go upstairs?

1961
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,570
- That was funny.
- Did she actually leave?

1962
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,270
She actually left.

1963
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:05,280
(Ji Min gets up soon after.)

1964
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,650
Goodness.

1965
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,390
(He follows Je Yeon to the 2nd floor.)

1966
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,300
I'm sorry.

1967
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,070
- Really.
- I mistook it.

1968
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,800
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1969
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,240
It was just too embarrassing.

1970
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,170
- I had to leave.
- I thought you said something.

1971
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,540
It also took me by surprise.

1972
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,610
- You're not hungry, are you?
- I am.

1973
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:39,080
- Right now?
- That's why I'm having tomatoes.

1974
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,080
Is that so?

1975
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,380
(Eating)

1976
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:44,650
I'm sorry.

1977
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,290
It's okay.

1978
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,890
But that was
the most active you've been...

1979
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,520
since we moved here, you know?

1980
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,530
Was I active?

1981
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:54,430
Throwing that cushion.

1982
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,130
I mistook it for calling me.

1983
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,140
Did I...

1984
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,500
throw it too hard?

1985
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:05,640
No.

1986
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:09,010
But you had every right to throw it hard.

1987
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,880
(She's still embarrassed.)

1988
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,810
- It's good.
- That was...

1989
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:14,910
quite funny.

1990
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,180
What was?

1991
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,480
Seriously.

1992
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,190
Don't bring it up.

1993
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,090
What? Was it the sound?

1994
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,260
- What?
- What was funny?

1995
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,960
- Everything.
- The situation?

1996
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,730
The situation was funny.

1997
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,870
I couldn't stay there.

1998
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,070
I have a feeling this might be a chance
for Ji Min.

1999
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,240
Go ahead.

2000
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,040
My gut tells me it'll go well
between the two.

2001
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,610
You didn't eat much earlier.

2002
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,280
Right?

2003
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,050
- Dinner was good.
- Yes, it was great.

2004
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:54,990
- Our talking...
- Yes?

2005
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,220
could be thanks to your stomach growling.

2006
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:00,430
- Should I stop?
- Ji Min is good at teasing.

2007
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,430
Exactly.

2008
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,760
- Call it "that incident."
- "That incident?"

2009
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,170
- It could be thanks to that incident.
- That incident.

2010
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,410
Compared to when we were in Florence,
I feel...

2011
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:15,270
- More comfortable?
- more comfortable.

2012
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:17,680
I feel more embarrassed now.

2013
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,180
- What?
- What?

2014
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,880
- You feel more embarrassed?
- Yes.

2015
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,850
- Because of that incident?
- Yes.

2016
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,880
- Don't worry.
- Forget about what happened.

2017
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:27,150
Gosh, okay.

2018
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,190
- But...
- Was it because I drank this?

2019
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:32,090
- You were digesting the food.
- Was I?

2020
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,830
I was actually kind of hungry.

2021
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,760
When my stomach growls,
I'll move next to you.

2022
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,330
- So that I'd hear it?
- Yes.

2023
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,400
Look at me
after hearing me growl next to you.

2024
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,640
Got it.

2025
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,310
(They promise to pair up
thanks to that incident.)

2026
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:48,610
There.

2027
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,340
So did having some tomatoes help?

2028
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,380
Yes.

2029
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,650
Aren't you tired?

2030
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,320
I've been taking...

2031
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,550
- Did you take naps?
- a lot of naps these days.

2032
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,690
(I see.)

2033
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,960
- Was it EE?
- Pardon?

2034
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,960
- Was it electrical engineering?
- Yes, it was electrical engineering.

2035
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:07,790
I used to work with semiconductors before.

2036
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,130
Then what are you focusing on these days?

2037
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,430
- Telecommunications. Yes.
- Telecommunications.

2038
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:16,270
(Nodding)

2039
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:17,340
Telecommunications.

2040
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,440
I see.

2041
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,810
(Pondering)

2042
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,850
I don't know any lawyers.

2043
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,110
Really?

2044
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,780
That might be the case
since you were a science major.

2045
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,780
Right.

2046
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,590
He's expressing a lot with his eyes.

2047
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:37,160
What made you want to become a lawyer?

2048
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,490
- Why did I become a lawyer?
- Yes.

2049
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,500
It'd been my dream
since I was in middle school.

2050
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,300
I see.

2051
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:46,600
So...

2052
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,630
It's Ji Won.

2053
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,670
Did you have fun?

2054
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,910
- Why did you come home so late?
- Why did you come home so late?

2055
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:54,370
- Did you have fun?
- I got off work pretty late.

2056
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,610
- Really? When did you get off work?
- Right.

2057
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:56,780
He's tipsy too.

2058
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,250
- How did you know?
- Your gaze is unfocused.

2059
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,280
(Glaring)

2060
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,980
Is this the first day
of your contract relationship?

2061
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,850
We got off work late today.

2062
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,820
But that was good.
I'm glad you guys had a nice time.

2063
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,420
So what did you guys eat tonight?

2064
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,060
- Right.
- We had dumpling soup with rice cakes.

2065
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,160
- Je Yeon cooked today.
- Oh, right.

2066
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,460
- We have some leftover food.
- We do.

2067
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,300
- The dumpling soup with rice cakes.
- Was that a meal kit?

2068
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,030
- No. I cooked it myself.
- Come on.

2069
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,170
She even made the broth herself.

2070
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,240
- Really?
- Yes, she made the beef bone broth.

2071
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,970
You bought the beef bones for the broth?

2072
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,110
- Yes. Right.
- Right.

2073
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,240
- She started cooking this morning.
- I should try it.

2074
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
Try it.

2075
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:35,380
It's nice to see you tipsy together.

2076
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:38,450
I bet the whole world looks beautiful now.

2077
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,990
It's cute
how you're peeking into the room.

2078
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,790
- You guys look alike for some reason.
- Right.

2079
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,630
- I'm smiling like a proud dad.
- They're cute.

2080
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:52,630
Right.

2081
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,100
That's cool.

2082
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,300
You dreamed of becoming a lawyer
since middle school.

2083
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,910
So you achieved your dream.
You must've been happy when you did.

2084
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:02,740
- I was really happy.
- What a nice thing to say.

2085
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,110
I bet your parents were over the moon too.

2086
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:06,250
Yes. They were so happy for me.

2087
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,350
So how is it?

2088
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,950
Is it what you dreamed of?

2089
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,850
- It's rewarding.
- It is?

2090
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,490
- When does it feel rewarding?
- It can be tough, though.

2091
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,920
When the cases get resolved nicely,

2092
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,590
my clients would send me
a thank-you letter.

2093
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:19,230
It feels really rewarding then.

2094
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,390
That's so cool.

2095
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,160
Ji Min is asking all the right questions.

2096
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,160
- Right.
- Yes.

2097
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,360
Seriously. That's really cool.

2098
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,030
Thank you.

2099
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,640
What was your childhood dream?

2100
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,200
My dream?

2101
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:37,080
Well, personally,
that's always been a hard question.

2102
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,080
Okay.

2103
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,510
I'm so envious of people who have
a clear dream about their careers.

2104
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,810
- I see.
- Right.

2105
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,150
So...

2106
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,420
when I was young,

2107
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,860
my parents had been
educationally motivated.

2108
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,130
I studied just like they told me to do.

2109
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,660
I majored in engineering...

2110
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,730
because it would get me a stable job.

2111
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,060
But it suits you.

2112
01:34:58,530 --> 01:34:59,870
- It suits my image?
- It suits your image.

2113
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:01,500
That's how I figured out your major.

2114
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,500
I see.

2115
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,840
How should I put it?

2116
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,680
I wouldn't say
I had a dream career growing up.

2117
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:13,150
I've been taking the safe path...

2118
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:15,480
of our society. That's me.

2119
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:16,650
I see.

2120
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,620
When there came a moment for me to decide,

2121
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,220
I chose a path that suited me better.

2122
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:25,360
- That's been my direction.
- They're in their own world.

2123
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,390
- Really?
- Yes.

2124
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:29,900
That's why I'm very impressed by
people with a clear image...

2125
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,160
of what they want.

2126
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,900
That's why ever since I was a child,
I said my dream was to become rich.

2127
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:36,240
To become rich?

2128
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,240
(Laughing)

2129
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,240
- I see.
- He's so honest.

2130
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:46,380
(The presence of others
didn't distract them.)

2131
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,850
(The two of them are engrossed
in their conversation.)

2132
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,180
Right. So I don't know.

2133
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,650
(The two of them are engrossed
in their conversation.)

2134
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:54,720
What's up with those three?

2135
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,720
(Laughing innocently)

2136
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,820
Je Yeon didn't even look
when Woo Jae entered the room.

2137
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:59,090
She wasn't distracted
and continued the conversation.

2138
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:01,730
Je Yeon sort of seems different.

2139
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:05,900
So in other words,
I don't have a clear goal.

2140
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:09,870
But that's really cool. You're so honest.

2141
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:12,100
Right. That shows his confidence.

2142
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:14,710
You are.

2143
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,980
I'd like to be your first client.

2144
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,650
Really? That would be really nice.

2145
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,390
Not needing your representation
might be better, right?

2146
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,720
It's better that way.

2147
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,660
Yes.

2148
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,760
I bet you read a lot of books.

2149
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,660
Do you like books?

2150
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,930
(Nodding)

2151
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:42,000
I'm really fascinated by you.

2152
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,070
Not me.

2153
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,410
Then do you watch videos?

2154
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:49,510
- Like dramas or movies?
- I like watching things.

2155
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,940
- Dramas or movies?
- Yes. Movies.

2156
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,410
You mentioned "Lovely Runner."

2157
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,580
I like watching dramas.

2158
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:59,890
(Their first day in Italy)

2159
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,450
I couldn't go to sleep afterward.

2160
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,160
- Did you watch that drama?
- No.

2161
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,220
- Did you watch it?
- Yes, I did.

2162
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,290
- You did?
- Yes.

2163
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:06,360
You did?

2164
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,860
She's the only one who can understand him.

2165
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:11,860
(Only two of them watched
"Lovely Runner.")

2166
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:14,630
I know that you love Byeon Woo Seok.

2167
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,670
I wouldn't say I love him.

2168
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,270
She's adorable.

2169
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,870
- Ji Sung and Jung Hae In.
- Yes.

2170
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:24,010
But it's not that
I like the actual celebrities.

2171
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,110
I liked the characters they played.

2172
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:27,680
- Their characters? What were they?
- Yes.

2173
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,150
They only had feelings for one person.

2174
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,420
- The hopeless romantic?
- Yes.

2175
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,160
They were sweet.

2176
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:43,100
Yet, there were some cute moments
with the characters.

2177
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:45,860
- Cute moments?
- He's trying to decipher that.

2178
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:48,030
They sort of acted cute in the dramas.

2179
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,370
They acted cute?

2180
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:51,140
She's speaking in her dialect again.

2181
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,770
- They acted cute in the dramas.
- Yes.

2182
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,880
The scenes were cute to watch.

2183
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,580
Nice.

2184
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,180
- Your dialect came out.
- Yes.

2185
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:04,280
- Is that why you're fanning yourself?
- Yes.

2186
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,290
What's wrong with that?
People can speak with dialects.

2187
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:08,950
But it's getting even worse
after moving in here.

2188
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,360
(You're right about that.)

2189
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:13,690
Tell me more.

2190
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:14,690
- More?
- Yes.

2191
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,200
I think I told you so many things already.

2192
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,100
- Tell me in detail.
- In detail?

2193
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:23,500
(Ji Min wants to
get to know her in detail.)

2194
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,510
How is it possible that Je Yeon's smile...

2195
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:28,740
can change
Ji Min's facial expression completely?

2196
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,140
- Exactly.
- He could talk to her like that,

2197
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:32,810
thanks to the grumbling incident.

2198
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:35,510
What makes him attractive
is his sincerity.

2199
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,750
- And he's passionate and witty.
- Yes.

2200
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,020
- He's also strategic.
- Yes.

2201
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,020
Isn't he really charming?

2202
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,690
And their conversation in the kitchen
left an impression on me.

2203
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:45,660
The three of them were walking
around the kitchen.

2204
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:47,560
But they continued to have
a serious conversation about careers.

2205
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:49,160
- You know?
- Je Yeon surprised me then.

2206
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,530
- Woo Jae was there too.
- Woo Jae entered the kitchen too.

2207
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,560
She didn't look at him.

2208
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,930
- She didn't.
- Her eyes stayed on Ji Min, right?

2209
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:54,130
- She didn't look at him.
- Usually, when he entered,

2210
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:55,800
she looked at him and said,
"Oh, he's here."

2211
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,200
But I would like to applaud Ji Min
for being able...

2212
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,410
to keep her gaze during the talk.

2213
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,310
- I agree.
- Right?

2214
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,310
I wondered if she could develop
some interest in him too.

2215
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,610
I really don't know
how it will play out today.

2216
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,280
Not today.

2217
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,420
- What about Ji Won?
- Is she sleeping?

2218
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:11,550
Chae Eun.

2219
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,550
- I can't see her.
- What?

2220
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,960
There you are.
Are you feeling better, Chae Eun?

2221
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,560
- Ha Neul, did you have a good day?
- Yes.

2222
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:21,930
- Wasn't it cold outside?
- It was freezing outside.

2223
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,930
Are you feeling okay?

2224
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:26,070
I'm much better than before.

2225
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:27,400
Did you eat?

2226
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:30,370
- I had some fruits.
- Okay.

2227
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,470
Je Yeon cooked dinner.

2228
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,940
- The dumpling soup with rice cakes.
- We have some soup.

2229
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:34,940
I see.

2230
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,980
- Chang Hwan.
- You can have it later at night.

2231
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,350
- You must be recovering.
- Yes.

2232
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,780
- You said it sounded tasty.
- Your appetite must be coming back.

2233
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,920
- When are you leaving for work tomorrow?
- It's...

2234
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,720
Are you going to work tomorrow?

2235
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,860
Yes. I think I should.

2236
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,960
- I see.
- Do you think you can do it?

2237
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:53,460
I must be at work by 8 a.m. tomorrow.

2238
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:56,860
Chae Eun must be so disappointed.

2239
01:39:57,460 --> 01:40:00,270
- You must get a good night's sleep.
- Yes. I'll take some medicine.

2240
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,170
(Sighing)

2241
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:09,170
He will have to make up his mind soon.

2242
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,410
(Woo Jae leaves the room.)

2243
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,020
Knock knock.

2244
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,590
- Is Je Yeon here?
- She's in the bathroom.

2245
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,060
- He went to Je Yeon.
- Wait.

2246
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:26,160
He must've been bothered that
Ji Min and Je Yeon talked for a long time.

2247
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:29,330
(Je Yeon returns not long after that.)

2248
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:30,700
- Je Yeon.
- I ate it.

2249
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:32,230
- Really?
- It was tasty.

2250
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,170
How was today?

2251
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,900
It was... She was good at
keeping the conversation going.

2252
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,570
- Ji Won?
- Yes.

2253
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,780
- She was great to talk to.
- Really?

2254
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,940
I realized that she had to
feel comfortable to talk a lot more.

2255
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,250
- Right. She seemed like the type.
- Yes.

2256
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,620
You haven't talked to Ji Won a lot, right?

2257
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,660
No. We talked a bit in the car
when we were in Italy.

2258
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:59,390
- At the beginning of our trip.
- Yes. That's right.

2259
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,260
(Opening the door)

2260
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,670
(Woo Jae goes back to Je Yeon.)

2261
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,000
This is his second time going to Je Yeon.

2262
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,670
- Are you sleeping?
- What?

2263
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:12,940
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

2264
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:16,010
- You were sleeping, right? No?
- No, I couldn't. I was just resting.

2265
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:21,350
Can I take your book?

2266
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:22,350
Yes.

2267
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,050
Did you have a nice day off today?

2268
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:30,660
Yes, I had a nice day off.

2269
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,890
I went to the hospital.

2270
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:34,490
- With Chae Eun?
- Yes.

2271
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:37,100
You're not sick, right?
Did you just accompany her?

2272
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,130
- I wasn't feeling well either.
- Really?

2273
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,330
I feel better after getting the shot.

2274
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,170
- I got the IV drip.
- I see.

2275
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:45,340
(Worried)

2276
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,970
- Your body must be fatigued.
- A bit.

2277
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,370
- And your energy must be drained.
- Yes.

2278
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,680
Are you all right?

2279
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:52,580
- I'm fine. Yes.
- Really?

2280
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:54,810
- That's expected of a soccer player.
- I'm strong.

2281
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:56,320
A strong soccer player.

2282
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:00,050
I had the meeting today.

2283
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,450
- It was my first meeting with them.
- Yes.

2284
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,660
He's sharing that with her.

2285
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,320
We talked about the exhibition.

2286
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,730
Then I stopped by my studio and came home.

2287
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,260
Did the meeting to well?

2288
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:14,470
Yes. We sort of settled on a date too.

2289
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:16,600
- It will be at the end of March.
- At the end of March?

2290
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:19,100
Or it might be in April.

2291
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:23,280
- Is it a long exhibition? For 1 week?
- For 3 weeks.

2292
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,340
- It will last for 3 weeks?
- Yes. For about 3 weeks.

2293
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,610
- Really?
- Yes.

2294
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:30,380
There's a great venue in Yaksu.

2295
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,590
So we'll do it there.

2296
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,220
You must come.

2297
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,790
- You must invite me.
- Yes. For the opening day.

2298
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:39,990
- The opening day?
- On the first day.

2299
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:42,530
- Sounds good.
- It will probably be on a weekend.

2300
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,430
Probably.

2301
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,900
(Je Yeon was the first one...)

2302
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,200
That's all.

2303
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,300
(Woo Jae invited to his exhibition.)

2304
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,840
- I'll bring it back after I read it.
- Sure.

2305
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:55,810
- I'll read it thoroughly again.
- Thoroughly?

2306
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,410
He's expressing himself a lot to her.

2307
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:00,150
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

2308
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,710
- See you later.
- Okay.

2309
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:26,640
(Woo Jae read Je Yeon's Pairing Book
for quite some time.)

2310
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,140
My gosh.

2311
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,880
Is Je Yeon looking at art?

2312
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,120
(Ji Min is deep in thought in the lobby.)

2313
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,860
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

2314
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,700
(Sighing)

2315
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,460
Gosh, he has a lot on his mind now.

2316
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,240
(He strides up...)

2317
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,070
(and heads to Je Yeon's room.)

2318
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,380
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

2319
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:06,580
I think it's your first time
calling me casually like that.

2320
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,610
- What?
- It's nothing.

2321
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,320
- This is so embarrassing for me.
- Yes.

2322
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:15,520
Do you still have our caricature?

2323
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,960
- I have it.
- Here?

2324
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,220
- I brought it with me.
- I see.

2325
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,590
- Good.
- Do you want it?

2326
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:23,000
Send me the picture later.

2327
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,160
A picture?

2328
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,430
You want me to take a picture of it?

2329
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,470
You can send the picture to me.

2330
01:44:31,570 --> 01:44:33,310
What? Will he ask her?

2331
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:36,140
Well, there was something
I was curious about.

2332
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,740
- Is that so?
- What is it?

2333
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:38,910
Oh, my.

2334
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,520
Well...

2335
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,180
(Well...)

2336
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:48,190
You have to go into
a contract relationship.

2337
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:49,590
Yes.

2338
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,920
Is there someone you have in mind?

2339
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:57,300
(Nodding)

2340
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,430
- Among the guys you're considering,
- Yes?

2341
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,700
am I one of them?

2342
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,700
My goodness!

2343
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,240
(Ji Min is impressive.)

2344
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,470
Oh, my.

2345
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,610
- He's so brave.
- I love it.

2346
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,940
He's totally my type.

2347
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,240
(She's moved by Brave Ji Min.)

2348
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,010
She's climbing the sofa now.

2349
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:17,820
- Among the guys you're considering,
- Yes?

2350
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:19,920
am I one of them?

2351
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,720
(Among the guys you're considering,
am I one of them?)

2352
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,360
- Am I one of them?
- What?

2353
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:28,990
Is that what you want to know?

2354
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,330
- Yes.
- Really?

2355
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,140
I want...

2356
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,480
to spend time with you alone pretty soon.

2357
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:48,110
So...

2358
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,980
if I'm one of the guys,

2359
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,490
go into the contract relationship with me.

2360
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:59,760
(Go into the contract relationship
with me.)

2361
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,460
- Well...
- I know it will be short, but...

2362
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:06,770
(He expressed how he felt
in his trembling voice.)

2363
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:08,570
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

2364
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:10,770
See you in a bit.

2365
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

2366
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:15,010
Pick me.

2367
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:25,750
- My gosh. This is crazy.
- This is crazy.

2368
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,030
(Exhaling)

2369
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:43,840
(Can you see the couples
who have been paired together?)

2370
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:50,610
(Mission 6:
Guess the male residents' decisions.)

2371
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,880
(Hold on a second.)

2372
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,150
Ji Min took the ending clip
of today's episode.

2373
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:57,280
Are you all right over there?

2374
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,320
(I'm not fine.)

2375
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,920
- Are you all right?
- Listen.

2376
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:02,320
- The protagonist of our show...
- Are you okay?

2377
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:05,260
- I can't wait to find out. Yes.
- keeps changing.

2378
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,960
- This is driving me crazy.
- This episode was all about Ji Min.

2379
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,830
- He's the protagonist tonight.
- Seriously.

2380
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,960
- He's gaining more popularity.
- And...

2381
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,200
"Go into the contract relationship
with me."

2382
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,270
Seriously.

2383
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:16,540
What he said was quite moving.

2384
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:18,800
- But Woo Jae has no idea about this.
- Ji Min and Je Yeon.

2385
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,470
Woo Jae visited her before Ji Min.

2386
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:25,280
- But he only talked about the exhibition.
- Seriously. That was disappointing.

2387
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,680
And in his own way,

2388
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,710
it was his attempt...

2389
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,620
- Right.
- to share more of himself.

2390
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:34,090
It was his way of expressing his interest.

2391
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,620
But Ji Min who came after Woo Jae
made such a bold move.

2392
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,090
- Right.
- I agree.

2393
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:39,420
- Oh, my.
- All right.

2394
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:40,930
We're playing this as a team today.

2395
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,160
For the three-day contract relationship,
the male residents...

2396
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,870
will write down the names of two women
in the text message.

2397
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,070
They must pick two women.

2398
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:50,600
We must guess the two female residents...

2399
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,670
chosen by the male residents.

2400
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:55,470
- Let's start with Woo Jae. Yes.
- That will be the easiest one so far.

2401
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:58,010
- He already said it in the video.
- Woo Jae... Right.

2402
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,080
Je Yeon and Ji Won.

2403
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,910
- Je Yeon and Ji Won.
- They gave us Woo Jae's answer.

2404
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,520
(He needs to talk to Je Yeon
on a deeper level with more time.)

2405
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:07,990
(Ji Won got his attention
the moment they met.)

2406
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,960
- Woo Jae would pick those two.
- Je Yeon and Ji Won.

2407
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,420
Woo Jae probably picked
Je Yeon and Ji Won.

2408
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,160
(They agree unanimously.)

2409
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,590
- Chang Hwan.
- It's hard to guess his decision now.

2410
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:18,660
(Chang Hwan was deep in thought.)

2411
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,530
I think he will choose Ha Neul.

2412
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,770
- Yes, I think he might choose her.
- Ha Neul.

2413
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:24,770
I think...

2414
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:25,840
Chae Eun.

2415
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,170
- Me too. I'd say Chae Eun.
- There are two.

2416
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:29,610
Because he asked about Chae Eun so much.

2417
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:31,380
I don't think it'd be Chae Eun.

2418
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,410
I think he only asked...

2419
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:33,450
- because she looked really ill.
- Okay.

2420
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:36,750
- That makes sense.
- Any chance that he chose Je Yeon?

2421
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:38,350
- Right.
- Je Yeon is the oldest.

2422
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:40,120
Could it be Je Yeon?

2423
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,150
- Instead of Chae Eun?
- With the smallest age gap?

2424
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,820
Je Yeon with the smallest age gap.

2425
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:45,760
That makes sense.

2426
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,460
And they have similar personalities.

2427
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:50,000
He'd still choose Ji Won.

2428
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:52,830
When Ji Won and Chan Hyeong
returned from their date,

2429
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:55,970
I noticed Chang Hwan was bothered.

2430
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:59,340
(Chang Hwan noticed...)

2431
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:01,940
(that Ji Won was away.)

2432
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:03,170
(He remembers.)

2433
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:05,410
Right. Then...

2434
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,680
- Ha Neul and Ji Won?
- Ha Neul and Ji Won.

2435
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:08,680
(Let's go with that.)

2436
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,550
Is the other one Ha Neul?

2437
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:12,720
- It's Ha Neul.
- Ha Neul for sure.

2438
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:15,620
Chang Hwan chose Ha Neul and Ji Won.

2439
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:17,990
(Chang Hwan chose Ha Neul and Ji Won.)

2440
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:20,830
Next is Chan Hyeong. He's difficult.

2441
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:23,930
He rooted in everyone.
It's hard to guess him.

2442
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:25,300
(Chan Hyeong went on a date with 3 women.)

2443
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,630
I'd say...

2444
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,830
- Ha Neul and Chae Eun.
- Me too. He would've chosen Chae Eun.

2445
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,900
- I'd say Ha Neul and Chae Eun.
- Ha Neul and Chae Eun.

2446
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:34,810
- Ha Neul is certain.
- Yes, Ha Neul.

2447
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:36,170
- Chae Eun's memo.
- Yes.

2448
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:37,440
(Voting for the memo Chae Eun received)

2449
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:39,840
(Chan Hyeong looked after Chae Eun
who was ill.)

2450
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,580
He even brought a humidifier
from his house.

2451
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,120
(He also wrote his heart to her.)

2452
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,790
Chae Eun, and the other person is Ha Neul.

2453
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,890
- Ha Neul?
- No vote for Ji Won?

2454
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,160
- No.
- He's not interested in her.

2455
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,120
No? Did you notice anything, Ji Seon?

2456
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,160
That's what I was thinking.

2457
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:59,900
But would Chan Hyeong neglect her
that much...

2458
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:03,100
after what she did on their date?

2459
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:04,940
That occurred to me.

2460
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,240
I'd say Chan Hyeong might have chosen
Ha Neul and Ji Won.

2461
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:10,140
- Ha Neul and Ji Won?
- Yes.

2462
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,710
Then let's remove Chae Eun.

2463
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,510
(Taking Ji Seon's advice
and going for Ha Neul and Ji Won)

2464
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:16,980
- It's harder to choose two people.
- I know.

2465
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,680
We all know one for sure.

2466
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,320
It's Ji Min and Je Yeon.

2467
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,950
I can never guess
who Ji Min would choose...

2468
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,190
as his second choice.

2469
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:26,830
Everyone else means nothing to Ji Min
except for Je Yeon.

2470
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:28,030
- Right.
- Yes.

2471
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,630
Would he still vote for Ha Neul?

2472
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:32,160
- I doubt he would.
- No?

2473
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,670
- I agree.
- To be clear,

2474
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,670
it's better not to choose her.

2475
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:37,440
He drew a line with Ji Won.

2476
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:38,540
Then it's Chae Eun.

2477
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:39,600
Chae Eun?

2478
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:41,870
But he didn't do anything with Chae Eun.

2479
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:44,240
I think he would've chosen someone
he barely knows.

2480
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:46,180
- Chae Eun?
- He went on a date with everyone else.

2481
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,180
- Then it's Chae Eun.
- Chae Eun it is. Okay.

2482
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:50,420
Ji Min chose Je Yeon and Chae Eun.

2483
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,180
Did we get everyone?

2484
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:54,150
Let's check the result.

2485
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:56,520
Who are the two people Woo Jae chose?

2486
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:59,760
(Je Yeon is the first person
he wants to invite.)

2487
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,030
(Ji Won
with an unforgettable first impression)

2488
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:05,100
(I hope it's Je Yeon and Ji Won.)

2489
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:08,070
(Please.)

2490
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:09,700
(Woo Jae)

2491
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,300
(Je Yeon)

2492
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,340
Je Yeon.

2493
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:14,270
Ji Won.

2494
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,680
(Ji Won)

2495
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,640
Ji Won.

2496
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,310
- We were right.
- We got that.

2497
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:23,150
- We even got the spot right.
- He kept...

2498
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:25,050
talking about it throughout the show.

2499
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:27,020
- Right.
- Next is Chang Hwan.

2500
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:30,760
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Chang Hwan chose?

2501
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,290
(Ji Won who felt like destiny?)

2502
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,390
(Ha Neul who's always bright?)

2503
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:37,160
Please.

2504
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:40,070
(Ji Won?)

2505
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,630
(Chang Hwan)

2506
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:43,070
(Chae Eun)

2507
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:44,240
Chae Eun.

2508
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,640
Who's the second contract relationship
partner Chang Hwan chose?

2509
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,640
(Chae Eun)

2510
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:52,740
(Je Yeon)

2511
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,110
Chae Eun. I told you it was Chae Eun.

2512
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,720
- Je Yeon.
- Oh, my gosh.

2513
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:00,820
I guess Chang Hwan feels burdened
by the age gap.

2514
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,190
Due to his appearance.

2515
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:03,190
(Chang Hwan ends his feelings
toward Ji Won.)

2516
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,060
I can't wait to check the next person.

2517
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:08,160
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Chan Hyeong chose?

2518
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,960
(Will Chan Hyeong continue to pair up
with Ha Neul in Seoul?)

2519
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,430
(Or will he pair up with Ji Won
who newly approached him?)

2520
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:17,040
(The guessing panelists
wait for the result quietly.)

2521
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,840
(Chan Hyeong)

2522
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,140
(Ji Won)

2523
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:22,710
- We have Ji Won.
- We have her.

2524
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:27,110
(Ha Neul)

2525
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,080
Ha Neul.

2526
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,450
- I knew it.
- Ji Won and Ha Neul.

2527
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:31,980
In the end,

2528
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,590
Ji Won's enthusiasm today was...

2529
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:36,050
- The best move.
- the best move.

2530
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,420
It's the last person.

2531
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,860
I'm not so sure about
Ji Min's second choice.

2532
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:43,330
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Ji Min chose?

2533
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:47,870
(The woman he delivered his heart to
straight up)

2534
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:49,800
Obviously, it is...

2535
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Je Yeon.

2536
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,270
(Ji Min)

2537
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:56,040
(Je Yeon)

2538
01:52:56,370 --> 01:52:57,810
- Yes.
- Yes.

2539
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:02,050
Who's the second contract relationship
partner Ji Min chose?

2540
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:05,120
- We said it was Chae Eun.
- Yes.

2541
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:08,750
(Did he choose Chae Eun
to meet someone new?)

2542
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,960
(Losing confidence)

2543
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,390
(Focused)

2544
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:15,290
(Je Yeon)

2545
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:19,000
(Ha Neul)

2546
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:22,600
(Why Ha Neul out of nowhere?)

2547
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,370
- He said...
- He said that wasn't right.

2548
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:28,640
If it can't be Je Yeon,
he should still go for Ha Neul.

2549
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,940
But he probably didn't assume
that it wouldn't work out with Je Yeon.

2550
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,410
We couldn't get all the answers today.

2551
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:35,710
It's a bummer.

2552
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:38,480
Now, it'll depend on...

2553
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,920
whom the female residents chose.

2554
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:43,190
Let's check the result now.

2555
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,190
(The female residents' choices
are revealed now.)

2556
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:45,920
- Right away?
- Who's the first contract relationship...

2557
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,630
partner Chae Eun chose?

2558
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,630
- Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan.
- Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan.

2559
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:52,100
- Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan.
- Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan.

2560
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:53,400
(Chan Hyeong)

2561
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:57,000
(Chang Hwan)

2562
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,100
I knew it.

2563
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,470
(Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan)

2564
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:02,440
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Ha Neul chose?

2565
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,880
(Ha Neul)

2566
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,110
Chan Hyeong and Ji Min?

2567
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:07,580
(Chan Hyeong)

2568
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,810
(Ji Min)

2569
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,850
Ji Min.

2570
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,820
- Still...
- That means Ha Neul isn't...

2571
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:15,020
interested in the other two.

2572
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,150
- No.
- Ha Neul...

2573
01:54:16,150 --> 01:54:17,860
- knows what she wants.
- Yes.

2574
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:19,490
- Ji Min is the type she likes.
- Woo Jae or Chang Hwan...

2575
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:20,690
isn't on her radar.

2576
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,260
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Ji Won chose?

2577
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,300
- Chan Hyeong.
- Chan Hyeong.

2578
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,470
Chan Hyeong.

2579
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:29,470
(Who is it?)

2580
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:31,070
(Ji Won)

2581
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:34,040
(Chan Hyeong)

2582
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,010
(Woo Jae)

2583
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,380
Yes.

2584
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,280
- As expected...
- She has pride.

2585
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,910
It's not only about her pride. Maybe she
chose someone she hasn't dated yet?

2586
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:43,410
She doesn't want anyone that rejected her.

2587
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,550
She didn't get the texts.

2588
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:45,850
She didn't get the texts.

2589
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,550
Ji Won moved on.

2590
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:48,690
(She moved on with no regrets.)

2591
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,820
You can expect Je Yeon, right?

2592
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,690
Who's the first contract relationship
partner Je Yeon chose?

2593
01:54:54,030 --> 01:54:57,830
(Woo Jae helped her open up)

2594
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:02,600
(Ji Min knocked on her heart
with a bold confession)

2595
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,500
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

2596
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,600
(Je Yeon)

2597
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,210
(Woo Jae)

2598
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:09,740
It's Woo Jae. He was a strong candidate.

2599
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:13,910
(Ji Min)

2600
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:16,410
Yes. She chose Ji Min.

2601
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:19,880
- The first...
- How are they going to match now?

2602
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,490
Je Yeon gets to go on a date
with Woo Jae...

2603
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,720
and Ji Min too?

2604
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,860
For three days?

2605
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,260
Here.

2606
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:29,030
There's a hidden matching rule
the residents aren't aware of.

2607
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,900
(A hidden...)

2608
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,360
(matching?)

2609
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,730
It's the 1st-come-1st-served
contract relationship matching.

2610
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:37,540
- No way.
- First come, first served?

2611
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:40,270
- What is this? A subscription?
- Okay.

2612
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:42,870
For Je Yeon and Ji Min to go on a date,

2613
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,940
after Je Yeon sends the text,

2614
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:47,280
Ji Min must text her first
before Woo Jae does.

2615
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,310
Yes.

2616
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,920
The first contract relationship is...

2617
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,120
They are...

2618
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:58,160
Don't say it after the commercial.

2619
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,520
It's coming next week.

2620
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:02,590
It's way longer than the commercial.

2621
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,160
- I hate it.
- It's too long.

2622
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,300
I hate it.

2623
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,470
I have to wait for seven days? I hate it.

2624
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:10,640
(The day of the contract relationship)

2625
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,740
(The 3 days of the contract relationship
begins.)

2626
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,940
(It's short,
but we got to be in a relationship.)

2627
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:22,280
(Enjoy going out...)

2628
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,950
(without worrying about others.)

2629
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:25,950
(I'm your boyfriend right now.)

2630
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,520
(You're my boyfriend.)

2631
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:32,360
(The contract relationship privilege,
their own messenger)

2632
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,660
(Losing track of time while talking)

2633
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,760
(I feel like I have the right
to meddle with his life.)
