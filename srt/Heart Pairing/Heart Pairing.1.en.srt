1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,970
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,670
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,670
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,210
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,850
After eight years, after "Heart Signal,"
Channel A presents...

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,110
the best-ever dating reality show.

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,580
Welcome to Heart Pairing.

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,380
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,550
(Boosting dopamine)

10
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,790
The atmosphere is heated up.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,620
I have nine years of experience
in "Heart Signal."

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,590
I've been married for 20 years.

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,090
I'm the right person
for hosting Heart Pairing.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm Yoon Jong Shin.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,660
You're just right for this.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,270
And here's someone
who rarely appears in variety shows.

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,340
Actress Lee Chung Ah joined us
in hosting the show.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,910
Hello, I'm Actress Lee Chung Ah.

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,080
The only dating show I watched
was "Heart Signal 4."

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,250
It really was...

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,680
- more dramatic than a drama.
- Right.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,620
Hearing that the crew was creating
a new dating reality show,

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,690
I came here feeling excited,

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,490
- and it already makes my heart flutter.
- Right?

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,590
My heart flutters so much.

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,420
Actually for me, "Heart Signal" was...

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,660
the first and the last dating show
I watched.

28
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,230
You should have appeared
in the show, Si Won.

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,360
- That's right.
- Watching it now,

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,430
I feel I should have been there.

31
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,270
The mood there is so nice.

32
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,600
I also had an experience with this show.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,940
Although my gut feeling isn't good,

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,140
watching them makes me feel...

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,940
that they're around my age.

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,370
(Mimi feels that the residents
are around her age.)

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,980
Today, as a friend,

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,610
I will try to represent their position.

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,850
Mimi, you're the best age to marry, right?

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,980
I want to deny it,

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,290
but that's right.

42
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,490
I will do my best...

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,590
to look for someone.

44
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,460
And here's someone
who sent us a love call...

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,790
saying she wants to be in this show.

46
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,630
Dreams come true.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I watch all the dating shows,

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,600
but "Heart Signal" is the way to go.

49
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,400
- That's right.
- In my heart,

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,770
"Heart Signal" is a story that isn't over.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,170
It's a show I really love.

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,310
So, joining in Heart Pairing...

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,140
makes me so happy.

54
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,150
Then...

55
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,210
can you predict who will be a couple
in the last episode?

56
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,480
I think I can guess it right.

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,120
- Watching only the first episode?
- I'll give it a try.

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,520
In the previous "Heart Signal,"

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
from flirting to dating,

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,230
young love of people in their 20s
was described.

61
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,060
This time, for one month,

62
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,300
the show describes the process
of looking for a partner...

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
the residents want to get married.

64
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,970
Dating and marriage are different...

65
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,370
in the mindset.

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,940
Are they quite different
from the beginning?

67
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,300
They surely are.

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,870
They have different weights.

69
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,410
I have a dim memory about it, though.

70
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,680
(I can't remember exactly.)

71
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,950
Now, from the beginning stage
of a relationship,

72
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,150
I get to think about a lot of things.

73
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,790
You can't just date someone
only because you're attracted.

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,820
If you marry just because
you're attracted...

75
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,960
You're dragged.

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,890
- You're dragged?
- For whole life.

77
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,360
I understand.

78
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,330
- It seems they went somewhere.
- With a passport.

79
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,270
There's a rumor they went to Europe.

80
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,570
Of Europe, they went
to the city of romance,

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,940
Tuscany.

82
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,100
In Italy.

83
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,640
They're in big trouble.
Something's going to happen.

84
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,440
I can't believe I'm its first viewer.

85
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,610
I'm excited.

86
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,780
(What kind of person
do you want to marry?)

87
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,850
(Someone who puts effort...)

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,820
(into work and family)

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,490
I'm already immersed.

90
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,520
(I want to spend time together.)

91
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,990
(How do you want to sleep
after getting married?)

92
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,130
(What's the monthly income
you expect as a couple?)

93
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,130
(- How will you do the housework?
- Do you want to have children?)

94
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,000
Now that they talk about marriage,

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,070
it feels totally different.

96
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,700
(33 questions on marriage)

97
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,500
(One person's thoughts...)

98
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,910
I got goosebumps. What's that?

99
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,340
(are made into a book.)

100
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,180
(Is there someone you like?
Then pick the book she wrote.)

101
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,220
(Using only books, they picked someone...)

102
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,620
(they're most curious about.)

103
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,020
(You got a text message.)

104
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,060
That's how they get to know each other.

105
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
- Seriously.
- That's what it's like.

106
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,900
Hello, I'd like to buy
international travel insurance.

107
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,240
Yes, you can check
the text message I send.

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,410
Thank you.

109
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,110
I'm excited too.

110
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,510
(You're ready to go.)

111
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,180
I've saved travel to Europe...

112
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,190
because I wanted to go there
with someone I want to marry.

113
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,420
It's a puppy.

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,420
Going to the Incheon
International Airport?

115
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,690
(A strange place)

116
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,260
(Someone new)

117
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,360
Oh, my goodness.

118
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
It must feel like riding a time machine.

119
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,770
He looks good.

120
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,530
Oh, my. My heart is already beating fast.

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,700
I feel so already.

122
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,170
My goodness.

123
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,770
(To the place where
I don't need to explain myself)

124
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,080
He looks nice.

125
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,520
(Leonardo da Vinci-Flumicino Airport,
Rome)

126
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,120
(At last)

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,020
- Oh, my. She's beautiful.
- How lovely.

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,290
I felt so excited...

129
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,920
because it was a place
I had never been to.

130
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,800
I wondered what kind of people
were coming.

131
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,030
Her voice sounds sweet too.

132
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,540
It kind of felt like a new beginning.

133
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,600
In an environment
where everything feels unfamiliar,

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,940
- It gives me goosebumps.
- will I be able to find...

135
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,610
someone who clicks with me?

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,450
(Looking for the writer of a book)

137
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,420
(Looking for a new relationship)

138
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,580
When I start a relationship with someone,

139
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,750
I consider whether we can picture
our future together.

140
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,990
- It's just like a movie.
- I know.

141
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,630
I got to realize it,

142
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,230
and although I wasn't 100 percent sure,

143
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,730
I thought I'd be able to recognize
the person I selected.

144
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,770
(Leaving Seoul, the city they live in,)

145
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,600
(in a new place,)

146
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,810
(they dream of marriage.)

147
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,110
(The journey starts now.)

148
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,550
Oh, my.

149
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,780
- What's going on?
- Goodness.

150
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,050
(What fates...)

151
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,690
(await them?)

152
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,690
The opening is insane.

153
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,990
- It feels different.
- As they talk about marriage,

154
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,730
it suddenly feels different.

155
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,130
But if you meet someone
in a place like that,

156
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,600
you can't resist falling in love.

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
(You're guilty
if you don't fall in love there.)

158
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,470
(Tuscany, Italy)

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,690
(The first resident walks in.)

160
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh, my goodness.

161
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
It looks like a castle.

162
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,470
There's a garden too.

163
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,980
(Hundreds of years are seen...)

164
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,550
(in this Italian mansion.)

165
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
(A new fate will unfold in this place.)

166
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,690
The place deserves
a European noble person.

167
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,220
It looks like Hogwarts.

168
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,060
The house has beautiful colors.

169
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,390
(My one and only...)

170
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,970
(to spend life together)

171
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,770
It's magnificent. How come it's so grand?

172
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,070
Heart Pairing.

173
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,810
She's so beautiful.

174
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,290
(In a new country)

175
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,190
- She's beautiful.
- How lovely.

176
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,810
The picture frames look beautiful.

177
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,610
(Yellow room, 1st living room)

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,620
It will become the space
they usually gather.

179
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,690
It was my first time to be in Europe.

180
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,160
I couldn't take such a long break
while I was working.

181
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
I was always working.

182
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,740
My longest break was five days.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,470
She only took five days' break.

184
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,210
The break this time was so precious to me.

185
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,940
There's a possibility
that she just started her career.

186
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,850
It was so beautiful.

187
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,220
I've seen it only on TV or media.

188
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,320
Thinking I could see those sights
in person...

189
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,490
- She's cute.
- She looks like Jun Ji Hyun.

190
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,560
- Yes, a bit.
- Yes.

191
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,060
(Her first time in Europe)

192
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,270
The view is so nice.

193
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,800
(She's looking around
the Italian mansion.)

194
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,440
(Breakfast room)

195
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
It's an escape from daily life.

196
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,380
Breakfast room.

197
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,680
There's a separate space for breakfast.

198
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,520
It's different from "Heart Signal."

199
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,190
(Everything feels new and unfamiliar.)

200
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,590
The view is crazy.

201
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,160
(Dining room)

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,430
It's a banquet.

203
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,830
They wouldn't eat kimchi stew there.

204
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,600
I know. They'll be cutting steak.

205
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,770
(She wants to leave the record
of everything she sees here.)

206
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,540
It really looks great.

207
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
(Kitchen)

208
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,040
It's a nice house.

209
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,780
(Is there a chance someone has arrived?)

210
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,920
I wondered if there was someone...

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,290
in a room or so.

212
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,830
But there was no one.

213
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,960
I started to feel nervous since then.

214
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,700
It felt like a very old house...

215
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,940
located in a remote place.

216
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,540
I thought...

217
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,140
only the residents
could stay in that house.

218
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,040
- Right.
- How come my heart flutters so much?

219
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,410
(An unfamiliar place, a space only for us)

220
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,510
It's a man.

221
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,080
(A new person arrives there.)

222
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,250
Who's that?

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
It was in the 2000s.

224
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,070
When I heard the place was in Tuscany,

225
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,570
it felt very strange.

226
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,900
What about Tuscany?

227
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,070
(The second resident, Woo Jae)

228
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,540
- Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae.

229
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,240
It's a name for a main character. Woo Jae.

230
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,750
Italy was a battlefield to me.

231
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
It's a country that gave me
many emotions...

232
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,920
that I was reminded of the past.

233
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,620
What does he mean by battlefield?

234
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,090
It was also a new beginning...

235
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,730
of going to meet someone
for love and marriage,

236
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,600
so it made my heart flutter a lot.

237
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,140
He had an experience in Italy.

238
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,450
(Rules)

239
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,250
- Rules.
- Express your feelings.

240
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,450
(Send an anonymous text every night
to someone who attracts you.)

241
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,650
(You must not reveal your last name,
age, and occupation in Italy.)

242
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,190
(Opening the door of Pairing House
with a trembling heart)

243
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,430
(The second resident, Woo Jae)

244
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,630
He's handsome.

245
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,230
(Nervous)

246
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,860
She can hear him coming.

247
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,740
(Nervous)

248
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,970
Oh, my. It's their first encounter.

249
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,520
How come my heart is throbbing so much?

251
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,890
It's nice to meet you.

252
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,500
May I sit here?

253
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,340
They must feel nervous.

254
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,180
It feels awkward.

255
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,680
She's smiling.

256
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,990
- Did you just enter?
- Yes.

257
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,730
- She's so cute.
- The house is so large.

258
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,290
I looked around it all.

259
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,730
- Did you?
- Yes.

260
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,200
Did you see the view on your way here?

261
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,270
Yes.

262
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,000
- The tree looks...
- Yes, the tree.

263
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,570
- It looks like an old house.
- Right.

264
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,370
First of all, the two of them
have a similar voice tone.

265
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,450
They have a similar atmosphere
in their looks.

266
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,610
(They have a similar atmosphere.)

267
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,920
My heart is throbbing. This is insane.

268
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,750
What's your name?

269
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm Je Yeon.

270
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,320
- Je Yeon.
- Yes.

271
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,930
- I'm Woo Jae.
- I see.

272
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,230
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

273
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,330
Woo Jae.

274
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,310
Until I came here,

275
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,810
- I didn't feel nervous at all.
- I see.

276
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,250
But seeing you, somehow...

277
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,820
(Fingering things for no reason)

278
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,460
He looks at the book for no reason.

279
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,490
(Je Yeon smiles looking at Woo Jae.)

280
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,460
- Have you eaten pizza?
- Yes.

281
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,430
- Pasta?
- Yes.

282
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,970
I'm shy around strangers.

283
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,240
Me too.

284
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,340
- So...
- Me too.

285
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,980
I could be a little awkward at first.

286
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,440
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

287
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,950
I'm really shy around strangers as well.

288
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,620
- After some time...
- Right.

289
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,990
This place is amazing.

290
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
- Right.
- Right.

291
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,220
It'd be nice if we could look around.

292
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,430
- Don't you want to take a look around?
- Yes.

293
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,560
This house is so beautiful.

294
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
(It seems like Je Yeon feels hot.)

295
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,900
She feels hot now.

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,270
(Glancing)

297
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,740
Je Yeon really can't hide how she feels.

298
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,240
She doesn't know what to do now.

299
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,870
Is there water here?

300
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
He's nice. He seems very kind.

301
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,280
I'll go get some water. Do you want some?

302
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,350
Sure, I'll go with you.

303
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,420
There was a kitchen here.

304
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,590
- Really?
- Yes.

305
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,790
- I think there was a kitchen.
- I'll look around for it.

306
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,490
It was here.

307
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,930
Let me see.

308
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
(Opening)

309
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,040
- I found it.
- Where was it?

310
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,540
It was in the fridge.

311
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,220
You're tall.

312
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,290
I'm also wearing heels today.

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,960
Aren't you thirsty?

314
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,530
I'm so thirsty.

315
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,300
Here you go.

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,070
Thank you.

317
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,350
(Glancing)

318
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,490
(Je Yeon can't look him in the eye.)

319
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,060
(Her hand is shaking a little.)

320
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,160
It seems like Woo Jae is feeling
more comfortable now.

321
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,670
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm starving.

322
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,800
- Are you starving?
- Yes.

323
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,540
But we should wait for
everyone to come, right?

324
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,170
(Glancing)

325
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,810
She's looking at him.

326
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,610
What do we do?

327
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,080
By the way...
There's something written there.

328
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,950
I really like how she talks.

329
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,720
(Rules in Italy Pairing House)

330
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,790
Rules.

331
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,890
(Send an anonymous text every night
to someone who attracts you.)

332
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,890
(Express your interest to the person that

333
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,630
(You must not reveal your last name,
age, and occupation in Italy.)

334
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,470
(Reading the note)

335
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,970
See how she looks at him.

336
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,640
I think Woo Jae is in good shape.

337
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,150
(Peeking)

338
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,150
(Je Yeon peeks at him,
and Woo Jae smiles.)

339
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,080
Those pictures...

340
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,350
- are beautiful.
- Right.

341
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,660
- Do you like taking a walk?
- I love it.

342
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,690
- You love it?
- Yes.

343
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,990
Me too. I take a walk a lot.

344
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,630
So this is the fun of it.

345
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,670
(Mimi is pairing with Italy.)

346
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,530
Isn't it so cute? "I love it."

347
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,300
It looks like they have...

348
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,640
- similar vibes.
- They're quite similar.

349
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,070
They look comfortable with each other.

350
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,410
Since they are in Italy together,

351
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,380
it reminds me of the movie
"Twist Calm and Passion."

352
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,110
- Exactly.
- That's right.

353
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,110
I think it had more impact on Je Yeon.

354
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,420
Je Yeon doesn't seem like a person...

355
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,020
- who makes the first move.
- Right.

356
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,390
- Someone...
- Right.

357
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,760
should come to her first
to make something happen.

358
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,590
I remember this.

359
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,190
"Italy was a battlefield to me."

360
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,200
So he's quite familiar with Italy.

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,360
- Right.
- For him.

362
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,230
He opened the fridge naturally
in the kitchen.

363
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,800
He found cups and water right away.

364
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,640
If you're not used to it,
you would look around like this.

365
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,210
- Right.
- But it was natural as if he was at home.

366
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,710
He must be a musician or a designer.

367
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,110
- Or a photo... A photographer.
- It could be something like that.

368
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,110
- A photographer.
- Right.

369
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,820
Who is it this time?

370
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,690
I want to get married
when I'm about 35 or 36.

371
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,090
These days, I think you need a partner...

372
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,230
to feel more settled
both emotionally and physically.

373
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,670
As I get older,

374
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,600
I want to find someone
I could plan my future with.

375
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,510
Ever since I started working,

376
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,880
it was so hard for me
to start a relationship naturally.

377
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,610
I felt my heart flutter
when I saw this house.

378
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,080
That was when I really felt...

379
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,690
that I was here.

380
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,460
(That was when I really felt
that I was here.)

381
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,820
- Why are they all good-looking?
- They're all handsome.

382
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,660
The way he talks tells me...

383
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,400
- he's very confident.
- He's confident.

384
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,930
- He looks meticulous.
- He seems to be straightforward.

385
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,100
(Closing the door)

386
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,940
He's handsome in a different style.

387
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,010
(The sound of footsteps)

388
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,110
I hear the door closing.

389
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,780
Someone is here.

390
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,480
It makes me put down my cup.

391
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,450
I wonder how Je Yeon will react
when she sees him.

392
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

393
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,290
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

394
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,660
(The Third Resident, Ji Min)

395
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,100
It must have been a long trip.

396
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,500
Do you want some water?

397
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,000
- Sure.
- I'll bring you a cup.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,170
- I can go get it.
- Actually, it was a little hard to find.

399
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,470
- Really? Thank you.
- Yes.

400
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,810
(Je Yeon looks a little more awkward.)

401
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,920
It looks like Je Yeon's reaction
is different than before.

402
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,720
(Ji Min avoids her eyes.)

403
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,460
(Nervous)

404
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,370
These two look quite awkward.
Not like before.

405
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,910
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

406
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,610
He glanced at her.

407
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,320
- You can have more.
- Okay.

408
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,250
Thank you.

409
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
(Glancing)

410
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,830
So what is your name?

411
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,030
I'm Ji Min.

412
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,360
- Ji Min.
- So it's Ji Min.

413
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,070
What's your name?

414
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,070
I'm Je Yeon.

415
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,270
- Je Yeon?
- That's right.

416
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,740
I'm Woo Jae.

417
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,870
- Woo Jae?
- Yes.

418
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,010
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

419
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,010
Nice to meet you too.

420
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,850
We're both a little shy.

421
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
So...

422
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,620
We didn't talk much.
We just shared a few words.

423
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,390
(Staring)

424
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,230
I think Ji Min is interested in Je Yeon.

425
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,260
I can tell from his eyes.

426
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,830
Seriously.

427
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,270
How long has it been since you arrived?

428
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,770
I'm not sure. Maybe an hour.

429
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,010
- An hour?
- Yes.

430
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,340
You waited for the longest.

431
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,440
There was literally no one.

432
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,550
You must have been bored.

433
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,280
But there were so many rooms.

434
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,980
- Did you check them all?
- Yes.

435
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,690
And every room is so different.

436
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,450
They have different colors and everything.

437
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,020
- He's smiling.
- Have you decided on a room?

438
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,730
Yes. I liked a few of them.

439
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,460
I even took photos.

440
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,170
He's fallen in love by this point.

441
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,140
He can't even look her in the eyes.

442
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,520
Chan Hyeong.

443
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
I need to get married.

444
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
He gives off a different vibe.

445
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,890
Self-management and work.

446
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,990
I've been working hard the whole time.

447
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,460
You know, at work.

448
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,860
But when I come back home...

449
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, I live alone,

450
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,370
so there's only silence.

451
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,270
At such moments,

452
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,540
I come to realize that I need someone...

453
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,510
who I can spend time with in the future...

454
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,040
instead of dating.

455
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,380
All three men seem very different.

456
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,810
(The fourth resident has arrived.)

457
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,620
(Looking around)

458
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,860
(This resident looks curious.)

459
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,400
We have a manly one out of the blue.

460
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,100
- He seems feisty.
- Yes.

461
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,540
- He's very masculine.
- Yes.

462
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

463
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,680
- I can sit anywhere, right?
- Yes.

464
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,250
Okay.

465
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,890
- Chan Hyeong seems natural.
- Hi.

466
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,190
This place is wonderful.

467
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,720
- It's cool, right?
- Yes.

468
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,890
Would you like some water?

469
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,800
- Sure.
- He's cute.

470
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
Thank you.

471
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,200
I was thirsty.

472
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,840
(Peeking)

473
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,540
Je Yeon still gives a warm look...

474
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,170
when she's looking at Woo Jae.

475
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,610
(Chan Hyeong busily looks around.)

476
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
May I...

477
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,360
ask you what your name is?

478
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,160
My name is Chan Hyeong.

479
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,160
- Chan Hyeong?
- Yes.

480
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,730
Can I be comfortable?

481
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,300
A black coat.

482
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,740
(He quickly takes his coat off.)

483
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,270
You can...

484
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,770
- put your coat here.
- Okay.

485
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,780
- If you don't mind,
- No.

486
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,780
- I'll put it here.
- Sure.

487
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,820
Woo Jae is a very delicate type.

488
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,120
Do you know how many floors there are?

489
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,760
I think it's a three-story house.

490
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,990
- It was practically a mansion.
- I know.

491
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,600
I've never been
to a place like this before.

492
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,600
This is no joke.

493
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,830
Unbelievable.

494
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,400
It looks so old.

495
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,010
What kind of tree is this?

496
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,340
He seems playful.

497
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,010
He's very easygoing.

498
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,380
(He looks like a child
who's curious about everything.)

499
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,020
(He takes a look
at every corner of the house.)

500
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,520
The house seems very old.

501
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,360
Just looking at that scorch mark,
I can tell it's quite old.

502
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,500
Have you looked out the window
from inside?

503
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,670
- How does it look?
- It's gorgeous.

504
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,800
- Right?
- Yes.

505
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,870
Chan Hyeong's personality is my type.

506
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,840
He lightly breaks the ice
as soon as he arrives.

507
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,040
Don't you think...

508
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,780
he's good at easing the tension
in the room?

509
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,310
I really like that.

510
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,890
How was it?

511
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
Did you have a type when you chose a book?

512
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,690
- Me?
- Yes.

513
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,660
I had no idea
that there would be a book...

514
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,430
about what I wrote.

515
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,160
What he wrote.

516
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,670
Were you torn...

517
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,070
when you had to choose one?

518
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,600
There are Pairing Books.

519
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,640
(Before leaving for Italy)

520
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,210
(The Pairing Books were delivered
to the residents.)

521
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,850
(The color that represents me, blue)

522
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,720
(The image of love in my mind,
drawn by me)

523
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,690
(It's a book of 33 answers
to the questions...)

524
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,290
(about marriage.)

525
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,500
(One favorite sentence about love
on the back of the book)

526
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,500
(About me, about love,)

527
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,700
(and about marriage)

528
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,340
(A book that holds my thoughts)

529
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,240
(The residents read each other's books...)

530
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,920
(and looked for the person
that was most compatible with them.)

531
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,320
(Did anyone make your heart flutter?)

532
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,620
Before going to Italy,

533
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,120
we asked the residents 33 questions...

534
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,390
about dating and marriage.

535
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,200
And the crew made books
using their answers.

536
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,370
We sent the books to the residents...

537
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,940
and had them choose a book
of the person that would suit them.

538
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,070
(I see.)

539
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,770
I bet they'll think,
"I hope this person wrote that book."

540
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,640
(It's so exciting!)

541
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,980
You're right!

542
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,820
Were you torn when you had to choose one?

543
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,950
- Not me.
- Did you pick one right away?

544
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,790
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,420
(Glancing)

546
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,300
I intensively read
all of them a few times.

547
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,300
But there were four books.

548
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,540
Were there four?

549
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,070
If a female resident received
four books...

550
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,340
Were there four books?

551
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,080
That's a different number.

552
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,640
- What?
- It's a different number.

553
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,380
- Seriously?
- I didn't get four.

554
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,050
There must have been three books
about women.

555
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,220
I guess there was
a different number of books.

556
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,490
We have...

557
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,390
We have one piece of information.

558
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,860
- We got three.
- Did I make a mistake?

559
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,630
- Sorry?
- We had three books.

560
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,960
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

561
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,060
(Surprised)

562
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,030
The guys realized
that there were more men than women.

563
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,100
Anyway, you said there were four.

564
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm not sure.

565
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,340
It may have been 4 books or 3 books.

566
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,170
She's adorable.

567
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,880
(Embarrassed)

568
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,110
So...

569
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,980
- I must have been mistaken for a second.
- You were mistaken.

570
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,620
She's thinking,
"I shouldn't have said that."

571
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,960
(Putting her head down)

572
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,430
(Twitching his lips)

573
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,800
(Another resident walks
toward the mansion.)

574
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,740
- It's a kitten.
- There's a cat.

575
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
She looks cool.

576
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,640
She looks like the heroine
of a Japanese youth film.

577
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,650
I want to marry someone...

578
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,790
with whom I can share small joys.

579
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,490
(The Fifth Resident, Ji Won)

580
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,620
(Nervous)

581
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,920
That's the sound
of someone entering, right?

582
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,990
(Pricking up his ears)

583
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,070
Can I get another glass of water?

584
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,370
Thank you.

585
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,370
Where are all the cups?

586
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,770
Hello.

587
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

588
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,580
- Hello.
- Have some water.

590
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,220
- Water.
- Thank you.

591
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,930
- Oh, the cups are behind us.
- Look at Woo Jae.

592
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,130
I think we can use them.

593
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,760
- His facial expression changed.
- Exactly.

594
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,060
- He looks so different.
- Yes.

595
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,830
We can use them, right?

596
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,900
Yes. Have a seat here. Over here.

597
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,610
Is this an empty seat? Thank you.

598
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
They don't know what to do.

599
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,780
- We could give her that.
- Right?

600
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,580
- Yes.
- Here's a new glass.

601
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,090
Okay. Thank you.

602
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,920
You can use the coat next to you.

603
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,130
The one under it.

604
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,100
- Thank you.
- But Je Yeon is also wearing a skirt.

605
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Do you want some more?

606
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,200
She looks kind of disappointed.

607
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,270
Thank you.

608
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,150
- You can put your coat here.
- If you don't mind.

609
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,280
Thank you.

610
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,490
(Chan Hyeong's coat was placed
on top of Woo Jae's coat.)

611
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,820
(Chan Hyeong's coat)

612
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,290
It wasn't Woo Jae's coat?

613
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,960
(There's been a mix-up.
It was Chan Hyeong's coat.)

614
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,660
(Chan Hyeong's coat)

615
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm going to stop drinking.

616
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,530
I can tell he's thinking,
"What just happened?"

617
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,370
(Flustered)

618
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,420
(Woo Jae was kind to Je Yeon.)

619
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,890
Woo Jae is a very delicate type.

620
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,430
(It feels like...)

621
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,460
(he gave Ji Won special treatment.)

622
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,630
Je Yeon noticed...

623
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,930
she's very different from her.

624
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,340
- She must be feeling some way.
- It's nice to have you.

625
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,570
Woo Jae's facial expression shifted
dramatically.

626
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,580
- Yes.
- His eyebrows are way up here.

627
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,110
I think Je Yeon noticed it too.

628
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,880
- Right.
- She did.

629
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,980
- Hi.
- Hi.

630
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,660
- Woo Jae certainly seems more tense.
- Yes.

631
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,560
May I ask what your name is?

632
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,620
I'm...

633
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,130
Ji Won.

634
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,400
Ji Won.

635
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,000
- Ji Won?
- Ji Won.

636
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,070
When did you arrive in Italy?

637
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,170
- The day before yesterday.
- The day before yesterday?

638
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,180
I think we all arrived
pretty much the same day. But he...

639
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,980
- I arrived yesterday.
- Really?

640
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,820
- I had a personal matter.
- Oh, I see.

641
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,190
I think he's struggling from jet lag.

642
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Me?

643
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,330
- You all didn't get enough sleep.
- No.

644
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,170
(Peeking)

645
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,470
She's looking.

646
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,010
(Feeling awkward)

647
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,650
We're all being shy.

648
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,690
We did talk about a few things.

649
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,500
(Awkward)

650
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,170
(Sunshine)

651
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,570
(She bursts into laughter.)

652
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,670
(The afternoon sunlight fills the room.)

653
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,440
Isn't the sunlight bothering you?

654
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,970
- The sunlight?
- Yes.

655
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,770
I was starting to feel bothered.

656
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,580
But I couldn't move.

657
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,410
- You're the only one with a halo.
- It's warm.

658
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,250
The crown of your head...

659
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,120
- Is it? Is it too bright?
- It's glowing.

660
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,220
(Laughing)

661
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,560
I think I should move.

662
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,060
He should naturally sit
next to Ji Won now.

663
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,200
- The last one will have to...
- There you go.

664
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,500
- sit there.
- Yes.

665
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,700
We should look around the house
when everyone gets here.

666
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,070
- Right.
- And we should eat.

667
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,240
That's right.

668
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,670
(A new female resident...)

669
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,780
(is driving toward the mansion.)

670
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,050
She looks amazing!

671
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,050
I think it's been about a year.

672
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,420
I focused more on work than dating...

673
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,590
for self-improvement.

674
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,090
And I didn't have that many chances.

675
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,160
Chances to meet new people.

676
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,430
I tend to judge
by how hard he works at his job...

677
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,330
and how confident he is.

678
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,410
(The Sixth Resident, Ha Neul)

679
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,410
(Light steps)

680
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,420
They're all so gorgeous!

681
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,720
Compared to other residents,
I can tell from her stride...

682
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,990
- that she's confident.
- She is.

683
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,330
I think someone's here.

684
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,940
I can't believe how loud
the footsteps are.

685
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,140
Right? The click-clack.

686
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,480
(The new resident's steps seem confident.)

687
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,780
Hello.

688
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,380
Hello.

689
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,320
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

690
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,590
(The Sixth Resident, Ha Neul)

691
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

692
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,430
The three women have
such different charms.

693
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,130
They do.

694
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,170
- Chan Hyeong seems the most nervous.
- Yes.

695
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,530
Chan Hyeong is...

696
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,300
- Ji Min isn't even getting up.
- Right.

697
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,470
You can sit there.

698
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,010
- Even Ji Min.
- Look at Ji Min!

699
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,080
His eyes are wide open.

700
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
(The air has changed.)

701
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,110
The air in the room shifted.

702
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,420
(Taking a look)

703
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,050
Hello.

704
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,720
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to meet you too.

705
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,090
Well, my cup's over there.

706
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,130
Right.

707
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,100
He's on the move.

708
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,500
Why don't I clear the space a bit?

709
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,540
I mean,

710
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,040
others will be joining us.

711
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,310
Chan Hyeong's suddenly more passionate.

712
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,440
- I know.
- Right?

713
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,480
- He's on the move.
- We have water for everyone.

714
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,110
(Smiling)

715
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,280
Thank you.

716
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,390
For the first time,
Chan Hyeong seems nervous.

717
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,620
(Politely)

718
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,750
This is amusing.

719
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,120
Thank you.

720
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,490
You must've all gotten here early.

721
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,360
It seems like I'm the last one here.

722
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,960
(Then...)

723
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,310
The third young woman to join us
has an exotic look.

724
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,380
- Right.
- Right?

725
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,250
We were introducing ourselves
in the order we came in.

726
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,590
My name is Ha Neul...

727
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,790
as in the sky.

728
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,660
- Ha Neul. Really?
- Yes.

729
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,960
- It's a pleasure.
- It's good to meet you.

730
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,460
This is our first time applauding.

731
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,870
You sort of led us in.

732
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,340
I know. That was a first for me.

733
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,870
Anyway, that was to celebrate
the gathering.

734
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,580
What were you up to, then?

735
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,310
We were chipping away at the awkwardness.

736
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
- I see.
- Right.

737
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,650
- Slowly, the awkwardness...
- I see.

738
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,650
- Right.
- That's right.

739
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,720
All that's left for us is to get closer.

740
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,260
That was sweet of her to say.

741
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,960
(Tempting)

742
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,160
Ha Neul doesn't seem shy or awkward.

743
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,300
Are you usually shy around people?

744
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:48,400
(Are you usually shy around people?)

745
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,670
Not really.

746
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,340
Right? You seem like an extrovert.

747
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,480
- Really?
- Yes.

748
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,350
You're right.

749
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,880
Like many do,
they talk about their MBTI personalities.

750
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,690
So, what's your MBTI personality type?

751
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,160
My MBTI?

752
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,860
(All eyes are on Je Yeon.)

753
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,560
(Nervous)

754
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,370
- She's an introvert.
- Yes, an introvert.

755
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,530
- I think she's an extrovert.
- I think so too.

756
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,870
That was out of the blue.

757
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,740
- That's...
- It's so obvious.

758
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,770
(Flustered)

759
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,870
Tell us if you're
an extrovert or an introvert.

760
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,870
- Yes, just that.
- We've only been discussing that.

761
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,910
- I'm an introvert.
- An introvert.

762
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,410
- I'm also an introvert.
- I see.

763
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,110
Meanwhile, I'm an extrovert.

764
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,220
I'm also an extrovert.

765
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,150
Really?

766
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,690
I'm an introvert.

767
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,590
There are three of each.

768
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,860
- It's perfectly balanced.
- Right.

769
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,360
(Smiling brightly)

770
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,230
(Je Yeon still seems shy.)

771
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,300
(Glancing)

772
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,840
It's not easy to sit there
because of the sunlight.

773
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,180
- It's warm.
- Are you good?

774
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,950
I switched seats after getting roasted.

775
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,020
- So you originally sat here.
- That's why.

776
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,050
You're now at a good seat.

777
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,320
We can make you a seat over here.

778
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,660
- We can clear this.
- It's fine.

779
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,130
We have to clear these anyway.

780
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,760
- I'm good with that.
- Then...

781
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,030
Let's move everything there.

782
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,060
- Were you using this?
- The cushion...

783
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,630
- "Were you using this?"
- You can keep it.

784
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,440
(Ha Neul stands there observing.)

785
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,670
Could you... Thanks.

786
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,840
(Busy in the living room)

787
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,540
I'll switch seats to over here then.

788
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,310
(In seconds, Ha Neul changes seats.)

789
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,280
I see you all have a cushion.

790
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,780
- I also had one.
- Right.

791
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,090
They seem nice.

792
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,660
- Don't you think you're too close?
- I can't help it.

793
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,320
- This is how we get closer, right?
- Right.

794
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,490
We do so by closing the gap.

795
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,830
I'll move a little bit closer to you.

796
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,100
People keep leaving Je Yeon's side.

797
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,100
(She's now in a cooler seat.)

798
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,570
(Proud)

799
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,140
(All 6 residents have gathered.)

800
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,750
This is so much fun.

801
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,120
What on earth?

802
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,290
After seeing how short Ji Won's skirt was,

803
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,660
Woo Jae insisted on giving her his coat.

804
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,820
(Woo Jae offered Ji Won his coat.)

805
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,230
- The one under it.
- He specifically told her...

806
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,460
which one it was, and I was impressed.

807
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,130
That's not something he demonstrated
when he was with Je Yeon.

808
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,130
- He didn't.
- No, he didn't.

809
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,800
Giving her his coat
hadn't occurred to him then.

810
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,910
That could've been...

811
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,070
because things were too awkward at first.

812
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,480
However, I saw a shift
in Je Yeon's expression.

813
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,050
At that moment, Je Yeon was slightly...

814
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,250
- disappointed.
- That's right.

815
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,350
Je Yeon seems like a decent person.

816
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,120
- She can't hide her feelings.
- Right.

817
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,220
She's like a glass bead.

818
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,160
- That's how I see her.
- I saw that too.

819
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,530
There's something peculiar about Ji Won.

820
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,660
- She looks cold from the side...
- That's right.

821
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,260
- but warmer straight on.
- Exactly.

822
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,870
If I'm to make a guess...

823
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,470
Already?

824
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,640
(This soon?)

825
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,140
I see a love triangle.

826
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,910
- A love triangle?
- Me too.

827
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,740
This is what I saw.

828
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,380
- A chain surrounding Woo Jae.
- Love pointing in different directions?

829
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,510
A chain.

830
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,110
They are tangled.

831
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,350
- That'd be heartbreaking.
- Je Yeon has feelings...

832
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,590
for Woo Jae, but he likes someone else.

833
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,790
The cruelest situation.

834
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,390
Woo Jae looked at Ji Won a lot.

835
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,390
- He reacted to her.
- Right.

836
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,730
Je Yeon caught that
and seemed upset about it.

837
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,760
She obviously knew...

838
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,270
- that he greeted Ji Won differently.
- Which was a fact.

839
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,600
And when Ha Neul walked in,
Chan Hyeong lit up.

840
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,670
- Obviously.
- He got busy.

841
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,740
Exactly.

842
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,670
It was like seeing Usain Bolt.

843
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,140
(Usain Chan Hyeong)

844
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,710
Doesn't Ha Neul seem
most glamorous to you?

845
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,280
- That's right.
- It's the same with her features.

846
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,580
She looks like an actress.

847
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,920
- She's cool and outspoken too.
- Right.

848
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,480
All that's left for us is to get closer.

849
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,850
She addressed the others
without being shy...

850
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,190
- and smiled a lot.
- She's lively too.

851
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,760
She also said she was an extrovert.

852
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,920
(A woman with many sides to her)

853
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,930
This is something I take note of.

854
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,690
I see whether women
cover their mouths when laughing.

855
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,000
Some worry about
how they'll look when laughing,

856
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,070
but Ha Neul laughed as is
without covering her face.

857
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,770
That tells you about her personality.

858
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,970
Je Yeon was seated
in one of the hottest seats in the room.

859
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,010
Right.

860
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,610
I bet Ha Neul
would've said something first.

861
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,010
That it was hot here
and that she'd like to move.

862
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,850
(Expressing it in person)

863
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,750
(The two couldn't be more different.)

864
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,490
It seemed to me...

865
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,260
that Ji Min was quite mindful of Je Yeon.

866
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,460
I agree.

867
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,030
- Right?
- There's something that spoke to me.

868
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,630
He smirked in a way
that seemed like he found her hesitant...

869
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,800
- and reserved personality to be cute.
- Exactly!

870
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,300
- There was a moment.
- He was trying to hold back his smile.

871
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,870
- Really?
- Like this.

872
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,940
He held back like this.

873
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,440
Did he really look like that?

874
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,810
- He might've looked different.
- Do you have something in your teeth?

875
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,780
It might've looked different, but anyway.

876
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,680
So is this the living room?

877
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,420
Yes, let's go that way.

878
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,960
- No way.
- This is incredible.

879
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,390
This is great.

880
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,060
(The residents take a tour
of the Pairing House.)

881
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,830
They have anything and everything.

882
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,190
There's even a chess set.

883
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,260
The meal has already been cooked.

884
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,670
I see. No way.

885
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,030
The meal's been cooked for us.

886
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,500
- Check that out.
- Gosh, the view.

887
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,040
What a fantastic view.

888
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,270
- My gosh.
- It's cozy.

889
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,010
That's a view
worth opening a bottle of wine for.

890
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,740
- A cat.
- There's even a cat.

891
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,080
Even the cat seems romantic.

892
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,980
- Tell me about it.
- What a charming place.

893
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,310
(Up the vintage stairs)

894
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,580
This place is amazing.

895
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,650
(Pairing House, Male resident room 1)

896
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,650
No way.

897
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,250
This is incredible.

898
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,990
This is amazing.

899
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,490
- Right?
- This looks like a framed photo.

900
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,300
It's so pretty.

901
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,670
Do we seriously get one room each?

902
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,170
- My gosh.
- It's so pretty.

903
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,230
The view is to die for.

904
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,440
(Pairing House, Female resident room 2)

905
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,340
- This is amazing.
- Right?

906
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
It'd be therapeutic to stay here.

907
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,610
I'm ecstatic.

908
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,880
I took photos earlier.

909
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,180
The view is that pretty.

910
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,920
There's a lot of blue in this room.

911
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,450
Exactly. Lots of blue.

912
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,020
While we're at it, let's keep heading up.

913
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,990
(Pairing House: Sunset Room)

914
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,190
This space is amazing.

915
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,230
No way.

916
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,460
My gosh.

917
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,200
(My gosh.)

918
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,100
- What an incredible view.
- This is grand.

919
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,740
- What a view.
- No way.

920
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,180
This is what you take photos of.

921
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,220
(Moving away)

922
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,390
(The men choose their rooms.)

923
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,760
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

924
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,190
- Right.
- It's nice and neat.

925
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,390
Right, I'll sleep alone.

926
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,030
Why were you contemplating just now?

927
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,590
- I don't mind sharing.
- Really?

928
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,700
- Normally...
- Then we'll share.

929
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,830
Sounds good.

930
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,130
I wrote down 2, 2, and 1.

931
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,130
(The women choose their rooms.)

932
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,370
This is how we're going to decide.

933
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,700
I got number one.

934
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,870
- I got 2.
- I got 2 as well.

935
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,340
- Sounds good.
- We'll bunk together.

936
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,310
Congratulations.

937
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,580
Would you like a plate?

938
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,680
(Their first brunch at the house)

939
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,350
- Sorry?
- I don't think this is edible.

940
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,750
I had some earlier.

941
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,690
(A man who is funnier than expected)

942
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,660
What's this? Is it a muffin?

943
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,760
(A man who unexpectedly
dives in without hesitation)

944
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,630
Even though I cut this,
I doubt anyone will eat it.

945
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,830
That looks good.

946
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,870
People bond over meals.

947
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,900
- That's important.
- When we eat,

948
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,600
- we display our culture.
- I taste pistachio.

949
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,070
You're right.

950
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,810
It's not that bad.

951
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,010
- It's so pretty.
- This can't be real.

952
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,810
(They enjoy their first sunset together.)

953
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,320
I was busy living my life one minute,

954
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,550
but I woke up one day in Italy.

955
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,590
I bet the feeling's mutual.

956
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,390
(I bet the feeling's mutual.)

957
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,430
This is breathtaking.

958
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,400
- I still can't wrap my head around it.
- Sorry?

959
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,640
It's so good that I can't believe it.

960
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,870
It still hasn't hit me fully
that I'm in Italy.

961
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,010
Where do you think we are, then?

962
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,280
It feels surreal.

963
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,690
(A room that lets you see the sunset
from all sides)

964
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,490
That must be the Sunset Room.

965
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,660
(Their first sun in Italy is setting.)

966
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,530
(During the next 5 days,)

967
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,160
(what kind of fate will Italy bring them?)

968
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,230
(Ji Won)

969
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,670
(Chan Hyeong)

970
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,240
(Woo Jae)

971
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,040
(Ha Neul)

972
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,270
(Je Yeon)

973
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,880
(Ji Min)

974
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,510
Did you talk about Italy before I arrived?

975
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,980
We asked the same questions...

976
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,450
whenever someone arrived.

977
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,990
Which were?

978
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,560
About the book.
Whether or not we picked them fast.

979
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,920
I'm the only one who missed your answers.

980
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,560
Were you quick to pick out a book?

981
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,660
Out of the options, I mean.

982
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,660
- Yes.
- I see.

983
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,330
How so?

984
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,630
Was there a paragraph
that spoke out to you?

985
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,340
I felt something
as soon as I read the first page.

986
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,770
What was the first page again?

987
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,510
- A drawing?
- "What makes me charming?"

988
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,540
Flirting, right?

989
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,880
For me,

990
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,420
I was intrigued by the artwork.

991
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,220
I wondered what it was,

992
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,020
and it caught my attention.

993
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,760
- Someone drew that.
- I thought it was a feather,

994
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,230
- but it was air.
- Really?

995
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,760
I think this person
is the most gifted painter.

996
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,330
I bet this person loves to work out.

997
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,070
A fitness enthusiast.

998
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,530
There was something calm about it.

999
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,610
The answer was quite memorable.

1000
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,570
"Which do you prefer
for your matrimonial home?"

1001
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,510
"Your own with a mortgage
or a rental without debt?"

1002
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,380
The answer was
"My own since I already have one."

1003
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,150
He also chose the answer
"sleeping deeply in our own rooms."

1004
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,650
That made me wonder
how easily his sleep is interrupted.

1005
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,590
I could tell...

1006
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,660
that he loves himself
and lives his life to the fullest.

1007
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,030
Whispering.

1008
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,300
He said whispering was also flirting.

1009
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,670
After an argument, he prefers...

1010
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,900
to take some time alone and then talk.

1011
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,940
That's someone I'd like to get to know.

1012
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,640
Was there anyone
who was close to your ideal man...

1013
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,880
judging by what he had written
in the book?

1014
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,550
Was there anyone?

1015
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,090
As for me...

1016
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:42,420
There was someone who shared views
that were similar to mine.

1017
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,360
I doubt it was easy
to clear your schedules like this.

1018
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,370
- I wonder what everyone does.
- Same here.

1019
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,440
How was your vacation?

1020
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,240
Did you go on one?

1021
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,040
I did...

1022
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,980
but for my job.

1023
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,310
- On business?
- Yes.

1024
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,810
Where did your business take you?

1025
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,080
- Sorry?
- Where abroad did you go?

1026
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,580
- I went to Saudi Arabia.
- I see.

1027
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,150
Gosh, Saudi Arabia.

1028
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,590
- Saudi Arabia?
- Saudi Arabia?

1029
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,420
Saudi Arabia?

1030
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,890
Is that enough of a clue though?

1031
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,700
Well...

1032
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,870
I was only there to eat.

1033
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,940
His family could own an oil company.

1034
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,000
An oil company?

1035
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,870
(What will happen here...)

1036
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,180
(until they find everything out
back in Seoul?)

1037
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,510
Who goes on a business trip
to Saudi Arabia?

1038
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,510
Someone in constructions?

1039
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,620
Constructions in Saudi Arabia?

1040
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,850
Wasn't that a thing in the 70s?

1041
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,020
That's what I thought. Is that so?

1042
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,050
(He went overboard with his prediction.)

1043
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,650
- That was the case for our uncles.
- Of course.

1044
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,220
Check out
"my annual income in five years."

1045
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,960
This is what Mr. Blue wrote.

1046
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,930
"More than
my annual income in five years,"

1047
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,700
"I'm looking forward
to the global impact I'll have."

1048
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,060
This must be Chan Hyeong.

1049
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,500
It has to be Chan Hyeong.
He was in Saudi Arabia to meet the royals.

1050
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,770
- To get people to invest?
- To meet oil tycoons.

1051
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,370
He was there to persuade people to invest.

1052
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,840
I think he works at a startup company.

1053
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,070
I agree.

1054
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,770
He's thinking about
taking the company public.

1055
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,440
- Maybe the company develops games.
- A Bitcoin company?

1056
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,940
A blockchain company? Possibly.

1057
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,680
Mr. Brown wrote, "Perhaps..."

1058
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,880
"with a good bonus,"

1059
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,080
"about 100,000 dollars."

1060
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,850
He must work in an office.

1061
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,290
Right.

1062
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,120
- I'd love to attend the wedding...
- The brown one?

1063
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,660
of the brown pairing book owner.

1064
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,630
It contains all the pain, suffering,

1065
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,800
and reality of a man.

1066
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,970
On his music playlist for his partner,

1067
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,840
- there is "Forgetful" by Yoon Jong Shin.
- Right.

1068
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,440
- My song, "Forgetful?"
- Yes.

1069
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,470
(The song's original composer is
surprised.)

1070
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,340
He experienced a proper breakup.

1071
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,370
(Goodness, Yong Shin.)

1072
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,880
The lyrics recall emotions
you have during a breakup.

1073
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,850
I feel like Mr. Brown is Ji Min.

1074
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,580
- Mr. Brown?
- I can see the hurt in his eyes.

1075
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,380
- That's possible.
- Right?

1076
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,420
(Could the brown pairing book belong
to Ji Min with melancholy eyes?)

1077
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,390
As they plan to get into a relationship,

1078
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,890
I thought of questions
they could ask each other.

1079
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:57,930
Here's an example.

1080
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,360
How to spend public holidays
after getting married.

1081
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,460
- Right.
- One, visiting each other's family.

1082
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,070
Two, visiting each other's family
before the holiday...

1083
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,500
and spending the holiday with each other
in private.

1084
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,540
- Right.
- It's an example.

1085
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,200
- Yes.
- It's so realistic.

1086
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,470
It's very realistic.

1087
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,270
I'm curious about this one.
Which do you want as newlyweds?

1088
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,240
- A house of your own with debt.
- Right.

1089
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,280
A house rented on key deposit money
without debt.

1090
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,810
Jong Shin, it's very realistic.

1091
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,280
We'll be able to guess their occupations
based on their salary in five years.

1092
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,580
I read Mr. Blue's response.

1093
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,250
He wrote, "What I'm doing now..."

1094
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,690
"will accumulate as time goes by."

1095
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,820
"I'd like to be evaluated
on the future value,"

1096
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,060
"not the present."

1097
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,030
"The future value?" Could he be
in the music industry?

1098
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,460
- Copyright?
- Something like that.

1099
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,200
Doesn't it accumulate?

1100
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,460
He could compose a lot of songs.

1101
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,270
Could Mr. Blue be Woo Jae?

1102
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,500
I think it's Woo Jae.

1103
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,040
He studied abroad for a year
when he was in high school.

1104
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
Didn't he bring up the battlefield?

1105
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,410
- He brought up studying abroad.
- Yes.

1106
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,510
It would be more interesting...

1107
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,810
to share the pairing books
with the viewers.

1108
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,350
- It'd be so interesting.
- Right?

1109
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,980
If you get to read these...

1110
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,720
(It's dinnertime at the Pairing House.)

1111
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,490
(Meticulous and neat)

1112
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,230
(My best household chore skills)

1113
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,300
(Cleaning, throwing out trash,
catching bugs)

1114
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,430
Isn't washing dishes
his best household chore skill?

1115
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,470
Washing dishes was one of them.

1116
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,800
(I tend to wash dishes
quickly and neatly.)

1117
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,340
Mr. Blue must be Woo Jae.

1118
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,240
- I don't know where garlic is.
- It should also be outside.

1119
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,340
There's everything here.

1120
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,610
When did you come downstairs?

1121
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,050
I'm cold.

1122
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,080
Why is it so cold?

1123
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,350
You should put more clothes on.
It's still cold.

1124
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,650
- Shall I put on a padded jacket?
- Yes.

1125
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,920
I saw tomatoes over here.

1126
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,990
Everything is here.

1127
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,990
I had no idea. Why did I not notice?

1128
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,560
- How about noodles?
- Potatoes...

1129
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,860
There's this type of noodles.

1130
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:43,930
(Men gather around Ha Neul.)

1131
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:44,970
There they are.

1132
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,000
Let's see.

1133
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,770
- Which type of noodles do you want?
- These button mushrooms.

1134
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,670
- As expected, Ha Neul is active.
- Button mushrooms?

1135
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,640
- Button mushrooms sound good.
- She's active.

1136
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,640
- With onions.
- Shall I grill button mushrooms...

1137
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,010
- with the meat?
- Ji Won seems introverted.

1138
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,080
Right.

1139
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,750
- Will you take off the top?
- Yes.

1140
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,680
That's the button mushroom house.

1141
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,550
What type of pasta noodles do you like?

1142
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,120
Which is better, cream or tomato sauce?

1143
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,420
Could everyone tell me what they like?

1144
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,190
I think...

1145
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,360
you have a low chance of failing
with tomato sauce.

1146
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,030
Assuming that they're both successful.

1147
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,100
He's going to succeed.

1148
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,540
- Is that so?
- Of course.

1149
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,840
Ji Min is more talkative than before.

1150
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,540
I knew it.

1151
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,940
(An hour ago
during their outing for the sunset)

1152
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,010
(Glancing)

1153
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,280
Didn't you say that you're good
at julienning green onions?

1154
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,690
They're over there.

1155
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,290
What are you going to make
with green onions?

1156
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,020
- You can be in charge of that.
- Right.

1157
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,960
- In charge of green onions.
- I'll cut them.

1158
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,500
There are a lot of them.

1159
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,330
- Without hesitation,
- Shall we pick them?

1160
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,870
Ha Neul talks to others and laughs.

1161
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,930
This one too.

1162
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,270
(Amicable)

1163
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,900
- This is...
- We look like good cooks.

1164
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,170
- Ji Won is paying attention to Ji Min.
- We made a ridiculous choice.

1165
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,570
What kind of pasta do you like?

1166
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,940
- I like both.
- Me too.

1167
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,950
Both?

1168
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,150
I'll make whatever you want.

1169
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,720
- You don't want to sleep early, do you?
- Could Ji Won be interested...

1170
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,020
in Ji Min?

1171
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,620
(Glancing quietly)

1172
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,720
There are onions without skin.

1173
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,060
We have a lot of onions.

1174
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,220
There's nothing we can do.

1175
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,030
I know. He's doing everything for us.

1176
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,300
She's approaching him.

1177
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,330
(Je Yeon approaches Woo Jae.)

1178
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,540
You don't have to be sorry.

1179
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,670
- Oh, my.
- Do you feel sorry?

1180
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,980
We'll do the dishes after dinner.

1181
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,680
We can do them together.

1182
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,180
Je Yeon is interested in Woo Jae.

1183
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,950
Why do you have your hands together?

1184
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,620
I didn't do anything wrong.

1185
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,760
I found a hint.

1186
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,160
She's hovering around Woo Jae.

1187
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,230
(Je Yeon is hanging around Woo Jae.)

1188
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,770
Someone said hovering.

1189
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,500
Someone said she hovers
when she's interested.

1190
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,670
- Right?
- I have the page open.

1191
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,640
- Sky blue.
- My secret flirting skills.

1192
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,840
Hovering around him.

1193
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,410
- Could it be Je Yeon?
- Je Yeon must be sky blue.

1194
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,780
- Je Yeon must like Woo Jae.
- Right.

1195
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,250
It's already obvious in Episode One.

1196
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,650
Seriously.

1197
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,020
I thought her color was green.

1198
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,190
(Je Yeon might be flirting with him
by hovering around him.)

1199
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,760
You should play a board game.

1200
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,330
- Why don't we go upstairs?
- Okay.

1201
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,630
(Woo Jae, Je Yeon, and Ji Won spend
some time together.)

1202
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,930
Can you guess which one is who
based on your feelings?

1203
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,740
You mean, the book?

1204
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes, the book.

1205
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,040
Can you guess?

1206
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,480
I have a better idea than before.

1207
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,210
I see.

1208
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,510
(Thinking)

1209
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,680
We were talking about how I won
rock-paper-scissors.

1210
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,880
Really?

1211
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,690
(Woo Jae showed confidence
about rock-paper-scissors.)

1212
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,060
I have experience.

1213
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,390
You're good at playing
rock-paper-scissors?

1214
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:57,890
(Glancing)

1215
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:00,330
(Woo Jae is good at playing
rock-paper-scissors.)

1216
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,200
I picked blue.

1217
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,670
He's good at playing rock-paper-scissors?

1218
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,340
That was interesting.

1219
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,570
(I don't have a supernatural power,
but I'm good at rock-paper-scissors.)

1220
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,510
Love where the fluttering of the heart
leads to comfort?

1221
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,080
I thought that was similar...

1222
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,850
to my image of love.

1223
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,080
Could Woo Jae be Mr. Blue?

1224
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,780
It'd be amazing if it's right.

1225
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,620
(Could Woo Jae be Mr. Blue
whom Je Yeon picked?)

1226
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,660
Je Yeon definitely seems interested
in Woo Jae.

1227
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,190
If I had known that
they would make a book with it,

1228
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,730
- Right.
- I'd have written it more carefully.

1229
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,500
That could be a hint.

1230
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,900
Really? That's true.

1231
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,530
- Really?
- Is that so?

1232
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,900
(Smiling)

1233
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,200
I should be quiet.

1234
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,900
It's okay. Now I know.

1235
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,670
You seem sure of yourself.

1236
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,380
You're full of confidence.

1237
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,640
(Thinking hard)

1238
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,910
I think Ms. Green is Je Yeon.

1239
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,880
- What?
- I see.

1240
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,120
I thought that Ji Won was Ms. Green.

1241
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,450
Ms. Green is Je Yeon.

1242
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,260
I'm sure of it.

1243
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,860
- It could be Je Yeon...
- It's likely to be Je Yeon.

1244
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,860
because she's very introverted.

1245
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,930
My MBTI type?

1246
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,670
(Staring)

1247
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,240
(Je Yeon got shy when
everyone was paying attention to her.)

1248
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,370
It said that she liked to be at home.

1249
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,940
- Didn't Ms. Green seem...
- Right.

1250
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,570
- like her?
- Yes.

1251
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,910
There was much less content
in the sky blue book.

1252
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,980
(Her first impression made them think
she was straightforward.)

1253
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,450
- Ji Won must be Ms. Sky Blue.
- I agree.

1254
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,680
- She's definitely sky blue.
- Yes.

1255
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,820
(It'd depend on how hard I work.)

1256
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,620
A lot was written in the green book.

1257
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,790
- Right.
- Yes.

1258
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,050
That left a strong impression on me.

1259
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,720
- The two were very different.
- Right.

1260
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,520
I think so too.

1261
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,530
Ms. White must be Ha Neul.

1262
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,230
Ha Neul is the white one.

1263
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,000
I agree with you on the white book,

1264
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,830
- but the other two should be switched.
- Really?

1265
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,700
The books were only writing.

1266
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,210
You can only get a vibe from them,

1267
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,740
but as we spend time together...

1268
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,480
Right.

1269
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,980
(Staring)

1270
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,380
(What does Woo Jae really mean?)

1271
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,620
It looks like suyuk.

1272
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,620
Right, it's becoming strange.

1273
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,050
- Suyuk?
- The meat is very thick.

1274
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,420
Is this really a steak?

1275
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:10,960
- Of course.
- Is it?

1276
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,190
Is it usually this thick?

1277
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,390
We're in Italy, after all.

1278
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,960
(Their Italian-style dinner is
being prepared.)

1279
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,630
Do you like your room?

1280
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,970
I think sharing a room with someone is...

1281
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,370
- better than having your own.
- I see.

1282
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,640
Getting to know each other quickly is
the most important.

1283
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,810
Ha Neul.

1284
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,150
Your name is...

1285
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,680
very hard to forget.

1286
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,820
- My name is easy to remember.
- Right?

1287
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,820
(Glancing)

1288
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,120
She looked at him.

1289
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,550
(Where Ha Neul is looking)

1290
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,120
(Staring)

1291
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,060
- Chan Hyeong.
- Yes?

1292
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,290
Ji Won.

1293
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,730
Ji Min.

1294
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,860
Ji Min?

1295
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,430
(Ha Neul called Ji Min to get closer.)

1296
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,140
Ha Neul knows how to act cute.

1297
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,970
Over here is...

1298
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:02,280
(About 3 hours ago
while taking a look at the house)

1299
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,340
It's very...

1300
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,580
Do you want to take a rest?

1301
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,250
- Me?
- Yes.

1302
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,450
- I didn't sleep much yesterday.
- You must be tired.

1303
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,980
Right? You must be tired.

1304
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,720
- Is it obvious?
- No.

1305
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,650
I couldn't sleep much.

1306
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,490
Aren't you the introverted type?

1307
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,020
What do you mean?

1308
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,230
- Your MBTI.
- I'm extroverted.

1309
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,660
Are you extroverted?

1310
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,800
Actually, I'm extroverted.

1311
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,060
But you're introverted now
because you're tired.

1312
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,800
Right. I didn't get to sleep much
because I got here late.

1313
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,670
- I arrived yesterday.
- You arrived yesterday?

1314
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,570
Why don't we take a break upstairs?

1315
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,640
- Shall we?
- We can...

1316
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,110
come back down after watching the sunset.

1317
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,240
(Ji Min has been on Ha Neul's mind.)

1318
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,780
Ji Min and Ha Neul?

1319
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,280
Don't they make a good match?

1320
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,250
- Button mushrooms?
- Oh, yes.

1321
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,850
- Button mushrooms.
- How many should I cut?

1322
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,220
Button mushrooms.

1323
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,130
Could you cut four of them?

1324
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,430
(Chopping)

1325
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,370
You cut the mushrooms nicely.

1326
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,840
- I know how to cut mushrooms.
- Right.

1327
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,200
That's amazing.

1328
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,970
You're good at cooking.

1329
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,240
It sounds like she's making fun of you.

1330
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,440
Gosh, you're really good.

1331
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,710
- She's being mischievous.
- That's cute.

1332
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,680
- I like Ha Neul. She's cute.
- Should I add the noodles...

1333
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,380
when the sauce gets reduced?

1334
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,490
Cook the noodles separately.

1335
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,890
Right.

1336
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,090
(Nodding)

1337
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Oops.

1338
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,290
She said it.

1339
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,460
What I said was nonsense.

1340
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,730
My head feels...

1341
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,000
Just blame the time difference.

1342
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,770
I thought of it as making ramyeon.

1343
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,970
Right. Ramyeon seasoning.

1344
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,540
- All of them are extroverted.
- Right.

1345
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,380
They might already have
their arms around each other.

1346
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,980
Exactly. While cooking.

1347
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,010
They probably will.

1348
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,950
They become like Christmas trees at night.

1349
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,280
- They're lit.
- You're right.

1350
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,190
It's Christmas.

1351
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,120
Here's what's good about it.

1352
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,720
- We'll spend Christmas together.
- I won't be spending Christmas alone.

1353
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,530
I definitely thought that I'd spend
Christmas alone.

1354
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,960
All my friends are...

1355
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,630
married.

1356
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,070
Or they're in long-term relationships.

1357
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,070
Right, it's the same for me.

1358
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,570
I don't get to see them on weekends.

1359
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,870
All my friends started a family.

1360
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,280
I'm not lonely, but I'm bored.

1361
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,350
Last November,
I had no appointment on weekends.

1362
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,320
- Really?
- Yes.

1363
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,690
It's not that
there's something wrong with me.

1364
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,460
Wait, let me think about that.

1365
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,460
- He must be quite old.
- I had no appointment at all.

1366
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,830
He must be over 30.

1367
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,660
We'll spend Christmas together this year.

1368
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,660
- Isn't that great?
- Yes.

1369
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,930
- We'll be with a group of people.
- Exactly.

1370
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,070
Who knows how to open this?

1371
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,100
Goodness.

1372
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,440
Don't you just turn the lid?

1373
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,810
- Don't you just turn it?
- It didn't work.

1374
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,810
Doesn't it grind?

1375
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,140
Doesn't it grind when you tear it?

1376
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,710
Maybe I'm wrong.

1377
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,380
If there's no hole when I open it...

1378
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,350
I think there is.

1379
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,750
(Exclaiming)

1380
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,520
She's very responsive.

1381
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,220
Personally, I like Ha Neul's personality.

1382
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,750
It's their first day.

1383
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,190
She's kind to many people.

1384
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,660
- Right, that's a good thing.
- It's not bad.

1385
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,160
They still have many days left.

1386
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,800
I think there is.

1387
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,030
(Exclaiming)

1388
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,300
(They hear laughter down the corridor.)

1389
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,670
I don't know where it is.

1390
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,670
Aren't all of us introverted?

1391
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,310
- Only the introverted ones...
- We're all introverted.

1392
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,340
You're right.

1393
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,440
They're introverted.
The others are extroverted.

1394
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,610
I see.

1395
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,450
- Goodness.
- But this is...

1396
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,080
- No, it's...
- You can put your hand through.

1397
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,650
(Bothered)

1398
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,090
Shall we go and check on them?

1399
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,560
- Sure.
- I'm curious.

1400
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Okay.

1401
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,530
(They go to the place
where it bothers them.)

1402
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,200
We don't need an oven. It's working.

1403
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,260
- It's finally working.
- Why don't we put one...

1404
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,430
- in the oven?
- This one?

1405
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,970
The frying pan is already heated.

1406
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,630
Which one shall we use?

1407
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,170
(Smiling)

1408
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,540
- What were you doing?
- Where were you?

1409
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,870
We were in the living room.

1410
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,040
Ha Neul, do we keep the cheese
in room temperature...

1411
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,510
- after opening it?
- Yes.

1412
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,450
- What?
- Can we keep it in room temperature?

1413
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,480
Yes.

1414
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,780
Am I a cook or something?

1415
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,420
I want to put black gloves on you.

1416
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,990
Black gloves?

1417
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,220
You look like...

1418
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,190
her bodyguards.

1419
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,990
Because we're wearing black?

1420
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,460
You look like bodyguards
who are protecting her.

1421
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,900
They're crowding around Ha Neul.

1422
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,960
- That's funny.
- Yes.

1423
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,500
Oh, no. Goodness.

1424
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,170
(Dying to talk)

1425
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,640
- He's an amazing cook.
- Really?

1426
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,740
She keeps making fun of me.

1427
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,240
- She keeps making fun of me.
- A genie...

1428
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,480
He did all of the cooking.

1429
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,050
(Soon, Ha Neul is teasing Ji Min.)

1430
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,110
Mr. Cook.

1431
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,750
(Mr. Cook)

1432
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,620
- Does it look good?
- Yes.

1433
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,020
Are you sure?

1434
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,090
Talk to him.

1435
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,260
(Ha Neul and Ji Min seem very close.)

1436
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,230
- Do you add the pasta water?
- Yes.

1437
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:46,930
Add just a little.

1438
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,970
Who wants to try it
and see if it's cooked?

1439
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,040
- Who wants to try?
- Me.

1440
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,140
Isn't it slightly sour?

1441
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,870
I'm just joking.

1442
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,480
Ji Won keeps glancing at them.

1443
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,580
Rock-paper-scissors.

1444
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,910
(Ji Won keeps being bothered by them.)

1445
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,550
(Ha Neul is teaching Ji Min how to cook.)

1446
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,520
Don't hold it like this. Hold the end.

1447
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,320
- In one direction?
- Yes.

1448
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,020
Just pour it...

1449
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,490
as much as you want. Only on one side?

1450
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,930
She keeps staring.

1451
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:19,960
How much?

1452
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,400
- You're good at cooking.
- Yes.

1453
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,370
He's got himself a concept.

1454
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,170
You've done it yourself.

1455
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,670
(Smiling)

1456
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,840
And I don't even know your name.

1457
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,080
(Smiling)

1458
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,150
Where's the olive oil from earlier?

1459
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,750
- Can I use this one?
- Yes, go ahead.

1460
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,290
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1461
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,390
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

1462
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,460
We're doing this first.

1463
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,900
We'll be able to cook well in Korea.

1464
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,100
Are we splitting into teams already?

1465
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,560
Look at their expressions changing.

1466
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,670
(Ha Neul leads the two men at ease.)

1467
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,170
- I think it's easy to remake.
- Exactly.

1468
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,340
I'll make sure to dig in.

1469
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,840
We'll be able to have dinner now.

1470
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,470
- I think it's cooked.
- Yes.

1471
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,380
- The plating is great.
- Right?

1472
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,650
It's a cooked dish.

1473
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,480
Put some cheese on top.

1474
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,480
- This shot needs to be taken.
- Right?

1475
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,750
Cheese, please.

1476
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,720
It grates well on top.

1477
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,420
(Dumbfounded)

1478
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,760
It's my first time using it.

1479
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,360
- I didn't know.
- He said, "It doesn't work."

1480
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,630
I have weak hands.

1481
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,100
Are you hungry? Please dig in.

1482
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,100
- You made it.
- Oh, gosh.

1483
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,640
(An Emotionally Sensitive Reaction)

1484
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,940
(Working hard)

1485
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,580
(With Chan Hyeong's lead,
the steak is done.)

1486
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,880
It looks good.

1487
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,650
(Wine to accompany the meat)

1488
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,810
The wine is out.

1489
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,980
(Impressed)

1490
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,520
(Glancing)

1491
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,400
(Staring)

1492
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,770
Ha Neul is clearly conscious of Ji Min.

1493
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,900
- Ha Neul is interested in Ji Min.
- Yes.

1494
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,040
For sure.

1495
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,870
(Glancing)

1496
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,340
Unlike in the beginning,
many are interested in Ji Min.

1497
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,580
(And Je Yeon's eyes are set on...)

1498
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,250
(3. My soul food)

1499
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,480
(I love all kinds of food,)

1500
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,750
(but if I had to pick one, it'd be meat.)

1501
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,980
It's finally done.

1502
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,050
- Thank you.
- Should I pour the wine?

1503
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,020
Since everyone's a lightweight,
let's have half a glass.

1504
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:31,060
Salt and... Season it to your taste.

1505
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,290
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1506
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,960
(It's the first dinner together.)

1507
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,040
They make good eye contact.

1508
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,340
The two are absolute extroverts.

1509
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,270
- I hope it's good.
- Same here.

1510
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,110
But the meat has cooled down and such.

1511
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,650
- It's good.
- Please be nice as it's the first day.

1512
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,910
- It can't be bad.
- True.

1513
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,490
Please take a piece of the meat
and try it.

1514
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the meal.

1515
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,900
You'll probably have to sprinkle
more salt.

1516
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,260
(Curious)

1517
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,540
Is it okay?

1518
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,440
It's cold.

1519
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,570
(Laughing)

1520
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,880
(Taken aback)

1521
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,240
- But it's edible.
- There's...

1522
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,310
Her expression is like, "What's going on?"

1523
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,880
She's in a slightly bad mood.

1524
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,690
- No. Should I cook it again?
- Sorry?

1525
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,290
- Should I cook it more?
- What?

1526
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,560
- Should I cook it more?
- No.

1527
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,130
It's not that bad.

1528
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,460
The meat is cold.

1529
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,200
After it was done, we...

1530
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,900
- It's good. Yes.
- Really?

1531
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,170
- What a relief.
- Thank you.

1532
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,070
- How nice. She's a kind person.
- Right?

1533
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,170
"Kind..."

1534
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:55,810
(Glancing)

1535
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,840
(She's focused on the meat again.)

1536
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,550
- What's this?
- He's interested in her.

1537
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,880
- Now that we know how to make it.
- We know now.

1538
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,120
Shall we try it again tomorrow?

1539
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,120
Let us cook again tomorrow.
A chance to make up for it.

1540
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

1541
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,030
It would've been better if it were warm.

1542
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,690
How cute.

1543
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,670
I'm not sure if the noodles are cooked.

1544
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,430
Are the noodles cooked?

1545
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,800
- Yes.
- I see.

1546
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,040
It's fully cooked.

1547
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,370
I'm glad.

1548
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,610
The noodles are cooked.

1549
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,680
Ha Neul is the proactive one.

1550
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,380
He practically ate
uncooked noodles earlier.

1551
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,680
You had it tough.

1552
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,790
- It was good.
- Was it?

1553
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,230
The onions are good, too.

1554
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:50,960
- The seasoning is...
- It's good.

1555
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,030
He's a great cook.

1556
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,100
- She keeps looking at him.
- He made all of these.

1557
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,870
(Ha Neul keeps teasing Ji Min.)

1558
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,910
He sliced all the ingredients.

1559
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,510
The cook.

1560
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,820
(The two have an inside joke.)

1561
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,050
(Nodding)

1562
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,120
With fire.

1563
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,390
(Smiling brightly)

1564
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,860
Ji Won seems slightly uncomfortable.

1565
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,260
- Yes. She's not all that comfortable.
- Right?

1566
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,400
(Je Yeon focuses on eating
without a word.)

1567
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,240
Since you're drinking it.

1568
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,380
Do you like drinking?

1569
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:40,780
Me?

1570
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,120
I do.

1571
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,220
I think I like drinking.

1572
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,730
What do you like to drink the most?

1573
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,130
I like whiskey...

1574
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,660
and wine.

1575
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,300
(Glancing)

1576
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,240
- I'm not the picky type.
- I see.

1577
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,610
(Glancing)

1578
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,120
Do you like to drink?

1579
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,220
- She mustered up the courage to ask.
- Exactly.

1580
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,860
- Just with some food.
- Her tone of voice was different.

1581
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,990
I like to accompany drinks with food.

1582
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:27,730
I like soju.

1583
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,030
- Me too.
- Really?

1584
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,530
What a surprise.

1585
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,470
Ji Won's body keeps facing Ji Min.

1586
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,540
Her eyes follow him, too.

1587
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,770
Ha Neul and Ji Won are rivals.

1588
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:42,140
- There's a tension between them.
- Yes.

1589
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,280
Ha Neul isn't smiling.

1590
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,550
We should take this out.

1591
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,080
We're done with it.

1592
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,120
I'll put it back.

1593
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,590
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

1594
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,760
(As soon as Ji Min leaves...)

1595
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,460
(Smiling)

1596
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,600
(Smiling)

1597
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,470
Oh, no.

1598
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,870
(Here it is, smiling with their eyes.)

1599
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,840
They're not actually smiling, are they?

1600
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,170
Is that the so-called smile
that women talk about?

1601
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,380
Ji Won and Ha Neul...

1602
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,280
- find each other uncomfortable. Right?
- Yes.

1603
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,580
Ji Won is like,

1604
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,280
"Ha Neul, your moves..."

1605
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,880
"are overboard."

1606
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,220
- "I can tell."
- Really?

1607
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,350
Ji Won kept watching her.

1608
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,260
She did whenever Ha Neul overreacted.

1609
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,460
(Ji Won looked at Ha Neul
when she exaggerated.)

1610
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,360
- Was the cause Ji Min?
- Yes.

1611
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,430
- It's mainly because of him, right?
- Seems like it.

1612
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,560
From day one?
But they must be there for a month.

1613
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,800
There are times when men are in between,

1614
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,140
but there's a pride between women.

1615
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:45,270
There's something you can feel
when the two can't get along.

1616
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,070
Like in high school,
when you're bothered by a classmate...

1617
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,140
you can't get along with.

1618
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,480
- The style...
- It doesn't mix well.

1619
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,950
From what I see, it's an eyesore.

1620
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,820
This is when it all starts.

1621
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:02,460
(There's silence once again.)

1622
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,490
Je Yeon isn't reacting at all.

1623
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,530
The atmosphere is a bit...

1624
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,900
They should go easy on the first day.

1625
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,800
What do you usually eat for breakfast?

1626
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,540
I...

1627
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,940
The last one.

1628
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1629
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,210
I eat salad,

1630
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,180
bagels, and such.

1631
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,690
- A simple breakfast?
- Yes, a simple breakfast.

1632
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,060
How is it?

1633
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,730
- It's too tough.
- Is it?

1634
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,030
- It's too...
- Is it tough?

1635
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,400
- We should've taken it out earlier.
- Did we have to take it out earlier?

1636
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,170
We know how to make it now.

1637
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,640
It's a conversation
only the three who cooked can have.

1638
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,970
- Right.
- Be careful.

1639
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,270
It's tough, right?

1640
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,380
(Chewing)

1641
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,350
Is the meat really tough?

1642
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,380
- You're still chewing on it.
- It's like rubber.

1643
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,820
Have you not swallowed it yet?

1644
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,330
He's still chewing.

1645
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,360
(Smirking)

1646
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,630
I'm having a rough time.

1647
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,730
Down it with wine.

1648
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,400
It's your first bite, right?

1649
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,240
It's no joke, isn't it?

1650
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,610
(Surprised)

1651
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:29,880
It must bother her.

1652
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,880
I get why he's still chewing it.

1653
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,550
It's still good.

1654
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,190
- She's good at reacting.
- Right?

1655
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,230
- Ji Won finds it unpleasant, right?
- Yes.

1656
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:50,600
- Is that so?
- And she makes it obvious.

1657
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,570
(Glancing)

1658
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,570
(Getting up)

1659
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,870
It's Woo Jae for Je Yeon.

1660
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,940
Go and hang around him.

1661
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Exactly.

1662
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,140
(Looking around)

1663
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,980
(Ji Won tries to get some pasta.)

1664
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,620
You've got pasta on your sleeve.

1665
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:10,650
Really?

1666
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,490
(Getting up)

1667
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,520
Oh, my.

1668
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,060
Where?

1669
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,590
- Where?
- Where?

1670
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,860
- I can't see it.
- Me, neither.

1671
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,230
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

1672
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,330
What did he see?

1673
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,430
- Is it only visible to him?
- Oh, my.

1674
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,400
Can we use that?

1675
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,200
We wiped wine with it.

1676
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,210
He must be really tired.

1677
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,010
- What is it?
- There's nothing on her.

1678
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,040
If not, she can use this later
to wipe things off.

1679
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,550
Her sleeve touched the food.

1680
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,150
- I see.
- Thank you.

1681
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,220
We were like, "What? What did you see?"

1682
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,520
Her sleeve touched the pasta.

1683
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,120
I'm sorry.

1684
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,460
She looks so happy.

1685
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,530
Ji Won.

1686
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,900
(Smiling)

1687
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,030
My goodness.

1688
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,360
(Concerned)

1689
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,640
- Ha Neul's face...
- Ha Neul's face is clouded over.

1690
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,200
- Yes, slightly.
- Right?

1691
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,670
Why did Ji Won get up together?

1692
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,170
Mirroring?

1693
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,840
That's possible. If you watch one person,

1694
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,680
you stand up when they suddenly do.

1695
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,180
- Yes.
- Because you were focused on them?

1696
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,350
And in Ji Won's standpoint,

1697
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,290
she wanted to show Ha Neul that...

1698
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,720
- Ji Min was aware of her.
- Yes.

1699
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,090
"It's not you. It's me."

1700
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,360
Feelings stronger than expected
went back and forth.

1701
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,560
True.

1702
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,800
(The dinner continues
in an odd mix of emotions.)

1703
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,260
I heard you talked about MBTI.

1704
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,570
We're all introverts.

1705
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,100
- Yes.
- And you're all extroverts.

1706
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,770
- Is that how we're split up?
- You're right.

1707
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,040
- That's interesting.
- For real.

1708
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,940
We were having a quiet conversation.

1709
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,280
Weren't we loud?

1710
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,780
We thought you'd have arms
around each other in the kitchen.

1711
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:52,320
She keeps looking at him.

1712
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:55,660
- Did you share the rest after the I?
- Yes.

1713
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,460
Can you share it with us?

1714
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,160
(Thinking)

1715
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:04,760
- My MBTI is INFJ.
- INFJ?

1716
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:07,430
Mine's ISFJ.

1717
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,140
Only one letter is different.

1718
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,310
I'm an ESFJ.

1719
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,580
- We have the same MBTI.
- Same here.

1720
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:17,740
- What?
- Really?

1721
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,580
- The three are the same?
- They have the same MBTI.

1722
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,650
The result comes out
as a sociable diplomat.

1723
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:23,820
It felt like...

1724
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,390
you were very sociable.

1725
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,020
Nice. Our group is exactly like that.

1726
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,090
- So the three of you are the same.
- And you?

1727
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,760
Mine is ISTP.

1728
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,800
ISTP?

1729
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,700
- The only thinker.
- You're the only thinker.

1730
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,400
- Am I the only thinker?
- Yes.

1731
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,640
And the only prospector. Right?

1732
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,800
Really?

1733
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,810
Please evaluate the taste.

1734
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,550
"This one's too cold."

1735
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,980
"It's too sour."

1736
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,350
How is it as a thinker?

1737
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,790
As a thinker, it's good.

1738
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,320
Is it? What a relief.

1739
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,750
Do thinkers not react well?

1740
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,160
No. I'm a thinker too.

1741
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:09,100
What time should we have
breakfast tomorrow?

1742
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,600
We don't have to set a time.

1743
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,300
Those tired can sleep in.

1744
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,140
We should get a good night's rest
for a day.

1745
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,240
How about 10 a.m.? Or 11 a.m.?

1746
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,070
You don't have to worry about me.

1747
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,670
Eat whenever you'd like.

1748
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,840
And I come to the restaurant at any time.

1749
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,510
- "Restaurant?"
- I'll just leave some there.

1750
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,150
How funny.

1751
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,990
Her reaction...

1752
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,620
She has great reactions.

1753
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,920
(Embarrassed)

1754
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,190
Oh, no.

1755
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,030
That's bad.

1756
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,470
There's a subtle rivalry
between the women.

1757
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,540
(For a moment, there's silence.)

1758
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,950
It was a battle of reactions.

1759
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:05,990
(The battle of reactions was smothering.)

1760
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,550
If we evaluate it, Ha Neul reacts...

1761
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,890
like a volleyball player.

1762
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,860
She reacts to everything.

1763
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,230
(An enthusiastic reaction
boosts likability.)

1764
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,730
- And the other party feels an attraction.
- Yes.

1765
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,300
Because she reacts to everything.

1766
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,070
- Reacting to something requires effort.
- Exactly.

1767
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,230
Those who made the effort...

1768
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,840
usually got a lot of votes
on the first day...

1769
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,440
- on "Heart Signal."
- True.

1770
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,910
As expected
from a love reality show lover.

1771
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,410
- I remember everything.
- She's extraordinary.

1772
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,440
- A love reality show lover.
- Yes.

1773
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,150
Ji Won actively compliments others...

1774
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,480
and builds up men's pride.

1775
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,920
Volleyball-wise, she's a server.

1776
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:42,090
If you think about it, Je Yeon is amazing.
She doesn't react.

1777
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,660
- She's a bench member.
- She's shadowboxing.

1778
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:46,930
- She's playing a one-person sport.
- Yes.

1779
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,760
- She's playing alone.
- Alone.

1780
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,130
- Like squash.
- Like marathon.

1781
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,530
Yes. I like that one. Marathon.

1782
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,870
- A one-person sport.
- So...

1783
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:56,840
I think Je Yeon and Woo Jae
might make a good couple.

1784
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,310
They were the only two people
who seemed composed throughout dinner.

1785
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,810
They might be able to
feel a great sense...

1786
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,080
of stability from each other.

1787
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,680
It would be quite entertaining...

1788
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,350
to watch them have dinner
after getting married.

1789
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,250
- "It's tasty." "Yes."
- Like a quiet family.

1790
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,650
(Paired as a quiet couple)

1791
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,590
(Will being responsive be important
in pairing with someone?)

1792
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,960
I don't know if we can see stars here.

1793
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,390
- Stars.
- We're deep in the countryside.

1794
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,500
- That's so romantic.
- That sounds great.

1795
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,100
- You'll fall asleep before then, right?
- We have to stay up until then.

1796
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,230
I might go to sleep.

1797
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:31,000
Seriously.
I don't even think I can stay up now.

1798
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,270
I'm so sleepy.

1799
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,680
- You didn't sleep on the plane?
- No.

1800
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,150
Why not?

1801
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,780
- You couldn't fall asleep?
- On the plane...

1802
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,880
(Hesitant)

1803
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,990
Well, at first, I couldn't fall asleep.

1804
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,520
- Was it "Lovely Runner?"
- Yes.

1805
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,860
- I started watching the first episode.
- Was it too good?

1806
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,960
I couldn't go to sleep then.

1807
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,890
That's why you're even more tired.

1808
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:54,860
- Is that a fun show to watch?
- Gosh.

1809
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,300
- It was good.
- Really?

1810
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,900
At first, I thought it was a bit childish.

1811
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,470
But I get why everyone fell in love
with Byeon Woo Seok.

1812
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:02,540
You get it now?

1813
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,440
- I bet you all like him.
- I...

1814
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,040
- Have you watched it?
- No.

1815
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,610
Me neither.

1816
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,410
- I did.
- You did?

1817
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,680
- She has something in common with him.
- You did?

1818
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,380
She's the only one
who understands what you mean.

1819
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,350
- Yes. Byeon Woo Seok...
- Did you like the drama?

1820
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,420
(Smiling brightly)

1821
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,250
- That was the first time I saw her...
- Right.

1822
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,690
smile that big.

1823
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,360
- It was a big smile.
- Yes.

1824
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,090
(Embarrassed)

1825
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,370
(Suddenly nodding)

1826
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,700
My gosh.

1827
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,770
(Smiling)

1828
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,440
Unlike how it was at their first meeting,

1829
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,080
- Ji Min is quite popular during dinner.
- Yes.

1830
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,110
He's on the rise now.

1831
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,180
- He attracted two women's interest.
- Yes.

1832
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,320
- Yes.
- Whom do you think he was interested in?

1833
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,890
Personally, I think it was Ji Won.

1834
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,690
- Ji Won?
- Yes.

1835
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,060
He couldn't keep his eyes off her.

1836
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,290
He was shy, so he couldn't look at her.

1837
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:03,430
He was looking at somewhere else
and then glanced at her toward the end.

1838
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,730
I noticed a lot of shots like that.

1839
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:09,340
In my opinion, I think it's Je Yeon.

1840
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,870
- Toward the end of dinner?
- Je Yeon. Yes.

1841
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,670
Let me explain.
I think Ji Min seemed to be aware...

1842
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:17,340
of Je Yeon from the first meeting.

1843
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,950
I get the feeling that once
he likes someone, he only focuses on her.

1844
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,380
- That's just my feeling.
- Okay.

1845
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,280
That's why he was able to...

1846
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,450
get along well with the other ladies
without feeling nervous except for her.

1847
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,660
So he was natural
around both of the ladies.

1848
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,120
But when Je Yeon was sitting next to her,
she didn't talk much.

1849
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,460
So that got his attention.

1850
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,990
- So he paid attention to her.
- Yes.

1851
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,230
With his peripheral vision.

1852
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,130
What she said was spot on.

1853
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:40,400
When someone gets your attention
and you're not sure yet if you like them,

1854
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,270
it can have a big effect on the dynamics.

1855
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,070
- He did pay attention to her.
- I really don't like it...

1856
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,500
- when someone grabs my attention...
- I see. It's the opposite.

1857
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,870
because he would keep draining my energy.

1858
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:51,140
But later on,
that could play a huge role later.

1859
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,880
That could be risky.

1860
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,410
Ji Min just said
something like this to Je Yeon.

1861
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,920
- "This was your first big smile today."
- Right.

1862
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,890
- That means he had been watching her.
- Yes.

1863
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:00,990
- That's right.
- Yes.

1864
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:05,730
So Ji Min might want to
take care of quiet people...

1865
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:08,160
- He might like her?
- who aren't as expressive like Je Yeon.

1866
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,430
I think that's what's happening now.
That's what I think.

1867
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,730
(Their first dinner in Italy is over.)

1868
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,070
Yes. Put it there.
And I'll take care of it.

1869
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,410
(Woo Jae, Je Yeon, and Ji Won
are in charge of washing dishes.)

1870
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,940
(Looking clean)

1871
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,040
(Careful)

1872
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,050
I'll do the rest.

1873
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,310
- My gosh, but...
- They aren't heavy.

1874
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,550
- Gosh, no.
- I'll do them.

1875
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,280
Aren't your hands hot?
Why didn't you wear...

1876
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,990
- I rarely wear rubber gloves.
- Yes.

1877
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,090
Why not?

1878
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,320
Just because.

1879
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,760
(Glancing)

1880
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,090
It's okay if you go...

1881
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:44,660
and talk to the extroverts.

1882
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,430
Okay.

1883
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,970
(With Ji Won gone, it's quiet
with the two of them in the kitchen.)

1884
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:53,610
- Give it to me.
- I'm sorry.

1885
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,270
- Gosh, no.
- I keep finding more things to wash.

1886
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,280
My gosh.

1887
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,350
We shouldn't stay up too late tonight.

1888
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,420
I agree.

1889
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,250
(They finish washing the dishes
as they chat.)

1890
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,790
Is it because they're all different?

1891
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:07,920
- I'm not sure.
- We don't know.

1892
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,720
- We don't know.
- We only know they're music boxes.

1893
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,360
She might know.

1894
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,730
(Flustered)

1895
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,800
- Have you already tried it?
- No.

1896
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,100
I don't know what's in it.

1897
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,640
(They choose a music box with excitement.)

1898
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,970
- I'll just grab one too.
- Let's just go in order.

1899
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,970
Okay.

1900
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,340
I'll go and check it out.

1901
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,940
- That's the goal, right? To check.
- Yes.

1902
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,680
- See you tomorrow.
- Sleep tight.

1903
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:37,780
(Their first night in Italy deepens
in no time.)

1904
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:41,920
(He listens to the melody
from his music box.)

1905
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,160
(Observing intently)

1906
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,860
(Winding the unfamiliar tape...)

1907
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,360
The songs are all different.

1908
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,130
- It's from "Harry Potter," right?
- Yes, "Harry Potter."

1909
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,230
(Happy)

1910
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:55,030
- That's nice.
- I love this song.

1911
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,870
(The rules of the Pairing House
are written...)

1912
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,070
(inside the music box.)

1913
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,010
"On your last night in Italy,"

1914
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:04,110
"express your interest to the person
that made your heart..."

1915
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:06,180
"flutter the most with a postcard."

1916
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:09,820
(The postcard from their last night
in Italy will be their first pairing.)

1917
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,490
(They will spend 5 days in Italy.)

1918
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:16,090
(They met new people...)

1919
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:19,630
(in a faraway travel destination.)

1920
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,760
(Before they have to face the reality
in Seoul,)

1921
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,730
(whom will they choose?)

1922
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,940
(A night when sleep eludes him)

1923
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,110
- Is he drawing?
- Is he really a designer?

1924
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,280
(They listen carefully
to what their heart is saying.)

1925
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,920
(The first moment to check
where their heart stands)

1926
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,250
- Gosh, they'll send out the messages.
- My goodness.

1927
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,090
(Send a text message to the person
who interests you tonight.)

1928
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,890
(Thinking)

1929
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,200
(At their first meeting,)

1930
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,300
(gazes were exchanged.)

1931
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:03,340
(Pondering)

1932
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,670
Hello.

1933
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,110
(The one who I've received glances from)

1934
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:11,480
(The one I find myself looking at)

1935
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:15,310
(Their fated pairing has already begun.)

1936
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,880
(Who made their heart flutter
on their first night?)

1937
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,920
(Mission 1: Guess the results
of tonight's pairing now.)

1938
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,320
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

1939
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,360
- All right.
- No way.

1940
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,460
- We have to get to work now.
- Oh, no.

1941
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,460
- Gosh, yes.
- Let's...

1942
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,460
- guess the results.
- This is...

1943
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,530
People will find out that
my romance radar is utterly off.

1944
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,000
On Heart Pairing, we'll use
a different method to guess the results.

1945
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,040
We must guess who paired up...

1946
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,070
through their text messages every night.

1947
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:41,470
And we must also guess
the number of paired-up couples.

1948
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,440
What do you think?
How many couples do you think paired up?

1949
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,680
In my opinion, the fact that
they asked us to guess the results...

1950
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:49,880
makes me believe some must have paired up.

1951
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,320
- They already paired up. Right.
- I see.

1952
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,390
So you're trying to read the staff's mind.

1953
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,650
- They wouldn't have asked...
- She's different.

1954
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,720
if no one matched.

1955
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,890
- I see.
- Right.

1956
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,190
This is just my hunch.
I don't think Chan Hyeong...

1957
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,060
will receive any message tonight.

1958
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,600
(Laughing)

1959
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,830
- From no one?
- Right.

1960
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,670
- But I'm sure he sent one to Ha Neul.
- Right.

1961
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:11,600
I don't think
he got the message from Ha Neul.

1962
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,370
He kept talking to Ha Neul,
but her gaze and body language...

1963
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,940
were directed...

1964
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,540
to Ji Min.

1965
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,680
She didn't treat Chan Hyeong
in a special way or anything.

1966
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,180
But what if she were to send a message
to Chan Hyeong?

1967
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,980
- That crossed my mind briefly.
- Yes.

1968
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:26,620
Ha Neul was very responsive
and interactive with Ji Min.

1969
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,720
But he seemed to pay attention to Ji Won.

1970
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,360
And he also glanced at Je Yeon.
Considering these things,

1971
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,560
she might have chosen Chan Hyeong...

1972
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,930
to be safe in case she didn't get matched.

1973
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:39,000
Here's what I've observed
from hosting this show.

1974
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,070
No one really goes with the safe route.

1975
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,140
They follow their heart
and text the person who interests them.

1976
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,240
- That's it. I see.
- Then it was probably Ji Min.

1977
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,440
Let's talk about Woo Jae.

1978
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:48,540
- Woo Jae.
- I think...

1979
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,040
Je Yeon sent a message to Woo Jae.

1980
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,440
But Woo Jae...

1981
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:55,050
- might have chosen Ji Won.
- I think he was interested in Ji Won.

1982
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,350
I agree.

1983
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,950
- It was Ji Won.
- His face lit up when she walked in.

1984
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,020
- Right.
- And when Ji Won...

1985
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,220
- kept focusing on Ji Min,
- Yes.

1986
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,390
- he just focused on eating.
- Right.

1987
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,330
- That's possible.
- He suddenly felt jet lagged.

1988
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,090
- He suddenly felt tired.
- Yes.

1989
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,090
- It was clear...
- Yes.

1990
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,860
- Ji Won was interested in Ji Min.
- It was clear.

1991
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,900
"I guess she's not interested in me."
So afterward,

1992
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,530
- he focused on his meal.
- Yes.

1993
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,770
- Woo Jae probably chose Ji Won.
- I think he sent a message to Ji Won.

1994
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,310
- Ji Won probably chose Ji Min.
- That's for sure.

1995
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,870
- She must have chosen Ji Min.
- It was probably Ji Min.

1996
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:23,840
- I think she chose him.
- This is an unchanging truth.

1997
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,180
- Ji Won had to have chosen Ji Min.
- Ji Won to Ji Min.

1998
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,780
I can guess some people's interest,
but I'm not sure if it's reciprocated.

1999
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,820
- Yes. I'm not sure if it's reciprocated.
- But...

2000
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,280
if I have to guess a couple,
I'm sure it must be...

2001
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,990
Ji Won and Ji Min.

2002
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,820
- Ji Won and Ji Min.
- I agree.

2003
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,990
Or Ha Neul and Ji Min.

2004
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:38,860
- Our guesses are the same.
- Same here.

2005
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,630
- I can't figure out...
- But...

2006
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,030
whom Ji Min is interested in.

2007
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,360
Here's what I think.

2008
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,370
- When Ji Min had to vote for someone,
- Yes.

2009
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:49,670
he must have chosen 1 of the 2 women...

2010
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,640
- who showed interest in him.
- One of them?

2011
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,240
- Instead of picking Je Yeon.
- Right.

2012
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,240
It seems Ji Min holds the key tonight.

2013
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,110
- My gosh. I'll never be able...
- He's a popular guy.

2014
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,510
- to figure out his interest.
- He's in the limelight in Episode One.

2015
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:00,980
(This is hard.)

2016
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,580
This is difficult.

2017
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,150
If I'm only considering their looks,
Ji Min and Je Yeon look good together.

2018
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:07,390
- I'll go with Ji Min and Ji Won.
- Okay.

2019
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,690
- Let's hold it up.
- I'll follow his nine-year experience.

2020
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,990
A lot of my guesses are wrong.

2021
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,560
(I believe in you.)

2022
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,630
Let's go around the room
and explain our guesses.

2023
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,260
- Mimi.
- I chose...

2024
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,200
- Ji Min and Ha Neul.
- I see.

2025
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,370
- Why Ha Neul?
- Ji Min and Ha Neul?

2026
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,430
I'll only pursue one path.

2027
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,900
I think it will be Ji Min and Je Yeon.

2028
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,500
- But Je Yeon wouldn't pick Ji Min.
- Right. No.

2029
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,940
- Right. So that can't happen.
- Right.

2030
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,170
Since he and Ha Neul cooked together,

2031
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,880
he probably sent the message
to thank her for her help.

2032
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,240
- To thank her.
- That might be the vibe.

2033
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,110
It's like sending a message
to a team member.

2034
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,310
- Out of a sense of comradeship.
- And...

2035
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,780
To show Ji Min that
she was responding to what he said,

2036
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,150
she practically pulled her body out...

2037
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,750
- and interacted with him.
- I see.

2038
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:44,560
He might send the message to her
out of guilt or not to hurt her.

2039
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,090
That's my guess.

2040
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,790
I'll go with Ji Min and Ji Won
for the first night.

2041
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,460
I also thought
Ji Min might choose Ha Neul.

2042
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:55,330
But he didn't return
Ha Neul's responses that actively.

2043
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,170
She made it obvious
that she was interested in Ji Min.

2044
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,810
Other people noticed it too.

2045
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,440
Ji Min also noticed it.

2046
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,210
If Ji Min were to send the message
to Ha Neul,

2047
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,080
they could end up becoming a couple
from the first night.

2048
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,150
- I'm not sure if he'd want that.
- Right.

2049
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,420
Let's check out Je Yeon's message first.

2050
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,360
- I wonder to whom Je Yeon...
- I'm so curious.

2051
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,490
sent the message.

2052
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:20,560
It must be Woo Jae.

2053
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,190
I think it's Woo Jae.

2054
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:30,000
(Will it be Woo Jae
whom she showed interest from the start?)

2055
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,840
(Did their first guess come true?)

2056
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,640
(Or did it fail?)

2057
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,410
(Je Yeon chose Woo Jae.)

2058
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,210
(Their guess was spot on.)

2059
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,610
- So we were right.
- I knew it.

2060
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,150
She can be interested in only one person.

2061
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,220
Je Yeon's interest hasn't changed.

2062
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:47,920
All right then.

2063
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,390
Woo Jae received a message from Je Yeon.

2064
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:51,360
Let's find out
to whom he sent the message.

2065
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,360
I get the feeling it wasn't Je Yeon.

2066
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,530
- I think it was Ji Won.
- I bet it was Ji Won.

2067
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:55,530
- You think so too, right?
- Yes.

2068
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:58,600
To whom did Woo Jae send the message?

2069
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:02,770
(Did they guess correctly?)

2070
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,040
(Will it be Je Yeon,
the first person he spoke to?)

2071
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:10,180
(Or will it be Ji Won,
the first person he was interested in?)

2072
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:15,210
(Or will it be Ji Won,
the first person he was interested in?)

2073
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,520
Come on, let us know already.

2074
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,550
Right. What if it's Je Yeon?

2075
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:19,820
(Is it possible that
there could be a first pairing?)

2076
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:24,520
(Woo Jae chose Ji Won.)

2077
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,090
- Ji Won.
- We were right.

2078
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,330
(It's as expected.)

2079
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:29,700
- His interest was quite obvious too.
- I knew it.

2080
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,100
- Right.
- All right.

2081
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,970
Ji Won. What about her?
To whom did she send the message?

2082
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,900
- Ji Min.
- It has to be Ji Min.

2083
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,240
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min?

2084
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:39,640
(Just like everyone's
confident guesses,)

2085
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:43,040
(did it go to Ji Min?)

2086
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,580
(Will they guess correctly
3 times in a row?)

2087
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,750
(Ji Won chose Ji Min.)

2088
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:55,020
So we were right that
Ji Won would pick Ji Min.

2089
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,560
- I was wrong.
- I was right.

2090
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,420
Let's check out
Ji Min's decision at the end.

2091
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:00,590
Let's check out Chan Hyeong's decision.

2092
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,590
To whom did he send the message?

2093
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,860
- Ha Neul.
- It must be Ha Neul.

2094
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,270
(Oh, dear skies...)

2095
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,170
(Preparing for dinner with her
went smoothly.)

2096
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:13,240
(And their dinner was
full of laughter and smiles.)

2097
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,440
(Did Chan Hyeong choose Ha Neul?)

2098
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,950
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

2099
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,050
That's it.

2100
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,550
- We were right.
- Then...

2101
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:26,080
To whom did Ha Neul send the message?

2102
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:34,460
(Ha Neul actively expressed
her interest in Ji Min.)

2103
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:38,960
(Chan Hyeong showed his interest
in Ha Neul.)

2104
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:43,670
(The guy who interests me
versus the guy who's interested in me)

2105
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,440
It can't be...

2106
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,110
(Whom has she chosen?)

2107
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,980
(Ha Neul chose Chan Hyeong.)

2108
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,980
(The first successful pairing)

2109
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,680
- Right?
- Yes.

2110
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,320
- I should have kept my first choice.
- My gosh.

2111
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,120
You know what? As for this pairing,

2112
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,690
we must analyze the story in detail.

2113
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,120
- Yes.
- Right?

2114
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,560
In my opinion,
when Ha Neul chose Chan Hyeong,

2115
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,290
it was equivalent to Ha Neul
giving up on Ji Min.

2116
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,490
There's a universal phenomenon
of the sudden loss of interest.

2117
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,870
When someone you're interested in
doesn't seem to want you,

2118
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:15,830
you end up going with someone else.

2119
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,070
The future seemed not so favorable.

2120
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:19,370
- We should have gotten this right.
- Yes.

2121
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:21,110
We were too focused on Ji Min.

2122
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,140
All right.

2123
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,110
To whom did Ji Min send the message?

2124
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,380
(The starting point of the Pairing Chain)

2125
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:36,990
(There was a sneak peek
of an intense love triangle.)

2126
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,290
(Whom is he interested in?)

2127
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:44,460
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2128
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,630
Je Yeon.

2129
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:47,670
- It was Je Yeon.
- My gosh. Je Yeon?

2130
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:48,930
- Ji Min chose Je Yeon?
- My gosh.

2131
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,140
- So...
- What?

2132
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,270
Ji Min sent the message to Je Yeon.

2133
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:55,840
This means that
the last reaction we saw from Ji Min...

2134
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,580
toward Je Yeon...

2135
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:58,780
was genuine.

2136
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:01,450
- Right. He kept looking at Je Yeon.
- Right?

2137
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,350
My gosh. I didn't know
he would pick her in the end.

2138
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,780
So here's the pairing for today.

2139
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,890
- Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.
- And Ha Neul.

2140
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,320
Oh, that is...

2141
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,660
None of us got it.

2142
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,390
We...

2143
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:13,560
First of all, I'm disappointed in you.

2144
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,630
- For your information,
- It's humiliating...

2145
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,790
you must not count on me.

2146
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,800
(Don't count on Jong Shin.)

2147
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,770
I talk a lot, but I'm often wrong.

2148
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,770
(Chan Hyeong, Ha Neul)

2149
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:28,410
(Chan Hyeong, Ha Neul)

2150
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,340
(First day in Italy)

2151
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,210
(Who did their hearts choose?)

2152
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:37,180
She's someone I can't help
but think about.

2153
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,650
Because she smiled a lot from the start,

2154
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,750
I felt no barrier from her.

2155
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:48,030
(Your bright smile makes people happy.
Have a good night.)

2156
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:52,160
When we had dinner,
there was big pistachio bread.

2157
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,200
It was a big muffin.

2158
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:57,100
No one dared to rip it.

2159
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,210
Then Chan Hyeong ripped it first.

2160
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,140
And he gave it to other people.

2161
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,310
(Watching)

2162
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:05,740
- That looks good.
- It was a good choice.

2163
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,450
Are you okay?

2164
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,680
- Are you okay?
- That looks good.

2165
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,320
Ji Min is...

2166
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,760
a prickly fox.

2167
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:18,290
Are you okay?

2168
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:19,760
- It's okay.
- It's cold.

2169
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:23,260
(A prickly fox)

2170
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:28,370
I never talked to him alone.

2171
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,600
I'd like to get to know him.

2172
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:32,240
(Who did Ha Neul choose?)

2173
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:37,640
(Thank you for the delicious food today.)

2174
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,350
When I opened the door,

2175
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:43,150
he looked like a cold city man.

2176
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,720
He looked chic and cynical.

2177
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,750
He was...

2178
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,860
To be honest,

2179
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,390
he's kind of good-looking.

2180
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:55,990
I like soju.

2181
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:00,530
Although he didn't mean
the things he said,

2182
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,500
it still felt different.

2183
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,800
(Rest well.
Make sure to recover tomorrow.)

2184
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:11,440
When I entered the room,

2185
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:14,410
a woman was sitting...

2186
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:17,550
against the light.

2187
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,190
It was very intense.

2188
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,190
It looked like a halo.

2189
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,130
She was beautiful.

2190
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,530
(Hesitant)

2191
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,270
I'm not sure if that's the correct term.

2192
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:39,170
(After Je Yeon,
Woo Jae's eyes stopped at someone.)

2193
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,610
She felt unusual.

2194
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:45,510
Her eyes appear to be sharp at first.

2195
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:47,550
But they look kind.

2196
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,580
Her pupils? Her eyes look kind.

2197
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,920
When she walked in, I was like, "What?"

2198
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,290
I was like, "Wait."

2199
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,230
(It was nice to meet you today.
Let's build good memories together.)

2200
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,500
I wished it was Woo Jae.

2201
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,800
The fact that he wore a backpack
was memorable.

2202
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:17,210
He felt like a senior in a lecture room.

2203
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:25,380
I liked the feeling I got
when we first talked.

2204
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,750
(Despite the short conversation,)

2205
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,860
(she had a good first impression.)

2206
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:34,830
We had the same
conversation temperature...

2207
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:36,530
and tone.

2208
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Should I say he looked laidback?

2209
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,170
I liked that vibe.

2210
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:48,670
(I look forward to having a good time
with you. You had a long day today.)

2211
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:51,680
Ji Min barely talked.

2212
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:54,680
He was different from Woo Jae.

2213
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:59,280
- I'll go check now.
- Okay. Bye.

2214
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,920
(Alone?)

2215
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,950
He kind of has it his way.

2216
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,220
(He kind of has it his way.)

2217
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:10,530
He felt cold. That's the impression I got.

2218
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,600
She looked fragile.

2219
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,740
She kept dazing and looking at the floor.

2220
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,110
And that...

2221
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:22,110
(Dazing)

2222
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,640
bothered me.

2223
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:29,080
I don't know what I want either.
I can't stop paying attention to her.

2224
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,150
Am I interested in her?

2225
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,350
I tried a few times.

2226
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,550
(He made an effort.)

2227
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,660
(Spotting his chance)

2228
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,190
You're the only T.

2229
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,160
(Exclaiming)

2230
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,260
She just smiled, and that was it.

2231
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,260
(He failed to continue the small talk.)

2232
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,700
It'd take a long time to get to know her.

2233
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,800
(This is Ji Min's second dating show.)

2234
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,500
I went to find a date.

2235
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,940
I went to get into a relationship.

2236
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:58,010
My life so far...

2237
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:01,150
didn't get me a lot of chance
to meet women.

2238
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:04,780
And when you work,
it's not easy to meet someone.

2239
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:08,120
You could say I was desperate
because I'm getting old.

2240
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,260
(He plucked up his courage again.)

2241
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:12,060
That was out of the blue.

2242
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,060
- That's...
- It's so obvious.

2243
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,530
(Let's build good memories
for the next month.)

2244
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,400
I was excited...

2245
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,470
to spend time in Italy.

2246
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:31,440
I finally got to start.

2247
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,450
That's what occurred to me.

2248
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,910
In the country I've never been before,

2249
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,880
what kind of future will we have?

2250
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,190
I look forward to the next one month.

2251
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:43,290
I love it.

2252
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,320
I'm very excited.

2253
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:49,160
It has finally begun. That was how I felt.

2254
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,560
(In a strange place,)

2255
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:56,600
(what kind of fate awaits them?)

2256
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,040
(Their first picnic in Florence together)

2257
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:02,910
(Do you want to come with me?)

2258
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:04,380
(They plucked up their courage...)

2259
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,210
(to go on a date.)

2260
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:08,350
I found it.

2261
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,350
But how come you never traveled to Europe?

2262
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,950
(I wanted to go with someone...)

2263
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,250
(I loved enough to marry.)

2264
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:17,960
Oh, my gosh.

2265
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,820
It's nice to enjoy it as a snack.

2266
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,360
(Glancing)

2267
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:22,790
- What?
- Nothing.

2268
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,260
(I'm just happy.)

2269
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,030
(Every little thing...)

2270
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:30,640
(excites them and feels new.)

2271
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:33,710
(Is there someone you like?)

2272
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,680
(I think so.)

2273
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,750
The music box is not there.

2274
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,120
It's gone.

2275
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,250
There's another room.

2276
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,190
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

2277
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:54,990
He looked confident.

2278
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,360
It's completely different.

2279
01:39:57,730 --> 01:40:00,500
Ha Neul, Ji Won, and Je Yeon.

2280
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,400
That's all I need to know.

2281
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,040
He looked charismatic.

2282
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,340
Did you sleep well?

2283
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,940
What do you like?

2284
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,180
