1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,470
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,900
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,670
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,440
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,140
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,310
(Psychology expert, Park Ji Seon)

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,050
Last week, the residents enjoyed...

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,650
a romantic Christmas date.

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,980
Ji Min and Je Yeon,

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,390
Chang Hwan and Soo Ah,

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,890
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul,

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,520
Sang Yun and Chae Eun,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,590
and Woo Jae and Ji Won.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,860
These five couples had a special day.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,860
First of all, last week...

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,360
was a total chaos.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,570
- It was so chaotic.
- Yes.

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,130
While you were away, Professor,
many things happened.

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,140
In the process of choosing
a partner for the home date,

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,240
he directly said, "I'll write your name."

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,670
I'm going to write your name.

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,840
(Sang Yun's heart was drawn to Chae Eun.)

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Sang Yun had Chae Eun in mind.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,480
- Right.
- Je Yeon and Chae Eun were in his heart.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,850
- Right.
- Sang Yun thought so.

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,450
If Chae Eun hadn't cared about Sang Yun,

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,590
she wouldn't have given it a meaning.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,020
But she was interested in him too.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,090
(What is she going to do?)

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,030
Chae Eun looked different
from when she was with Chan Hyeong.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,290
She felt different.

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,800
- Didn't she feel like a woman?
- Right.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,830
I agree.

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,500
- In front of Sang Yun,
- She was a woman.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,270
she changed into a heroine of a melodrama.

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,370
She looked like
she was in a mini-series drama.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,970
I could...

38
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,870
understand how she felt.

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,880
And Chan Hyeong had a bitter look.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,950
- It put me into despair.
- He was heartbroken.

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,880
It felt like a movie...

42
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,580
in which a sweet guy turns dark.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,750
Still, Chan Hyeong's arrow...

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,090
It went toward Chae Eun.

45
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,490
- I was wrong.
- We...

46
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,490
Watching that, Si Won said,

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,730
- "His mind has changed."
- To Ha Neul?

48
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,260
- He said he'd choose Ha Neul.
- I see.

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,700
Chan Hyeong wouldn't do that.

50
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,960
Paul Kim and I...

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,330
have bad intuition, as always.

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
We have a bad gut feeling.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,470
For me, seeing Ji Min and Je Yeon...

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,870
taking photos for each other
in front of a Christmas tree,

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,170
looking at those photos,

56
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,610
sending a heart,

57
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,980
and being lovey-dovey like a real couple.

58
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,510
- Those scenes remained in my heart.
- And in fact,

59
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,050
they look most comfortable together.

60
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,710
- Right, the two of them.
- When they're together.

61
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,250
After opening up to each other,

62
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,220
they resolved past misunderstandings...

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,620
- and that's meaningful, I think.
- That's right.

64
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,520
(Can they have faith
to each other to the end?)

65
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,490
- That's awesome.
- And...

66
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,730
Chang Hwan and Soo Ah's date...

67
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,500
was very impressive.

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Taking advantage of gloves,

69
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,070
they interlocked fingers.

70
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,200
It's hard to make
the first physical contact,

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,140
and it seems they got off
on the right foot. What did you think?

72
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,610
It was written in his Pairing Book...

73
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,510
- as his flirting skill.
- Right.

74
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,450
I never imagined that skill would shine
at that moment.

75
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,580
Soo Ah...

76
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,250
was different from
how she felt comfortable with him before.

77
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,720
I think
it was a more exciting date for her.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
However,

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,620
when Chang Hwan was talking at length,

80
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,190
the look on Soo Ah's face
was unforgettable.

81
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,490
She had this look.

82
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,330
(Smiling)

83
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,430
Saying "I like you"
would have been good enough,

84
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,760
but he went, "I couldn't find a reason
not to like you."

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,900
That's right.

86
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,470
(The day for the home date has broken.)

87
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,980
(Send the name of the person...)

88
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
(you want to have the home date with
by 2 p.m. today.)

89
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,950
(Each person's day goes by quickly.)

90
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,920
(Have they decided on someone
they want to spend the day with?)

91
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,720
It was introduced together,

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,730
but it's not working properly.

93
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,170
(Woo Jae sent a message.)

94
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,230
I got goosebumps.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,900
(Chang Hwan sent a message.)

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,100
(Ji Won sent a message.)

97
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,870
(Chan Hyeong sent a message.)

98
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,140
I received the document you sent me.

99
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,920
(They have 3 days left
until the final decision.)

100
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,820
(What result would be brought
by their choice today?)

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,090
(Ji Min sent a message.)

102
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,890
(Soo Ah sent a message.
Ha Neul sent a message.)

103
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,800
(Sang Yun sent a message.
Je Yeon sent a message.)

104
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
I'm curious.

105
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,640
(And Chae Eun)

106
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,810
Who would she choose
between Sang Yun and Chan Hyeong?

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,150
(Chae Eun sent a message at 2 p.m.)

108
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,680
She sent it exactly at 2 p.m.

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,690
(She sent the message last
after much thought.)

110
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,890
I feel nervous.

111
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,920
Please.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,930
(Ji Won waits for her home date partner.)

113
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,970
She's beautiful.

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,710
(Who's Ji Won's partner for the date?)

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,810
(Ji Won's home date partner...)

116
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,850
(is Woo Jae.)

117
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,050
- There he goes.
- They must have...

118
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,280
butterflies in their stomachs.

119
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,820
(He's running to Ji Won.)

120
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,590
- My goodness.
- He's running.

121
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,090
(Surprised)

122
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,160
Hi.

123
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,660
Woo Jae!

124
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,100
(Glad to see her)

125
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,330
- Do you have a hand warmer?
- Yes, I do.

126
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,170
Where are you coming from?
Why didn't I see you?

127
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,870
- I walked from there.
- Really?

128
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,600
- You must've been cold.
- I'm fine.

129
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,340
- How come they look so happy?
- I knew you'd be here.

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh, my.

131
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,540
I thought it would be nice
if you were here.

132
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,610
Same here.

133
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,210
Goodness. It looks like
they're going home together after work.

134
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,750
(The home date begins
in a space for just two of them.)

135
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,650
I guess it's that house.

136
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,650
- Is it that one?
- The one with the light on, over there.

137
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,290
Really?

138
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
It looks very nice.

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,120
Let's go and see.

140
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,330
In fact, for the home date,

141
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,360
there's no cameraman inside.

142
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,460
(The production crew is out.)

143
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,530
They leave after setting up the cameras.

144
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,670
Only two of them were in that place.

145
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,370
Let's go.

146
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,600
It's a love nest.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,140
This is nice.

148
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,280
It's there.

149
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,380
(Amazed)

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,350
Is this a house?

151
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,390
- It's great.
- It's nice.

152
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,590
This is so beautiful.

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,260
(Living room)

154
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,900
It looks nice.

155
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,460
(Living room)

156
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,800
That's beautiful.

157
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,970
- It's very spacious.
- It's really nice.

158
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,840
I can't believe this is a house.

159
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,740
(Kitchen)

160
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,770
It's really nice.

161
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,240
It's so spacious.

162
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,410
They're going to live there
for 2 days and 1 night.

163
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,510
This is so beautiful.

164
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,310
(She keeps exclaiming.)

165
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,720
This house is very nice.

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,880
That's what I'm saying.

167
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,090
Ji Won, thank you.

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm here thanks to you.

169
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,790
I'm here thanks to you too.

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,590
Would we be able to look around
the whole house in a day?

171
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,630
It's a shame we only stay here
for one day.

172
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,660
Tell me about it.

173
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,700
I guess we need to stay up
all night tonight.

174
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,800
That's what I'm saying.

175
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,470
Is this a room?

176
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
It's a room.

177
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,610
The bedroom is...

178
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,040
Are we supposed to sleep here?

179
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,850
(There are two beds placed side by side.)

180
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,050
That's...

181
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,380
(Are they going to sleep
in the same room?)

182
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,220
Is it okay to broadcast this?

183
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,020
- There are two beds placed like this.
- Right.

184
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,120
What if I snore?

185
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,230
- I snore too.
- I don't snore.

186
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,430
Woo Jae is flustered.

187
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,430
- It's beautiful.
- Is this really a house?

188
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,600
Kimchi stew?
What are we going to cook for dinner?

189
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,770
- What shall we cook?
- Let's decide as we do grocery shopping.

190
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,310
- Shall we do that? All right.
- Yes.

191
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,410
Kimchi stew...

192
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,280
- Let's get going.
- Let's get going.

193
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,050
(A supermarket in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul)

194
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,520
Shall we bring this?

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,790
Yes, let's bring it.

196
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,390
I'll carry it.

197
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,520
Now it feels so familiar
to watch the two of them together.

198
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,690
Soft persimmon!

199
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,530
Shall we get some soft persimmons?
Do you want to eat it?

200
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,800
- Shall we?
- Yes.

201
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,800
What else do we need?

202
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,000
- Shall we get some fruits for tomorrow?
- Shall we?

203
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,370
- This one.
- Yes.

204
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,580
- Let's get this one.
- Okay.

205
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,910
- Is it too many?
- No.

206
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,380
I think tteokguk will be nice.

207
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,580
- Shall we have tteokguk?
- Shall we?

208
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,080
- We just need to cook it in broth.
- All right.

209
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,190
- Shall we buy this one?
- Okay.

210
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,020
We need green onions. And we'll add eggs.

211
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,260
Can I have some chips?

212
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,190
Yes, of course.

213
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,700
I'll have this one.

214
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,800
- I was looking at that one too.
- Really?

215
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,930
- They...
- Let's get this.

216
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,800
are synchronized.

217
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,200
You can put it in here.

218
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,510
This is fun.

220
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,510
While doing the home date,
they'd imagine...

221
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,450
something like their future together.

222
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,350
Shall we take off our jackets upstairs
and come down?

223
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,550
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

224
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,460
Let's do that. I'll put this on here.

225
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,290
- They seem to rub off on each other.
- Yes.

226
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,700
(Woo Jae comes down first
and prepares for dinner.)

227
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,170
Things are peaceful here.

228
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:35,210
(Preparing dinner quickly)

229
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,090
(Adept)

230
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,470
(Ji Won is ready too.)

231
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,600
- I came down too late.
- No.

232
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,640
- No?
- Not at all.

233
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,670
Not at all?

234
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,580
Shall I slice green onions?

235
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,110
Will you do that?

236
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,380
(Preparing dinner together)

237
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,980
Let's put those in, just like that.

238
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,460
- I'll add the eggs.
- Okay.

239
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,260
- Do you want to try this?
- Okay.

240
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,230
- Your hand might feel hot.
- It's okay.

241
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,370
(Blowing)

242
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Blow on the spoon. It might feel hot.

243
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,770
Oh, my.

244
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,070
- Does it taste all right?
- Yes.

245
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,840
- You can sell it outside.
- What?

246
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,110
It tastes good enough to sell.

247
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,140
- Does it?
- Yes.

248
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,280
I'll prepare
a business license application.

249
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,950
(He whipped up
two bowls of tteokguk quickly.)

250
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,350
- Let's take a picture of this.
- Yes, let's take one.

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,290
I wonder if that's how
a newlywed's life feels.

252
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,860
Your feet show in the picture.

253
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,330
- It looks like a newlywed's dinner table.
- That's cute.

254
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,100
- Thank you for your work today.
- Thank you for your work.

255
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,700
(Drinking to their moving in)

256
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,340
You can whip up a meal in no time.

257
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,570
I cooked this quickly. The recipe is easy.

258
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,780
It's good.

259
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,820
It tastes so good.

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,020
If I lived with you,
I'd eat good food every day.

261
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,090
That's true.

262
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,930
You should remember that.

263
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,430
- You're usually alone at home.
- Yes.

264
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,870
What do you cook for yourself?

265
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,570
I often cook pasta.

266
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,810
Or, sometimes,

267
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,050
I cook Korean stew.

268
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
I like kimchi stew.

269
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,780
In my case,

270
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,150
I don't eat properly when I'm alone.

271
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,950
- That happens. Right.
- I grab whatever's around.

272
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,950
Right.

273
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,360
It's hard to cook for yourself
all the time.

274
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,500
- Since I don't cook on a daily basis,
- Yes.

275
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,360
when I buy cooking ingredients,
I have to throw away a lot of them.

276
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,670
- It's a waste, so I don't get to cook.
- That's right.

277
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,540
- That's why people get married, I guess.
- Right.

278
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,610
(Exhilarated by what Ji Won said)

279
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,580
She catches him off guard
by mentioning marriage.

280
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,780
(That's why people get married, I guess.)

281
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,020
Right.

282
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,350
I guess so.

283
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,050
You surprised me.

284
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,730
- Environmental preservation.
- What?

285
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,890
Environmental protection.

286
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,530
You mean people marry
for environmental protection?

287
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,200
That's a nice idea.

288
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,270
You can say this for a proposal. "Will you
protect the environment with me?"

289
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,140
They look great together.

290
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,840
(Laughing)

291
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,410
But haven't you thought about this?

292
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,080
- I got so accustomed to living alone...
- I see.

293
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,350
that it's hard for me to imagine myself...

294
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,220
- living with someone.
- She's right.

295
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,390
Well...

296
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,960
I can imagine myself living with someone.

297
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,090
Why?

298
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,460
I might have to sacrifice the convenience
I had while living alone, to some extent.

299
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,930
It would happen when I live with someone,
of course. However,

300
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,600
- it's natural that it happens.
- Yes.

301
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,370
But many other good things
will happen too.

302
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,910
I don't want to lead
a single life forever.

303
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,810
- You don't?
- I have to protect the environment.

304
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,680
- When I read the text message yesterday,
- Yes.

305
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,090
- I wondered how it would be in detail.
- I know.

306
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,460
I didn't imagine
we'd move into a separate house.

307
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,720
- Neither did I.
- You didn't, right?

308
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,790
When I'm with other people,

309
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,200
- it's hard to focus on only one person.
- Right.

310
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,740
Since it's a home date, we can talk a lot.

311
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,610
- So I like it.
- Yes.

312
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,480
It feels different
from the contract relationship, right?

313
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Yes.

314
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,580
And...

315
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,290
although I'm not sure what our final
decisions would be when this ends,

316
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,860
but if we have a happy ending,

317
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590
it will be nice if we proceed
from that point.

318
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,860
He said something significant.

319
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,670
(Laughing)

320
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,730
Why?

321
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,370
(Beaming with them)

322
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,540
I think Woo Jae is blushing a bit.

323
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,850
It was really good. I'm full.

324
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,310
Thank you for the food.

325
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,150
Shall we clean this up quickly?

326
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,190
- Let's do that.
- Shall we?

327
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,220
Okay.

328
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,950
I'll do it.

329
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,260
I want to do it.

330
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,660
What? I can do it quickly.

331
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,630
- I'm good too.
- Okay.

332
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,800
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

333
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,300
Then, let's do this.

334
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,570
If you put detergent on the dishes,
I can wash them...

335
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,770
I'm fine.

336
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,940
(Pushed)

337
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,370
Okay.

338
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,010
- That's cute.
- That's cute.

339
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,150
Tell me something funny.

340
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,810
Something funny?

341
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,280
Saying something funny
is harder than washing the dishes.

342
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,490
That's even more difficult.

343
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,190
Something funny?

344
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,860
I can't think of anything funny today.

345
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,560
It doesn't come up
when someone asks you, right?

346
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
That's right.

347
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,760
I always have fun
when I'm with you, though.

348
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,670
But I always think...

349
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,430
that I'm not a funny person.

350
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,600
- Why?
- What?

351
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Why?

352
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,240
But I have fun when I'm with you.

353
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,210
That has a huge impact.

354
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,880
- I'm done.
- Thank you for your work.

355
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,050
Sure.

356
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Let's go.

357
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,190
I brought my bedding here.

358
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,760
I'd rather sleep here.

359
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,660
I told you. You can sleep upstairs.

360
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,560
We have separate beds, so it's fine.

361
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,670
(Setting up an electric heating pad
for a warm and restful sleep)

362
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,710
(Making the bed)

363
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,140
Let's have a seat and take a rest.

364
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,190
Do you have anything you want to buy...

365
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,790
for your home
when you have enough money later?

366
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,720
It will be nice to have a big screen TV.

367
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,460
Of course, you also need a spacious house.

368
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,960
A big screen TV and a sound system.

369
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,660
Those are what I want to have at home.

370
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,330
A sound system?

371
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,370
I wish it feels like a theater
when I watch a movie at home.

372
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,700
- How about you?
- Me?

373
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,580
I wish I had a robot vacuum cleaner
at home in the future.

374
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,740
I heard it's really nice to have one.

375
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,650
- Do you clean your house often?
- Clean?

376
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,710
I clean up things when I see them.

377
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,380
I clean the floor on weekends.

378
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,520
I used to deep clean my house once a week.

379
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,690
I scrub the floor on my knees.

380
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,660
I still scrub the floor on my knees.

381
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,900
It's 3 a.m.

382
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,370
- Shall we wash up?
- You can wash up first.

383
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,970
Let's clean this up tomorrow.

384
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,610
That's something we haven't heard before.

385
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,710
"You can wash up first."
Something like this, I mean.

386
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,710
Their conversation feels unfamiliar.

387
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,910
They can say that
since they're living together.

388
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,700
(Glancing)

389
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,500
He's afraid she might feel embarrassed.

390
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,870
(Woo Jae goes downstairs
while Ji Won is washing up.)

391
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,850
(He finishes up the cleanup.)

392
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,460
(Ji Won comes out after her shower.)

393
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,470
(She looks around to find Woo Jae.)

394
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,740
Woo Jae, do you have lotion?

395
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,440
- What?
- Did you bring lotion?

396
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,610
I brought my lotion.

397
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,710
I think I could even fall asleep here.

398
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,750
He must feel a bit awkward.

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,390
What if your lips get numb from the cold?

400
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,390
You look the same.

401
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,090
(You look the same without any makeup on.)

402
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,190
You said you couldn't see me clearly.

403
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,060
- I can see you clearly when I'm close.
- You can?

404
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,730
Let's talk and hang out
over here for a bit.

405
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,640
- Sure. Is there...
- As for our sleeping arrangements...

406
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,370
Does that make you uncomfortable?

407
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,140
We should still be careful,
and it might be uncomfortable.

408
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,210
I see.

409
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,240
I really don't mind
if we sleep in the same room.

410
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,910
- Really? You're okay with that?
- Yes.

411
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
(Careful)

412
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,920
Shouldn't we turn this off?

413
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,650
That must feel awkward.

414
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,190
(The light is off.)

415
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,330
What happened?

416
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,430
- What?
- Okay.

417
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,830
- What was that? What?
- That's the one.

418
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,030
I see. This is the button.

419
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,640
(Feeling awkward)

420
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,280
This must be nerve-racking.

421
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,450
He can't exactly turn around
to face the wall.

422
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,520
No.

423
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
(Bursting into laughter)

424
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,680
I mean, they should go to sleep.

425
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,850
Wouldn't it be weird to face the wall?

426
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,920
- Right.
- Yes.

427
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,450
Should I play some music?

428
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,460
(He plays a song
to break the awkward silence.)

429
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,770
- What?
- You look silly.

430
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,900
- Me?
- Yes.

431
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,740
I look silly?

432
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,150
I was surprised
by how beautiful she looked.

433
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,950
I thought she was beautiful
when she had makeup on.

434
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,980
But...

435
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,790
she was even more beautiful
without the makeup on.

436
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,920
When we were talking, I kept thinking...

437
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,820
how beautiful she looked.

438
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,590
Oh, my!

439
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,460
(Blushing)

440
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,660
By the way,

441
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,970
you look prettier without the makeup on.

442
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,140
(Shy)

443
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,870
You look exactly the same.

444
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,940
- Really?
- Yes.

445
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,980
- He can't stop looking at her.
- Right.

446
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,520
(Blushing)

447
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,850
(Adoring her)

448
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,030
Are you sure I can sleep in here?

449
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,730
Why not?

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,130
I told you it was fine.

451
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,740
Once we fall asleep,
we'll probably be out of it.

452
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,940
I think he might be too nervous
to fall asleep in there.

453
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,820
(Ji Won turns off the last light.)

454
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,550
(Startled)

455
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,530
- Go to sleep when you get sleepy.
- What about you?

456
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,790
I'll go to sleep right away too.

457
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,500
- You can fall asleep right away?
- Yes.

458
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,100
It's so fascinating
to be here with you like this.

459
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
- Same here.
- Right?

460
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,140
I can't imagine doing this
with someone else other than you.

461
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,680
- Same here.
- Right?

462
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,750
Had I paid more attention to my feelings,

463
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,150
I would have known that
I would end up falling for you eventually.

464
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,520
My parents will be happy
when they meet you.

465
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,890
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,760
- Why?
- What's not to like about you?

467
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,630
He said, "What's not to like about you?"

468
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,800
What's not to like about you?

469
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,060
- Really?
- Of course.

470
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,470
I feel the same way.

471
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,370
What about your parents?

472
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,710
I think they'll be happy too.

473
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,680
- Well, I talk to my mom...
- Yes.

474
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,980
(Their night deepens
as the conversation grows more intimate.)

475
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,380
The two of us wanted to say
more things before falling asleep.

476
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,220
We kept talking to each other even though
we could barely keep our eyes open.

477
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,860
So that moment made my heart flutter
quite a lot.

478
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,430
When we finished talking
to each other in the house,

479
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,100
it felt like we were saying goodbyes
even if we were in the same house.

480
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,500
But when we were at that house
by ourselves,

481
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,000
we were talking to each other
with the lights off.

482
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,640
We kept talking to each other.

483
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,740
We talked until we fell asleep.

484
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,580
We fell asleep in the same room.

485
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,950
It was really nice.

486
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,580
- My gosh. Those two are...
- Oh, my.

487
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
They looked like newlyweds indeed.

488
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,550
They looked like a couple
who had been together for some time.

489
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,620
- Totally.
- Ji Won brought up...

490
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,560
the topic of marriage first...

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
- when they talked.
- Right.

492
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,260
I was wondering
how Woo Jae felt about marriage.

493
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,600
Right after that, he mentioned
the proposal, the environment,

494
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,670
- and his parents.
- Right. He did.

495
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,440
It made me realize that
they were on the same page.

496
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,810
- Yes.
- I was relieved.

497
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,340
When Ji Won was taking a shower earlier,

498
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,840
he went downstairs.

499
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
That speaks volumes for his personality.

500
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,950
- Yes.
- Right.

501
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,650
- In case she was uncomfortable.
- He was thoughtful.

502
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,220
Personally, I thought Woo Jae
was more nervous than Ji Won.

503
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,690
- Right?
- Ji Won kept saying,

504
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,090
"Why? What?"

505
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,120
(She was quite playful.)

506
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,160
- "Why?" Right.
- But... Yes.

507
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,260
- But it was clear he was nervous.
- Right.

508
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Totally.

509
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,930
(Gongdeok Station)

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,270
It's Chan Hyeong.

511
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,630
I naturally thought that
I might not be paired up.

512
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,970
Well...

513
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,210
I was going to pick you for the home date.

514
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,980
- Really?
- Yes.

515
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,650
(Chan Hyeong was listening to the talk
between Sang Yun and Chae Eun.)

516
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,820
- He could hear them.
- That's not my intention.

517
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,650
He must've been so upset
when he heard that.

518
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,720
(Nodding)

519
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,830
I was trying
to calm myself down emotionally...

520
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,860
by saying everything was all right.

521
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,360
Oh, no.

522
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,370
If I don't try it,

523
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,010
I won't be able to satisfy my curiosity.

524
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,210
What?

525
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,080
(The partner
for Chae Eun's home date is...)

526
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm so curious.

527
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,720
(Who will it be?)

528
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,850
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

529
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,420
Who is it? What?

530
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,790
No way.

531
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,690
(Utterly focused)

532
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,090
(Someone is getting close to Chae Eun.)

533
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,700
(Chae Eun's partner
for the home date is...)

534
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,740
It's Chan Hyeong.

535
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,770
(Chan Hyeong.)

536
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,240
His face lit up already.

537
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,150
It's so windy.

538
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,220
- He's so happy to see her.
- He's over the moon.

539
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,450
- What is this?
- My gosh.

540
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,720
- What took you so long?
- It's freezing cold today, right?

541
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,360
- What took you so long?
- It's so cold, right?

542
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
Seriously.

543
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,560
- Get in.
- He's in a good mood now.

544
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
This is nice.

545
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,830
- Gosh.
- By the way,

546
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,330
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Yes?

547
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,500
- Really?
- Totally.

548
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,570
How happy are you?

549
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,800
- I thought...
- Express how happy you are.

550
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,370
I might not be able to see you.

551
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,510
- Really?
- Yes.

552
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,340
I couldn't stop thinking
about that look from last night.

553
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,610
Really?

554
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,350
When I lay down,
I kept hearing Sang Yun's voice.

555
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,850
Then the conversation was about...

556
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,950
(What?)

557
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,460
It was what I expected
when I came out of the room.

558
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,930
You two were having a serious conversation
about something.

559
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,060
- I hadn't felt...
- Yes.

560
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,600
that insecure emotionally in a while.

561
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,500
- He's telling her how he felt.
- I barely felt...

562
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,870
this kind of feeling in my life before.

563
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,370
- He realized his feelings too.
- I see.

564
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,550
I wanted to tell you that I was certain
about my decision before going to sleep.

565
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,550
Yes.

566
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,350
- Because you talked to me...
- Yes.

567
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,550
(She made up her mind
after talking to Chan Hyeong.)

568
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,950
It was the right move
to talk to you yesterday.

569
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,690
It was, right?

570
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,760
What if I didn't talk to you?

571
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,460
If you didn't talk to me?

572
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,360
Even if you didn't...

573
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,800
Well, even if you didn't,

574
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,040
I think I might have chosen you.

575
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,770
(Staring)

576
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,870
He keeps looking at her.

577
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,710
(Glancing)

578
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,950
- That look from the day before is gone.
- Yes.

579
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,910
What is it, Chan Hyeong?
Why do you look so happy?

580
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,620
- What was that smile for?
- What?

581
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,090
- I'm just so happy.
- Really?

582
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,150
I am happy indeed.

583
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,320
- Everyone needs a wake-up call.
- Right.

584
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,960
Everyone needs to get a wake-up call.

585
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,000
- He needed this kind of push.
- I agree.

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,100
Totally.

587
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,130
(It helped him realize his feelings.)

588
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,370
Should we pack everything in one suitcase?

589
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,500
I think we can do that.

590
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,840
- I think that might be better.
- Yes.

591
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,600
- I'll go upstairs and pack Lego.
- Okay.

592
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,340
- We just need...
- He's going to pack that.

593
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,210
(They focus on packing for the date.)

594
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,850
- Do you have a cup?
- Yes.

595
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,480
Oh, yes. It's perfect. Let's go.

596
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,150
It's a story about a couple
running away at 10 p.m.

597
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,220
Right.

598
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,420
Let's have the simplest meal we can have.

599
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,450
No. I want to cook for you.

600
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,960
Let me cook for you once.

601
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,360
- I'll look forward to it.
- Yes.

602
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,630
Please do.

603
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,860
Because she cooked for him before?

604
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,630
I do want to see him cook.

605
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,300
I'm curious.

606
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

607
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,440
- Should we make jeon?
- That sounds amazing.

608
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,800
- Right? We can have jeon.
- I love it.

609
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,210
Do we only need the frying mix?

610
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,140
When I made it, frying mix was enough.

611
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,050
- We can add squids and shrimp.
- Squids.

612
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,880
I love it.

613
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,180
Snacks.

614
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,820
Snacks? Yes.

615
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,220
- She's cute.
- Should we try this?

616
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,290
This one is new.

617
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,750
Cherry tomatoes.

618
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,090
Blueberries?

619
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,020
Get everything. Let's empty the shelves.

620
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,190
That's good, Chan Hyeong.

621
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,230
Two? Are you going to drink it?

622
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,530
- Yes. Two, please.
- Two.

623
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,300
Always get two because we're a pair.

624
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
I must get a pair.

625
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,270
Chan Hyeong is taking the lead today.

626
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,470
- Bye.
- Bye.

627
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

628
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,580
- Let me use the restroom.
- Okay. Go ahead.

629
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,010
What's he doing?

630
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,310
(While Chae Eun goes to the restroom...)

631
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,380
Gosh, he's busy.

632
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,480
Oh, my.

633
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,350
(he uses the spare time
to catch up on work.)

634
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,820
- He's working even now?
- I think Chan Hyeong is really busy.

635
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
- Do you have some work left?
- No, I'll do it later.

636
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,690
No, do it now.

637
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,430
- No, do it now.
- I need to send an email, but later...

638
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,830
- No, you should do it now.
- No. It's okay.

639
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,360
- Do it now.
- No, it's okay.

640
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,600
Just do it now.

641
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,170
- It will make me nervous.
- No.

642
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,300
- The accounting report was finished.
- Yes.

643
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,370
I can check on that later.

644
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,670
- Then...
- I just have to email that later.

645
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,880
- Then...
- It's just an email.

646
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,740
- do you have to do that before midnight?
- No.

647
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,810
I can do it tomorrow.

648
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,650
I just remembered it.
I thought they might be waiting for it.

649
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,550
I thought you would take some time.
So I wanted to send the email.

650
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,950
Since you remembered it,
let's take care of that when we arrive.

651
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,090
I don't want to.

652
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,020
(Chuckling)

653
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,290
I don't want to.

654
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,260
- Chan Hyeong.
- What?

655
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,730
Why are you so excited?

656
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,260
Of course, I'm excited.

657
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,330
I'm elated now.

658
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,100
I'm on cloud nine.

659
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,200
She must find him cute.

660
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,370
(In no time, they arrive at a house,
prepared just for them.)

661
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,740
It's a different house?

662
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,350
- This place is legit.
- It's so warm.

663
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,050
It's warm inside too.

664
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,920
There are only two pairs of slippers.

665
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,990
- They are matching slippers.
- Right.

666
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,460
(Kitchen)

667
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,760
I love it.

668
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,660
- I love it. Chan Hyeong.
- Oh, my.

669
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,160
We should have bought...

670
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,460
a bottle of Champagne.

671
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,800
We bought makgeolli.

672
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,170
Gosh, look at the tableware too.

673
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,100
It's so beautiful.

674
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,410
- I didn't know it'd be fancy.
- This is so cool.

675
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,540
(Spotting the living room)

676
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,040
- My gosh. It's...
- This place is amazing.

677
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
(Living room)

678
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,440
- This place is amazing.
- Oh, my.

679
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,080
- I love it here.
- Gosh.

680
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
- Put it down. It's heavy.
- This is crazy.

681
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,250
It's heavy. Put it down.

682
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,390
- They're so happy with the house.
- This is amazing.

683
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,150
I love it here.

684
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,920
I just want to live here.

685
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,490
Shall we go upstairs too?

686
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,300
My gosh, the ceiling is quite high.

687
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,160
Can we use this room too?

688
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,260
This is the bedroom.

689
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,630
Gosh, no way.

690
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,970
(A cozy bedroom welcomes them.)

691
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,040
It'd be so nice to sleep in.

692
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,340
My gosh, Chan Hyeong. Right?

693
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,110
The dressing room is huge.

694
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,210
This is insane.

695
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,580
However,

696
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,050
the most beautiful thing is this.

697
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,210
- What is it?
- What is that?

698
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,220
- Should we take one each?
- Should we?

699
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,620
- The Santa glass.
- I'd like that.

700
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,190
(They each took one cup and sock...)

701
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,520
(in Italy.)

702
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,590
He brought that.

703
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,230
- Their memory from Italy made it there.
- Right.

704
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,130
Do you have socks?

705
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I do.

706
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,300
- Put this on.
- I want to put it on.

707
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,430
How cute.

708
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,030
Let's change into comfortable clothes.

709
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,240
You go ahead.

710
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,410
You should go and wear something thicker.

711
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,370
That's cute.

712
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,640
(While Chae Eun is upstairs...)

713
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,050
Chan Hyeong, the man who can cook.

714
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,280
(While Chae Eun is upstairs,)

715
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,090
(Chan Hyeong prepares
the ingredients first.)

716
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,350
The squid. He's dissecting it.

717
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,550
He seems to know what he's doing.

718
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,890
- He's good.
- I think he's a good cook.

719
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,430
(Careful)

720
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,200
You already started?

721
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,470
Yes. I cut everything.

722
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,340
Chan Hyeong,
how did you cut them so beautifully?

723
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,680
- I did?
- Yes.

724
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,880
- I thought they were chili pepper models.
- Really?

725
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,910
Your knife skills are really good.

726
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,780
I'll try to do a better job next time.

727
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,220
This is crazy.

728
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,690
You're good at cooking too.

729
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,850
What was that?

730
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,060
- I think it's tastier with minced garlic.
- Here. We bought that.

731
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,060
- It says...
- As long as we can...

732
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,300
- put up with the smell, garlic is fine.
- This is...

733
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,930
The more, the merrier. Right?

734
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,630
The more we add it,
the tastier it will get.

735
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,430
Do you think
you can put up with the smell?

736
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,370
I mean, I like garlic.

737
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,310
Add just a little bit.

738
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,470
Why?

739
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,410
- Because you're shy?
- Yes.

740
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,110
- I'll add half.
- Okay.

741
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,010
- Let me try this.
- Go ahead.

742
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,980
- Try the method you want to do.
- Yes.

743
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,020
Gosh, this looks good.

744
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,750
- Chan Hyeong, this looks so good.
- Oh, my.

745
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,990
The ingredients made the dish.

746
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,690
My gosh, this is a lot of food.

747
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,990
(Golden brown)

748
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,230
Have you ever flipped the jeon before?

749
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,830
- Should I really do it?
- Please.

750
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,000
- Really?
- Gosh.

751
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,230
You're on your own.

752
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,770
I shouldn't do it, right?

753
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,470
You make the right calls quickly.

754
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,010
You're smart.

755
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,310
I think we should use the spoon
to support it.

756
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,910
Well done.

757
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,240
- This is decent.
- Yes, it is.

758
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,010
- You did a great job.
- I did a decent job.

759
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,680
Totally. Very good.

760
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,650
Do you want some carrots?

761
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,120
(Feeding him)

762
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,290
(A thumbs-up)

763
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,090
- I bet it's so good.
- Yes.

764
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,930
- What?
- It's good.

765
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,430
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

766
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,170
- Gosh, this is going to be so good.
- Yes.

767
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,600
The first jeon.

768
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,370
Gosh, this looks good.

769
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,710
We'll finally get to use the cups
we brought from Italy.

770
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,950
I didn't imagine that we'd be doing this
when we met in Italy.

771
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,080
- I didn't see it coming at all.
- Right?

772
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,220
It's so fascinating.

773
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,020
This looks amazing.

774
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,260
I feel so proud.

775
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,630
(A meal just for the two of them
is ready.)

776
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,730
(Makgeolli instead of wine)

777
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,430
- It's so cute. Yes.
- Right?

778
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

779
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,370
Gosh, with the cups
they brought from Italy.

780
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,970
It's good.

781
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,710
Gosh, I can't believe this.
This is so good.

782
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,780
(Tasting the pajeon he made)

783
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,050
(Taking a big bite)

784
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,080
No way.

785
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,790
- Chan Hyeong.
- This is no joke, right?

786
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,230
- It's so good, right?
- You're a pajeon expert.

787
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,530
I'm serious.

788
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,800
- We made it together.
- Gosh, Chae Eun.

789
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,900
Your expressive nature...

790
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,470
brings a lot of joy to your partner.

791
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,110
This is so good.
I need to drown myself in makgeolli.

792
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,710
- She's drinking it up.
- Cheers.

793
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,380
The glass is Christmas-themed too.

794
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,750
Seriously.

795
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,090
- This melts away today's fatigue.
- Right? I'm so happy.

796
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,420
- It was so cold outside.
- Yes.

797
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,690
This is the kind of marriage I want.

798
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,360
- Really? Cooking together?
- Yes.

799
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,630
No.

800
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,430
Cooking a meal together...

801
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,430
on the last weekday before going to sleep,

802
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,370
having a drink together,
and relieving stress.

803
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,840
- I like that too.
- This is nice.

804
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,940
We're going to want to cook
more dishes now.

805
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,350
You're so good at making jeon.

806
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,050
I'm so happy.

807
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,790
This day is making her happy.

808
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,260
- You picked the right glass for this.
- Seriously.

809
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,360
Didn't this whole thing begin
because of this glass?

810
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,500
You're right.

811
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,070
I won the rock-paper-scissors.

812
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,300
- Right.
- Yes.

813
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,070
(She still believes
she made the best choice.)

814
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,340
They look so cute, acting lovey-dovey.

815
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,280
When you look at the beginning
of successful love stories,

816
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,520
- there was always an element of fate.
- Right.

817
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,880
It would've been great...

818
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,420
- if you didn't have work tomorrow.
- Right.

819
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,620
This must be the hardest on you, though.

820
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,720
- I have to work only for a bit.
- Okay.

821
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,430
It won't take long.

822
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,590
I'll come back right away.

823
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,100
- Come back soon.
- Take some rest, okay?

824
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,500
It's only 2:01 a.m. now.

825
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,740
You shouldn't say it's not too late.

826
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,970
Shall we go to sleep
after we chat for about 30 minutes?

827
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,210
They have no time together
because he comes home so late after work.

828
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,810
- Isn't this the gelato you talked about?
- It is.

829
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,280
(Gelato was delivered
while they were preparing their meal.)

830
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,120
Gelato is here.

831
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,250
- You must love gelato.
- I love it. I'm crazy about it.

832
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,460
(Gelato reminds them
of their time in Italy.)

833
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,890
As they think about Italy...

834
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,360
It's mint and basil.

835
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,000
- And there's citron and ginseng.
- One is ginseng, right?

836
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,430
This ginseng one is tasty.

837
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,470
- It's tasty?
- Yes.

838
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,670
- It's tasty, right?
- It has a unique flavor.

839
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,670
Yes.

840
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,370
It's so good.

841
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
What?

842
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,740
You're so innocent.

843
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,250
I think I'm a simple person.

844
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,450
I don't need that much to be happy.

845
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,550
That's a good character.

846
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,020
She's happy with ice cream and makgeolli.

847
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,560
- Right. Small things make her happy.
- Yes.

848
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,630
Is there something small
that makes you happy?

849
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,370
Me?

850
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,240
When I attend a conference abroad
or go somewhere,

851
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,670
I always go to these places by myself.

852
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,570
I always visit a zoo or an aquarium.

853
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,480
- Is that so?
- Yes. Even when I'm by myself.

854
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,810
That's an unexpected answer.

855
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,150
- Is it?
- Yes.

856
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,450
This is what I thought about you.

857
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,450
It seemed like you'd always have
people around you.

858
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,950
- Really?
- Yes.

859
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,760
Actually, I enjoy being alone.

860
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,060
You're so different from
the first impression I had of you.

861
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,260
Really? How different?

862
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
Actually, I thought...

863
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,900
I thought you'd be...

864
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,170
- so extroverted like a puppy.
- I see.

865
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,380
I thought you'd be frivolous.

866
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,210
It hasn't been a while since we've met,

867
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,650
- but I thought she had a specialized job.
- Me too.

868
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,690
I had a feeling that you'd be a lawyer.

869
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,290
(Even when they've first met in Italy,)

870
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,630
(he had asked her so many questions.)

871
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,160
But actually, for me...

872
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,870
There are people who are extroverted
and who lead the people around.

873
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,040
But that kind of character
isn't something I like...

874
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,210
- when I meet someone.
- I see.

875
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,080
The truth is,
before we did the contract relationship,

876
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,840
I was worried a bit.

877
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Really?

878
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,510
- Before the contract relationship?
- Yes.

879
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,320
I wanted you to...

880
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,120
take some rest while zoning out
and relax when you want to.

881
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,890
I wanted you to be like that.

882
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,020
You don't have to joke around.

883
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,190
- I see.
- Yes.

884
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,690
So I wanted to tell you that,

885
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,130
but when you were just with me,

886
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,700
you were so different.

887
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,740
You did what you wanted to do.

888
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,240
You spent the day
without pushing too much.

889
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,940
I thought I got to know you better.

890
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,980
It was real you, the calm one.

891
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,220
Who you are when you're alone.

892
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,950
- Right.
- Yes.

893
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
I think you really know me.

894
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,950
The way you're telling me this
makes me think so.

895
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,090
- Why?
- I like that you enjoy your food.

896
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,460
Is that so?

897
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,830
He fell for her again.

898
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,440
I can't stop eating because it's so tasty.

899
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,840
(Rustling)

900
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,350
So cute. You keep eating.

901
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,450
Chan Hyeong, why would you...

902
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,980
Don't look at me eating.

903
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,790
I should eat this
after I put you to sleep.

904
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,020
This feels uncomfortable.

905
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,990
- How can you say that?
- No, I mean...

906
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,990
- You feel uncomfortable?
- That was...

907
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,090
I said something nice.

908
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,430
It's not because of what you said.

909
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,500
It feels like you should go to sleep,
and that makes me feel uncomfortable.

910
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,100
- That was what I meant.
- It's okay. I'm fine with a short sleep.

911
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,300
No problem.

912
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,670
- You should go to bed now.
- What time is it?

913
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,840
It's 3:30 a.m.

914
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,510
- It's 3:30 a.m.?
- You should go to sleep now.

915
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,980
What should we do?
If you feel uncomfortable,

916
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,380
I can sleep here on the sofa.

917
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,980
- No. I don't mind.
- Because, you know.

918
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,820
We might be...

919
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,560
- It's okay.
- showing each other how we sleep.

920
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,930
So if it feels uncomfortable.

921
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,630
Well, no. I don't mind.

922
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,330
- Really?
- No. I'm okay with it.

923
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,970
They have to go into the same room.

924
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,070
They must feel awkward.

925
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,940
I can see that they feel shy.

926
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,670
I don't mind.

927
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,380
Which one are you going to use?

928
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,310
- Me? The one inside.
- Which one? The one inside?

929
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,150
Okay. I'll be coming in and out more.

930
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,250
She's eating there too?

931
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,150
That's so cute.

932
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,520
I'm going to wash up fast for now...

933
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,290
and take a shower tomorrow.

934
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,690
- She doesn't stop eating.
- My goodness.

935
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,360
- I'll be outside.
- Okay.

936
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,800
I'll give you this with the toothpaste.

937
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,300
- He's so sweet.
- That's nice.

938
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,330
Putting the toothpaste for her.

939
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,140
They have matching gowns here too.

940
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
I see.

941
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,710
(He gives her the toothbrush.)

942
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,850
Thank you.

943
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,060
(She turns off the light for Chan Hyeong
who will sleep only for a few hours.)

944
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,290
Chae Eun is so thoughtful.

945
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,800
- Do you want to put on a facial mask?
- That sounds nice.

946
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,000
I brought two.

947
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Seriously.

948
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,770
I brought a lot of facial masks
to the Pairing House,

949
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,770
but I never got to use them.

950
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,570
Really? Why?

951
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,640
- Well, I...
- Were you sleepy? Tired?

952
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,970
I fell asleep right away.

953
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,340
- Really?
- Yes.

954
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,380
I had no energy to do it.

955
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,810
- Is that so? Gosh, I feel sorry for you.
- Yes.

956
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,220
(She feels sorry for him.)

957
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,090
I'll put it on for you. Come here.

958
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,950
Let me do it for you. Sit here.

959
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,790
Should I lie down like this?

960
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,430
Go to sleep right after this.

961
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,330
I think I can sleep like this.

962
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,200
Put this on and go to sleep.

963
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,000
I think you'll fall asleep like this.

964
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,500
I feel so good. It's so comfortable.

965
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,570
Your skin will glow tomorrow.

966
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,310
You're going to sleep
for only three hours anyway.

967
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,450
I think you can take it off
when you wake up.

968
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,880
Come up a bit more.

969
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,590
- It's so comfortable.
- So you can sleep right away.

970
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,820
This is different.

971
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,220
- Is that so?
- This one is.

972
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,430
I might die because it's too sweet.

973
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,460
Come up a little more. I'll tuck you in.

974
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,830
- This is so nice.
- I'll put you to sleep and wash up.

975
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,670
This is so nice. Oh, right.
You need to wash up too.

976
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm definitely sleeping before you.

977
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,370
- I'll sleep before you. Sorry.
- This is what I think.

978
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,040
I tuck you in,
and you'll fall asleep in 0.1 seconds.

979
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,080
Thank you so much
for being so considerate.

980
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,750
Gosh, this is so comfortable.

981
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,890
She even covered his feet. Goodness.

982
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,060
I'll sleep like this.

983
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,690
You must be so tired.

984
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,830
(Chae Eun understands Chan Hyeong
who is so tired.)

985
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,300
I'll be sleeping, so wash up comfortably.

986
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,370
Okay.

987
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,340
- I love it.
- He's cute.

988
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,110
Thank you for the facial mask.
This is so nice.

989
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,240
No, Chan Hyeong.
I'm the one who should thank you.

990
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,280
My skin will be so soft tomorrow.

991
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,450
- I'll look forward to it.
- I'll be amazing tomorrow.

992
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,720
When you come back from work,
sleep while I cook, okay?

993
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,190
I should...

994
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,190
Will the alarm wake you in the morning?

995
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,860
This could be a bit
uncomfortable for you, right?

996
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,330
No, I'm okay.

997
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,900
I have to get up, so...

998
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,540
I'll set an alarm.
I hope I get up right away.

999
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,240
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1000
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,290
(The first night of the home date ends.)

1001
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,760
(I love it.)

1002
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,190
- I love it.
- As I was watching it,

1003
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,460
since I'm single...

1004
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,330
(What?)

1005
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,330
- This was my reaction.
- You saw what it would be like...

1006
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,330
when you get married.

1007
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,500
- Yes.
- I see.

1008
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,600
(If this is what marriage is,
I want to get married too.)

1009
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,940
In the end,

1010
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,240
- Chae Eun chose this.
- Right.

1011
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,370
If she were with Sang Yun,

1012
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,470
- I think it would've been awkward.
- Right.

1013
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,380
And as she saw
how Chan Hyeong was so happy with her,

1014
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,950
she felt even happier.

1015
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,080
- I thought they looked so good together.
- Seriously.

1016
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
They're a match made in heaven.

1017
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,290
Chan Hyeong prepared so many things today.

1018
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,160
He brought the socks and everything.

1019
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,660
- Right.
- Also, the cooking.

1020
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,860
I think he prepared for it.

1021
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,230
- I see.
- He must've planned what to do.

1022
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,960
It wasn't from experience.
He prepared for it.

1023
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,800
- He studied.
- Yes.

1024
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,470
- I'm so happy.
- Indeed.

1025
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,470
(Ji Min's letter of reflection...)

1026
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,570
(though no one scolded him)

1027
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,880
On the day of the home date, I thought,

1028
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,020
"I choose Je Yeon."

1029
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,420
"But you can follow your heart, Je Yeon."

1030
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,720
Clearly, I hope that she'll pick me.

1031
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,890
During the date on Christmas...

1032
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,960
Are you concerned about anything
right now?

1033
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,670
It's not easy for me either.

1034
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,770
That night...

1035
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,470
I know.

1036
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,280
I got a bit emotional.

1037
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,480
And I felt sorry.

1038
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,520
I guess it doesn't show.

1039
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,250
- Not at all.
- No one knows I'm struggling.

1040
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,450
(Although Je Yeon doesn't show
that she's struggling,)

1041
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,520
Right.

1042
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,390
(I should have taken another look.)

1043
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,120
I thought...

1044
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,130
maybe I should have been considerate
toward her the day before.

1045
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,460
Picturing her talking to others...

1046
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,930
as if nothing's wrong...

1047
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,130
Exactly.

1048
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,370
I felt really bad for her.

1049
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,810
She's doing her best on her end.

1050
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,040
You seemed unhappy.

1051
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,480
- Me?
- Or not.

1052
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,650
I'll go upstairs.

1053
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,360
At that moment,

1054
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,030
I wasn't sure what I was feeling.

1055
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,060
You know,

1056
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,100
it's not like she's my daughter.

1057
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,800
But it breaks my heart...

1058
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,940
when I imagine her
getting her feelings hurt or struggling.

1059
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Yes.

1060
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,350
But I had never felt that way
anywhere else...

1061
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,050
my entire life.

1062
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,890
Whether she chooses me or not,

1063
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,620
I won't be disappointed.

1064
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,530
I'm certain about my feelings for her,

1065
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,900
so nothing can change my mind.

1066
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,330
Nothing's changed. It's the same.

1067
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,100
If we're attracted,
we can accommodate each other.

1068
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,850
(He feels bad for her for some reason.)

1069
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,020
(Their story...)

1070
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:38,060
(needs no approval...)

1071
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:42,860
(and comes with no conditions.)

1072
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,000
(Grinning)

1073
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,770
It's Je Yeon.

1074
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,470
(He can't hide his smile.)

1075
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,380
But...

1076
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,880
there she was.

1077
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,720
I was...

1078
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,290
really...

1079
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,520
I think "happy" is the right word.

1080
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,620
Ji Min is already smiling.

1081
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,590
I was exhilarated.

1082
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,430
(A car pulls up in front of Je Yeon.)

1083
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,100
He's so happy.

1084
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,000
(Ji Min and Je Yeon will go
on a home date.)

1085
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,670
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

1086
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,940
- What?
- What are you doing here?

1087
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,780
You didn't know I'd be here?

1088
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,720
- What?
- You weren't expecting me?

1089
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,850
I never know.

1090
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,790
I wore the jacket you liked.

1091
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,060
(So did I.)

1092
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,960
How did you know?

1093
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,130
I remember one of your clothes.

1094
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,800
I don't know if you remember,
but back in Florence,

1095
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,330
I complimented your long coat.

1096
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,240
Oh, I remember. It's my favorite coat.

1097
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,710
Yes. It looked so good on you,
and I thought it was pretty.

1098
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,770
Really?

1099
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,080
(Ji Min remembered Je Yeon's coat...)

1100
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,480
(that she wore in Italy.)

1101
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,280
We read each other's minds.

1102
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,650
Ji Min finally seems relieved.

1103
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,920
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just a little.

1104
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,760
Just a little? Aren't you cold?

1105
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,630
- Did you have a hand warmer?
- Yes.

1106
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,060
You wore this, though.

1107
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,760
I did.

1108
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,100
I picked you,

1109
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,670
so you were the only one
I could have possibly met.

1110
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,500
- Oh, you're right.
- Yes.

1111
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,540
Me too.

1112
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,940
For me,

1113
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,810
the shearling jacket.

1114
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,680
- The one I wore on the date with you?
- Yes.

1115
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,780
(Je Yeon also remembered Ji Min's jacket.)

1116
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,080
It was so much fun that night.

1117
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,150
- You can appreciate it more.
- Should we?

1118
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,720
- Let's sit on the stairs and watch.
- Good idea.

1119
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,920
- I was so thankful when he said that.
- Should we sit here?

1120
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,990
Yes.

1121
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,720
It must have been so cold.

1122
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,430
I just felt relieved at that moment.

1123
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,870
I've caught glimpses of her,

1124
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,330
and she was beautiful.

1125
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,810
If I had found him uncomfortable,

1126
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,010
I wouldn't have watched the performance
for that long.

1127
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,550
It made my heart flutter
while making me feel comfortable.

1128
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,850
(Staring)

1129
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,890
(He's in his element.)

1130
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,020
He's so glad.

1131
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,860
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1132
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,470
- What?
- Nothing.

1133
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,900
It's just...

1134
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,270
amazing how time went by.

1135
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,310
Right.

1136
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,580
To be honest, I feel...

1137
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,060
(Turning)

1138
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,900
You're like a bunny.

1139
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:06,970
You're a total bunny.

1140
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,700
I remember picking each other's emojis.

1141
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,140
You were a fox.

1142
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,140
- Right.
- Yes.

1143
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,540
I insisted on being a fox.

1144
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,910
- But you're actually a puppy.
- Yes.

1145
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,220
(Take one more look before bed.)

1146
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,460
(Their pet names were Fox and Bunny
during the contract relationship.)

1147
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,990
(I love this photo.)

1148
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,730
(So do I!)

1149
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,360
(I wish we could take another one
tomorrow, but we won't have time.)

1150
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,360
Will it be like a cozy home for newlyweds?

1151
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,770
Probably.

1152
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,330
Je Yeon is flustered!

1153
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,300
Do you think we can live together
and cook?

1154
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,070
I'm a better cook than you are.

1155
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,440
Yes.

1156
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,010
I'll try cooking.

1157
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,380
But you know that you can't complain.

1158
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,380
I know.

1159
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,820
- You think you can follow that rule?
- Yes.

1160
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,320
Chapagetti is like my ultimate skill.

1161
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,330
(Moaning)

1162
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,570
(Ji Min's ultimate dish
has already been approved.)

1163
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,500
It was so tasty.

1164
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,970
Today...

1165
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,840
What is it?

1166
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
- What?
- What?

1167
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,940
What about today?

1168
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,580
Do you want me to cook for you?

1169
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,280
(Squealing)

1170
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,580
She must have practiced.

1171
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,850
Don't you think so?

1172
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,180
Oh, my gosh!

1173
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,220
(That's so exciting!)

1174
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,560
That's cute.

1175
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,890
(It makes them burst into laughter.)

1176
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,860
(Glancing)

1177
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,730
Or you can cook.

1178
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,170
Cook for me.

1179
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,100
I'll eat it even if it's burnt.

1180
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,340
Even if it's burnt to a crisp.

1181
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,440
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

1182
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,810
- I'll even be your assistant.
- Great.

1183
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,350
That's adorable.

1184
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,380
I know that she's not
interested in cooking and she's bad.

1185
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,320
But she put her effort,
and it comes from the heart.

1186
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,320
(Although it comes from the heart,)

1187
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,290
(she's still a lousy cook.)

1188
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,230
I know how much courage it took for her.

1189
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,100
(That's why he's even more thankful
for her cooking.)

1190
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,870
I'll be great to you.

1191
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,570
I meant today.

1192
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
I know.

1193
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,880
- What are you going to cook?
- What?

1194
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,240
Bulgogi?

1195
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,810
Bulgogi? You know how to make bulgogi?

1196
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,880
- But you've never made it before.
- No.

1197
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,120
- Does that concern you?
- No.

1198
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,150
- Your eyes seemed concerned.
- No.

1199
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,460
- I can't wait to see it.
- How do you marinate it?

1200
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,260
The marinade? I have one in mind.

1201
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,060
I studied the recipe.

1202
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,230
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1203
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,200
- Why is this so funny?
- What?

1204
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,370
Peeled onions.

1205
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,570
Yes, we need peeled onions.

1206
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,840
(Impressed)

1207
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,070
Look at you.

1208
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,310
Here it is.

1209
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,380
(She found the secret sauce.)

1210
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,780
This is it.

1211
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,850
- I think it's the one.
- Did you look it up?

1212
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,950
You studied really hard.

1213
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,650
We need instant rice,

1214
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,090
water...

1215
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,290
Ramyeon.

1216
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,860
- What kind of ramyeon do you like?
- I can cook ramyeon so well.

1217
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,960
Really?

1218
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,530
Are we going to drink?

1219
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,790
Should we?d

1220
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
(Lovey-dovey)

1221
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,370
- Are these your favorite chips?
- No, my favorite one is...

1222
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,470
- What?
- What was it called?

1223
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,570
- Homerun Ball.
- Homerun Ball?

1224
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,940
(Today's main ingredient)

1225
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,640
- You think this is funny too, right?
- What?

1226
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,640
(Laughing)

1227
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,380
You never imagined
you'd be doing this with me, right?

1228
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,680
No.

1229
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,550
Just three weeks ago.

1230
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,920
(After shopping for groceries)

1231
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,760
I have no idea where we're headed.

1232
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,960
Me too.

1233
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,890
It's mysterious.

1234
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,290
I know.

1235
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,200
(This is where they're headed.)

1236
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,370
That's...

1237
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,070
(Amazed)

1238
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,370
(They arrived at their private house.)

1239
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,940
This is nice!

1240
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,440
It is. It looks fantastic.

1241
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,610
Input the passcode.

1242
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,810
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

1243
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,820
(Exclaiming)

1244
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,720
I didn't know this kind of place existed.

1245
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,990
Wear your slippers.

1246
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,960
(Living room)

1247
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,460
- It looks amazing.
- Goodness.

1248
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,230
It's a shame they only get one night.

1249
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,270
Exactly.

1250
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,800
(The house has a different vibe
from the Pairing House.)

1251
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,570
This is awesome!

1252
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,270
It's beautiful.

1253
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,240
It's better than our house.

1254
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,810
It is.

1255
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,480
It looks absolutely amazing.

1256
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,650
- It reminds me of that day.
- When?

1257
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,650
When we first entered the Pairing House,

1258
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,520
you showed me around the house.

1259
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,690
I did.

1260
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,900
(Bedroom)

1261
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,130
This is lovely.

1262
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,530
Totally. I love it.

1263
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,940
- There's a styler.
- You're right.

1264
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,910
Let's put all our clothes inside.
What do you think?

1265
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,040
Sure.

1266
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,110
We'll take turns... What?

1267
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,280
Will I be able to fall asleep...

1268
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,180
next to your bed?

1269
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,450
(They get ready to cook
after a house tour.)

1270
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,090
I have a feeling
this will be entertaining.

1271
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,790
(Surprised)

1272
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,760
- Is that a speaker?
- I'll pair it.

1273
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,560
- What kind of music do you want?
- What?

1274
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,360
Music?

1275
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,800
The one you played last time.

1276
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,900
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

1277
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,740
(Playing music)

1278
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,910
- Is this it?
- I think so.

1279
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,780
You never even told me the title.

1280
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,710
It's "Saturday."

1281
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,550
(He puts on an apron before cooking.)

1282
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,650
(Putting it on)

1283
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,890
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1284
00:56:58,890 --> 00:56:59,920
(Turning)

1285
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,620
That's cute.

1286
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,460
- I look pretty funny.
- What?

1287
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,700
In the mirror.

1288
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,900
You do.

1289
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,670
- Are you good?
- What?

1290
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,870
It suits you.

1291
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,480
I won't tie it too tightly.

1292
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,250
(They tie each other's aprons.)

1293
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,720
Let's chop all the ingredients first.

1294
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,820
- I'll chop them.
- Sure.

1295
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,230
Try to remember the recipe by heart.

1296
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,060
The recipe?
First, we get the peeled onions.

1297
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,360
You can guide me...

1298
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,570
since you're the main chef.

1299
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,440
- Do you want me to cut them diagonally?
- What?

1300
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,570
- Diagonally to make them look better.
- Yes.

1301
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,670
(Looking)

1302
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,580
You'll hurt your hand that way.

1303
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,680
Put your fingers...

1304
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,850
- like this.
- Like this?

1305
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,150
- No. You need to curl your nails.
- Like this?

1306
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,220
There you go.

1307
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,290
That way, the knife can't cut your hand.

1308
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:08,890
Then, you slide over.

1309
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,230
- It's so nice to watch.
- Good.

1310
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,690
Stop.

1311
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,030
Well done.
Should we cut it diagonally now?

1312
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,960
That's so cute.

1313
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,270
(Time to marinate the meat)

1314
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,600
(Staring)

1315
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,930
He can't take his eyes off her.

1316
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,310
Should we return this oil?

1317
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,340
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1318
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,980
What do you have on your hair?

1319
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,980
Is there something on it?

1320
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,380
How did the sauce get there?

1321
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,780
You put it on my hair, didn't you?

1322
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,350
You worked really hard.

1323
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,020
(Embarrassed)

1324
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,620
It looks pretty good.

1325
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,090
- Right?
- The color, I mean.

1326
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:45,260
Yes.

1327
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:51,730
(Cooking bulgogi marinated by Je Yeon)

1328
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:54,870
Is this "Lee Je Yeon's Cooking Class?"

1329
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,270
They're so lovey-dovey.

1330
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,070
The rice is cooked well.

1331
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,780
Is it?

1332
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,850
Je Yeon, here.

1333
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,020
- Ji Min is such a sweet guy.
- Yes.

1334
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,020
Do you like it?

1335
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,530
(Place the cooked bulgogi on a plate.)

1336
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,430
I was starving.

1337
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,300
- You must be starving.
- I am.

1338
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,700
(A big bite)

1339
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:30,270
What do you think?

1340
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,970
- It's seasoned perfectly.
- Really?

1341
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,310
- It's perfect.
- Really?

1342
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,510
Yes.

1343
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,380
We may need more rice.

1344
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,120
It's so good.

1345
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,990
(Happy)

1346
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,830
Je Yeon, you're good. This is delicious.

1347
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,100
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

1348
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,100
She's pleased.

1349
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,370
(Proud)

1350
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,270
I've always been a good cook.

1351
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,940
You just don't cook that often.
You know how to do it.

1352
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,910
(Nodding)

1353
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,150
(Their quality dinner continues.)

1354
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,650
Did you have any second thoughts...

1355
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,250
about meeting me tonight?

1356
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,390
When you had to make a choice.

1357
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,660
I didn't.

1358
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,430
It's so touching!

1359
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,500
Because of the Christmas date?

1360
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,630
No, for me...

1361
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,370
Do you know what convinced me?

1362
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,240
Tell us.

1363
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,510
Je Yeon started speaking her mind.

1364
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,240
- She's determined.
- Yes.

1365
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,010
The day you mistakenly came to me.

1366
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,680
The day you came
when you weren't supposed to.

1367
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,650
- Why?
- What?

1368
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,680
Why?

1369
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,630
I came when I wasn't supposed to,
and a new guy came,

1370
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,500
- and it made you realize your feelings.
- Yes.

1371
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,230
Did it hit you?

1372
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,770
It hit me hard.

1373
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,200
Because I was so glad to see you.

1374
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,640
Everyone needs a crisis, indeed.

1375
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,140
That's why.

1376
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,110
The GPS kept telling me to go there.

1377
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,550
It was a good mistake, then.

1378
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,450
Yes, it was a great mistake.

1379
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,650
"A good mistake."

1380
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,560
That's how.

1381
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,930
Do you know
when I thought you were the prettiest?

1382
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,830
No.

1383
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,230
In Florence.

1384
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,300
The day was over,

1385
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,010
and I came over to your room.

1386
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,480
- You and Ha Neul were roommates.
- We were.

1387
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,710
You were lying in bed.
Maybe you were feeling unwell.

1388
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,280
And you sat up in bed all messy and dazed.

1389
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,690
That looked so pretty to me.

1390
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,260
- The way I looked messy?
- Yes.

1391
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,560
I almost thought
it was a commercial for beds.

1392
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,890
And you were sitting up like this.

1393
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,230
You were half-asleep
and trying to join in the conversation.

1394
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,200
That left a strong impression on me.

1395
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,270
(Nodding)

1396
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,510
But I know...

1397
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,210
that you've been struggling...

1398
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,080
all by yourself.

1399
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,450
Now that I know what your pace is...

1400
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,550
and that I fully understand it,
I felt so bad.

1401
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,420
So, I've been meaning to tell you.

1402
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,600
This is the most fun I've had
since I got here.

1403
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,910
Why don't we clean this up?

1404
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,580
I wish they would give us
some wooden chopsticks.

1405
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,910
We need to eat ramyeon.

1406
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,280
Or is it that I can't find them?

1407
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,490
- There are only forks and knives.
- Really?

1408
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,360
We haven't found chopsticks yet?

1409
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,590
(Ji Min was looking
for chopsticks desperately.)

1410
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,130
There are no chopsticks.

1411
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,460
(They ended up eating with forks.)

1412
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,860
Are there still
many company get-togethers?

1413
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,670
- It's rare, isn't it?
- At my company...

1414
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,300
What's unique at my work...

1415
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,640
(Using it naturally like a spoon)

1416
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,270
Do you go out to lunch or dinner?

1417
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,340
It can be either lunch or dinner.

1418
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,140
(Both of them are easygoing.)

1419
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,480
My team has such a great vibe.

1420
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,810
(This is exciting.)

1421
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,280
I'll put it to the side.

1422
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,290
(Ji Min who doesn't stay seated)

1423
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,190
- It's so delicious.
- It's delicious.

1424
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,360
Isn't it funny that we're here together?

1425
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,790
(Ji Min, the somaek genius)

1426
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,430
This is the mix for you.

1427
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,300
The mix for me is a little different.

1428
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,500
Can I get a little tipsy?

1429
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,340
(They're excited even without chopsticks.)

1430
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,570
This should be cool.

1431
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,210
Cheers.

1432
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,280
Cheers.

1433
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,090
- It's so delicious.
- I agree. You made it well.

1434
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,760
Goodness.

1435
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,230
It made all the fatigue...

1436
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,560
- disappear.
- Really?

1437
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,030
What about my work?

1438
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,730
You said that your work was hard today.

1439
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,300
I was concerned about tonight.

1440
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,900
(Ending their day with warm dinner)

1441
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,410
Gosh, I turn red too.

1442
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,570
What are these? They're chopsticks.

1443
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,240
Where?

1444
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,280
I don't think there are chopsticks here.

1445
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,110
(He was sure
that there were no chopsticks.)

1446
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,350
Ahn Ji Min, come here.

1447
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,420
Here are the chopsticks.

1448
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,920
(The type of troublemaking husband
who can't find chopsticks)

1449
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
(Running away)

1450
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,990
I didn't know.

1451
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,630
We only need them for eating ramyeon.

1452
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,500
That's true.

1453
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,830
- As the wife...
- The Christmas tree is beautiful.

1454
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,870
- Take a photo of it.
- What?

1455
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:04,840
- The tree?
- Yes.

1456
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,850
(Clicking)

1457
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,450
- Show me.
- What?

1458
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,480
Show me.

1459
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,390
I took it from afar.

1460
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,990
I don't mind.

1461
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,020
(Coy)

1462
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,260
That's cute.

1463
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,730
Did I show you
the sunset photo that I took?

1464
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,900
- The one on your background screen?
- Yes.

1465
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,000
(Nodding)

1466
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,100
Did you take it on Jeju Island?

1467
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,740
You know a lot about me now.

1468
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,140
Of course.

1469
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,910
I'd like to see your photo album
if you have many photos.

1470
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,020
- Did I not show this to you?
- No, you didn't.

1471
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,220
- Really?
- Let me see.

1472
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:54,620
Wait.

1473
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,590
Let's see.

1474
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,890
Is this your Kakaotalk profile photo?
You have profile photos?

1475
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,160
Don't look at other photos.

1476
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,130
- Why not? I want to see them.
- Give it back. No.

1477
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,200
(Rushing)

1478
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,970
- Why not?
- I'll show them to you.

1479
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,940
- Goodness.
- I couldn't see any.

1480
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,340
You're so spoiled.

1481
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,480
- I couldn't see any.
- What?

1482
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,810
You covered them with your hand.

1483
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,380
You can't see these. They're old photos.

1484
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,520
Since they're profile photos,
didn't you mean to show them?

1485
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,620
That's true.

1486
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,820
I'll see them anyway
since we'll add each other on Kakaotalk.

1487
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,090
Look at them from far away.

1488
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,760
The photo looks nice.

1489
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,640
It's cute how you're showing it to me
because it came out well.

1490
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,780
We didn't do much, but it's still fun.

1491
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,620
Ta-da.

1492
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,990
This is my fantasy when I get married.

1493
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,360
Your fantasy?

1494
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,460
Having a drink with my wife
after work on Friday night.

1495
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,430
If we have a child,
we'd order chicken and drink quietly.

1496
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,540
- With his wife.
- Cheers.

1497
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:18,670
(A toast just for the two of them)

1498
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,480
Once you're done with that,
drink a refreshing one.

1499
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,750
(Checking her looks)

1500
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,380
- Do you want me to take a photo of you?
- What?

1501
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,520
- You look really beautiful right now.
- Now?

1502
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
No.

1503
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,930
(Staring)

1504
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,760
Shall we take a selfie?

1505
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,560
- Sure.
- Together.

1506
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,970
- "Together?"
- Sure.

1507
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,140
- You take it.
- She told him to take it.

1508
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,870
Sit down.

1509
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,110
Make a pretty face. That's it. Stay still.

1510
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,620
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's selfie time)

1511
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,880
(Click)

1512
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,950
That's hilarious.

1513
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,660
- You came out well.
- Really?

1514
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,590
I'll stay like this.

1515
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,160
I think I look bad.

1516
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,530
Stay still.

1517
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,200
(Clicking again)

1518
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,170
You look so pretty.

1519
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,040
- In this photo?
- You look very pretty.

1520
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,080
I don't care about my face.

1521
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:36,450
Je Yeon suggested taking a selfie first.

1522
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,590
You should take many photos today.

1523
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,690
You look beautiful.

1524
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,930
I like this type of interior design.

1525
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,500
- This place?
- Yes.

1526
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,840
It's chic.

1527
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:02,080
The aura of a man
who has found his place in society.

1528
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,510
The scent of masculinity.
What do you think?

1529
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,080
Yes.

1530
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,190
You're a puppy, okay?

1531
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,320
But I want to be a male.

1532
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,660
No, I prefer the puppy.

1533
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,790
- "Okay?"
- No,

1534
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,560
I'm not a puppy. I'm a fox.

1535
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,800
You're a puppy.

1536
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,570
What are you doing? You silly.

1537
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:34,980
"Silly?"

1538
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,580
- Goodness.
- They're in their honeymoon phase.

1539
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,050
You're so silly.

1540
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,890
(Do you mean you?)

1541
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,920
(No, you.)

1542
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,760
People act childish
when they like someone.

1543
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,930
What?

1544
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,590
I'm grateful and sorry.

1545
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,030
Sorry about what? Grateful for what?

1546
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,570
Well...

1547
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,810
For judging things on my own.

1548
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,470
He did that.

1549
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,610
I'm grateful to you...

1550
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,680
for staying open-minded despite all that.

1551
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,600
My goodness.

1552
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,040
Oh, my.

1553
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,250
She must have written something.

1554
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,550
I don't get it.

1555
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,650
You wrote "silly."

1556
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,360
Have fun with me again tomorrow.

1557
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,700
- Okay.
- What?

1558
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,830
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1559
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,530
I don't think you heard correctly.

1560
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,600
I heard you.

1561
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,910
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

1562
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,110
(What did he say just now?)

1563
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,110
- I'll sleep on the floor.
- What?

1564
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,210
I'll sleep on the floor.

1565
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,310
Where on the floor?

1566
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,810
I can sleep on this rug.

1567
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,320
- You want to sleep here?
- Yes.

1568
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,790
But...

1569
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,120
Won't you be cold?

1570
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,660
No, it's perfect.

1571
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,230
Do you want some toothpaste?

1572
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,970
(Washing up and getting ready to sleep)

1573
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,440
They won't be sleeping in the same room.

1574
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,440
Can you give me some moisturizing cream?

1575
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:47,240
- Moisturizing cream?
- Yes.

1576
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,140
What?

1577
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,850
I wanted to thank you
for the moisturizing cream.

1578
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,620
Go away.

1579
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,190
Go and wash up.

1580
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,120
Don't come in.

1581
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,290
- What?
- Don't come in.

1582
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:03,220
I won't come in even if you ask me to.

1583
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,660
- Sleep well, Je Yeon.
- You too.

1584
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:15,140
(Ji Min takes the blanket
and goes downstairs.)

1585
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,940
(The same house)

1586
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,680
(Different rooms)

1587
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,520
(It's hard to fall asleep tonight.)

1588
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,190
It feels like
my romantic side is coming back to life.

1589
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,320
- I feel happy.
- I agree.

1590
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,920
Now that Je Yeon opened up to him,

1591
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,520
- it's progressing fast.
- Right.

1592
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,860
When Ji Min saw Je Yeon
for the first time,

1593
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,130
he had a particular look on his face.
It showed that he found her...

1594
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,630
- unbearably cute.
- He held back his smile.

1595
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:43,760
(He couldn't hide the look
on his face when he saw Je Yeon.)

1596
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,600
Mimi called them "Ji Je Yeon"
since the first episode.

1597
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,300
- Right.
- She predicted it.

1598
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,300
Ji Min has that look on his face
even today.

1599
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,470
I'm so happy.

1600
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,610
It feels like my dream came true.

1601
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,280
(They finished cleaning up the house
early in the morning.)

1602
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,650
You worked this morning.

1603
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,080
You must be tired. How do you feel?

1604
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,450
I had fun.

1605
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:04,450
- You did?
- Yes.

1606
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,450
Aren't you tired?

1607
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,550
I'm not tired,

1608
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,260
but my legs are swollen.

1609
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,360
- Your legs?
- Yes.

1610
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,290
(Legs, 3 times)

1611
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,100
- Try it.
- Legs.

1612
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,100
(Intensive care, 1 out of 3)

1613
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,070
The pressure is strong.

1614
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,240
- Is it effective?
- My legs feel more relaxed.

1615
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,300
- They feel more relaxed?
- Yes.

1616
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,240
(Nice and refreshing stretching)

1617
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,310
This is really nice.

1618
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,580
Do you like firm or soft mattresses?

1619
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,110
I like soft ones.

1620
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,610
In that case,

1621
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,880
we can adjust the firmness.

1622
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,390
- This is fascinating.
- It's getting softer.

1623
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,750
This is fascinating.

1624
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,790
(Soft)

1625
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,090
- This is nice.
- Right.

1626
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,230
(While Je Yeon is sleeping,)

1627
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,470
(Ji Min is making ramyeon for brunch.)

1628
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,770
(Adding chopped green onions)

1629
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,770
(Finishing with an egg)

1630
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,280
It looks very delicious.

1631
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,280
It looks delicious.

1632
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,110
It smells really good.

1633
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,050
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1634
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,160
(Slurping)

1635
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,500
It's good.

1636
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,130
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1637
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,210
I thought that it'd be salty,
but it's not.

1638
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,680
(Relaxing lunch with ramyeon)

1639
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,310
- They got comfortable around each other.
- Right.

1640
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,350
They don't seem concerned anymore.

1641
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,380
Right.

1642
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,820
(The night at the Pairing House)

1643
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,330
It's Chang Hwan.

1644
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,460
He's at the Pairing House.

1645
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:02,070
(Chang Hwan is the first one to return.)

1646
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,140
Did he not get paired?

1647
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,840
- No way.
- Oh, no.

1648
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,120
It's Ha Neul.

1649
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,620
(Ha Neul returns after him.)

1650
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,360
- Wait a minute.
- I guess they didn't get paired.

1651
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,830
No way.

1652
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,630
Soo Ah. Sang Yun.

1653
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:44,680
He turned off the light.

1654
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,380
(Sighing)

1655
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,950
It looks like he has a lot on his mind.

1656
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,120
(The home date pairing has ended.)

1657
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,390
He didn't get paired?

1658
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,820
Oh, no.

1659
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,320
(Chang Hwan picked Soo Ah.)

1660
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,370
- Goodness.
- That's sad.

1661
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,530
Yes, it's sad.

1662
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,470
(Ha Neul picked Ji Min.)

1663
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:12,670
(Sang Yun picked Chae Eun.)

1664
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,210
(And Soo Ah picked Ji Min.)

1665
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,210
Goodness.

1666
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,550
Soo Ah picked Ji Min.

1667
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,150
So that's what happened.

1668
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,150
It'd be awkward to stay in the same house.

1669
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,190
- For Soo Ah and Chang Hwan.
- They're both there.

1670
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,750
(Very worried)

1671
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,890
Soo Ah, when did you get back?

1672
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,230
I just got home from work.

1673
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:35,000
What? I got off work too.

1674
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,060
- I see.
- I'm tired.

1675
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,100
I got a text saying
that the pairing has ended.

1676
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,900
Yes, I received it too.

1677
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,810
- I expected it not to happen.
- It's upsetting.

1678
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,410
Some of the men should be here too.

1679
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,810
Two of them who didn't get paired.

1680
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,510
By the way,

1681
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,890
I was afraid that you'd feel pressured.

1682
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,660
Well...

1683
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,160
Either way,

1684
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,190
- I did it knowing that it'd happen.
- You knew it.

1685
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,560
- Soo Ah knew...
- Right.

1686
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,670
that Ji Min would pick Je Yeon.

1687
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,570
- Right.
- Now...

1688
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,640
Yes?

1689
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,770
You know Chang Hwan's personality.

1690
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,510
Chang Hwan's personality?

1691
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,010
He's softhearted.

1692
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:24,480
You're right.

1693
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,020
That's what I'm worried about.

1694
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,190
But how you feel is more important.

1695
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,560
Seriously.

1696
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:40,160
You did the right thing. You made
a firm decision based on your feelings.

1697
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,000
- Yes.
- Right, she did the right thing.

1698
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,270
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

1699
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,800
Chang Hwan is coming upstairs.

1700
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:53,870
(Rummaging)

1701
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:17,760
(He's easing his hunger
with a simple meal.)

1702
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,370
Someone must be cooking.

1703
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,200
It's Chang Hwan.

1704
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,500
- Hello, Chang Hwan.
- Hi.

1705
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,970
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1706
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,380
- It's awkward between them.
- Have you eaten?

1707
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:32,310
- No, not yet.
- I should've asked earlier.

1708
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:34,650
- Do you want some kimchi fried rice?
- Kimchi fried rice?

1709
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,020
No, I want some cake instead.

1710
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,680
I wanted to eat it yesterday,
but I didn't.

1711
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,490
The cake I bought.

1712
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:40,920
- This?
- Yes.

1713
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,990
I was about to eat
like a person living alone.

1714
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,890
Why were you eating all alone?

1715
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,730
I was eating alone...

1716
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,070
I hardly ate anything today.

1717
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,600
Why are you hurting my feelings like this?

1718
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,610
- What? What do you mean?
- What?

1719
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,840
You should've asked me to join you.

1720
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,010
I didn't know that you were here.

1721
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,410
- You didn't?
- I really didn't.

1722
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,050
You thought that
I got paired with someone?

1723
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,280
I was hoping that
I wouldn't get paired this time.

1724
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,820
- You were hoping that you wouldn't?
- Right.

1725
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,750
I mean, us.

1726
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,160
You were hoping
that we wouldn't get paired?

1727
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,330
- I thought that it was wrong.
- Why?

1728
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:23,360
You should talk to more people
and have more experience.

1729
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:25,570
If you pick me...

1730
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:28,200
after having done all that,

1731
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,340
you'd be making the right choice.

1732
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:31,770
It would also make me feel more confident.

1733
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:35,180
Even if you go on
a home date with someone else...

1734
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,010
I would definitely feel bitter,

1735
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,910
but I thought that it was only right.

1736
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,820
As you get to know someone else,

1737
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,920
you'd feel something.

1738
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:48,420
If you think about me for a few seconds
while being with him,

1739
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,290
it would mean...

1740
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,060
that I worked hard.

1741
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,860
If that isn't the case,

1742
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,770
it'd mean that I didn't work hard enough
or I wasn't charming enough.

1743
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,870
I wanted you to have the chance
to make that judgment...

1744
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,470
despite the short period of time.

1745
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,710
Right.

1746
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,880
Although...

1747
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,880
I was hoping that we wouldn't get paired,

1748
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,580
when we didn't get paired,

1749
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,520
it wasn't so pleasant.

1750
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,560
Oh, no.

1751
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,360
And so...

1752
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,490
the home date...

1753
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:27,530
Was it better that it didn't happen?

1754
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,530
- With you...
- In the end, the two of us...

1755
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,470
- It's a home date.
- We're on a home date.

1756
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,000
In a way, we got paired.

1757
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,440
- Let's call it a house date.
- Okay, it's a house date.

1758
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,570
You got something on there.

1759
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,810
It's gochujang.

1760
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,040
They're on a date at home,
but it's not home date.

1761
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Right.

1762
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,950
- They have a lot to say to each other.
- You're right.

1763
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:46,980
(This is even better.)

1764
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,620
Would you like some cake?

1765
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,690
- Cake?
- Yes.

1766
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,990
You should sit here.

1767
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,430
He's chugging his beer.

1768
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:08,440
(Chugging)

1769
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,910
Gosh, look at Soo Ah.

1770
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,510
You seem to have lost weight
over the past few days.

1771
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,550
- I haven't been able to eat much.
- Right.

1772
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,080
Why haven't you been able to eat much?

1773
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:29,320
I've been put off food
these past 3 or 4 days.

1774
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,660
I went as far as to having
only one meal a day,

1775
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:33,290
and there was a day
when I ate less than 1,000 calories.

1776
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,960
But...

1777
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,730
everything's coming to an end now,

1778
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,930
so it's understandable.

1779
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:40,930
Goodness, she's been on his mind.

1780
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,670
She must feel bad.

1781
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,070
Even this is low in calories.

1782
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,510
Come on.

1783
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,110
Chang Hwan has a fragile heart.

1784
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,150
- It's a bit chilly here.
- I know.

1785
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,320
Can I get you more blankets?

1786
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,650
I already have one.

1787
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,190
It's just naturally cold out here.

1788
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:10,630
(Chang Hwan's muffler will double
as a blanket.)

1789
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,570
He brought his muffler.

1790
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:16,600
Like this?

1791
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,570
- Make it a hijab.
- Yes, make it a hijab.

1792
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,140
Thanks.

1793
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,380
Being wrapped up in these blankets
and everything...

1794
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,450
makes it feel like
it's the holiday season.

1795
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:30,120
- Right?
- Tell me about it.

1796
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,520
When will we get another chance like this?

1797
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,950
Hey, Sang Yun.

1798
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,790
- Have you eaten?
- I haven't.

1799
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,890
- Exactly. Shouldn't you eat?
- We could order something.

1800
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,360
- We should.
- Who wants fried chicken?

1801
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,660
As if we should be eating meals.

1802
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,760
Are you not going to cook that?

1803
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,630
You only cook
when there's someone to share it with.

1804
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,540
It's perfectly fine to cook for yourself.

1805
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:53,970
- What can you do?
- Exactly.

1806
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,240
- Things happen, right?
- Of course.

1807
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,350
Sang Yun looks genuinely upset though.

1808
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:59,450
Sometimes it's one way,

1809
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,010
- sometimes another.
- Exactly.

1810
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,020
Sang Yun, weren't you upset?

1811
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,820
I've been upset since yesterday.

1812
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,990
How so?

1813
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:11,090
I've been upset ever since I realized
that I've been wasting my time.

1814
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:14,330
When I got home today,

1815
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:16,860
- to be honest...
- I bet you were exhausted.

1816
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,430
I thought, "What if Je Yeon was here?"

1817
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,500
- That's all I could think about.
- Right.

1818
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:22,500
- Were you glad she wasn't here?
- I was relieved.

1819
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,710
I believe I chose the best person here.

1820
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:29,140
So knowing that someone else
didn't choose her?

1821
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,080
It upsets me.

1822
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,250
Why not?

1823
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:37,450
I believe I chose the best person here,

1824
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,820
and she must think
that the guy she chose...

1825
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,720
also believes that.

1826
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:43,120
She's right there!

1827
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,130
She didn't have enough time.

1828
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,730
This hasn't been long enough.

1829
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,160
We were short on time.

1830
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,730
I truly wish she had been given
enough time to get to know others.

1831
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:55,470
Just say it's me.

1832
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,970
(Could she be bolder?)

1833
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,610
Soo Ah amazes me.

1834
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:01,810
"Just say it's me."

1835
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,210
(She's not like the others.)

1836
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,480
- She's honest, isn't she?
- She is.

1837
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,450
I'm right here.
It's "me," not "her or she."

1838
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,150
Why do you keep talking about me
in the third person?

1839
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,990
- There's no need to be shy.
- Should we give them the room?

1840
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,390
I don't like that Mr. Soo Ah is here.

1841
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,220
- Ms. Soo Ah.
- Ms. Soo Ah, not Mr. Soo Ah.

1842
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,830
It's Ms. Soo Ah.

1843
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,690
He kept referring to me
in the third person,

1844
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:22,960
so I was wondering if it was you.

1845
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,130
Is it me?

1846
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,300
Chang Hwan, were you talking about me?

1847
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,870
(Embarrassed)

1848
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,910
It's nice to have a drink...

1849
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,370
- with you here, Ha Neul.
- I know. It's nice.

1850
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:37,080
- When will we get a chance like this?
- Call us lucky.

1851
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,280
- We couldn't be luckier.
- We couldn't be luckier.

1852
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,880
(We couldn't be luckier.)

1853
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,520
They had to pack for the night.

1854
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,980
- Exactly.
- How bothersome is that?

1855
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,750
- They have to be back tomorrow.
- They'll have to unpack tomorrow.

1856
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,420
They have to go out
when it's cold outside. Right?

1857
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,460
Absolutely.

1858
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,520
This is complacency.

1859
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,860
We even have cold weather.

1860
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,360
(Only thinking positively)

1861
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,430
We'll all get to have a room
to ourselves tonight.

1862
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:58,360
You're right.

1863
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,600
That's the best.

1864
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:04,500
Even if we stay up drinking and eating...

1865
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,640
- until 1 or 2 in the morning,
- Right.

1866
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,440
- we'll still get 8 to 9 hours of sleep.
- Right.

1867
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,010
Forget 8 to 9 hours.

1868
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,110
Let's keep sleeping...

1869
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,980
- until they get home.
- I'm glad I took the day off tomorrow.

1870
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,550
- What?
- How nice is this?

1871
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,080
We sound really pathetic.

1872
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,980
I know.

1873
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:21,920
(A night of laughter
at the house goes by.)

1874
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,300
(Chang Hwan is up.)

1875
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,370
(He takes over the kitchen
as soon as he gets up.)

1876
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,440
He's making breakfast for everyone again.

1877
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,770
Always so sweet.

1878
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:42,740
He's such a great guy.

1879
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,850
Is it kimchi stew?

1880
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,220
(He doesn't forget the garlic.)

1881
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:59,230
(In goes everything he prepped.)

1882
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,260
(Working hard)

1883
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:05,100
(Stir-frying everything)

1884
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,640
(Looking tasty)

1885
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,380
That looks good.

1886
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,910
He's the best catch on the show.

1887
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,810
(Let me see.)

1888
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,720
- Good morning.
- Hey.

1889
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,890
I made kimchi stew.

1890
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,460
(Amazed)

1891
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:31,930
My voice is hoarse.

1892
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,530
Same here.

1893
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,360
(They exchange a quick greeting,
then each clean up.)

1894
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,270
And now we have an awkward silence.

1895
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:41,900
Goodness.

1896
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,040
I should do this first.

1897
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,380
Would you like to have a simple breakfast?

1898
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,780
I'd rather have some coffee first.

1899
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,620
I could get that for you.

1900
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,050
Chang Hwan's mindful of her.

1901
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,350
I'll go.

1902
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,490
I'll get you something
since I have to take this out anyway.

1903
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,120
What would you like? Americano?

1904
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,860
That's not necessary.

1905
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,860
It's only 30 seconds away.

1906
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:13,430
I won't be gone long. Americano, is it?

1907
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:16,300
Yes, but strong with minimal water.

1908
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,840
- Strong with minimal water?
- Yes.

1909
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:19,270
I'll get mine as well.

1910
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,510
Thanks.

1911
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:21,610
Where is he going?

1912
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:22,840
To get coffee.

1913
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,010
(I won't be gone long.)

1914
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,050
Let me serve you some.

1915
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,090
(Let me serve you some kimchi stew.)

1916
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,220
No way.

1917
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,690
How do you get it to look good in a photo?

1918
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,930
This is how Zoomers do it.

1919
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,530
- Is that how Zoomers do it?
- Like that?

1920
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,000
- How?
- What was it again?

1921
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:46,430
I'll do that too.

1922
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,500
I'm confident this time around.

1923
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,200
It tastes good. Goodness.

1924
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,970
- I'll enjoy.
- I'll enjoy.

1925
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:56,080
- I'll really enjoy this, Chang Hwan.
- Sure thing.

1926
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,320
Does this have oysters in it?

1927
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,450
No.

1928
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,150
I added some powdered anchovies.

1929
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,520
(I see!)

1930
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,590
This is my first time
having a home-cooked meal.

1931
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,930
- At this house?
- Yes.

1932
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:15,360
It's really good.

1933
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,900
(Smiling)

1934
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,200
We were punked.

1935
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,570
We thought they were enjoying a home date.

1936
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,310
It's been a while since I saw someone
chug a drink like that.

1937
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,380
And it was...

1938
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,510
a big bottle.

1939
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,180
It broke my heart.

1940
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:33,910
The footage from last week...

1941
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,280
had us convinced they had paired up.

1942
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,150
- That wasn't the case.
- I know.

1943
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,490
Chang Hwan chose Soo Ah,

1944
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,350
but they didn't get paired up.

1945
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,790
But the person he chose...

1946
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,520
was rejected by the person she chose,

1947
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,960
and they ended up together...

1948
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,290
- Exactly.
- at the Pairing House.

1949
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:48,830
In psychology, the behavior...

1950
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,600
Chang Hwan displayed earlier...

1951
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,700
is called cognitive dissonance.
He can't change...

1952
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,800
the outcome of the pairing
that has already happened.

1953
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,040
- Right.
- However,

1954
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,240
he's still upset and uncomfortable
with the outcome.

1955
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,610
When we can't change the outcome,

1956
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,240
we change our behavior and attitude.

1957
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,540
That's why he said...

1958
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,150
he was glad she wasn't paired with anyone.

1959
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,920
He was relieved for her sake.

1960
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,520
His words...

1961
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,650
were aimed at him as well.

1962
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,920
He's trying to say he's fine.

1963
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,290
When you're upset,

1964
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:17,960
- I believe it's okay to say nothing.
- Right.

1965
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,860
He would've been better off...

1966
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,830
- trying to make Soo Ah uncomfortable.
- Exactly.

1967
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:23,330
To make her mindful of him.

1968
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,530
I don't think this was Soo Ah
rejecting Chang Hwan.

1969
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:29,470
Since she knows where Chang Hwan stands,

1970
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:34,370
she wanted to use this opportunity
to hopefully get to know Ji Min.

1971
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:36,940
And Sang Yun just openly talked
about Je Yeon.

1972
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,180
I thought, "What if Je Yeon was here?"

1973
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:41,580
That came out of nowhere, didn't it?

1974
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,180
Here's the takeaway.

1975
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,520
He mentioned her after he told Chae Eun...

1976
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,020
that he was going to choose her
for the home date.

1977
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:52,960
- Exactly.
- Still, he mentioned Je Yeon.

1978
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:56,160
- His true feelings came out.
- That's right.

1979
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,770
- He's still interested in Je Yeon.
- Exactly.

1980
01:29:58,770 --> 01:29:59,870
That came out involuntarily.

1981
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,330
"What if Je Yeon was here?"

1982
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,770
That explained it all.

1983
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:05,300
- Exactly.
- Absolutely.

1984
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,940
(The morning of day 2 of the home date)

1985
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:16,150
(Ji Won stirs awake.)

1986
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,050
(Woo Jae's bed is empty.)

1987
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,220
Woo Jae's already up.

1988
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,320
(Yawning)

1989
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,030
Anyone can tell
he couldn't sleep last night.

1990
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,860
(Woo Jae woke up early.)

1991
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,800
- Morning. Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

1992
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,200
- It wasn't uncomfortable?
- No.

1993
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:38,810
Maybe we should have some apples.

1994
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:46,980
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1995
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,120
They're sitting so close together.

1996
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,950
(Sitting side by side, having breakfast)

1997
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,790
I was actually really tired.

1998
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,520
It seemed that way.

1999
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,160
I was really tired,

2000
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,960
- and you looked that way too.
- Right.

2001
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,800
We were both sleepy,
but we wanted to keep talking.

2002
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,770
I loved how we both kept trying...

2003
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,670
to keep the conversation going,
even though we were sleepy.

2004
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,810
Whenever there was a long pause,

2005
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,580
I wondered if you were sleeping.

2006
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:18,040
- What?
- "Is Ji Won asleep?"

2007
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,280
- During our conversation...
- You fell asleep.

2008
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,650
It's because you have such a nice voice.

2009
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:26,490
I don't remember a huge chunk
of our conversation.

2010
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,150
I dozed off.

2011
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:30,560
You were talking,
but I don't remember what it was about.

2012
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:34,760
- So...
- I was right to assume that.

2013
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,670
Still, I wanted to keep on talking,

2014
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,800
- so I pretended to have heard everything.
- I believe...

2015
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,470
we talked as much as we could.

2016
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,710
Right? Then, we both passed out.

2017
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,040
I like how similar we are,
even about these things.

2018
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,810
- Right.
- Right?

2019
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,150
Have I been eating with two forks?

2020
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,120
It's fine. Be liberal with your cutlery.

2021
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,290
"Be liberal with your cutlery."

2022
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:10,360
What do you even mean by that?

2023
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,700
That's hilarious.

2024
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,170
Woo Jae thinks he can be boring,

2025
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,370
- but Ji Won thinks he's funny.
- I know.

2026
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,540
Use all the cutlery you want.

2027
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,950
Have you made up your mind?

2028
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,350
- Me?
- Yes.

2029
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,180
Are you still thinking about it?

2030
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,220
I've...

2031
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,820
(Stop!)

2032
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,020
Decide carefully.

2033
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,190
Think about it
before you go to bed tonight.

2034
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,100
Goodness.

2035
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,540
(A grape rolls onto the floor.)

2036
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,770
- I'll wash that for you.
- It's fine.

2037
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:53,770
That should be rinsed.

2038
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:56,140
It's fine.
It was on the floor for only a second.

2039
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,680
It'll be dirty though.
This is a carpet of all things.

2040
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:01,980
You must believe in the three-second rule.

2041
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,180
Isn't it the national rule?

2042
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,260
- What?
- Here.

2043
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,360
(Giving her a different grape)

2044
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,020
He gave her a different grape.

2045
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,930
How about we take a photo
with a film camera on a timer?

2046
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,830
- That's a good idea.
- I'd like that.

2047
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:23,040
I can get it into the frame.

2048
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:25,840
This will block the view though.

2049
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:29,380
- I think we're set.
- Are you done?

2050
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,410
Let's give it a try.

2051
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,380
The sun's behind us,
but I think it'll be okay.

2052
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,380
Is it okay?

2053
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,050
(Quickly)

2054
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,720
(The camera isn't doing anything.)

2055
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,420
What?

2056
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:47,860
Hold on.

2057
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:49,330
Just a second.

2058
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,070
The light came on.

2059
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,700
(Rushing back)

2060
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,740
(Taking a photo side by side)

2061
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:06,550
(Another one with their arms linked)

2062
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,210
(In a daze)

2063
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,850
I think I was looking elsewhere.

2064
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,490
Let's take as much as we can.

2065
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,160
(Swing)

2066
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,600
(Their time together was captured
in a photograph.)

2067
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,000
- That's so pretty.
- The vibe of a film camera.

2068
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,130
I'm loving the vibe.

2069
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:26,470
- I'll get this to you.
- Sure.

2070
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,570
Woo Jae and Ji Won seem like a couple...

2071
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:33,140
- that's just starting out.
- Right.

2072
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,510
- Absolutely.
- They just enjoy each other's presence.

2073
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,980
You saw how Ji Won wrapped her arm
around his.

2074
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,310
That was something to watch,

2075
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:41,050
but then Woo Jae took her arm...

2076
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,620
- and wrapped it around his.
- Exactly.

2077
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,820
That made my heart skip a beat.

2078
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,450
The home date really solidified
their relationship.

2079
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:49,220
Solidified like concrete.

2080
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,260
That's right.

2081
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:56,000
That's Chan Hyeong.

2082
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
(An alarm cuts through the early morning.)

2083
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,270
(Chan Hyeong wakes up early.)

2084
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:01,730
- Have a good one.
- Sure.

2085
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:03,970
- Rest up.
- Got it.

2086
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:07,140
Chan Hyeong has to go to work.

2087
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:11,310
(The sky brightens.)

2088
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,380
(Stretching)

2089
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,920
(Chae Eun wakes up...)

2090
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,650
(from her peaceful sleep.)

2091
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:20,120
(Just then, Chan Hyeong
gets back from work.)

2092
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,890
(Carefully)

2093
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,560
Just in case Chae Eun is asleep.

2094
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,790
Right, hey. Yes, I'll send it right away.

2095
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,200
(Chan Hyeong is busy
even after getting back.)

2096
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,930
(After wrapping up his work,
he takes a nap.)

2097
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,100
Where's Chae Eun?

2098
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,800
(Gently)

2099
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,270
Hey.

2100
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:42,840
I'll get started on our meal downstairs.

2101
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,310
I'll get up. Thanks.

2102
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,950
(While Chan Hyeong naps,)

2103
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:50,220
(she starts making lunch.)

2104
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,360
(Getting up)

2105
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,800
- Thanks for this.
- Hey, you're awake.

2106
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,830
(Groggy)

2107
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,300
Are you okay?

2108
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,440
- I'll wash the dishes.
- The dishes?

2109
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:17,280
I haven't fried shrimps in a while.

2110
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,580
What can't Chae Eun do?

2111
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,550
No way. Those look delicious.

2112
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,020
(Chan Hyeong helps.)

2113
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:30,520
Chan Hyeong, I thought those weren't real.

2114
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,490
How can you slice them so nicely?

2115
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:34,630
I wanted a gold star from you.

2116
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,260
- Really?
- They both fish...

2117
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,000
- for compliments.
- That really surprised me.

2118
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,800
I should immediately have one of these.

2119
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:43,170
Chae Eun loves carrots.

2120
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,670
- Aren't carrots tasty?
- They are.

2121
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:47,070
You taught me that.

2122
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,840
Only these have been fried twice.

2123
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,140
That looks good.

2124
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,280
- Goodness.
- Are you okay?

2125
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,750
Should I take over?

2126
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,950
(He battles the hot oil in her stead.)

2127
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,950
Squid.

2128
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,790
(Setting the food they have made)

2129
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,360
We went full-on Japanese style.

2130
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,530
You have to take a photo of this.

2131
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,470
(Lunch by Chae Eun)

2132
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:14,630
(Perilla oil makguksu
and assorted fritters)

2133
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:17,200
Deep-fried shrimp by Chae Eun.

2134
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,770
(Crunchy)

2135
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:22,310
- Is it good?
- It's delicious. Try one.

2136
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:26,180
- They turned out nicely.
- Right?

2137
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,550
- This is insane.
- I know.

2138
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,020
(Next, they have the makguksu.)

2139
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,320
I haven't had perilla oil makguksu before.

2140
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,490
- Really?
- Yes.

2141
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,860
There's a place you need to go
to have perilla oil makguksu.

2142
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,960
They really enjoy their food.

2143
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,370
There's no way I'm leaving this behind.

2144
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:51,870
(Ending with a dessert)

2145
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:53,440
(Staring)

2146
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,240
Do you wear contacts?

2147
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,240
- No.
- No, right?

2148
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,740
These are how my eyes are.

2149
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:00,180
- I'm fascinated.
- How so?

2150
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,250
Your eyes are so clear.

2151
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:05,080
You have clear eyes as well.

2152
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,320
(Adorable)

2153
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:08,690
This proves we've spent
a lot of time together now.

2154
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,790
Look at us talking
about the color of our eyes.

2155
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:15,330
(Cleaning up thoroughly)

2156
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:16,500
Should I vacuum the place?

2157
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,440
- Time to brush our teeth.
- Time to brush our teeth.

2158
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,540
Wait. Oh, I see.

2159
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:29,240
- I thought you were doing it alone.
- No way.

2160
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,880
Did you enjoy the socks? How were they?

2161
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,180
These were so soft and fluffy.

2162
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,380
I'm not giving you one though.

2163
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,820
- Does she have to return them?
- Are you going to wear them yourself?

2164
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,150
I'll be cherishing them.

2165
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:41,620
- Really?
- Yes.

2166
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,360
Hand them over if you're not going
to look at them every day.

2167
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,060
Give me the mug
if you're not going to use it every day.

2168
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,690
We should've worn this too.

2169
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,560
- Try it on.
- We should have.

2170
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,100
It's a matching outfit.

2171
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:54,430
It reminds me of taekwondo.

2172
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:56,270
If only we could take...

2173
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:58,000
- a 30-minute nap like this.
- I know, right?

2174
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,310
I have a better idea.

2175
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:01,640
- Let's take selfies with this on.
- I'm in.

2176
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,640
Yes, what a good idea.

2177
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:09,050
(The two record their time together
with photos.)

2178
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:11,620
- We had fun here, didn't we?
- Yes, totally.

2179
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,690
I never imagined we'd visit this place.

2180
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,190
I haven't been to an aquarium in ages.

2181
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,460
Same here.

2182
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,900
That guy is huge.

2183
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,070
The ocean is an interesting place.

2184
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,100
(Doctor fish)

2185
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,140
What do I do?

2186
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,940
I've been getting flaky skin
on my hands lately.

2187
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,540
The doctor fish is treating the doctor.

2188
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:39,110
(Chae Eun, who can't resist her curiosity,
joins him.)

2189
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,980
I must not have flaky skin.

2190
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:42,720
Here they come.

2191
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,650
- Stay still.
- It feels weird.

2192
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:48,350
It feels really weird.

2193
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,590
- What's that?
- We'll start moving slowly.

2194
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:55,190
The small fish are mackerel.

2195
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:56,930
- Mackerel?
- You can see what's below?

2196
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:57,960
It's mackerel.

2197
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,170
- A shark is passing by.
- That's a shark.

2198
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:03,170
(A ray)

2199
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:08,340
What kind of fish is this?

2200
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,380
- It's a sand eel.
- Sand eel.

2201
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,410
Shall we throw it in?

2202
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,380
(Splatter)

2203
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,750
- The shark ate it.
- Did it?

2204
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,950
It did.

2205
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,450
(Amazed)

2206
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,120
I'll throw it there too.

2207
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:23,090
- I want to try it.
- Go ahead.

2208
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,620
They're a gourmand couple.

2209
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:31,630
(Capturing a day just for the two of them
in photos.)

2210
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,770
- We must take many photos.
- Right?

2211
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,700
Our heights are... Hold on.
Let me slide down a little.

2212
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,870
(They even take
the compulsory instant photos.)

2213
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,170
A different pose.

2214
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,640
(A cheek heart)

2215
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,940
The two suit each other.

2216
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,110
How cute.

2217
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,380
- Just watching them makes us happy.
- True.

2218
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:51,250
In a way, they are a stable couple...

2219
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,720
- in the Pairing House.
- Yes.

2220
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,720
I agree.

2221
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,520
- They've found peace.
- Yes.

2222
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,620
They even had breakfast the next morning.

2223
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,690
Other couples didn't have such a moment.

2224
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:00,690
- Yes.
- Exactly.

2225
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,560
This home date was
like getting a confirmation stamp.

2226
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,760
- Right?
- Yes.

2227
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,830
I doubt there will be an unexpected event.

2228
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:08,630
- I hope there isn't one.
- Please.

2229
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,500
Where are we going?

2230
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,010
To the amusement park.

2231
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,780
- Today?
- Yes. We're going to Everland.

2232
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:18,010
- Everland?
- Yes.

2233
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,710
- Really? Right now?
- Yes.

2234
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,550
- Didn't you want to wear a headband?
- I did.

2235
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,720
(During the first contract relationship)

2236
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,920
I like the vibe.

2237
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:28,320
- I get it.
- You know,

2238
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,420
wearing a headband with a school uniform.

2239
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,260
(Well received.)

2240
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:35,860
It's been years
since I last went to Everland.

2241
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:37,300
Let's go.

2242
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,630
How exciting.

2243
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,070
(Off they go to make Je Yeon's dream
come true.)

2244
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:43,040
(Glancing)

2245
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,770
Why are you so cute-looking?

2246
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,510
You're far from elegant.

2247
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,110
- Far from what?
- Elegant.

2248
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,320
- No, you don't have to check.
- What?

2249
01:41:58,420 --> 01:41:59,490
Stop looking at it.

2250
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:01,750
Looking cute isn't what I'm after.

2251
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:03,960
(Glaring)

2252
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,020
But you look cute.

2253
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,330
You're the cute one.

2254
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:10,660
Yesterday,
I told my friends that you were cute.

2255
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,130
But I'm not the cute type.

2256
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,700
You've got the wrong idea.

2257
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,070
To begin with, my looks are far from cute.

2258
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,970
That's why I like such a guy.

2259
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,370
A guy who's only cute to me.

2260
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,880
They're like a real couple now.

2261
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,250
I've never been to Pangyo before.

2262
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,990
Do you want to visit Pangyo?

2263
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,350
Pangyo has piqued my interest.

2264
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:36,420
My friend lives in Pangyo.

2265
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,790
- She lives in Pangyo?
- Yes, she's married.

2266
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:40,090
They're an office couple.

2267
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,890
- An office couple?
- Yes.

2268
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:43,930
An office couple sounds nice
if you're married.

2269
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:45,760
I know, right? I thought so too.

2270
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,370
No, it's better to meet someone
outside the company.

2271
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:51,040
- Is it?
- Yes.

2272
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:53,440
You should date someone
who works at Samsung Electronics.

2273
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,270
- Samsung Electronics?
- Yes.

2274
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:57,980
(Thinking)

2275
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,240
Ji Won?

2276
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,680
Gosh. Are you going to date a woman?

2277
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,650
No. Ji Won is already taken.

2278
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,690
(Laughing)

2279
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,260
We'll ride the merry-go-round right away.

2280
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,360
- What else?
- "What else?"

2281
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,660
Are there many rides you can go on?

2282
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,530
I can ride most of them.

2283
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:20,500
I'm good at riding rides.

2284
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,570
- Are you?
- Yes.

2285
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,240
Let's get churros.

2286
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:26,710
- You want to get churros?
- Yes.

2287
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:27,910
- Great idea.
- Right?

2288
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:32,340
(Playing around)

2289
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,820
The sun is setting.

2290
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:43,890
It's pretty.

2291
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,130
Was the amusement park you had in mind...

2292
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:49,360
for the evening or the daytime?

2293
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,460
The evening.

2294
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:51,630
- Nice.
- Yes.

2295
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,430
- It's much prettier in the evening.
- Exactly.

2296
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,130
- The lights turn on.
- Right?

2297
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:56,870
Yes.

2298
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,140
We're actually going there
on our last date.

2299
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:02,510
I didn't think we'd go.

2300
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,610
- The amusement park?
- Yes.

2301
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:05,880
- It's the finale.
- It really is the finale.

2302
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,950
It's already so pretty.

2303
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,520
It's an actual castle.

2304
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,690
- Coming here was the right choice.
- I'm on cloud nine right now.

2305
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:22,960
- We...
- Yes?

2306
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,900
came here for you,
but I'm enjoying it more.

2307
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,240
- How cute.
- It's beautiful.

2308
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,440
(The fairytale-like scenery
welcomes the two.)

2309
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,510
I love it.

2310
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:37,280
It's really pretty.

2311
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,980
Let's take lots of photos here.

2312
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,010
Okay.

2313
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:44,220
This is a real finale.

2314
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,320
Je Yeon has loosened up completely.

2315
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,790
- Try this one on.
- Try it on?

2316
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,920
(The obedient type)

2317
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,490
Does this look okay?

2318
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,730
(Satisfied)

2319
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,630
- It looks good on you.
- Will I be able to wear it around?

2320
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:57,960
But it looks good on you.

2321
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,100
A sheep.

2322
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,300
- So it's a sheep.
- I'm a sheep.

2323
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,600
This one is a fox.

2324
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,440
A fennec fox. Try this one on.

2325
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,240
It's too big.

2326
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:09,740
Do you want the smaller one?

2327
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,680
Yes.

2328
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,750
There's a rabbit here.

2329
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:18,020
This one is for you.

2330
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:21,620
- But it's a cat.
- It suits you perfectly.

2331
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:22,720
- Look at me. Try it on.
- What?

2332
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:28,230
- It looks great on you.
- But why are the ears not the same?

2333
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:29,960
I'm taking it.

2334
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:32,130
Why do the two look so nice together?

2335
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:35,000
Sheep Ji Min and Cat Je Yeon.

2336
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:36,370
Cute.

2337
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:39,070
I'm not going to ride the Ferris Wheel.

2338
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,240
- Ride it with me.
- No, I won't.

2339
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:42,910
- You should.
- I won't ride it.

2340
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:44,140
You have to ride it with me.

2341
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:46,410
- With that, renew everything.
- What?

2342
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:48,210
- Renew it.
- Should I?

2343
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,620
Je Yeon won't ride the Ferris Wheel
because he rode it with Soo Ah.

2344
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:53,250
Je Yeon is adorable.

2345
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,320
(A cuteness alert)

2346
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,090
Get up. Take a look.

2347
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:00,130
- What's that?
- It's beautiful.

2348
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,360
Has this place been here all along?

2349
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:02,730
It would've been such a shame
if we had missed this.

2350
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,730
It's so pretty.

2351
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,330
Why am I so nervous? No, excited?

2352
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,470
The color keeps changing.

2353
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,000
Was this always here?
I've never seen it before.

2354
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,740
- It's so pretty.
- It looks like a fairytale village.

2355
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,370
It's really pretty here.

2356
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,180
The trees are absolutely...

2357
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:21,510
This is what you call a winter paradise.

2358
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,950
- Stay still.
- Me?

2359
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:25,980
Look at me.

2360
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:27,550
Nice.

2361
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:31,360
I bet the photos will turn out great.

2362
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,990
- All good?
- Yes.

2363
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,690
It's turning out nicely.

2364
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,860
All set.

2365
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:39,630
Let's go.

2366
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:41,330
How about we take one together?

2367
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:42,330
- Together?
- Yes.

2368
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:43,370
- Over there?
- Yes.

2369
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,040
They look really nice together.

2370
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:52,140
- Je Yeon is feeling shy.
- Thank you.

2371
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,210
Thank you.

2372
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,110
Show me.

2373
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,150
- Wait.
- The headbands.

2374
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,550
The headbands stand out too much.

2375
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:03,620
Right? Mine too.

2376
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:04,760
(Sticking out)

2377
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:05,790
- Pretty.
- Right?

2378
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:10,360
So that's how they look at
each other's eyes now.

2379
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,060
- I know.
- Let's do another heart.

2380
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,640
(Look at the camera lens.)

2381
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,510
Let's do another pose you want to do.

2382
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:25,740
My gosh.

2383
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,610
(Look at the camera lens.)

2384
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:29,980
(Capturing their finale in a photo)

2385
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,150
- How cute.
- Right?

2386
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,220
They look cute.

2387
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:35,120
Out of all the places I've been on dates
on this show,

2388
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,760
including the ones in Florence,
this is my favorite.

2389
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,790
- This place?
- Yes.

2390
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:39,790
Me too.

2391
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:42,660
One cup of churros
and two chocolate lattes, please.

2392
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,330
This is fun.

2393
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,770
- Which side will you drink from?
- What?

2394
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:52,170
I'll take the other side.

2395
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:53,940
- You only get one chance to decide.
- This side.

2396
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,070
This side?

2397
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:00,350
(Helping Ji Min have one first)

2398
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:01,550
Je Yeon is...

2399
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:05,980
(Amazed)

2400
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,090
It's good.

2401
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,160
- It's good.
- It's really good.

2402
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:16,760
People must have gathered
to watch the parade.

2403
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,160
- Personally,
- Yes?

2404
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,170
I want to watch it with my back
to the merry-go-round.

2405
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:22,270
Okay.

2406
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,240
How pretty.

2407
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:32,680
(The two quietly look
at the merry-go-round.)

2408
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,150
(From Florence to Seoul)

2409
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,590
That's true.

2410
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,790
Right?

2411
01:48:41,790 --> 01:48:43,190
(From Florence to Seoul)

2412
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,360
Why do you have that
when it comes to the merry-go-round?

2413
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,990
Like a romantic idea or a dream.

2414
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:51,960
First off, the lights and such are pretty.

2415
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:53,830
- Right.
- It's eye-catching.

2416
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,300
When I rode it as a kid,

2417
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,840
my mom and dad took lots of photos of me.

2418
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,470
It reminds me of that moment.

2419
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:02,170
How romantic.

2420
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:07,910
The merry-go-round...

2421
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:10,280
- was also in Italy.
- Yes.

2422
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,850
So it's more...

2423
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,220
(Nodding)

2424
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,190
- The two suit each other.
- They look nice together.

2425
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:18,160
I agree.

2426
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,190
Yes.

2427
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,630
It was love at first sight.

2428
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:29,900
She looked feminine...

2429
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:31,500
and really soft-hearted.

2430
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,900
My MBTI?

2431
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:35,540
All of a sudden?

2432
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:37,540
- It was too sudden.
- Right?

2433
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:38,910
I was instinctively curious...

2434
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:40,950
about this person.

2435
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,080
I prefer being attracted...

2436
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,680
to the person right then and there.

2437
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:47,990
It was a great relief.

2438
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:53,020
- People used to busk here?
- Yes.

2439
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,990
This place came up when I searched
for merry-go-rounds in Florence.

2440
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,460
This seemed like the only place.

2441
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,730
(Their first date in Florence)

2442
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:06,670
(And 3 weeks after that)

2443
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,070
I wonder how it feels.

2444
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:12,280
(The two are before
the merry-go-round again.)

2445
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,580
The two are adorable.

2446
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:14,750
(The two are before
the merry-go-round again.)

2447
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:15,980
Nice.

2448
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,780
The growling.

2449
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,120
Do the contract relationship with me.

2450
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:22,750
Yes, that day.

2451
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:26,560
Thank you.

2452
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,990
- Isn't it freezing cold?
- Yes, it is.

2453
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,030
- Let's get something delicious.
- Okay.

2454
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,770
(Their hearts drew closer...)

2455
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:38,970
(to each other slowly.)

2456
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,480
(Even the smallest things
made them upset.)

2457
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:46,910
(And the smallest things made them happy.)

2458
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,580
(With all the moments shared,)

2459
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:52,750
(being together feels natural now.)

2460
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,690
The two are like a real couple.

2461
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,720
That's cute.

2462
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,360
Both of them look really happy.

2463
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,430
(What kind of days...)

2464
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:11,300
(lie ahead for the two of them?)

2465
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,250
The music fits perfectly.

2466
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,950
Some music was playing,

2467
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:27,490
and our eyes met by coincidence.

2468
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:31,520
When we looked at each other...

2469
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,660
for about five seconds.

2470
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:38,030
We couldn't take our eyes off each other.

2471
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:41,330
It was just impossible.

2472
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,240
It gave me...

2473
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,810
butterflies.

2474
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:50,940
(That heart fluttering moment)

2475
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:52,040
That moment.

2476
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:56,510
(Impressed)

2477
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,080
Come here.

2478
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,150
(He grabs her.)

2479
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:44,830
They look good together.

2480
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:51,070
Just watching them
makes our hearts flutter.

2481
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:57,080
Je Yeon looks extremely happy.

2482
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,490
It's like a painting.

2483
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:16,790
(In awe)

2484
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,460
- Can you see me?
- What?

2485
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,830
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

2486
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:25,840
- It's so pretty.
- I know, right?

2487
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:29,640
- It's beautiful.
- It's really pretty.

2488
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,610
It's snowing.

2489
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,080
It really is snowing.

2490
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:35,610
This is awesome.

2491
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,680
This will be unforgettable.

2492
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:41,790
He was bummed out that...

2493
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:44,460
we couldn't enjoy the snow together.

2494
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:47,160
It was snowing so beautifully back then,

2495
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:50,560
which made it even more special.

2496
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,030
It was blissful for me.

2497
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,340
(Their time together was like a dream.)

2498
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,710
- Oh, gosh.
- It's over.

2499
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,710
- That was intense.
- Really.

2500
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:12,380
Ji Min was disappointed that
they couldn't see the snow together.

2501
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:15,120
But to think it'd snow
at the end of the day.

2502
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:17,020
I shall congratulate Ji Je Yeon.

2503
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,060
Nice.

2504
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:20,690
Out of all of Je Yeon's dates,

2505
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,690
I think today's was the best.

2506
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:24,530
- Even including the skating rink date,
- That's right.

2507
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:25,530
today was the best.

2508
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,470
- I agree.
- Right?

2509
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,500
And such a moment exists.

2510
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,300
When you look into
the other person's eyes,

2511
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,570
you can see their real self
inside their eyes.

2512
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:37,080
Like that feeling you're connected
to that person.

2513
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,380
- Yes.
- So...

2514
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,140
from that moment on,
I watched them like it was a movie.

2515
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,850
You get a chance...

2516
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:44,620
if you persist like Ji Min.

2517
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,620
- Yes.
- Right?

2518
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:46,780
It's like...

2519
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:48,950
my love for humanity is back...

2520
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:51,060
now that these two are a thing.

2521
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:54,890
I feel like all the love in this world
will come true.

2522
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,330
Ji Je Yeon...

2523
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:59,300
gave off real couple vibes today.

2524
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,630
Day one?

2525
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:01,670
- Day 1?
- Day 1?

2526
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:02,800
Is it day one starting today?

2527
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,940
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

2528
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,040
Here.

2529
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:06,840
(Ji Min's gift)

2530
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,340
(Curious)

2531
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,640
Two rings are connected.

2532
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,940
It's really pretty.

2533
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,810
You know I love my rings.

2534
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:17,480
- It's beautiful.
- A necklace with two rings connected.

2535
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,820
I'm glad you like it.

2536
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,290
- Thank you.
- Sure.

2537
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:23,720
Let's go.

2538
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:30,360
(The day of the final decision)

2539
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,860
(Our last story)

2540
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:36,530
(Unforgettable dazzling winter)

2541
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:39,540
(A confession to the one...)

2542
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,370
(who made my heart race)

2543
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:45,540
(How do you feel?)

2544
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:50,950
(After going through many feelings
and contemplations,)

2545
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:55,250
(I will find the courage today.)

2546
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,990
(From the moment
I first saw you until now,)

2547
01:55:58,290 --> 01:56:02,430
(the words I've kept shouting)

2548
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:06,300
(A heartbreakingly beautiful...)

2549
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,830
(confession over 25 nights)

2550
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:12,100
(A final chance that may...)

2551
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:14,940
(never come again in a lifetime)

2552
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:17,340
(Will we be paired?)

2553
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,380
I was able to feel that you kept...

2554
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,280
- Hello?
- watching me.

2555
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:23,410
It filled me with gratitude and happiness.

2556
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:25,820
Because of you, my heart fluttered,

2557
01:56:25,850 --> 01:56:27,150
and I had fun.

2558
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:30,460
Getting to know you...

2559
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
feels like the greatest blessing
in my life.

2560
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,330
Thank you, and I mean it.

2561
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,490
Get here quickly.
