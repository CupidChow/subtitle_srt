1
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,040
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,440
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,470
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,410
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,410
Heart Pairing starts today.

6
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,640
(Heart Pairing is ready to go.)

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,420
Last week,
Heart Pairing's episode in Italy...

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,790
- came to an end.
- Yes.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,550
On their last day in Italy,

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,120
four couples had a special date.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,430
It lingered so much on my mind.

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,860
- Right.
- Even after I went home,

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,960
each couple's date lingered.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,800
- So many people around me asked.
- Right.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,370
There were couples whose relationships
were calm but boosted dopamine,

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,240
while some people dashed straight.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
Ha Neul's flirting attacks impressed me.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,410
- She made everyone lose their minds.
- I know.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,850
The feeling lingered for a long time.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,520
I had to hold my head until I got home.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,580
(That's understandable.)

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,420
I was truly shocked.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,790
Ha Neul shocked me.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,690
What I liked watching Ha Neul...

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,490
- was that you need to flirt clearly.
- That's true.

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,730
- Your expression should be clear.
- Rather than confusing people.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,030
she showed her feelings clearly,
and I liked that.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,230
I guess I wanted...

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,260
people to recognize...

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,000
that Woo Jae and Je Yeon were flirting...

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
when they watched their date.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,240
Their expressions were calm,

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,010
but they showed their feelings clearly.

34
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,810
And it moved me so much.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
We went like this
when we were watching them.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,310
- We went, "Oh, my!"
- Right.

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,150
For me, my favorite cast...

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,450
is Chan Hyeong.

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,620
Personally,

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,790
I like him. Anyway,

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,690
we saw the date of Chan Hyeong
and Chae Eun, the catfish woman.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,090
I loved their date.

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,730
(They kept smiling
even on their first date.)

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,630
We saw Chan Hyeong's smile
like a baby for the first time.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,460
- A baby's smile.
- Such an innocent smile.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,730
It was the first time
we saw his smile like a baby.

47
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,400
Their date was very impressive.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
What do you think?

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,110
She showed her charms
unexpectedly and by coincidence...

50
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,770
starting with the socks.

51
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,980
The smile he showed on those occasions...

52
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,380
- was his real smile.
- Right.

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,850
He came back with a bit of a heavy heart,

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,250
and Ha Neul was a totally changed person.

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,990
He looked a bit hurt, to be honest.

56
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,520
I remember his shaking eyes.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,790
Since then, I've had a serious headache.

58
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,530
I had a headache until the next day.

59
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,660
I've never seen that look of Chan Hyeong.

60
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,930
- His eyes were shaking.
- That's true.

61
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,530
And the most fun...

62
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,030
and nice couple for us...

63
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,740
were Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,000
It was like a movie.

65
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,210
It really was like a movie.

66
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,410
This was what moved me.

67
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,410
After Ji Won came to Italy,

68
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,250
she faced flustering situations,

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,820
and then she looked comfortable again.

70
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
- That's why.
- That's why I liked the date.

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,850
And I loved it
that Chang Hwan was her date.

72
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,690
- Right.
- I like the way...

73
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,020
Chang Hwan speaks.

74
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,730
- Right.
- It's nice.

75
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,760
From this week, Heart Pairing in Seoul...

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,800
starts in earnest.

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
And today, at last...

78
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,030
they will find out
about their occupations and age.

79
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,570
I wonder
if their fluttering feelings in Italy...

80
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,640
would continue in Seoul, too.

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,240
Let's watch it together.

82
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,310
How can I talk about this experience?

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,450
Since I didn't know her age or last name,

84
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,180
it felt like we got close faster...

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,420
and we could reveal
our true selves even more.

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,860
If I knew his age first,

87
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,660
I would have maintained my reserve.

88
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,190
You can eat it all, right?

89
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,930
- Do you think I'm a glutton?
- No.

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,530
We got close
only based on our personalities.

91
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,100
I felt I got younger.

92
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,710
It felt like I became my true self.

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,680
I only wondered what she was thinking.

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,250
It was fun to get to know each other
walking on a narrow street.

95
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,580
It felt like a dream.

96
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,020
Why are you laughing?

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,590
I knew I had to go back,

98
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,590
so it felt like a dream even more.

99
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,730
(Leaving the dream-like place,)

100
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,280
(they came back
to their works and daily lives...)

101
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,780
(and spent two busy days.)

102
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,430
(And now, in Seoul for 20 days,)

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,310
(they start pairing in earnest.)

104
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,020
(Someone heads somewhere.)

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,330
(Looking around)

106
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,460
(A strange place, not the Pairing House)

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,200
He's here to meet someone.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,170
(Looking closely)

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,940
(Come to this place and you can meet
your book pairing partner.)

110
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,870
The one paired to him by the book.

111
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,910
That's Ji Won.

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,240
Whenever I watched "About Time,"

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,610
the table tennis scene made me cry.

114
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,350
Whether we can be best friends
throughout our lives...

115
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,050
(They had many things in common
when they talked.)

116
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,150
Ji Won looks so comfortable.

117
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,550
Look at their eyes.

118
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,060
(Is the person
Chang Hwan is waiting for...)

119
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,230
(the one who wrote the green book?)

120
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,360
The green book.

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,690
(The one who wrote the green book?)

122
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,700
(Did she...)

123
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,570
(select me as well?)

124
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,140
The book pairing couples will meet.

125
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,840
I guess two of them
will make a rough guess.

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,140
They talked about each other before.

127
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,410
- Yes.
- Right.

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,810
(Meanwhile)

129
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,250
Chang Hwan is nice.

130
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,650
He's cool.

131
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,090
(The one who wrote the green Pairing Book
comes closer to Chang Hwan.)

132
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,390
Oh, my. Here she comes.

133
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,190
(The one who wrote the green Pairing Book
comes closer to Chang Hwan.)

134
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,330
(Nervous)

135
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,000
(Chang Hwan's book pairing partner)

136
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,200
It's Ji Won!

137
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,870
She's beautiful.

138
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,440
(Smiling)

139
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,670
(Exclaiming)

140
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,580
- He must be nervous.
- Hello.

141
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
It's you again.

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
In a row.

143
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
(Smiling broadly)

144
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,250
All right.

145
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,650
Have a seat.

146
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,750
How long has it been?

147
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,960
- It's been 2 days.
- It's 2 days after they came back.

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,660
Seeing you again in Korea...

149
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,730
- feels different.
- Right.

150
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,800
(Glancing)

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
It kind of feels...

152
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,770
like we're on a blind date.

153
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,710
First,

154
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,840
- it's cold, so let's have something warm.
- Sure.

155
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,250
I think...

156
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,280
I'll have an Americano.

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,020
He grinned just now.

158
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,350
(Why is he grinning?)

159
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,020
If you glance at someone
who's looking at something,

160
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,620
- that means you're interested.
- Right.

161
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,490
If you're not interested,
you'd only look at the menu.

162
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,160
Thank you.

163
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,330
Thank you.

164
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,040
She looks beautiful.

165
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,470
(Feeling awkward)

166
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,710
- I spoke to you casually before.
- That's right.

167
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,140
It's been a long time since we met, so...

168
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,410
- We're in a different place too.
- We met in a new place.

169
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,450
- By the way, you look very different now.
- Now?

170
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,350
Do I?

171
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,090
- Somehow...
- Oh, my.

172
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,220
I feel I became calm.

173
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,060
That's right.

174
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,560
They look into each other's eyes so much.

175
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,660
That means they like each other.
Am I rIght, Ji Seon?

176
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,170
My goodness. Look at them.

177
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,540
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won
picked each other's book.)

178
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,370
- I've read this so many times.
- Really?

179
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,240
This is what I loved.

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,750
- The chair.
- This chair, right. Let me see.

181
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,420
They printed it just as I drew it.

182
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,390
(The chair drawn by Chang Hwan)

183
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,890
(I think someone without love
is like a chair with one short leg.)

184
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,120
It's from the song
"Umbrella" by Epik High.

185
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,030
It always lingered in my mind.

186
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,260
It felt very warm...

187
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,830
when I read what you wrote.

188
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,070
And at the same time,

189
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,370
I clearly felt someone who wrote this
was a cheerful person.

190
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,870
Some answers made me
scream into the pillow.

191
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,640
This one was funny too.

192
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
"I already have one."

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,250
I didn't expect this answer
would be included in the book.

194
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,650
It's not a grand mansion, you know.

195
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,980
(Embarrassed)

196
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,250
There's something I'm curious about
in your book, too.

197
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,420
- Really?
- Yes.

198
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,590
Why does it have to be takoyaki,

199
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,890
specifically?

200
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,330
I've moved several times,

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
and whenever I moved,

202
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,300
I always found a takoyaki place,
be it a food truck...

203
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,940
- or a shop.
- Like it's destiny.

204
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,240
- Yes.
- Like how we keep pairing up.

205
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,570
Oh, my.

206
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,780
And it's not easy to just pass by
a takoyaki place.

207
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,380
- It's hard to resist.
- So after restraining myself all along,

208
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,320
and on a day I strongly feel
that I have to reward myself,

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,890
I go home and eat it.

210
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,760
Then it tastes so good.

211
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,820
I totally understand.

212
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,390
- He keeps looking at her.
- Right.

213
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,760
How come we are so...

214
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,030
- It's amazing.
- It's really amazing.

215
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,460
It's too amazing
just to be called a coincidence.

216
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,430
While their date in Italy
felt very comfortable,

217
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,640
now their date flutters my heart so much.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,170
Right, it's the opposite.

219
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,300
- They have a bit of tension,
- Yes.

220
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,510
- especially Chang Hwan.
- Yes.

221
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,340
There were some answers
that made me very curious.

222
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,610
I see.

223
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,310
First of all, I can remember this one
without looking at the book.

224
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,820
You said...

225
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,690
that you were such a light sleeper...

226
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,520
that you preferred to sleep alone.

227
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,930
That's what you wrote here.

228
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,390
- It's because he's a pilot.
- How much are you...

229
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,430
easily awakened, I wonder.

230
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,230
He can't answer.

231
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,270
(Thinking carefully)

232
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,000
Since I have friends who are married,

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,810
I ask them.

234
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,910
Some of them were sensitive when sleeping.

235
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,880
And I asked them how they do
when they sleep with their spouses.

236
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,280
They tried, but it didn't work.

237
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,150
So one of them stays lying down
until his wife goes to sleep,

238
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,620
and when his wife falls asleep,

239
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,190
he sneaks out of the bedroom
and goes to sleep.

240
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,620
That's how the couple agreed.

241
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,960
So I thought that was pretty reasonable.

242
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,690
It's not like saying, "See you tomorrow."

243
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,860
That's too cold-hearted.

244
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,960
So in that way...

245
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,570
However,

246
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,200
of course, I'm not saying
that I definitely need to do so.

247
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,470
It's not like I'm such a light sleeper...

248
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,140
that I can never sleep together
with someone.

249
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I'm not such a cold-hearted person.

250
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,410
That's why.

251
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,380
- I see.
- Did I explain it all right?

252
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,420
Yes.

253
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,690
Gosh, it feels hot.

254
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,550
Goodness, Chang Hwan.

255
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,360
He spoke faster as he talked.

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,030
As he spoke, he realized
that it didn't benefit him.

257
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,190
- I think he felt that.
- It didn't help him.

258
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,100
"This is wrong."

259
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,960
- "I didn't mean it."
- "Why did I start it?"

260
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,470
That's what I do.

261
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,700
When I feel something is wrong
while I'm speaking,

262
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,830
I get to speak faster.

263
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,840
(Totally understood)

264
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,340
- You like a line from "The Avengers."
- Right.

265
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,510
Then did you watch
the whole Marvel series of movies?

266
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,440
- Yes.
- I found Yun Ddan Ddan's song,

267
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,150
"The Night I Missed You"
and listened to it.

268
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,550
- I liked the lyrics.
- Aren't they nice?

269
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,050
Does a 70-dollar jjamppong
taste different?

270
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,620
I'm serious. Just tell me the taste.

271
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,390
It's enough if I can eat it sometimes
when I feel like having it.

272
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,420
I can buy it for you.

273
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,890
(They lose track of time
talking to each other.)

274
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,690
- I'd like to taste it.
- Right?

275
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,230
What's going on?

276
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,860
It definitely tastes good.

277
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,030
I also like jjamppong.

278
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,270
What you think and imagine...

279
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,470
about marriage...

280
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,940
are similar to what I do,

281
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,280
This is my life motto.

282
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,480
(Curious)

283
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,980
Simply being together.

284
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,320
Everyday life of having a meal
and laughing together without worries...

285
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,660
should never be taken for granted.

286
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,130
I know that.

287
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,730
(Wanting to care with small things)

288
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,970
- It's big for me too.
- I see.

289
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,010
(Without needing to do
something extravagant,)

290
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,810
(having a warm meal...)

291
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,740
(and ordinary things to share)

292
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,710
I feel like I'm going to support
this couple.

293
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,920
They look good together.

294
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,150
(Small but pleasant love)

295
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,760
(They look at
each other's Pairing Book once again.)

296
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,270
The household chores
she feels confident in...

297
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,100
and those she doesn't are totally
the opposite of mine.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,370
Do I have to be glad
that we're on the opposite ends?

299
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,370
At least one person has to cook.

300
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
This song is very high-pitched.

301
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,250
(The wedding song
I want to listen to on my wedding)

302
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,380
- This is...
- That's why...

303
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,720
I had to explain below.

304
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,380
Are you really going to sing it?

305
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,250
Well...

306
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,290
I can lower about five keys
from the original.

307
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,490
- I definitely need to lower the key.
- It won't be easy.

308
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,800
They look good together.

309
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,530
It's important to be attracted
by the Pairing Book.

310
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,870
That's right.

311
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,210
Exchanging Pairing Books...

312
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,740
is a good way to speed things up...

313
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
because it takes a lot of time
to find out about those things.

314
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,680
Right. However,

315
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,110
the tension between them
even made me nervous.

316
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,980
I think Chang Hwan
was more attracted to Ji Won.

317
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,250
Chang Hwan's feelings
were more intense and visible.

318
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,690
Ji Won liked Chang Hwan too,

319
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,790
but she tried to figure him out carefully.

320
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,260
- Still, she liked him.
- Yes.

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,530
Chang Hwan almost fell in love
the moment Ji Won entered.

322
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,330
It looked like
he fell in love with her once again.

323
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,330
(The moment the door opened
and Ji Won entered,)

324
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,330
(Chang Hwan exclaimed.)

325
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,800
I guess he felt more glad
to see her in Seoul.

326
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,040
What are Ji Won's feelings?

327
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,570
She has enough good feelings for him,

328
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,910
but she hasn't moved
to the next stage yet.

329
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,180
She will,
once their occupations are revealed.

330
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,880
(I'm getting curious.)

331
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,180
(Meanwhile, in a different place)

332
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,550
I guess Ha Neul is paired.

333
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,120
The blue one?

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
(Ha Neul is waiting for
her pairing partner.)

335
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,930
It's Chan Hyeong.

336
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,830
(Ha Neul's book pairing partner
is Chan Hyeong.)

337
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

338
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,300
You brought the book with you.

339
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,870
Did you expect this?

340
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,240
- Did you?
- I did, to some extent.

341
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,810
I wasn't confident, though.

342
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,220
It feels like we're seeing
after a long while.

343
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,960
- I know.
- It really feels like a long while.

344
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,060
Did you rest up enough?

345
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,630
I took a rest until yesterday...

346
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,160
and started to work again today.

347
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,630
(Feeling awkward)

348
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,700
(Gazing)

349
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,810
(Two of them were pretty close in Italy.)

350
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,070
(However, on the last day,)

351
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,180
- Really?
- Right.

352
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,440
(there was a change.)

353
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,980
No.

354
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,750
It's been a long while since I saw you.

355
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,020
I know.

356
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,520
(After spending time in Italy,)

357
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,990
(they see each other in Seoul.)

358
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,260
Why do I feel so embarrassed?

359
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,730
Right.

360
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,630
I know. This is...

361
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,000
It feels different to see you in Seoul.

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,570
Yes, it certainly feels different.

363
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
But when you read the book,

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,470
can you guess what he does?

365
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,510
Yes.

366
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,410
I'm not 100 percent sure,

367
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,450
but I thought I could guess.

368
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,050
And when we were talking back then...

369
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,820
Right. Actually,

370
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,220
it happened that we had a lot of chances
to be together.

371
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
- Right.
- So we got to talk a lot.

372
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,490
Only on the last day,

373
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,560
- whether our choice...
- Right.

374
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,360
went that way
or we made a different choice,

375
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm not sure about that.

376
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,170
Did you like it?

377
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,240
To be honest, back then,

378
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,810
when we finished our dates,

379
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,210
- we met in the room upstairs.
- Right.

380
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,850
I didn't know what to do.

381
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,920
- You avoided meeting my eyes.
- It's because...

382
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,880
I didn't know what to do
in that situation.

383
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,590
I thought, "What should I do?"

384
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,260
But you two went up first.

385
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
Goodness.

386
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,720
Well, that was...

387
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,760
There was no other place to be
by ourselves.

388
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,800
But why did you have to be by yourselves?

389
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
What?

390
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,630
Gosh.

391
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,440
That made me a little upset.

392
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
It did?

393
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,070
I didn't know you were upset.

394
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,140
Maybe it was because you were so excited.

395
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,380
- Well...
- I mean...

396
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,640
You didn't even make eye contact with me.

397
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,510
I thought I was being the same
all the time.

398
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,350
- Is that so?
- Yes.

399
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
- But actually...
- Yes?

400
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,430
You went out with him,

401
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,460
and it seemed like you two
had a really great time together.

402
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
He's straightforward.

403
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,270
So I didn't know
how to talk to you about it.

404
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,000
- You were like...
- I see. What?

405
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,700
"It was amazing."

406
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,340
So...

407
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,980
So I thought, "What can be so amazing?"

408
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,680
"It was that amazing? What's going on?"

409
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,550
That's what I thought. So...

410
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,180
I couldn't talk to you about it.

411
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,050
I couldn't ask you about it, and I just...

412
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,290
- "I see."
- I can see that he was upset.

413
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,590
- I was...
- You really didn't see my eyes.

414
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,660
I couldn't...

415
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,720
- I couldn't see your eyes.
- Why?

416
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,860
- Why?
- You know.

417
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
Have you ever been
in a situation like that?

418
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,760
So that's what happened.

419
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,900
(Feeling awkward)

420
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,470
(Flustered)

421
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,310
(Glancing)

422
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,940
It felt different from the Florence
I've been before.

423
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,810
The atmosphere was different.

424
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,180
(Sighing)

425
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,850
(She feels sorry for no reason.)

426
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,220
(Embarrassed)

427
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,090
He's telling her about the things
that made him feel uncomfortable that day.

428
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,130
He's so straightforward.

429
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,330
So he's not the type who becomes sullen.

430
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,330
- Right.
- No.

431
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,160
- So I...
- Yes?

432
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,230
Oh, here.

433
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,270
I listened to this playlist.

434
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,670
- Oh, you did?
- Yes.

435
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,700
I see.

436
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,340
The last one here. "All I do" by Roy Kim.

437
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
- I really liked this song.
- Right.

438
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,580
- It's so nice.
- I even listened to it after coming back.

439
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,680
- Really?
- Actually, I've been listening to it.

440
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,250
Gosh, I can't predict
what will happen to them.

441
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,420
Oh, right.

442
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,390
I kind of knew
who was going to be here today.

443
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,520
Right. So I got my heart ready.

444
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,430
- Because I knew you'd be here.
- I see.

445
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,890
I guess I gave you some hints.

446
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,930
- Right.
- On purpose.

447
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,460
"I'm the one who eats two eggs."

448
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,360
Let's talk about it together then.

449
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,930
(Breaking an egg)

450
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,930
(Glancing)

451
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,940
I...

452
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,810
(My daily routine on weekdays:
I take vitamins and have two eggs.)

453
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,910
(I start the morning in my car
with exciting music.)

454
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,970
(Looking carefully)

455
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,640
(On the second day at the Pairing House,)

456
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,980
(Chan Hyeong had two eggs
in front of everyone.)

457
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,910
"Two eggs."

458
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,020
When I heard the sound, I thought,

459
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,050
"So it was you, Chan Hyeong?"

460
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,890
We would have been in trouble
if you had done that.

461
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,390
But I think I was the only one
who noticed it.

462
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,120
Right. Maybe I showed off a little
for you to find my book.

463
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,690
I think you really did.

464
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,100
And I thought this person was someone...

465
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,800
who worked so hard for his job.

466
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,330
Someone who works hard is cool.

467
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,900
I see.

468
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,600
So today is the day.

469
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,740
I know.

470
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,010
(I know. Seriously.)

471
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,040
Seriously.

472
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,540
- Meeting in Seoul...
- Seeing you in Korea...

473
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,840
- feels different, right?
- Yes. Right.

474
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,310
- Does it feel different?
- Yes.

475
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,510
- It's different?
- Yes. It feels different.

476
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,750
What's different then?

477
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,650
I think...

478
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,020
- you seem more manly here.
- Really?

479
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,560
- That's what it feels like.
- Is that so?

480
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
- Yes.
- I see.

481
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,830
I think...

482
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,230
I can start our days
here in Korea comfortably.

483
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,200
- You think so?
- Yes.

484
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,140
(Are the two...)

485
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,070
(still paired?)

486
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,980
- This is so cool.
- My goodness.

487
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,180
(I know that too.)

488
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,890
Luckily... I guess it's because
I've been taking medicine.

489
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,560
- Right.
- My throat is getting better.

490
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,390
Why did you catch a cold?

491
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,430
You must feel sick.

492
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,130
You should drink something like tea a lot.

493
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,490
- I should drink some.
- Yes.

494
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,760
Did you go to the hospital?

495
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,930
- I didn't go to the hospital.
- I see.

496
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,630
But you should go see a doctor.

497
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,040
It must be tough.

498
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,270
(It must be tough.)

499
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,440
- This is nice.
- It's prettier at night.

500
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
- Right?
- Yes.

501
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,310
I'll be reminded of this
if I ever come back here again.

502
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,610
The place that we walked together.

503
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,120
After coming here,
I feel happy so many times.

504
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,190
- Yes. Every day.
- Right?

505
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,720
It's a new experience,

506
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,260
and it's not something
I'll just forget about it.

507
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Right.

508
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,030
I can't let this slide.
Let's go see a doctor tomorrow.

509
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,030
Baby, let's go see a doctor tomorrow.

510
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,800
Thank you.

511
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
(Staring)

512
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,550
(Touching)

513
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,210
(Looking)

514
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,180
(Smiling)

515
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,480
You look really nice.

516
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,490
- Really?
- Yes.

517
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,520
I see.

518
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,190
(I hope you were always the same.)

519
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,930
(There wasn't a time I wasn't.)

520
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,760
I thought I was being the same
all the time.

521
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,100
(Staring)

522
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,900
Which is it? Is it a hair with bang
or hair pulled back?

523
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,370
- I guess it's half and half?
- Half and half?

524
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,840
Somewhere in between.

525
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,940
But it looks good on you.

526
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,010
- Do you think this is better?
- Yes.

527
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,480
- Really?
- It looks good on you.

528
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,780
I can change every day.

529
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,650
Yes, that's right.

530
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,790
(Yes, that's right.)

531
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,460
Everyone would be thinking,
"Why aren't they coming?"

532
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,390
Gosh, I have no idea.

533
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,630
(Smacking her lips)

534
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,830
- Ha Neul seems to have a lot of thoughts.
- Seriously.

535
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,700
I think she's thinking...

536
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,370
Chan Hyeong isn't that bad
after meeting him in Seoul.

537
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,440
- But you know what?
- Maybe that's why she didn't answer it.

538
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,270
This is because
we've all seen her genuine expression.

539
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,400
Is that so?

540
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,010
She knows that he's a nice guy.

541
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,610
But there's someone
who she's more drawn to.

542
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,180
- Her head and heart aren't in sync.
- Right.

543
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,150
Anyone can see that
Chan Hyeong is a nice guy.

544
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,550
- Right.
- Even if it takes longer,

545
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,850
she needs to be sure about her feelings.

546
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,890
I think she couldn't express her feelings
just to keep him around her...

547
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,190
- because she wasn't sure about it.
- Right.

548
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,760
She could've hesitated because of that.

549
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,890
She doesn't want him,

550
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,390
but she doesn't want others to take him?
That's not the case, right?

551
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,960
- Well, he is...
- That's not it, right?

552
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,030
- He's so nice just to give away.
- That's not the case.

553
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,030
Let me have him.

554
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,200
(If you're going to give him away,
give him to me.)

555
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,230
I like him.

556
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,170
(Come here.)

557
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,940
This is what Iike about Ha Neul.
She's crystal clear.

558
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,740
- She doesn't have a poker face.
- You're right.

559
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,770
She can't fool others.

560
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,980
And I think Chan Hyeong also felt that.

561
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,350
Think about the time when they had
their first date and how close they were.

562
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,980
We could all see that
she felt awkward later.

563
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
I see.

564
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,950
Woo Jae was
the most unpredictable one before,

565
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,520
but now, it's Ha Neul.
She's the most unpredictable one.

566
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,990
- I can't guess...
- She must feel complicated.

567
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,560
where her heart will head to.

568
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,630
- It's the same with Chan Hyeong.
- Right.

569
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,600
I remember how he was
on the date with Chae Eun.

570
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,800
- You're not sure about him too?
- I can't wait to see what will happen.

571
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,900
So both of them may be open to others.

572
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,930
- Yes.
- Right.

573
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,940
(This isn't easy.)

574
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,300
Finally, the eight residents...

575
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,540
will gather again
at the Pairing House in Seoul.

576
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,440
The Pairing House in Seoul
will be revealed.

577
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,040
Let's watch it together.

578
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,080
(The day of moving in
to the Pairing House in Seoul)

579
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,050
If I go to work from here...
It will take about two hours?

580
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,230
- It's Seongbuk-gu.
- It's at Seongbuk-gu?

581
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,490
The house was the talk of the town too.

582
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,700
- Since "Heart Signal."
- Right.

583
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,940
I can't wait to see this.

584
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,500
Are they using both buildings?

585
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,510
(Seoul Pairing)

586
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,540
(Ji Min is the first one to arrive.)

587
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,010
(Exclaiming)

588
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,950
There are two living rooms.

589
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,250
Gosh.

590
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,320
(Exclaiming)

591
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,690
(Looking around)

592
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,560
(It makes him laugh.)

593
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,990
On the first floor...

594
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,430
(He looks around the house.)

595
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,130
(Exclaiming)

596
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,170
(Exclaiming)

597
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,670
(Laughing)

598
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,740
Unbelievable.

599
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,870
Who is it?

600
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Who is it?

601
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,720
(The second resident has arrived.)

602
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,690
(Stopping)

603
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,560
(Grinning)

604
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,130
Hello.

605
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,960
Oh, my. It's Je Yeon.

606
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,000
Hi.

607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,870
Don't look so happy!

608
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,500
I think I'm the first one here.

609
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,140
Are you alone?

610
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,770
- I guess so.
- Really?

611
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,410
- Don't you need to check out this floor?
- Where's the living room?

612
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,210
Goodness.

613
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,220
- It's really nice.
- It's so pretty.

614
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,320
Right?

615
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,380
It is nice.

616
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,520
There's a better living room, though.

617
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,660
Really?

618
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,320
I put my bags here.

619
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,630
- I'll bring them here too.
- I think we can gather here.

620
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,800
Did you come right after work?

621
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,330
Yes, I came from work.

622
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,230
- I think this is my room.
- This one?

623
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,330
Yes.

624
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,700
- I got here first,
- Yes.

625
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,370
- so I'll give you a house tour.
- Sure.

626
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,710
- He's so cute.
- Wait.

627
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,480
- You didn't see this living room, right?
- No.

628
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,010
It's also pretty nice.

629
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,110
That's such a cool place.

630
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,180
(The playroom)

631
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,680
This is so nice.

632
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,490
Should we move them here?

633
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,050
Will all of us be able to sit?

634
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,860
No, let's put our bags there for now.

635
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,260
Which do you prefer?
The right one or the left one?

636
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,360
It's got endless space.

637
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,930
- Here.
- Here?

638
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,030
Yes.

639
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,430
It's so nice.

640
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,800
(The playroom is
across the main living room.)

641
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,400
And there's one outside.

642
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,770
It's so pretty.

643
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,370
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

644
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,440
(Courtyard)

645
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,140
If we spend some time here...

646
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,310
- with all the people in one place,
- Right.

647
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,020
don't you think it'll feel lonely
to be alone after?

648
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,350
- You look like the owner of the place.
- Me?

649
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,120
Yes, because you're giving a tour
of the house.

650
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,920
I took a look around.

651
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,990
The whole thing connects.

652
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,130
What's that?

653
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,000
I think the women's room are
on the second floor.

654
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,000
If I had owned this place,

655
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,030
(They check out the 2nd floor as well.)

656
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,200
that would have been so nice.

657
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,100
This is the dining room.

658
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,270
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- It is.

659
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,840
It's gorgeous.

660
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,550
(Dining room)

661
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,850
- It's beautiful.
- This is the kitchen.

662
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,680
Should we get some water
while we're upstairs?

663
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,850
What? Okay.

664
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,890
Oh, they already filled the refrigerator.

665
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,420
Which cup do you want?
There's a glass cup and a porcelain cup.

666
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
Porcelain.

667
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,060
We've got multiple cups.

668
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,660
(Looking closely)

669
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,930
I guess that's our dinner.

670
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,740
Which way did we come in? Here?

671
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,070
Yes, we came through this door.

672
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,470
Really?

673
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,040
We can also go this way.

674
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,450
I think these are the women's rooms.

675
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,150
(Open the door
from the dining room, and...)

676
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,350
Wouldn't it be fun to play a game here?

677
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,220
There's a bridge.

678
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,260
(2nd bridge)

679
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
- This place is so nice!
- Right?

680
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,560
- We can even chat over there.
- You're right.

681
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,700
I wonder where my room is.

682
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,260
What color is your book?

683
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,530
Are we allowed to say that?

684
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,270
- It's light blue, right?
- What?

685
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,270
It's obviously light blue.

686
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,300
What makes you say that?

687
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,610
I took a guess.

688
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,010
He guessed right.

689
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,140
Are you okay with bunk beds?

690
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,410
I love them.

691
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,780
- It's so cute.
- It's pink.

692
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,040
The closet!

693
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,850
It's my dream room.

694
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,620
It's so pretty.

695
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,350
There are two bunk beds.

696
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,720
I like it.

697
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,820
This must be one of the men's rooms.

698
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,730
I think there's a men's room downstairs
and another one upstairs.

699
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,460
Doesn't my room look nice?

700
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,660
It does.

701
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,270
Your book must be brown.

702
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,500
That's about it. What do you think?

703
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,000
I loved it.

704
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,870
I gave you a special house tour.

705
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,210
Special?

706
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,580
(A special house tour)

707
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,440
- It's a beautiful house.
- Yes.

708
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,150
The air has shifted.

709
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,710
It's quite different from the houses
we've seen in the "Heart Signal" series.

710
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,980
- You're right.
- Yes.

711
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,050
I think it's the biggest house
we've seen in the series.

712
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,420
- Yes.
- It's got multiple floors too.

713
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,060
I got the feeling that they put more rooms
where they could talk in private...

714
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,930
compared to the house in Italy.

715
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,660
Before this, they kept running
into each other in the house,

716
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,660
- so they were always together.
- Right.

717
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,900
Here,

718
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,200
the ones upstairs may only talk
to the ones upstairs,

719
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,340
and they might not even run
into other participants.

720
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,740
- That's true.
- It must be easier...

721
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,010
- to talk to each other privately.
- Also,

722
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,670
when we have matched couples later,

723
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,610
they need some space
where they can be alone.

724
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,850
You're right.

725
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,150
- How come your lips are chapped?
- Due to fatigue.

726
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,620
- You didn't get enough sleep.
- No.

727
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,850
He's considerate.

728
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,090
I'll sit here.

729
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,730
(Across from her)

730
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,730
This house is beautiful.

731
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,970
- Did you eat anything?
- A little?

732
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,370
- What did you eat?
- Cake.

733
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,470
- Cake?
- I had a financier.

734
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,670
A financier?

735
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,010
Thank you.

736
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,340
He gave her a cushion.

737
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,040
Did you have anything to eat?

738
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,910
A panini.

739
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,350
I had half a panini at a cafe.

740
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,690
(Painful)

741
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,030
It must hurt. Did you apply any ointment?

742
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,230
I did.

743
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,330
When did it get chapped?

744
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,330
I'm not sure. It was probably yesterday.

745
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,400
It hurts.

746
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,510
Your lips are chapped?

747
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,970
Totally.

748
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,880
My lips get chapped when I'm tired.

749
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,250
My...

750
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,680
favorite moisturizer.

751
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,050
Favorite moisturizer?

752
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,020
Thank you.

753
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,790
(He doesn't look
past even the smallest things.)

754
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,560
(They spent time together...)

755
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,430
(only once in Italy.)

756
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,870
Hello.

757
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,970
You drove here, right?

758
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,000
How was the drive here?

759
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,440
I think it's more comfortable
now that we're in Seoul.

760
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,540
- Right? I certainly feel...
- I'm not the only one, right?

761
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,710
I also feel comfortable.

762
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,250
Right? It's a bit...

763
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,450
Maybe it's because we spent
some time together in Italy.

764
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,980
- I feel more comfortable.
- You don't feel like a stranger anymore.

765
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,650
- We lived together for one whole week.
- We did.

766
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,990
What's that? It's pretty.

767
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,560
I think it's a fireplace.

768
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
Like a fireplace by the wall.

769
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
- We should try using it.
- We should.

770
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,230
- We never got to try it in Italy.
- Right.

771
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,700
Let's experience everything we can.

772
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,440
(At that moment,
beeps come from the gate.)

773
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Someone else is coming.

774
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,410
I wonder who it is.

775
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,740
I'm done giving people a tour.

776
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,010
You only did it once, and you're done?

777
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,410
You got special treatment.

778
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,110
It's Woo Jae.

779
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,620
Is he here?

780
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,550
(Smiling)

781
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,620
What is it?

782
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,350
He smiled as soon as we made eye contact.

783
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,660
I don't see him, though.

784
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,760
He's here.

785
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,760
She's waiting.

786
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,560
(The third resident is Woo Jae.)

787
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,800
(Tucking her hair behind)

788
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,930
- She tucked her hair!
- Oh, no!

789
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,540
Come on, Je Yeon.

790
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,040
She's so transparent.

791
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,040
(There's silence in the room
as soon as Woo Jae arrives.)

792
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

793
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,650
- It's been so long.
- Hi.

794
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,550
- It's been a while.
- It's been so long.

795
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,650
Take a look around the house.

796
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,590
- The house first?
- What's your color?

797
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,460
- The color of your book.
- My book?

798
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,660
It's brown.

799
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
They're all there.
The brown book is there.

800
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,600
I'll be back.

801
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,800
Why are you laughing?

802
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,530
Because he said it was brown.

803
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,300
- Why? It could be brown.
- But your book is brown.

804
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,100
- It's not. It might be yellow.
- It's not?

805
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,640
So, you two got the same room.
You're roommates.

806
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,380
We are.

807
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,610
(Pondering)

808
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,990
(Je Yeon and Woo Jae got closer
on the last day in Italy.)

809
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,090
(If Woo Jae's book is yellow,)

810
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,230
(that means they're roommates
since Ji Min's book is brown.)

811
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,430
(Worried)

812
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,940
(Is Woo Jae's book really yellow?)

813
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,010
Did everyone think...

814
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,810
that Chang Hwan's book was yellow?

815
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,580
(Teasing him is pretty fun.)

816
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,180
There's only one room here.

817
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,780
- There's one upstairs.
- Is there?

818
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,320
What was it like coming here first?

819
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,090
- When I was the first one to arrive?
- Yes.

820
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,030
Wasn't it nice to look around the house
by yourself?

821
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,200
I rushed to this place, actually.

822
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,200
I had to wrap up
what I was doing at work early...

823
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,800
to get here on time.

824
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,270
Did you have to wait long?

825
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,040
No, for about ten minutes.

826
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,640
Ten minutes?

827
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,510
I would have felt comfortable,
even with you around.

828
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,510
I would have taken my time.

829
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,220
Is your room on the 1st floor
or the 2nd floor?

830
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Mine's on the second floor.

831
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,650
- Did you move your bags there?
- Yes.

832
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,460
Wasn't his book pretty obvious?

833
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,030
- Where should I sit?
- It was a dark color.

834
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,660
- Yes, it was the most obvious.
- Right?

835
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,900
- It was pretty clear.
- It was.

836
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,470
(He sits between them.)

837
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,800
(What?)

838
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
He sat between them?

839
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,340
- Woo Jae has changed.
- He just...

840
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,040
- Right.
- It was clear.

841
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,820
It's nice to see you after a long time.

842
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,620
- I missed you too.
- I was bored in the last two days.

843
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,660
Have you looked around the whole house?

844
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,930
- I have.
- Have you?

845
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,530
- I have.
- It's like a maze.

846
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,430
Did you leave your coat upstairs?

847
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,470
No, my room is over here.

848
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,440
- Is it?
- Yes.

849
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,270
This is getting pretty hard.

850
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,040
When did you guys arrive?

851
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,740
- I arrived a moment ago.
- A moment ago?

852
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,210
- He was the first one.
- I got here first.

853
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,050
You're tired, aren't you?
Did you come from work?

854
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,180
I did.

855
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,190
Did you get a haircut?

856
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,460
I trimmed it a bit.

857
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,690
You got a haircut?

858
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,930
Yes, I got one during the break.

859
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,060
I also got a haircut.

860
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,630
Doesn't it show?

861
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,870
- It does.
- It's gotten neater.

862
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,440
I got my haircut yesterday on a whim.

863
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,410
- It looks nice.
- It does.

864
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,940
It suits you. It looks lighter.

865
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,180
Did you eat?

866
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,850
She had a small financier.

867
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,720
I also had a small panini.

868
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,530
Did you get a good rest?

869
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,430
- Yes.
- Did you?

870
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,760
She looks much better.

871
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,970
Do I?

872
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,840
Yes.

873
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,000
- Her lips are chapped due to fatigue.
- Right.

874
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,910
My lips are slightly chapped.

875
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,710
- Is it from jet lag?
- Yes.

876
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,410
(Gazing)

877
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,620
(Staring)

878
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,850
(Frustrated)

879
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,050
I kept tossing and turning.

880
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,320
Right. It's jet lag.

881
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,430
Did you look around the rooms?
Do you like them?

882
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,490
I do.

883
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,200
The men's room upstairs is
connected to the women's room.

884
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,600
It was right next to it.

885
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,040
- They were really close.
- Yes.

886
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,140
I think there's a men's room downstairs
and another one upstairs.

887
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,980
Won't the men and women upstairs
get too friendly?

888
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,280
You're right. The rooms are really close.

889
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,110
Feel free to come downstairs
if you're bored.

890
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,380
You're right.

891
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,220
- They were really close.
- Yes.

892
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,020
Is there a chance
it may get a bit inconvenient?

893
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,630
Well,

894
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,100
it might.

895
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,030
I won't get in your way.

896
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll walk around, dead silent.

897
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,310
- You won't even realize that I'm there.
- Is that right?

898
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,010
Come to think of it,

899
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,480
the three of us were in the room
on the first day.

900
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,810
We were.

901
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,550
(On the first day
at the Pairing House in Italy)

902
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,850
Woo Jae was between them
on that day as well.

903
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,260
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

904
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,930
- I'm not sure.
- We'll find out today.

905
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,600
- There's blue-green and blue in my room.
- Blue-green and blue.

906
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,170
You don't know what color my book is,
right?

907
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,140
I know exactly what it is.

908
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,710
How?

909
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,180
But you made it clear
that your book was green on the last day.

910
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,410
I wanted to be cautious.

911
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,910
People kept creating confusion,

912
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,150
so I decided to stop jumping
to conclusions.

913
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,120
(Smiling)

914
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,190
- So, your book is blue now?
- No comment.

915
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,960
- "No comment?"
- Yes.

916
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,360
I feel like three weeks will fly by.

917
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,130
- I felt it as soon as I entered.
- Right.

918
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,100
The last week went by so fast.

919
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,770
How did you feel before this?

920
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,380
Could you not wait to come here?

921
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,450
Or were you excited...

922
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,650
How should I describe this feeling?

923
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,590
I was already sad that it was ending,
even before I came here.

924
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,960
Oh, no.

925
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,860
Do you know what that's like?

926
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,700
Maybe it was that,

927
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,130
but I felt slightly lonely.

928
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,710
(He blurted it out without realizing.)

929
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,980
(Staring)

930
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,410
I'm not sure why, but I felt lonely.

931
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,480
(It feels like I now have someone...)

932
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:15,760
(that I can't control my feelings for.)

933
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,010
(Peeking)

934
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,250
- Guess.
- Who it is?

935
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,520
Yes. Guess.

936
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,820
- Ji Won.
- Nice.

937
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,520
- Is it?
- No.

938
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,220
Ha Neul.

939
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,760
(Running away)

940
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,290
- Was it no one?
- Chae Eun came in.

941
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,930
- Is it Chae Eun?
- I was going to surprise her,

942
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,430
but I'm still awkward with her.

943
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

944
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

945
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,740
I was going to come in with you,
but I came back as I felt awkward.

946
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,870
Oh, okay.

947
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,580
- Take a seat.
- Okay. Thanks.

948
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,280
I don't think I've ever been to a place
like this while I was in Seoul.

949
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,580
- Here?
- Yes.

950
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,720
Let's head in.

951
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,990
- They came together.
- They came together.

952
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,630
How did you arrive at the same time?

953
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,200
- We met on the way here.
- Was it the same route?

954
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,030
- Why are they keeping it a secret?
- What's going on?

955
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,040
We looked around the rooms
as soon as we got here.

956
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,240
- Did you?
- Yes.

957
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,570
Your book will be in your room.

958
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,140
Do you want to look around?

959
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,140
- We'll go and take a look.
- Can we?

960
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,390
It's so large!

961
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,260
Goodness.

962
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,290
It's gorgeous!

963
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,760
I wish I could take these home.

964
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,000
There's a massage chair.

965
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,470
Oh, my. I'm using that every day.

966
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,740
I'll be on that all day.

967
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,570
You and I will be competitors.

968
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,040
That's adorable.

969
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,310
I wanted this kind of dog as a pet.

970
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,450
Oh, right.

971
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,780
The interior design is so...

972
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,550
Doesn't this look like the Colosseum?

973
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,360
- Did you two enter together?
- Yes.

974
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,590
Yes, they arrived together.

975
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,820
- Why?
- I don't know.

976
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,860
- What's going on between them?
- They said they met on the way here.

977
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,430
Are they the couple that owns this place?

978
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,970
- They're the hosts.
- They're the hosts?

979
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,510
(And...)

980
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,510
(the final residents)

981
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,720
You're such a good driver.

982
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,120
- Did I drive well?
- Yes, you're very good.

983
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,220
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul also arrived.)

984
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,960
- Welcome.
- Are we the last ones here?

985
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,290
This place is so nice.

986
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,590
Welcome to our house.

987
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,030
- No way!
- What's with that tree?

988
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,400
His voice really stands out, doesn't it?

989
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,970
- Right?
- Yes.

990
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,500
- It was obviously Chan Hyeong's voice.
- Yes.

991
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,700
I bet he's a professional emcee
or a voice actor.

992
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,840
We're in here.

993
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,710
Hi.

994
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,380
Have you all looked around the house?

995
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,980
- We have.
- We had our tour.

996
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,020
This place is just as incredible.

997
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,250
Have you been well?

998
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,990
Yes.

999
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,320
Why don't we catch up over dinner?

1000
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

1001
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,290
The dining room's upstairs.
Allow me to escort you...

1002
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,430
- since I was the first one here.
- This must be your place.

1003
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,190
- Give us a tour.
- Let's head upstairs.

1004
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,400
Give us a tour.

1005
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,600
(Their first dinner
at the Seoul Pairing House)

1006
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,830
That looks good.

1007
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,870
No way.

1008
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,970
This is amazing.

1009
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,240
- I'll give you some.
- Thanks.

1010
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,810
- Nice.
- This is good.

1011
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,380
- I think that's salmon.
- It looks like salmon.

1012
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Right.

1013
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,480
I see.

1014
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,710
I'll give you a big piece.

1015
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,880
(Taking a bite)

1016
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,720
Did you perhaps shave?

1017
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,160
Before coming here, I...

1018
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,090
- Did you shave closely?
- Yes, closely.

1019
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,990
So that's what women focus on.

1020
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,760
There was something different about him.

1021
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,600
He noticed their interest in him.

1022
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,900
Did you eat what we bought that day?

1023
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,840
- The truffle and...
- Sure.

1024
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,710
- I ate them as soon as I got back.
- Really?

1025
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,740
(The last day in Italy,
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun's date)

1026
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,850
(The two stopped by a grocery store.)

1027
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,520
This is very special.

1028
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,350
I haven't had it like this before.

1029
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,090
(I haven't had it like this before.)

1030
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,460
It's good.

1031
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,990
- This isn't bad.
- I should get one too.

1032
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:46,730
(What they both bought
after tasting it in Italy)

1033
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,800
I had it with a cracker.

1034
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,730
- Really?
- It was so good.

1035
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,130
- Was it?
- You have no idea.

1036
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,870
Did you have yours? I bet you didn't.

1037
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,440
I haven't been able to.
It's still in its wrapped state.

1038
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,610
I figured as much.

1039
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,610
They're alike.

1040
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,140
I wonder what this is.

1041
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,750
(A suspicious object on the dining table)

1042
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,220
- It's a fork.
- Really?

1043
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,720
- Yes, it's for us to use.
- Seriously?

1044
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Yes.

1045
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,690
- I thought it was there for style.
- Do you use these at home?

1046
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,660
- Unbelievable.
- I've had it as a fork before.

1047
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,690
Really?

1048
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,330
- Why...
- She knows everything and anything...

1049
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,690
- You eat fruit with it.
- when it comes to food.

1050
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,200
She's experienced it all.

1051
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,160
Have you had this before?

1052
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,570
- What's that?
- This...

1053
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,040
is liquor you can only buy in Italy.

1054
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
It's stronger than you think.

1055
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,310
- Is it?
- The alcohol percentage is 26.

1056
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,770
Do you know what artichokes are?

1057
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,080
Yes, I do. I know what they are.

1058
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,480
They're grown in northern Italy.

1059
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,080
(Her knowledge matches that of an expert.)

1060
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,880
She's tried almost everything.

1061
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,390
- Is this for fruits?
- And rice cakes.

1062
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,590
Even rice cakes?

1063
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,560
(Startled)

1064
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,190
I see. I had no idea.

1065
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,660
You seem like the lady of the house.

1066
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,300
I know.

1067
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,900
Let's enjoy the food.

1068
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
(Nodding)

1069
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,540
- Je Yeon, were you able to rest up?
- Yes.

1070
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,470
- Did you take the whole day off?
- I did.

1071
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,540
- She stayed in bed like a cadaver.
- Really?

1072
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,940
- Doesn't she seem to be glowing?
- Tell me about it.

1073
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,810
(Glancing)

1074
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,080
- Were you able to rest well?
- Not at all.

1075
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,420
- Did you have to work?
- I couldn't catch a break.

1076
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,920
I had to work up until today
with all that had to be done.

1077
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,450
Signing off on things?

1078
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,160
- Is that not the case?
- That's for another time.

1079
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,530
I'm curious to know who's who.

1080
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,300
Hurry up and eat.

1081
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,870
Finish your dinner.

1082
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,700
What color are you?

1083
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,170
Who were you asking?

1084
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,710
- I bet you're not curious.
- Me?

1085
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,780
You asked what color...

1086
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,040
while cutting your shrimp.

1087
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,250
I couldn't tell who he was asking.

1088
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,480
Were you asking the shrimp?

1089
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,820
Did my desperation show?

1090
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,820
- It did.
- You wanted to move it along.

1091
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,450
We could tell that you weren't interested.

1092
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,490
(Embarrassed)

1093
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,990
My gosh.

1094
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,530
Since he brought it up,

1095
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,730
here's me.

1096
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm Mr. Blue. Blue is my identity.

1097
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I see.

1098
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Goodness.

1099
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Close to cobalt, right?

1100
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,240
Blue can be of different shades.

1101
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,440
That's right.

1102
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,870
Anyway, I'm Mr. Blue.

1103
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,680
I doubt anyone knew,
but I'm Mr. Blue-green.

1104
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,580
Mr. Blue-green.

1105
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,080
Yes. What?

1106
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
(Goodness)

1107
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,750
(He accidentally revealed his identity.)

1108
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,320
Mr. Blue-green.

1109
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,190
As if we didn't know.

1110
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,800
- It's blue-green.
- Is that water?

1111
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,860
This...

1112
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,900
That's a good drawing.

1113
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,130
It's air.

1114
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,570
This is an abstract rendering of air.

1115
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,500
I wanted to know who could draw this well.

1116
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,870
I'm Mr. Brown.

1117
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,780
Why didn't you say it in Korean?

1118
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,050
Right, brown. I'm Mr. Brown.

1119
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,950
The drawing is of a hand.

1120
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,250
I want a partner who I can rely on...

1121
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,350
that can be my equal.

1122
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,460
- That's cool.
- That was the meaning behind it.

1123
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,090
I see.

1124
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,330
The book I chose was white.

1125
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,660
Right.

1126
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,200
(Chan Hyeong chose
Ha Neul's white Pairing Book.)

1127
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,170
Ms. White must've chosen Mr. Blue.

1128
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,570
- That's right.
- You two chose one another.

1129
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,310
Like this.

1130
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,410
(Ha Neul and Chan Hyeong
chose one another.)

1131
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,750
I'm Ms. White,

1132
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,680
and a sunflower is on the cover.

1133
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,780
It means I desire a love
like a sunflower's.

1134
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,590
What had me hooked was the part...

1135
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,490
- about your superpower.
- Of course.

1136
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,760
"I have the ability..."

1137
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,930
"to change one's flaw
into one's strength."

1138
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,630
This alone told me that she was someone...

1139
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,560
- with strong self-esteem.
- That's right.

1140
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,830
How many people
can actually say that this...

1141
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,500
- is their superpower?
- It's admirable.

1142
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,400
That's what had me hooked.

1143
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,570
She wasn't kidding about that.

1144
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,740
Really?

1145
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,780
- Right.
- I agree.

1146
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,850
- Sure.
- Of course.

1147
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,250
- Exactly.
- That's true.

1148
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,220
I also chose Ms. White.

1149
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,450
What on earth?

1150
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,520
It was for a similar reason.

1151
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,360
I could tell that this was someone
with a positive outlook on life.

1152
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,170
- I could feel her confidence.
- Right.

1153
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,130
- That's why I chose this book.
- Goodness.

1154
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,840
(Since their time in Italy,)

1155
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,370
(they haven't been able to talk.)

1156
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,140
(Gazing)

1157
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,450
Well... Right.

1158
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,410
I... Well...

1159
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,980
(I... Well...)

1160
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,390
I chose this book because...

1161
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,750
It wasn't an easy choice.

1162
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:44,530
What she had written
had the most positive energy to it.

1163
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,160
- I see.
- Right.

1164
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,660
That's why I chose her book.

1165
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,930
Thank you so much.

1166
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,770
I...

1167
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,940
I'm Ms. Green.

1168
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,320
(Ji Won is Ms. Green.)

1169
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,550
You were confident...

1170
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,020
about me being Ms. Light Blue.

1171
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,460
Yes, Woo Jae said that.

1172
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,160
You were confident...

1173
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,600
about me being Ms. Light Blue.

1174
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,230
Right.

1175
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,670
(Embarrassed)

1176
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,370
I laughed really hard to myself.

1177
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,640
My gosh.

1178
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,940
(Woo Jae confused Ji Won's book
with Je Yeon's book.)

1179
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,140
She laughed hard to herself.

1180
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,250
Je Yeon's calm, isn't she?

1181
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,510
I'm Ms. Green,

1182
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,380
and the drawing on the cover...

1183
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,450
is of a fish-shaped bun.

1184
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,950
I drew this...

1185
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,460
because while I love
sharing special moments with a loved one,

1186
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,900
I believe you're meant
to marry the person...

1187
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,100
with whom you can share
everyday moments in life...

1188
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,500
that may bring small joys
but are constant.

1189
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,270
The fish-shaped bun symbolizes that.

1190
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,610
Everyone did a great job
on their drawings.

1191
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,740
- Are you sure you're not an artist?
- Tell me about it.

1192
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,480
Mine's shabby compared to yours.

1193
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,610
It's a fish-shaped bun.

1194
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,710
- The drawing...
- Seriously?

1195
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,880
Fish-shaped buns are adorable.

1196
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,980
- Why am I so fond of Chang Hwan?
- I'm fond of him too.

1197
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,090
- Really?
- So he says.

1198
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,890
I chose the fish-shaped bun.

1199
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,030
It's adorable.

1200
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,030
The reason may sound simple.

1201
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,470
- To me, this drawing...
- With red beans.

1202
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,930
had the most warmth.

1203
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:35,570
- I see.
- It reminded me of how we pick up...

1204
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,170
little things on the way home.

1205
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,180
I got the same feeling
from what she wrote as well.

1206
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,710
Also, check this out.
See how much she wrote.

1207
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,220
- He's showing off.
- She provided a lengthy answer.

1208
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,150
I saw this...

1209
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,890
as something positive.

1210
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,390
It showed that she was detail-oriented...

1211
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,460
and that she wanted to be nice.

1212
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,330
That's what I got from what she wrote.

1213
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,530
I chose her book...

1214
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,330
thinking that she might be someone
who is a lot like me,

1215
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,700
and I guess I wasn't wrong.

1216
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,540
I chose Mr. Yellow...

1217
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,540
because we each wrote down the same movie.

1218
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,570
- What was it?
- Which movie?

1219
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,580
- "About Time."
- I see.

1220
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,680
Since it's my all-time favorite movie,

1221
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,020
his answer left an impression.

1222
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,980
- Out of all the movies out there...
- Right.

1223
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,820
"About Time" may be a masterpiece,

1224
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,290
- but he could've chosen any other movie.
- Of course.

1225
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,430
It aligned with the concept
of him being someone...

1226
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,430
I can enjoy
the little things in life with.

1227
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,400
I figured he was someone
who was a lot like me...

1228
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,700
which is why I chose this book.

1229
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm Ms. Light Blue.

1230
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,110
On the cover is the Giving Tree.

1231
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,950
I drew it...

1232
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:55,880
because it embodies what I see as love.

1233
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,220
Meanwhile, I chose Mr. Blue-green.

1234
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,490
It seemed to me...

1235
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,430
like his view on love and marriage
mirrored mine the most.

1236
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,360
Of course. She chose Woo Jae.

1237
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,730
That has me curious. What did you write?

1238
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,640
What is marriage to you?

1239
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,340
What is love?

1240
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,740
That's actually what my drawing is about.

1241
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,380
Like I said, this is air,

1242
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,810
and here's my view on love.

1243
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,480
I believe the world...

1244
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,620
can't exist without love.

1245
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,350
He's feeling sour.

1246
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,860
- This is the worst meal for Ji Min.
- Tell me about it.

1247
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,090
(Of course this is bugging him.)

1248
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,260
His worst meal.

1249
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,490
Didn't the two of you...

1250
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,860
enjoy a date in Italy?

1251
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,630
Yes.

1252
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,400
I had the two of them completely mixed up.

1253
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,440
- Exactly. But you were so sure.
- You see...

1254
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,710
I guess...

1255
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,770
one shouldn't have too much information.

1256
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,340
- You're right.
- That's true.

1257
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,710
I had the whole book memorized.

1258
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,180
You came to a logical conclusion.

1259
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,780
- Their personalities...
- My logic was wrong.

1260
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,050
My logic was way off.

1261
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,390
(Woo Jae found out
that Ji Won is Ms. Green.)

1262
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,790
- It's good.
- Right?

1263
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,030
- Je Yeon, your answers...
- Everything else is good too.

1264
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
were concise.

1265
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,300
She gave short answers.

1266
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,930
To be honest,

1267
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,230
I found that to be fresh.

1268
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,370
Your answers were concise
compared to the others'.

1269
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,110
That has me curious.
Can we read them later?

1270
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,440
- Let's read them later.
- Sure.

1271
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,610
After reading your books...

1272
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,580
and seeing how detailed your answers were,

1273
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,950
I worried...

1274
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,150
about my answers being too short.

1275
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,290
- I chose my words carefully.
- I thought that was your personality.

1276
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,860
- It seemed boisterous.
- Yes, exactly.

1277
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,630
To the point that I thought...

1278
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,960
How should I put this?

1279
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,630
I thought you'd be bold and expressive
in person,

1280
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,470
but I was shocked to see
how soft and fragile you were.

1281
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,540
Exactly. I can't say
you seem like your book.

1282
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,010
- Really?
- I agree.

1283
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,980
Oh, no.

1284
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,280
(Fiddling)

1285
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,750
Why are you reading your answers again?

1286
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,390
- Are there any regrets?
- Gosh, no.

1287
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,030
This is what I thought.

1288
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,990
I figured that whoever she was...

1289
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,460
only said what needed to be said.

1290
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,200
There was something refreshing about it.

1291
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,240
- Is that how you are?
- That's who I am.

1292
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,670
Didn't anyone choose the brown book?

1293
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,140
I should go back to eating.

1294
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,390
He's adorable.

1295
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,760
Do you want a second chance
at the answers?

1296
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,020
(Do you want a second chance
at the answers?)

1297
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,530
I'm satisfied with what I wrote.

1298
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,100
Too much information is in these books.

1299
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,700
I heard you loud and clear.

1300
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,300
(Glancing)

1301
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,740
Still, things are less awkward...

1302
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,710
- thanks to our recent vacation.
- Right.

1303
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,050
I'm Ms. Light Green.

1304
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,650
The drawing is of two people...

1305
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,720
walking down the street together.

1306
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,620
I felt uneasy for a second
having all your eyes on me.

1307
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,590
I chose Mr. Yellow.

1308
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,030
The others were serious,

1309
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,660
but Mr. Yellow made me laugh.

1310
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,130
He put jjajangmyeon down
as his comfort food...

1311
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,500
but added that it had
to be a large portion.

1312
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,140
That made me laugh.

1313
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,540
I felt as though...

1314
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,610
he was someone
who wanted to make people laugh.

1315
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,410
I thought...

1316
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,710
it'd be nice to spend some time with him.

1317
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,580
Did you know who you were choosing?

1318
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,890
At first,

1319
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,290
I thought Chan Hyeong was Mr. Yellow.

1320
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,420
- Me?
- Yes.

1321
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,260
- I also thought that was you.
- Really?

1322
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,300
They found me intimidating at first.

1323
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,960
- What?
- I looked scary to them.

1324
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,300
(Chang Hwan's intense first impression)

1325
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,830
I totally admit that.

1326
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,040
It came to me during my second day.

1327
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,010
When we were talking in the Sunset Room,

1328
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,210
I noticed her humor...

1329
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,610
and it made me think
that we could be alike.

1330
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,480
It suddenly hit me.

1331
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,850
You walked in together...

1332
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,750
because you chose each other's books.

1333
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,860
- Right.
- I see.

1334
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,530
Were you all aware of it?

1335
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,630
- It just hit me.
- I didn't know either.

1336
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,460
- You didn't know either, right?
- I didn't know.

1337
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,370
We walked in by ourselves
because no one chose our books.

1338
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,040
I was the first to walk in
because no one had chosen me.

1339
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,510
- So that's how it is.
- I finally get what you're like.

1340
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,240
Who chose Mr. Brown?

1341
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,810
- He's adorable.
- Who has the brown book?

1342
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,680
This show can be brutal.

1343
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,820
(Their Pairing Books
have now been revealed.)

1344
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,520
Are there more plates?

1345
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,890
There were more.

1346
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,630
- I already started the cycle.
- But...

1347
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,760
- Leave it for the second batch.
- We can wash these by hand.

1348
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,160
I'll leave them like this.

1349
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,330
- I think we can leave the glasses.
- The glasses...

1350
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,730
- We'll probably...
- Are you sure?

1351
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,570
be taking those with us.

1352
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,210
- It's good.
- Is it?

1353
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,680
It's too big though.

1354
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,640
- That's why I love it.
- Really?

1355
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,550
(Like Woo Jae, she also tries one.)

1356
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,160
- I should read what I wrote again.
- Why?

1357
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,830
To remind me of what I wrote.

1358
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,000
- Same here. I don't remember it all.
- By doing so...

1359
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,200
I can't believe I wrote this.

1360
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,740
My winning rate in rock-paper-scissors.

1361
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:54,140
Is there something
we can wipe the table with?

1362
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,680
Is there a dishcloth?

1363
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,650
- Can we wipe it with that?
- Here.

1364
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,890
Rock-paper-scissors.

1365
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,590
Rock-paper-scissors.

1366
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,760
(They begin a game
of rock-paper-scissors.)

1367
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,030
I'm bad at this.

1368
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,770
Let me do that.

1369
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,170
This.

1370
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,340
I'd like to keep it.

1371
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,910
Isn't there a wastebasket?

1372
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,010
- I know.
- Is there one?

1373
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,340
- We made one out of that plastic bag.
- I see.

1374
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,380
- It's warm.
- Isn't it warm?

1375
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,950
Do we light it as is?

1376
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,520
Is that allowed?

1377
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,050
Can we light this?

1378
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,290
You want to light it right now?

1379
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,820
- I'm scared to do it.
- I think it'll be nice.

1380
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,690
Let's light it, then.
It'll definitely set the mood.

1381
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,090
In there?

1382
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:49,960
We'll see the flames from here.

1383
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,940
It's done.

1384
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,040
- My gosh.
- You startled me more.

1385
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,810
- Goodness.
- You startled me.

1386
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,910
- My gosh.
- That really startled me.

1387
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,080
I almost jumped out of my own skin.

1388
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,450
My gosh.

1389
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,680
That caught me off guard.

1390
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,350
- I was really startled.
- Who was cold a moment ago?

1391
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,120
- Right.
- She said that she was cold a moment ago.

1392
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,090
- I'm okay.
- Thank you.

1393
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,430
You seem colder than me. You can take it.

1394
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,030
Since it's big, you can share it.

1395
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,030
- Let's share it.
- Put your arms around each other.

1396
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,060
I'm fine.

1397
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,300
- Is this a scarf?
- What's this?

1398
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,670
- Is it from this place?
- You can cover yourself with it.

1399
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,170
Here's another one.

1400
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,010
You can share this too.

1401
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,110
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1402
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,810
- Would you like this one?
- This one is thicker.

1403
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,150
- What's that?
- Ji Min turned it on.

1404
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,780
It's an actual fire.

1405
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,020
- It's real.
- You can space out while staring at it.

1406
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,320
- Is that so?
- It will be warm.

1407
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,660
It will look pretty with the lights off.

1408
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,460
- Shall I turn them off?
- What?

1409
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,630
What?

1410
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,300
- What? Nothing.
- She seems happy all of a sudden.

1411
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,330
(An error in communication)

1412
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,600
She's so cute.

1413
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,910
This is very nice.

1414
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,010
Here comes what we've been waiting for.

1415
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,880
- Right.
- Yes.

1416
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,120
We don't know everything.

1417
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,020
We only know a fraction of each other.

1418
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
Things were good up to now.

1419
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,860
(Their time in Italy was like a dream.)

1420
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,900
I had a feeling that he could be...

1421
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,700
living in a different world from mine.

1422
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,300
So I got more curious...

1423
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,970
about the world that he's living in.

1424
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,270
- A tax accountant?
- Does it suit me?

1425
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,310
A little.

1426
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,440
I liked math in school,
but that's not my field.

1427
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,010
(And one person who seems familiar)

1428
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,550
Stereotypes are bound to form.

1429
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,750
When I hear about the person's age
or occupation,

1430
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,490
I can't help but imagine...

1431
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,920
what kind of life he led.

1432
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,560
Do you think it'll be fun back in Korea?

1433
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Or does anything worry you?

1434
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,730
Things will be revealed.

1435
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,930
(Ji Won is afraid of feeling biased
unlike now.)

1436
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,890
I hoped that
he wouldn't be younger than me.

1437
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,760
Otherwise, he'd seem so childlike.

1438
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,230
- Keep it for yourself.
- No, it's okay.

1439
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,900
To be honest,

1440
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:11,440
I don't really mind the age gap
in a relationship.

1441
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,310
I'm okay with the age gap.

1442
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,380
When I say that his pupils are important,

1443
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,450
they say, "She's so strange.
Why does she care about his pupils?"

1444
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,450
(Chae Eun is looking at something
in the person's pupils.)

1445
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,550
"Unemployed?"

1446
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,620
Being with someone
unemployed is difficult.

1447
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,020
It's okay as long as
he has the desire to find a job.

1448
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,790
If not, it's impossible for me.

1449
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,990
I'll move it.

1450
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,430
Are you using this?

1451
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,090
(Ha Neul wants someone with desires.)

1452
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,930
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1453
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,170
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1454
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,570
Yes, I was curious...

1455
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,570
about many things including
her family background and her ideal type.

1456
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,170
Who wants to go first?

1457
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,610
I believe that...

1458
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,880
one's occupation represents
her values and her past.

1459
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,620
Age and occupation are important,

1460
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,450
but those are
additional information for me.

1461
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,720
A lot of times,
I want to live in a world...

1462
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,830
where those things aren't important.

1463
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,790
I know that...

1464
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,360
they aren't everything about a person.

1465
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,170
On the other hand,
they play an important part.

1466
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,730
They can't be ignored...

1467
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,370
because that's life.

1468
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,240
If I need to make myself more attractive,

1469
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,180
there will be more things...

1470
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:25,080
to show in Korea than now.

1471
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,710
We're going back to our home ground.

1472
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,120
- Here comes what we've been waiting for.
- Right.

1473
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,590
I can't wait to see their reaction.

1474
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,290
In what order should we go?

1475
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,930
How about someone starts...

1476
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,130
and that person picks the next person?

1477
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,260
That's a good idea.

1478
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,730
- That's good.
- Am I the only one who thinks...

1479
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,130
that Chan Hyeong is at ease?

1480
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,870
He's swirling wine in his glass.

1481
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,540
"Do you guys know who I am?"

1482
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,910
"Look forward to it."

1483
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,440
That person picks the next person?

1484
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,510
That's a good idea.

1485
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,780
- That's a good idea.
- How should we decide who starts?

1486
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,620
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1487
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,950
(The first person is Ha Neul.)

1488
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,250
- You're selected.
- Ha Neul will go first.

1489
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,730
(What kind of person is Ha Neul?)

1490
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,600
My name is...

1491
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,430
- This is so fascinating.
- We don't know either.

1492
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,570
This is fascinating.

1493
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,170
It's Joo Ha Neul.

1494
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,000
- Joo? Is that your last name?
- Yes.

1495
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,970
- That's pretty.
- That's pretty.

1496
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,970
She looks different
now that we know her last name.

1497
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,210
- It feels different with the last name.
- Right?

1498
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,010
- Joo Ha Neul?
- I knew it.

1499
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,810
It's Joo Ha Neul.

1500
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,480
And my occupation is...

1501
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,490
- No one guessed correctly.
- Seriously.

1502
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,160
- A golf player.
- A golf player?

1503
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,930
You usually go on blind dates...

1504
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,260
with people in the same field.

1505
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,100
I don't want to meet people
in the same field as mine.

1506
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,730
(Ha Neul's occupation was
impossible to guess.)

1507
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,040
If...

1508
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,670
I bring up my studies,

1509
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,510
you'll know my occupation right away.

1510
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,010
So I can't talk about it.

1511
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,540
That's true.

1512
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,680
My occupation is...

1513
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,350
a dancer.

1514
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:11,990
- Look at their faces.
- I'm a dancer and a model.

1515
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,820
A dancer?

1516
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,090
They're surprised.

1517
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,700
What type of dance?

1518
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,200
I majored in Korean traditional dance.

1519
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,530
Korean traditional dance?

1520
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,030
Even though
she has western facial features...

1521
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,170
- That suits you so well.
- Really?

1522
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,780
I majored in dance.

1523
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,380
That's why I couldn't talk
about my school days.

1524
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,050
- You've been dancing since then?
- Yes, from arts high school...

1525
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,150
I studied dance
at Korea National Sport University.

1526
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,790
- She's an elite.
- I also got a master's degree...

1527
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,220
from Korea National Sport University.

1528
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,420
That's so fascinating.

1529
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,930
I joined a dance company
since I was in college.

1530
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,160
I'm a professional dancer.

1531
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,300
It's called
Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation.

1532
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,500
I was a dancer
in the affiliated dance company.

1533
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,740
I performed during
my professors' performances.

1534
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,280
Actually,
I started ballet when I was young.

1535
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,740
Then I took a break.

1536
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,110
I couldn't let go of my dream...

1537
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,310
to be a dancer.

1538
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,120
It was very hard for me.

1539
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,450
- Then my parents recommended it.
- She looks pretty.

1540
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,390
I arrived at school early in the morning
when the lights were out.

1541
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,690
I turned on the lights
in the dance studio.

1542
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:29,360
I was the last one to leave school.

1543
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,430
I practiced very hard.

1544
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,970
(Korean Dancer Joo Ha Neul,
"Flower of the Moment")

1545
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,870
(Dance was everything
in Joo Ha Neul's life.)

1546
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,870
I worked really hard.

1547
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:44,180
Originally,
my dream was becoming a professor.

1548
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,580
I plan to keep working hard to achieve it.

1549
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,780
Right now, I have a minor injury,

1550
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,220
so I'm taking a break.

1551
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,320
I'm also working as a model
at the same time.

1552
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,090
Are you a particular type of model?

1553
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,790
Or are you a model in general?

1554
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,960
I'm a model in cosmetics.

1555
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,730
- I get cast...
- A commercial model?

1556
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,670
- as a commercial model.
- A cosmetics model?

1557
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,570
I'm also a cosmetics model.

1558
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,770
That's amazing.

1559
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,100
- She looks like Julia Roberts.
- That's amazing.

1560
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,470
Will you go back to dancing
when your ankle gets healed?

1561
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,740
Exactly, but I'll keep working
as a model...

1562
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,010
at the same time.

1563
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,580
That's amazing.

1564
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,980
That's so fascinating.

1565
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,220
- Suddenly, she looks so different.
- It's fascinating.

1566
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,290
This is fun.

1567
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,890
No one guessed that I was a dancer.

1568
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:33,030
Guess how old I am.

1569
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:35,730
- Twenty-eight?
- Twenty-eight.

1570
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,030
- Twenty-eight?
- Around that age.

1571
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,630
You went to graduate school too.

1572
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,300
Twenty-two?

1573
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,310
Oh, come on.

1574
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,510
Let's not ask him.

1575
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,840
- I like that.
- He's flirting with her.

1576
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,780
It's because he picked the white book.

1577
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,750
He's so cute.

1578
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,520
My age is...

1579
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,250
- Drum roll.
- Drum roll.

1580
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,420
- I'm curious.
- I was born in 1998. I'm 26 years old.

1581
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,290
They guessed well.

1582
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,160
- Did we guess correctly?
- Yes.

1583
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,070
I'm curious.

1584
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,400
I probably look very different from now.

1585
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,540
You must seem alluring.

1586
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,780
"Alluring?"

1587
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,780
Joo Ha Neul.

1588
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,750
Those syllables are very meaningful.

1589
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,880
- "Joo Ha Neul."
- Joo Ha Neul.

1590
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,920
(They get more curious
about Dancer Joo Ha Neul.)

1591
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,350
- I didn't expect it at all.
- Me neither.

1592
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,990
- Shall I pick the next person?
- Yes.

1593
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,100
I'll pick the one whom
everyone was the most curious about.

1594
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,870
It's Chang Hwan.

1595
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,870
That's great.

1596
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,300
Why are you the most curious about me?

1597
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,640
It's impossible to guess.

1598
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,400
- Honestly, I can't guess at all.
- Guess?

1599
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,910
- It's Chang Hwan.
- I am...

1600
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,410
(He left a strong first impression
full of charms of a chef.)

1601
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,380
(Chang Hwan who seems pretentious)

1602
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,580
(While being eccentric,)

1603
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,650
(he's honest and diligent.)

1604
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:10,220
(He likes cute things.)

1605
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,460
(A mysterious man)

1606
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,260
- I should start with my name.
- Yes.

1607
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,600
(Curious)

1608
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,170
My name is Park Chang Hwan.

1609
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,670
- It suits him well.
- It suits him well.

1610
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,670
His name suits him well.

1611
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,040
- It suits him very well.
- Right.

1612
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,970
My name is Chang Hwan.

1613
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,040
My occupation is...

1614
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,180
You might be a member of a band.

1615
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,640
- That's what I think.
- A conductor suits him too.

1616
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,680
That's true.

1617
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Maestro?

1618
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,020
He said that he was sensitive to sound
during sleep.

1619
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,880
He might play the violin or the cello.

1620
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,720
- Classical music.
- I can't wait to see their reaction.

1621
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,490
- It's not a common job.
- Right.

1622
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,490
A pilot?

1623
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:48,900
- Right.
- A pilot?

1624
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,130
Every guess seems to suit him.

1625
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,200
- Right.
- Everything suits him.

1626
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,470
How is that possible?

1627
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,170
Why do you think so?

1628
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,600
It just seems to suit you.

1629
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,640
Really?

1630
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,540
Her sentence is very concise.

1631
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,010
Nice and simple.

1632
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,680
- She's exactly like her book.
- Right.

1633
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,550
I drive.

1634
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,920
- Drive?
- A racer?

1635
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,750
- Really?
- I drive,

1636
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,960
- but it's not a car.
- What?

1637
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,790
- Is it a plane?
- Is it a plane?

1638
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,790
A plane?

1639
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,130
I'm a pilot.

1640
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,930
How did she guess?

1641
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,460
That's incredible.

1642
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,500
- That's amazing.
- That's so creepy.

1643
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,470
I'm getting goosebumps now.

1644
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,830
I'm getting goosebumps.

1645
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,840
- I'm so startled.
- She just took a guess,

1646
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,900
and it was correct.

1647
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,810
She's the first one to guess
my occupation correctly.

1648
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,210
How did you guess correctly?

1649
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,680
- I just had a feeling.
- On the forehead...

1650
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,710
(How did she guess correctly?)

1651
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,280
"How did I guess correctly?"

1652
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,280
(Je Yeon is amazing
for guessing haphazardly.)

1653
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,620
I'm curious to see the look
on Ji Won's face.

1654
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,680
I'm so curious.

1655
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,690
- That's amazing.
- He said it was impossible to guess.

1656
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,690
It seems to suit you very well.

1657
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,060
- As soon as he said it,
- Right.

1658
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,590
- I thought that it suited him well.
- It suits him very well.

1659
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,330
- Suddenly, he looks different.
- Now...

1660
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,330
I drive a Boeing 777.

1661
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,930
That's the airline company we took.

1662
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,200
I operate that airplane.

1663
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,030
- That airplane.
- Really?

1664
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,200
It's the same plane that you took
to get to Rome.

1665
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,200
Seriously?

1666
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,470
I go back to Rome
at the end of this month.

1667
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:07,140
- That's amazing.
- Goodness.

1668
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,310
That's so fascinating.

1669
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,380
If he operates Airbus A380...

1670
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,710
- He's a pilot.
- That's so fascinating.

1671
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,710
That's incredible.

1672
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,320
I've been working...

1673
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,120
for ten years already.

1674
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,260
- Ten years?
- Yes.

1675
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,760
That's amazing.

1676
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,690
We have so many incredible people.

1677
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,390
Did you train in Korea?

1678
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,860
I trained in Arizona.
I started with light aircraft.

1679
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,100
So you're the plane captain.

1680
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,430
- I'm a copilot.
- Captain.

1681
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,600
Usually, I'm a copilot.

1682
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,900
What do you eat on the plane?

1683
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,310
Aren't you curious?

1684
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,980
Before I started working,

1685
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,980
- I was curious about that too.
- Right.

1686
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,080
For crew members who depart from Incheon,

1687
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,420
they get a warm meal called Crew Meal.

1688
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,050
We rotate with a team...

1689
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,720
called Cruise Team a few hours later.

1690
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,790
Then I get to sit in the business seat.

1691
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,720
I eat business class meals.

1692
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,590
Later when we land,

1693
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,960
I get to eat another Crew Meal.

1694
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,360
However, the menu is different...

1695
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,530
because pilots can't get an upset stomach.

1696
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:05,530
Right.

1697
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:07,030
I was also curious
about small things like this.

1698
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,340
Gosh.

1699
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,070
How does it feel to watch the sunset
right in front of you?

1700
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:12,940
We get to see the sunrise,

1701
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,270
and the moon rises too.

1702
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,280
Right.

1703
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,540
You can see the moon up in the sky.

1704
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,010
It's beautiful to watch the moon rise.

1705
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,980
At times like that,

1706
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,220
I think,
"It's too beautiful to watch alone."

1707
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,790
(Special views you can only see
from the pilot's seat)

1708
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:26,950
I often think that.

1709
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,590
I'm quite old.

1710
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,260
- Are you 37?
- What?

1711
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,290
No.

1712
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,900
I'm older.

1713
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,930
I'm curious.

1714
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,100
You said that you had been working
for ten years.

1715
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,970
- Right, he started after 30.
- Then 37?

1716
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,270
I was born in 1984.

1717
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,380
I'm 40.

1718
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,580
Gosh.

1719
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,150
I see.

1720
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,320
- You look young for your age.
- You look so young.

1721
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,020
I'm the only one in my 40s.

1722
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,290
Oh, no.

1723
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,320
Were you born in 1984?

1724
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,130
- Really?
- His ears turned very red.

1725
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,330
You look so young for your age.

1726
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,960
You look very young.

1727
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,370
- Goodness.
- You look very young for your age.

1728
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:13,970
That's how old I am.

1729
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,800
Oh, no.

1730
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,570
The look on Ji Won's face.

1731
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,910
(The look on Ji Won's face)

1732
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,840
Oh, no.

1733
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,340
(She can't hide the look on her face.)

1734
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,810
(Ji Won looks surprised.)

1735
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,820
(It's time for Chang Hwan
to pick the next person.)

1736
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,020
- You need to pick.
- Right.

1737
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,890
They look so nervous.

1738
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,260
I feel at ease because I went first.

1739
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,900
- Whom will you pick...
- The one who's working at the UN.

1740
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,170
The UN?

1741
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,240
Yes.

1742
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,540
I feel hot all of a sudden.

1743
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,380
My name is Bae Chae Eun.

1744
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,920
- Bae Chae Eun?
- Yes.

1745
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,120
My occupation is...

1746
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,990
A pharmacist.

1747
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,790
I haven't given up
on an international organization.

1748
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,460
- Her English skills...
- It's because...

1749
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,030
she seems like a diplomat.

1750
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,130
A consultant?

1751
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,230
That sounds likely.

1752
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,930
Everyone must have thought
that she looked intelligent.

1753
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,100
(Her intelligent aura left a strong
impression during the first meeting.)

1754
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,770
(Curious)

1755
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,940
Will you guess correctly again?

1756
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,250
- I know. I'm scared.
- She'll guess right again.

1757
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,310
Something related to banking.

1758
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,580
That suits her very well.

1759
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,650
- It seems like...
- What type of bank?

1760
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,250
- What?
- What type of bank?

1761
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,550
A foreign bank.

1762
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:43,890
Or IBK?

1763
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,030
I'm sorry. Why am I so excited today?

1764
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,330
- You seem disappointed...
- I must have been...

1765
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,500
- waiting for it.
- We've been waiting for it.

1766
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,870
- Seriously.
- We were curious.

1767
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,470
I must have waited long.
Why am I so excited?

1768
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,300
(Well, the answer is...)

1769
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,400
The answer is...

1770
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:03,480
I'm a researcher
at an economic research institute.

1771
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,940
- That suits you well.
- It suits her very well.

1772
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,810
I do research on regulations...

1773
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,480
related to ESG investing.

1774
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,720
I'm also a consultant.

1775
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,690
When you said consultant, I was surprised.

1776
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,690
When I said that?

1777
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,790
- You lived abroad for a long time.
- Yes.

1778
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,290
- What was your major?
- I majored...

1779
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:21,230
in natural science.

1780
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,760
Where did you live abroad?

1781
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,330
When I was in middle school,

1782
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,070
- I went to study abroad.
- I see.

1783
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,270
I studied in Canada for 11 years.

1784
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,900
I graduated from Toronto University.

1785
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,410
Did you go to study abroad alone?

1786
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,240
I have a twin sister.

1787
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:37,180
- Are you identical twins?
- No, fraternal twins.

1788
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,240
I see.

1789
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,180
We look very much alike.

1790
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,720
We went to study abroad together
in middle school.

1791
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,950
When you feel tired...

1792
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,150
Does she switch places with you?

1793
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,720
"Sister, you go today."

1794
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,720
My sister is working...

1795
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,230
- at a different foreign company.
- I see.

1796
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,660
Chan Hyeong looks a little...

1797
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,430
- He seems interested in her.
- My age.

1798
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,400
In case I get hurt by it,

1799
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,370
can I just say it?

1800
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,210
- When everyone says their age?
- Yes.

1801
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,580
I was born in 1996.

1802
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,350
I'm 28.

1803
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,410
Yes.

1804
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,050
Older sister.

1805
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,620
- Older sister.
- They look similar in age.

1806
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,790
You're my roommate.

1807
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,830
Nice to meet you.

1808
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,800
Chan Hyeong.

1809
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,640
Gosh, I am...

1810
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:40,670
He looks relaxed.

1811
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,740
My name is Lee Chan Hyeong.

1812
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:46,410
- I'm Lee Chan Hyeong.
- That suits him.

1813
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,210
I'm Lee Chan Hyeong.

1814
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,850
(He went to Saudi Arabia for work.)

1815
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,620
Why is this here?

1816
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,320
Why is there another one?

1817
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,820
Did you open that?

1818
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,060
It was already open.

1819
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,090
Wasn't it closed yesterday?

1820
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,460
(From start to finish,
he was sharp and analytical.)

1821
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,830
He's a detective.

1822
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,170
- Really?
- He has a sharp eye.

1823
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,500
Totally.

1824
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,300
Can you guess Chan Hyeong's job?

1825
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,640
I think it's something unique.

1826
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,040
He can't be an office worker.

1827
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,310
He was extremely busy.

1828
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,050
- Do I only know about homeschooling?
- Yes.

1829
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,950
You do look very smart.

1830
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,750
(An unusual man since childhood)

1831
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,190
Either in finance...

1832
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,860
- or a startup business.
- A trading company?

1833
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,890
What do you do about lunch?

1834
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,960
Where I am in the morning...

1835
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,930
and the afternoon are different.

1836
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,300
People wait for me...

1837
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,370
where my afternoon task is at.

1838
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,510
Really?

1839
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:47,870
We always have lunch together.

1840
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,510
There's a set pattern.

1841
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:51,980
It'll be beyond whatever you imagine.

1842
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,610
(Chan Hyeong's morning
and afternoon tasks are different.)

1843
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,380
This is making me nervous. I'm...

1844
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,180
- In the morning...
- What?

1845
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,490
Do you have two jobs?

1846
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,590
- Yes.
- Do you work two jobs?

1847
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,060
In the morning,

1848
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,960
I'm an internal medicine specialist.

1849
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,760
- What?
- I'm a doctor.

1850
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,030
They're taken aback.

1851
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,430
- My gosh.
- And...

1852
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:17,170
In the morning,
I examine or treat patients.

1853
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,870
In the afternoon, as you guessed,
I'm the CEO of a startup company.

1854
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:22,340
- I'm the CEO of a medical IT company.
- Medical, is it?

1855
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,080
As I'm juggling between two jobs,

1856
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,410
- my days are quite busy.
- Gosh.

1857
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,820
His likability has shot up.

1858
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,380
I'm in Gwanghwamun in the morning...

1859
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,220
- and then in Gongdeok in the afternoon.
- Goodness.

1860
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,860
I knew you were extraordinary.

1861
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,160
But you are truly unbelievable.

1862
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,090
You seemed very talented,

1863
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,730
but to think you had two jobs.

1864
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,130
What's more,

1865
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,930
you're a doctor...

1866
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,730
running a medical startup company?

1867
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,470
But you didn't say a thing
when I caught a cold.

1868
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
- Right?
- I did give him some medicine.

1869
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Right.
You gave me something in a bottle cap.

1870
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,680
- I left it.
- Did that cure me?

1871
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,180
No wonder I got better.

1872
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,620
(His credibility has gone up.)

1873
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,990
What's the medical startup company about?

1874
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,990
It's a medical questionnaire
analysis summary system.

1875
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,460
We implement
a medical efficiency system in hospitals.

1876
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,390
And to help foreigners get
medical examinations in Korea,

1877
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,930
we also provide translation services.

1878
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,600
Do you work
as an internal medicine specialist...

1879
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,640
from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.?

1880
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,470
Yes. I only work that shift.

1881
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,740
I've been a doctor for a while now.

1882
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,210
It's been over ten years.

1883
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,610
- Over ten years?
- Yes.

1884
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:33,010
My main job is a doctor.

1885
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,080
But I don't want to quit medicine...

1886
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,120
because my company
is a medical IT startup.

1887
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,550
The first ones to know
the needs of medicine...

1888
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,990
must be the most involved.

1889
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,660
I had to work both jobs.

1890
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,630
That's interesting.

1891
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,900
The men are left speechless.

1892
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,760
They're intimidated.

1893
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,370
I just got goosebumps.

1894
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,870
That's cool.

1895
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,740
Your age.

1896
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,870
(How old is this skilled and sharp man?)

1897
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,110
Thirty-seven.

1898
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,540
Thirty-eight?

1899
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,580
Since you're a specialist...

1900
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,680
Exactly.

1901
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,240
Wouldn't you be in your late 30s?

1902
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,310
I'm 32 years old.

1903
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,150
- What?
- I'm 32.

1904
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,920
- That's why...
- I'm sorry.

1905
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,950
- How is that possible?
- What?

1906
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,760
- It's because of your experience.
- I was born in 1992.

1907
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,130
I got into university quite young.

1908
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,130
- Because you were homeschooled?
- Yes.

1909
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,470
When did you enter university?

1910
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,270
- I went to university at 15.
- What?

1911
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,110
- Is he a genius?
- That's why...

1912
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:36,480
- Can I ask what your IQ is?
- I was ahead of others.

1913
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,540
I never got my IQ tested,

1914
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,880
- Mensa.
- so I don't know.

1915
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,250
Were you the youngest in Korea
to get into medical school?

1916
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,420
Yes.

1917
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,180
(Nobody can beat his qualifications.)

1918
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,890
At times like these,
Ji Min has the most...

1919
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,220
- She's honest.
- honest reaction.

1920
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,860
- I find her the coolest.
- Right?

1921
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,530
Were you the youngest in Korea
to get into medical school?

1922
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,590
Yes.

1923
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,830
That means you're a genius.

1924
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,800
Not really.

1925
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,270
I just put in a lot of effort
and did my best...

1926
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,470
with my older brother.

1927
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,840
(A series of shocks)

1928
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,040
You are incredible.

1929
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,510
Really...

1930
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,540
This is truly remarkable.

1931
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,340
- I got goosebumps.
- Really?

1932
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,450
For how long?

1933
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:15,010
You would've obviously gone through
fellowship.

1934
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,850
You're only 32...

1935
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,250
- and already did your fellowship.
- He's smart.

1936
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,390
I've never met someone like him before.

1937
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,160
I'm sure none of you have either.

1938
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:31,000
He's the first in my life.
Plus, he's really young.

1939
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,530
(Glancing)

1940
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,130
Pick the next person.

1941
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,270
(The next person has a lot of pressure.)

1942
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,470
- Je Yeon?
- Me?

1943
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,070
I bet everyone will be shocked.

1944
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,110
My name is Lee Je Yeon.

1945
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,750
A ballerina?

1946
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,250
She gives off such an image.

1947
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,280
- You read my mind.
- I was about to say a dancer.

1948
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,020
In the dancer or ballerina field.

1949
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,250
Right? The vibe she gives off.

1950
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,120
(What's Je Yeon's job?)

1951
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,560
- Lee Je Yeon.
- Yes.

1952
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,830
- An undergraduate?
- I think you're a college student.

1953
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,200
She's happy.

1954
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
Bring up a college student,
and it makes her happy.

1955
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,340
- Oh, gosh.
- She must be a college student.

1956
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,710
A weather forecaster?

1957
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,580
I bet you're in resource management.

1958
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,810
How come?

1959
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:21,980
An accountant?

1960
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,550
- Am I right?
- He must be right.

1961
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,750
As you're quiet and calm,

1962
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:30,290
you must like immersing yourself
in a solo task.

1963
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,330
- He did a lot of thinking.
- Is it one of them?

1964
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,090
- No.
- What?

1965
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,400
What was that for?

1966
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,030
She must've simply wanted to know
the reason.

1967
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,900
- I just...
- That made my heart pound a little.

1968
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:43,640
I just wanted to know the reason. I'm...

1969
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,340
She's revealing it.

1970
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,310
an attorney.

1971
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,110
I'm an attorney.

1972
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,020
- Look at Ji Min.
- Ji Min's jaw dropped.

1973
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,990
(Feeling shy)

1974
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,150
Even Woo Jae.

1975
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,560
I didn't expect that one bit.

1976
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,920
It's an opposite image.

1977
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,190
- Exactly.
- For real.

1978
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,090
- This is a surprise.
- How cool.

1979
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,530
You're not like that at court, are you?

1980
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,400
"Well, this is..."

1981
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,730
"I think I have an objection."

1982
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,140
You're not like that, are you?

1983
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,980
Ji Min and Woo Jae
have strange expressions.

1984
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,320
How did it happen?

1985
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,290
- "How did it happen?"
- "How did it happen?"

1986
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,260
I think you chose the wrong words.

1987
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,390
- It's just...
- It shocked him.

1988
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,860
- He's surprised.
- How did you...

1989
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,400
It has been my dream
ever since middle school.

1990
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,630
Since middle school?

1991
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,000
I like writing things
such as persuasive essays.

1992
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,940
And I like listening to people's concerns.

1993
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,980
I thought the job involved both of them.

1994
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,450
You said you liked writing,

1995
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,580
but your answers to the questions were...

1996
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,420
Keeping things short is hard.

1997
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,990
She's so cute.

1998
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:11,820
(The men have suddenly become withdrawn.)

1999
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,600
What time do you get to work?

2000
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,600
I'm currently...

2001
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,100
preparing to open my own office.

2002
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,510
Were you working at a law firm before?

2003
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,610
Yes. I used to work in a law firm.

2004
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,380
I was also a corporate attorney
for a company.

2005
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,180
That's cool.

2006
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,220
- How embarrassing.
- I'm really shocked.

2007
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,850
I was confident
you were a college student.

2008
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:46,360
(An unexpected side
of the quiet and bright Je Yeon)

2009
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,160
I had no idea.

2010
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,100
(An unexpected side
of the quiet and bright Je Yeon)

2011
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,930
Trials.

2012
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:54,930
(Do you also do trials?)

2013
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,040
Yes.

2014
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,340
But you barely talk.

2015
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,410
Isn't she "Jekyll and Hyde?"

2016
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,140
- In trials...
- Exactly. During trials...

2017
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,410
- Using dialects...
- She says everything.

2018
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,980
and going all out.

2019
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,380
(Je Yeon defends her clients
with a dialect?)

2020
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:08,580
The vibe.

2021
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,150
- Is it different?
- Sorry?

2022
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,790
Bam.

2023
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:15,220
- I wonder what you're like.
- What are you like?

2024
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,490
- During trials?
- Yes.

2025
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:20,260
Writings are the default.

2026
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:24,060
I explain what is written to the judge.

2027
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,400
That's what I do.

2028
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,170
- What a big twist.
- Do you need a mic?

2029
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,400
- Really.
- Everyone has a twist.

2030
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,600
- For real.
- Je Yeon.

2031
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,010
People don't usually guess
you're an attorney at first, do they?

2032
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:36,780
I had rarely been
in such a situation before.

2033
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,810
- True.
- Normally...

2034
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:38,810
- You introduce yourself.
- Yes.

2035
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,810
It's unlikely that
people won't introduce themselves.

2036
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,180
It was really fun.

2037
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,990
- It was.
- Woo Jae is laughing.

2038
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,660
- Woo Jae...
- He looks gloomy.

2039
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,360
- He's at a loss for words.
- Right?

2040
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:55,060
Woo Jae and Ji Min's reactions are...

2041
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,460
- Right.
- They're not exactly happy.

2042
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,960
No. It's like...

2043
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,800
- they feel a sense of pressure.
- Right?

2044
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,970
Women who are competent
and have everything...

2045
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:05,770
are so-called alpha girls.

2046
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:08,170
The men are overwhelmed,
wondering if they're good enough...

2047
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,040
for such an alpha girl.

2048
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,710
It also makes them feel small.

2049
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,680
Their minds must be a whirlwind.

2050
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,810
What about my age?

2051
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,780
- For someone with a baby face,
- Exactly.

2052
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,890
you already have experience
as an attorney.

2053
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,120
- I'm dying to know.
- Same here.

2054
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,830
(Thinking)

2055
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,930
It's hard to tell
that I can't even make a guess.

2056
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,700
Thank you.

2057
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,700
I was born in 1995.

2058
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,670
- Then she's either 28 or 29.
- That makes her...

2059
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,570
- Are you 29?
- I'm 29 years old.

2060
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,740
- Twentynine.
- Twentynine.

2061
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,710
- You have a real baby face.
- For real.

2062
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,450
- Really...
- Even Chan Hyeong is shocked.

2063
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,850
Anyone would think
she's a graduate student.

2064
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,350
This place is full of shockers.

2065
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,690
Big sister.

2066
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,490
Gosh.

2067
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,290
Really.

2068
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,200
Goodness,
she looks very young for her age.

2069
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,600
Why did you think I was the green book?

2070
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:11,470
Well...

2071
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
You were very simple and down-to-earth.

2072
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,110
- Simple?
- I see.

2073
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,280
Of course,
money and materialistic things...

2074
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,950
are important in life.

2075
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,720
But rather than being tied down by them...

2076
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,290
Do you prefer living a worry-free life?

2077
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,820
I think I do.

2078
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,730
I want a peaceful life.

2079
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:38,160
- It must be Woo Jae's life values.
- Right?

2080
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,830
What about you, Je Yeon?

2081
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,500
Same here.

2082
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2083
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:52,110
I get the feeling Je Yeon is far
from what Woo Jae expected.

2084
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,450
Naturally, next is...

2085
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:55,550
Me?

2086
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,790
First off, my name is...

2087
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,360
Shin Woo Jae.

2088
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,560
- Shin Woo Jae.
- Yes, Shin Woo Jae.

2089
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,760
(Shin Woo Jae)

2090
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,960
My job.

2091
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,670
Make a guess.

2092
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,570
- A tennis player.
- Tennis.

2093
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,040
I do like table tennis.

2094
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,300
A tax accountant.

2095
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,940
I should've worn my glasses today.

2096
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,370
- An accountant?
- He gives off an elite vibe.

2097
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,840
- Doesn't he also look like an attorney?
- An attorney.

2098
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,580
Won't Je Yeon get it right?

2099
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,650
Please pick one impressive piece.

2100
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,690
- Among all of them?
- Yes.

2101
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:36,920
I want to know your taste.

2102
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,490
I want to know what that blue thing is.

2103
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:43,600
Do you like that one?

2104
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,030
Because it's mysterious.

2105
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,700
You might like abstract paintings.

2106
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:50,340
You could be in the art industry.

2107
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,470
Art industry?

2108
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,610
Since Woo Jae used to be in Italy.

2109
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,910
That could be cool.

2110
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,540
A car designer.

2111
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,350
That suits him well.

2112
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,680
I had dreamed of becoming one.

2113
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,050
My job...

2114
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,920
involves drawing.

2115
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:10,260
- Are you a webcomic artist?
- No.

2116
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,660
I paint.

2117
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,400
So...

2118
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,300
Give me your book again.

2119
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:21,830
Ji Min has a great personality.

2120
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,770
- A reevaluation.
- It's a high-priced piece.

2121
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:25,800
I couldn't see it in detail.

2122
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,210
- I knew it. It was different.
- I thought it was water.

2123
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,540
Is it the drawing on the book cover?

2124
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,850
(Thinking)

2125
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,850
I've always liked drawing...

2126
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,580
since I was a kid.

2127
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,790
I used to be a soccer player.

2128
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:41,450
- Gosh.
- Really?

2129
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,020
My gosh. Until when?

2130
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,560
- I played until I was 23 years old.
- Were you a soccer player?

2131
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,760
Were you a professional player?

2132
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,330
Yes, but I couldn't become a famous one.

2133
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:54,000
I spent my last years as a player
in Germany.

2134
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,770
- How long in total?
- With that,

2135
01:28:56,770 --> 01:29:00,010
I returned to Korea.

2136
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,740
I always thought about
what I could enjoy doing my whole life.

2137
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,150
And the answer seemed like drawing.

2138
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:09,850
Once I began drawing and worked hard,

2139
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:10,980
opportunities arose...

2140
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,550
that allowed me to hold exhibitions.

2141
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,160
All I've been doing is drawing.

2142
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,730
And...

2143
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,030
Everyone here has amazing jobs...

2144
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:26,430
that I kind of feel...

2145
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,600
(Fidgeting)

2146
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,070
Right.

2147
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,740
You're more amazing
pursuing that after playing soccer.

2148
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,940
Arts and all.

2149
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,940
Having those two talents is extraordinary.

2150
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:41,580
That's why right now... Yes.

2151
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,350
Right now, I believe...

2152
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,120
I'm at the stage where I must grow more.

2153
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,420
I usually draw abstract paintings.

2154
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:55,030
There's not one style that I'm into.

2155
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,630
But the theme is nature.

2156
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:59,570
- I'm currently using watercolors...
- With watercolors?

2157
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:00,700
to paint nature.

2158
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,800
(Woo Jae pours his passion
onto canvases now.)

2159
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,900
- Gosh, that's cool.
- Oh, gosh.

2160
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:09,640
As for my age...

2161
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,240
I was born in 1990.

2162
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,850
- I see.
- I'm 34 years old.

2163
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,180
In 1990?

2164
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,820
- What a baby face.
- Right.

2165
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,890
- Ji Won.
- Okay.

2166
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,860
My name is Moon Ji Won.

2167
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,720
The name suits you.

2168
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,720
(Smiling)

2169
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,930
- Right. My job is...
- Your job.

2170
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:30,230
A kindergarten teacher?

2171
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,000
Right? I thought so too.

2172
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,370
In her book, it said...

2173
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,400
she was in charge of a project.

2174
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,500
An engineer?

2175
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,070
I'm a semiconductor engineer...

2176
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,240
at Samsung Electronics.

2177
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,480
- That's cool.
- Unbelievable.

2178
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,680
She's incredible.

2179
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,350
Amazing. Really.

2180
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,790
Nobody could've guessed it.

2181
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,490
- Did you finish engineering college?
- Yes.

2182
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,790
- You must've been really popular.
- No.

2183
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,130
Here we have
the engineering college's beauty.

2184
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,500
You had this air around you
back at the airport.

2185
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,800
- Really?
- Yes. How cool.

2186
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,170
I'm into semiconductors
and watch YouTube videos about them.

2187
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:14,270
ASUS piqued my interest,
so I looked into it too.

2188
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,610
- Is that so?
- Samsung Semiconductor is famous,

2189
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:19,780
but it's my first time meeting someone
working in that company.

2190
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:22,050
Chang Hwan is very interested
in that field.

2191
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,250
- How diverse.
- For real.

2192
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,790
- You really surprised me.
- Did I?

2193
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,690
I'm still in shock.

2194
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,090
Ji Min works for the same company.

2195
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:33,160
- Your age.
- May I ask how old you are?

2196
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,660
But I might get hurt by it.

2197
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,770
I...

2198
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,470
I was born in 1999.

2199
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,010
- How old is that?
- In 1999?

2200
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:49,010
I'm 25 years old.

2201
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,050
(A bolt out of the blue)

2202
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:01,750
- For real?
- Oh, no.

2203
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,090
He has a lot on his mind.

2204
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,790
Look at Chang Hwan's face.

2205
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:08,590
He's shocked.
They had a good thing going on.

2206
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,070
Did you say 1999?

2207
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,500
We're all similar in age, right?

2208
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,940
But...

2209
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,880
I should leave today.

2210
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,210
"I should leave today."

2211
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,780
Chang Hwan has a lot to think about.

2212
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,750
Ji Won is looking at Chang Hwan.

2213
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,750
(Shutting his eyes tightly)

2214
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,130
- I'm automatically the last.
- The last person.

2215
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,400
- I'm curious.
- Gosh.

2216
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,030
- I'm dying to know.
- Seriously.

2217
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,970
- I'm nervous.
- My name is Ahn Ji Min.

2218
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,840
Jung Yong Hwa of CNBLUE.

2219
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,980
- Jung Yong Hwa.
- Yes, he does look alike.

2220
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

2221
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,280
- But he's better looking than the singer.
- Let's move on.

2222
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,650
I bet he's a model.

2223
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,790
- Remember what we talked about?
- Oh, right.

2224
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,150
- You said he could be an underwear model.
- Should I reveal my body?

2225
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,860
I could totally see you working
as a model.

2226
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,030
- You look very fit. That's obvious.
- I see.

2227
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,060
Okay.

2228
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,290
Maybe, you're an investment banker.

2229
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,800
You said that last time too.

2230
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,600
When I'm in Korea, I usually lie down
in my bed around 10:30 p.m.

2231
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,770
(Ji Min goes to sleep early.)

2232
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,240
I hate being tired when I'm working.

2233
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:27,440
I totally agree.

2234
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,810
First of all, I did major in engineering.

2235
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,880
I also majored in electrical engineering.

2236
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,250
(Surprised)

2237
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,250
(Laughing)

2238
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,350
I was really shocked.

2239
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,920
- I also work for Samsung Electronics.
- What?

2240
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,390
- They work for the same company.
- Wait.

2241
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,960
What?

2242
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:48,630
- They work for the same company?
- My gosh.

2243
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,400
I work for Samsung Electronics,
but I don't work with semiconductors.

2244
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,370
I work in the Strategy Development Team
for the telecommunications sector.

2245
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:58,840
(A moment ago)

2246
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,240
- That's what I do.
- My gosh.

2247
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:04,080
(He fails to hold back his laughter
after realizing she's a colleague.)

2248
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:06,510
He failed to hold back his laughter.

2249
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,510
- I was really shocked.
- I bet.

2250
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:10,280
Where's your office?

2251
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,080
- Samsung Digital City in Suwon.
- I see.

2252
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,450
- Are you in the DX division?
- I'm in the DX division.

2253
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:16,220
I hate pigeons.

2254
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,590
- I really hate them too.
- I loathe them.

2255
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:18,590
(Chuckling)

2256
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,230
(They started off as an alliance
against pigeons.)

2257
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,230
I don't feel uncomfortable around you.

2258
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,430
(Somehow, he ended up drawing boundaries.)

2259
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:31,300
(He made it clear once again
by not sending her the message.)

2260
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,000
(She was simply enjoying her walk.)

2261
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,210
She was just enjoying her walk.

2262
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:38,410
(They unnecessarily ran
into each other too often.)

2263
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:40,010
- They ran into each other a lot.
- My gosh.

2264
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:41,580
I remember that day.

2265
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,180
- I was shocked.
- No way.

2266
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,350
(The office company)

2267
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,450
- Right.
- So...

2268
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:50,090
- we can talk on the messenger tomorrow.
- We can talk on the messenger.

2269
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,790
- Really?
- Yes, you work for the same company.

2270
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:53,360
- You must have the company messenger.
- Yes. We can talk on the messenger.

2271
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,430
- That's it.
- What about your age?

2272
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:56,560
- Your age.
- Right, my age.

2273
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:00,900
- I was born in 1992.
- In 1992.

2274
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,900
He's 32.

2275
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,870
- You guys are the same age.
- We're the same age.

2276
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:08,970
(They got to know one another
on a deeper level.)

2277
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,610
Nice to meet you all.

2278
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,280
(What kind of change will this bring?)

2279
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,380
- This is fascinating.
- It really is.

2280
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,720
- Chang Hwan and Ji Won.
- I...

2281
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,920
- Chang Hwan and Ji Won.
- Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2282
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,820
- Oh, no.
- The jobs...

2283
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,890
Chang Hwan...

2284
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,120
When his age was revealed,

2285
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,990
the look on Ji Won's face...

2286
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,790
Ji Won was shocked.

2287
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,230
- It was utter shock.
- Yes.

2288
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,660
What year was Ji Won born?

2289
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,430
- Ji Won was born in 1999.
- She was born in 1999.

2290
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,030
She's the youngest.

2291
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:37,170
After observing
Ji Won's facial expression,

2292
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,970
I realized that
Ji Won was indeed interested in him.

2293
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:39,970
- Right.
- I see.

2294
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,140
- She was always calm. You know?
- Right.

2295
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,980
When I saw how her face stiffened...

2296
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,210
(Ji Won seemed shocked.)

2297
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:47,110
- I realized that she liked him.
- Yes.

2298
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:49,750
To be honest, I feel more pain...

2299
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,580
for Chang Hwan, not Ji Won.

2300
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,780
- Same here.
- Right?

2301
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,320
- He seemed uneasy.
- Exactly.

2302
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,490
- He thought she was way too young.
- Right.

2303
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,620
- Right?
- Exactly.

2304
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,620
I was quite sad.

2305
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,690
- Same here.
- Yes.

2306
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:01,160
They seemed to be the most compatible.

2307
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,660
They were so perfect for each other.

2308
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:06,360
Finding out about Chan Hyeong's career
and background...

2309
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,030
might make the ladies uncomfortable.

2310
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:09,570
- That's a possibility.
- That crossed my mind.

2311
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:11,340
- That's possible.
- The thing is,

2312
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,840
- his life doesn't sound ordinary.
- Right.

2313
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,340
He's led such a different life.

2314
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,010
- That's why when she smiled,
- Right.

2315
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:17,710
- I saw a sense of uneasiness.
- That's right.

2316
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,740
- Right.
- Yes.

2317
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,380
Chae Eun seemed to be impressed.

2318
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:22,810
- Right.
- Yes.

2319
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:23,880
- She was fascinated.
- Chae Eun...

2320
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,980
- She seemed intrigued by his career.
- Yes.

2321
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,720
She might have come across...

2322
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,820
someone like him in her line of work.

2323
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:30,860
That's a possibility.

2324
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,590
She must have met a lot of people...

2325
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:34,490
- from many corporations and startups.
- Right.

2326
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:37,600
Woo Jae and Je Yeon seemed
to click the most in Italy.

2327
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,760
Their jobs are revealed now.

2328
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,700
Woo Jae is a painter in fine art,
the highest form of art.

2329
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,140
But Je Yeon is a lawyer who must
strictly follow the letter of the law.

2330
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,640
- So their industries are polar opposites.
- Yes.

2331
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,740
But Woo Jae said,
"How did you end up doing that?"

2332
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,610
And that doesn't have
a positive connotation.

2333
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:52,910
- That was more of a negative reaction.
- Right.

2334
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:56,250
So her job must have been so different...

2335
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:57,950
from what he had in mind.

2336
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:59,550
Here's what I worry about.

2337
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,720
- It's the topic of their conversation.
- Right.

2338
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:05,190
I wonder how many things
they have in common.

2339
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:07,660
And I wonder how long it will last.

2340
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,590
That's my concern now.

2341
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,730
So we'll have to pay attention
to the conversations...

2342
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:15,130
- they have in Seoul.
- Right.

2343
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,600
If this were "Heart Signal,"
we could have laughed it off...

2344
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,310
and moved on.

2345
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:23,240
- Yes. That's true.
- But on Heart Pairing, jobs and age...

2346
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:24,940
are so important.

2347
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,040
Marriage is in the picture now.

2348
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,180
- It's Heart Pairing. Yes.
- Yes.

2349
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,680
- It's finding their life companion.
- Considering marriage...

2350
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,950
By the way...

2351
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,950
- Big sister.
- Yes?

2352
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,220
- Big sister.
- Yes, baby.

2353
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,450
(They finalize
how they will address each other.)

2354
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,260
Right. Je Yeon is the oldest among them.

2355
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,660
We were roommates.

2356
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:41,390
- We talked a lot in Italy.
- Yes.

2357
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,230
- When we talked,
- Yes.

2358
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,500
- didn't I sound older, though?
- Yes.

2359
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,500
- Right?
- Yes.

2360
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
- I see.
- Right.

2361
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:52,870
If we run into any problems,
she's going to take care of them.

2362
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,040
I'll take care of them?

2363
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,640
- She'll fix them for us.
- I love it.

2364
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,610
- I just got a big sister I can rely on.
- My gosh.

2365
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:58,640
Yes.

2366
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,950
- Come by my office.
- She's so cute.

2367
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:05,120
We just managed
to memorize everyone's name.

2368
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,220
Now, we have to memorize
their last name and age too.

2369
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:11,020
- Chang Hwan.
- It was Ahn, right?

2370
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:12,690
- Was it Park Chang Hwan?
- Yes.

2371
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:14,090
- Then Ahn...
- Ahn...

2372
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:15,160
- Ahn Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

2373
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,190
- Okay.
- Ji Min.

2374
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,200
And...

2375
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,860
- Park...
- So...

2376
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,340
he was born in 1984.

2377
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,200
He was born in 1984.

2378
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:27,710
He's 15 years older than me.

2379
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,640
(Unable to hold back his sigh)

2380
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,510
- Ji Won.
- Oh, no.

2381
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,110
He's 15 years older than me.

2382
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,420
He's 14 years older than me then.

2383
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,720
Right.

2384
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,790
- But he doesn't look his age.
- Right.

2385
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,060
Seriously. I didn't get the vibe
that he could be much older.

2386
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,320
Totally.

2387
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:48,330
- He doesn't look his age at all.
- Right.

2388
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:51,100
You didn't feel the age difference
when you were on a date with him, right?

2389
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,100
- No. Not at all.
- Right.

2390
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,130
Right.

2391
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:02,810
(After the self-introduction session,
Chang Hwan is on her mind.)

2392
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:04,640
- It seems she has a lot on her mind.
- Seriously.

2393
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,480
He said he wasn't going to talk to me
going forward.

2394
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:13,650
Because you're too young for him?

2395
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,590
But you guys have already gotten
to know each other.

2396
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,760
- Wouldn't it be okay?
- Right.

2397
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,760
(A moment ago)

2398
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,760
Right.

2399
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,630
- Thank you. It was very warm.
- You can keep using it if you want.

2400
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:23,830
You can use it at work tomorrow.

2401
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,330
- Really?
- Yes.

2402
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:26,530
- Where are your suitcases?
- Thank you.

2403
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,300
But this is not good.
You're so much younger than me.

2404
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,370
No, don't say that.

2405
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,170
(Sighing)

2406
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,210
My gosh.

2407
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:38,740
But you went on a date with him
two days in a row.

2408
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,380
You also saw him
before coming to the house, right?

2409
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,780
Gosh, what should I call it? Pairing?

2410
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,120
- Right.
- How did we...

2411
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:50,560
(They had two dates in Italy
and chose each other's book.)

2412
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:54,960
(It was more than just a coincidence.
It seemed they were meant to be.)

2413
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,690
Gosh, they had such a strong bond.
What a pity.

2414
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:57,700
(Thinking deeply)

2415
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:00,800
(She picks up
Chang Hwan's book once again.)

2416
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,100
She's reading his Pairing Book.

2417
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,270
She really liked him.

2418
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,540
(They were drawn to each other...)

2419
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:12,740
(before their age or job came into play.)

2420
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,650
I think this is how she's feeling.

2421
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:16,080
She's flustered,

2422
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,420
but she feels bad that she's flustered.

2423
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,420
- Right.
- I see.

2424
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,550
This is especially more painful for me...

2425
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,820
because I wished for Ji Won's happiness
more than anyone's.

2426
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:27,960
She just came back to Seoul.
Her joyful moment was so brief.

2427
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,260
(Closing her eyes)

2428
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,330
So yes.

2429
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,670
And she must feel guilty
that she's even thinking about this.

2430
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:38,940
(What's on her mind now?)

2431
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,580
(Flipping)

2432
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,280
How is this possible?

2433
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,810
(He's also skimming
through Ji Won's book.)

2434
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,520
Oh, no.

2435
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,550
They're perfect for each other.

2436
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,820
(As he takes a breath...)

2437
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:58,860
Poor guy.

2438
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:04,830
(Chang Hwan sorts out his thoughts.)

2439
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:12,970
It's interesting
how all of us are older than the ladies.

2440
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,270
- Right?
- Yes.

2441
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:18,180
I can't choose just one person
who had the most unexpected job...

2442
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,950
- when we disclosed our information.
- Yes.

2443
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:22,980
I really had no idea.

2444
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,620
I couldn't guess any of their jobs.

2445
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:29,890
But I do have to say that
I was really surprised by Je Yeon's job.

2446
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:31,620
Given the age and everything...

2447
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,390
(Nodding)

2448
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:35,430
- That was a big surprise.
- Yes.

2449
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,160
- So they really didn't see it coming.
- That's...

2450
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,130
(Everything about Je Yeon
surprised everyone.)

2451
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,540
Right, Je Yeon.

2452
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,780
I couldn't picture her as a lawyer.

2453
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:51,840
Right. Yes.

2454
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,380
- It didn't match the image we had of her.
- It was a surprise. Yes.

2455
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,220
That's true.

2456
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:02,150
I wonder how he feels right now.

2457
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:03,860
It's not here.

2458
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:05,520
Can I drop the honorifics now?
Is that okay with you?

2459
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,090
I was talking to myself. Yes, sure.

2460
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:10,160
(Forget about the Woo Jae you met before.)

2461
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,000
- Woo Jae is asserting himself here.
- Gosh.

2462
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,830
- They revealed their age and all.
- Yes.

2463
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:15,030
"I'll drop the honorifics now."

2464
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:17,040
Woo Jae is so manly.

2465
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,140
It's not here.

2466
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,800
Can I drop the honorifics now?
Is that okay with you?

2467
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,310
I was talking to myself. Yes, sure.

2468
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,510
I sorted it out with Chan Hyeong.

2469
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,910
The bathroom was nice.

2470
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,880
Ji Min feels uncomfortable now
because Woo Jae is older.

2471
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:31,120
I see. So Samsung?

2472
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:36,220
Seriously.
Everyone seems so different now.

2473
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:39,090
When we met in Italy,
we didn't know anything about each other.

2474
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,490
But when we talked,

2475
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:44,700
he sounded like a professional.

2476
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:46,560
I was trying to sound smart.

2477
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,900
Does it mean I have to take a shower here?

2478
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,740
Woo Jae is thinking a lot
about everyone's job.

2479
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:58,440
(Approaching)

2480
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,010
Doesn't this suit me?

2481
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:02,180
My gosh.

2482
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,550
- Oh, my.
- What's going on?

2483
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,690
- Do you need a hand with that?
- What?

2484
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,160
No, I'm done.
I just have to rinse them now.

2485
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:16,090
- You should've taken off your cardigan.
- What?

2486
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,430
- This?
- Yes.

2487
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,930
Yes, I should have.

2488
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,670
(Chuckling)

2489
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:29,840
- You should roll up the sleeves.
- What?

2490
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,110
(Getting close)

2491
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:37,920
Ji Min and Je Yeon seem
comfortable around each other now.

2492
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,280
Thank you.

2493
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:45,590
Are you feeling better now?

2494
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,230
Yes.

2495
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:49,390
But how come you haven't recovered yet?

2496
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,130
- What?
- How come you haven't recovered yet?

2497
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,130
I don't know.

2498
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,270
But I think I'm recovering...

2499
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:57,800
- now that I took some medicine.
- What?

2500
01:43:58,140 --> 01:43:59,170
- What did you say?
- I'm recovering...

2501
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:01,040
- now that I took some medicine.
- I see. You took some medicine.

2502
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,140
- You can't be sick here.
- What?

2503
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,710
- You can't be sick here.
- Right.

2504
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:08,010
Oh, my.

2505
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:11,120
I don't even know where to place them.

2506
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,180
- Right?
- Right.

2507
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,920
- I'll be back. Let me take this off.
- Okay.

2508
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:25,860
(While she's gone,
he finishes washing the dishes.)

2509
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:27,970
I'll do it.

2510
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,800
- I just have to rinse them, right?
- Right.

2511
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,440
I was really surprised by your job.

2512
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:43,720
I thought you were in college.

2513
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,760
I bet that's what you liked.

2514
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,220
Who else said
they thought you were in college?

2515
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,890
Chae Eun.

2516
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,930
- You look young.
- Is that so?

2517
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,130
But you look very young too.

2518
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,200
Me? How old did you think I was?

2519
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,170
To be honest,

2520
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,040
I thought that
you could be younger than me.

2521
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:12,910
- You thought I could be younger? I see.
- Just based on your looks.

2522
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:14,210
(Just based on your looks)

2523
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,020
Does Woo Jae have a lot on his mind?

2524
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,820
I'm curious
about what he's thinking right now.

2525
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:28,430
(Sighing)

2526
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,960
(Exhaling)

2527
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,770
- I brought that.
- Why did you bring that?

2528
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:36,930
- She wasn't eating.
- I see. She wasn't eating.

2529
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,770
There you are. I was looking for you.

2530
01:45:38,770 --> 01:45:40,240
- Why?
- She washed the dishes.

2531
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,470
You washed the dishes?

2532
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,040
I did the dishes.

2533
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,440
- Why did you do that?
- I'm bragging now.

2534
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,250
- Why did you do that?
- No, I should do it.

2535
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,410
Wait, she's older than you?

2536
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,350
- Yes. She's older than you.
- She is.

2537
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,450
She became the oldest lady in the house.

2538
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:52,820
- I thought she was the youngest.
- I thought...

2539
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:55,220
- Ha Neul or Chae Eun would be the oldest.
- So...

2540
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:57,190
- That was a huge surprise.
- No.

2541
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:59,620
- Ha Neul seems slightly upset.
- My gosh.

2542
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,890
- Why are you so blunt today?
- What?

2543
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:03,430
Why are you so blunt today?

2544
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,700
You're especially blunt today.

2545
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,530
- But...
- I see. You're really cooking.

2546
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:09,170
The presentation looks so appetizing.

2547
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,570
- When can we wash up?
- Je Yeon.

2548
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:15,140
- Cloudie.
- What's that?

2549
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,440
- Cloudie.
- How cute.

2550
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,940
- Is that a puppy?
- It's my puppy.

2551
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,980
(She changes the subject to puppies.)

2552
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:23,050
- So when I was leaving today,
- What a cute puppy.

2553
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,020
Cloudie kept looking at me.

2554
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,350
Cloudie is so cute. How old is your puppy?

2555
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:28,620
- Cloudie is 3.
- Cloudie is 3?

2556
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:32,360
(Can you see the couples
who have been paired together?)

2557
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,390
(Mission 5: Guess the results
of tonight's pairing now.)

2558
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,590
- My gosh.
- Hold on.

2559
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,900
- This is the hardest one.
- I can't spot any paired couples.

2560
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,500
I don't feel confident today.

2561
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,930
I can't do it.

2562
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,470
I'm questioning
if there will even be any couples today.

2563
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:46,500
What happened to Chang Hwan and Ji Won
is such a pity, right?

2564
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,110
It's such a pity.

2565
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:50,240
- He said he wouldn't talk to her now.
- You know what?

2566
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,380
On "Heart Signal,"
after revealing their jobs,

2567
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,480
- everyone became so chatty.
- They were so cheerful and all.

2568
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,610
Exactly.

2569
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,950
But on Heart Pairing,
things became serious.

2570
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:59,520
It's like watching a weekend drama.

2571
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:02,250
Watching Chang Hwan and Ji Won
is like watching a weekend drama.

2572
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,360
- The dopamine rush is crazy.
- Right?

2573
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,560
This is crazy.

2574
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,190
Do you feel confident
about today's predictions?

2575
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:08,390
I don't.

2576
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,390
- This is a tough one today.
- All right.

2577
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:12,300
We must figure out
whose heart has been paired...

2578
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,270
with whom from tonight's text messages...

2579
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:17,940
and the number of paired couples.

2580
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,140
The 8,000-dollar voucher
of the Pairing House in Tuscany...

2581
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:22,840
will allow the winner
to spend two nights in it.

2582
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,110
The voucher is at stake of our prediction.

2583
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,410
All of us have a point so far.

2584
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:28,050
- So the five of us are tied.
- Yes.

2585
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,910
- I must be sharp.
- Yes.

2586
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,880
- Mimi, what are your predictions?
- I think...

2587
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,990
Ji Min and Je Yeon will be paired.

2588
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,150
- Ji Min and Je Yeon?
- You think they will be paired?

2589
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:36,950
- Really?
- You think they will be paired?

2590
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:39,560
My guess is that
the last clip must have been important.

2591
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,660
- Really?
- I see.

2592
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:41,660
(Is that so?)

2593
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,900
My first couple is Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2594
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,930
Ji Won is a loyal girl.

2595
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,300
Even if things are shaky,
they wouldn't end it yet.

2596
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,000
- Not yet. Okay.
- Not yet.

2597
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,070
I think
Woo Jae and Je Yeon will be paired.

2598
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:52,600
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2599
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,670
There's another one?

2600
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:54,840
- Yes.
- My gosh.

2601
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,710
I'm taking this all the way today.

2602
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:59,210
- Three couples!
- I'm going for three couples today.

2603
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,310
- It'll be great if everyone is happy.
- Yes.

2604
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,410
All right. Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.

2605
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:05,080
- A new start.
- Really?

2606
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,620
They didn't interact at all.
Just based on their jobs?

2607
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:09,550
- But they had a chance to talk.
- Yes.

2608
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:11,190
- Right. It's...
- That's right.

2609
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,590
Here's mine.

2610
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:15,160
I went with Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2611
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,530
Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2612
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:17,700
They seem to care about each other.

2613
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:21,600
Since they had
the Pairing Book Date today,

2614
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,670
I bet they sent a message to each other
about today's date.

2615
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,340
But I'm sure it was a loaded message.

2616
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:30,370
- "I'm sorry."
- "This could be my last message." Or...

2617
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,540
it could be a message,
expressing their uncertainty.

2618
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,840
- Here's mine.
- All at once.

2619
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,210
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

2620
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:36,280
Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2621
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,520
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2622
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,150
You think Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul
texted each other?

2623
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,850
- Mine is exactly the same as hers.
- What?

2624
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:44,360
I also think there would be three couples
and we picked the same people too.

2625
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,960
- The answer is always in the clips.
- I see.

2626
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,030
That's my opinion.

2627
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:51,260
There was an important clip
among the ones we watched today.

2628
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:55,300
- Ha Neul seemed a bit upset in it.
- She was upset.

2629
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,340
- One of the talks upset her.
- Right.

2630
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:00,770
I think that could be a hint.

2631
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:02,970
So in my opinion,

2632
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,880
I do believe that
she's still very interested in Ji Min,

2633
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,510
but there must be a reason...

2634
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:10,050
- the staff included that clip.
- I agree.

2635
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:14,550
I suddenly feel so confident
because she made the same guesses.

2636
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,690
All right.

2637
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:17,220
- Let's check the answers.
- Please.

2638
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,220
Please.

2639
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,290
You're watching Heart Pairing.

2640
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:21,030
To whom did Woo Jae send the message?

2641
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:24,600
(Woo Jae wrestled with his decision
up until he sent the message.)

2642
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:26,860
I'm anxious. Please show it to us now.

2643
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,600
- These few seconds are so nerve-racking.
- I'm so nervous.

2644
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:32,040
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2645
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,900
(Woo Jae chose Je Yeon.)

2646
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,970
It's Je Yeon.

2647
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:39,540
(Woo Jae didn't have a change of heart.)

2648
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:41,550
- All right. As you all know,
- I believe in Je Yeon.

2649
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,650
- we'll check Je Yeon's decision next.
- Please.

2650
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:45,580
- To whom did Je Yeon send the message?
- Please.

2651
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:47,180
Please go to Ji Min.

2652
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:51,060
(Two men showed interest in Je Yeon.)

2653
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,660
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2654
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:56,160
(Je Yeon chose Woo Jae.)

2655
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,730
We all got it.
It was the easiest question.

2656
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:00,400
- We all got it.
- Yes.

2657
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:02,100
What about Ji Won's love line?

2658
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:05,270
He won't talk to me anymore.

2659
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:06,540
(Chang Hwan said
he wouldn't talk to her anymore.)

2660
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:07,810
Because you're too young?

2661
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:17,680
(Will Ji Won talk to him first?)

2662
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,450
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2663
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:22,750
(Ji Won chose Chang Hwan.)

2664
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,950
I knew it.

2665
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:26,090
What about Chang Hwan's love line?

2666
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,830
I was born in 1999.

2667
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:33,830
(The 15-year age gap stopped Chang Hwan.)

2668
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,430
(Will he break it through...)

2669
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:37,030
(or be blocked by it?)

2670
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,910
(Chang Hwan chose Ji Won.)

2671
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:42,340
Yes. That's how it should be.

2672
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,870
- Nice.
- Chang Hwan...

2673
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,510
messaged Ji Won.

2674
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,040
I can't wait to find out what he wrote.

2675
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,250
- His message...
- It's kind of...

2676
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,820
- I have a feeling it's heartbreaking.
- But...

2677
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,920
it could've been simple and witty.

2678
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,550
- Let's trust the experience from his age.
- Yes.

2679
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,950
Next, we'll check Chae Eun.

2680
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,020
I think it's either Chang Hwan
or Chan Hyeong.

2681
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:04,760
Chan Hyeong.

2682
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,930
Who did Chae Eun choose?

2683
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,840
(Chae Eun chose Chan Hyeong.)

2684
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:12,870
I knew it.

2685
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:16,610
- Chan Hyeong.
- Chae Eun's interested in Chan Hyeong.

2686
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,310
And...

2687
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,510
if we get more couples, I'm out.

2688
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:22,010
(Please let him be wrong.)

2689
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,180
Chan Hyeong. Please.

2690
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,390
(Ha Neul makes his heart pound
every time.)

2691
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:33,290
(Chae Eun brought him a new thrill.)

2692
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,530
Who did Chan Hyeong choose?

2693
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:37,190
Let's face the reality.

2694
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:39,560
- He has to choose Ha Neul.
- Please.

2695
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:43,470
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

2696
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,640
Yes.

2697
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,000
(Good job, Chan Hyeong.)

2698
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,710
Who did Ha Neul choose?

2699
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:54,550
(Is it her Pairing Book match
Chan Hyeong?)

2700
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:58,680
(Or Ji Min whom she shared
her heart with?)

2701
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,350
- I have a feeling it's Ji Min.
- Me too.

2702
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:07,190
(Ha Neul chose Chan Hyeong.)

2703
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,590
- Yes.
- We got it, right?

2704
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:10,260
(No way)

2705
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:12,330
- You two...
- This is so exciting.

2706
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:14,130
got it.

2707
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:16,300
(Make some noise.)

2708
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,770
Then let's find out whom Ji Min chose.

2709
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:20,970
Who did Ji Min choose?

2710
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:23,270
- It's got to be Je Yeon, right?
- Yes, it's Je Yeon.

2711
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:28,150
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2712
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:31,380
Ha Neul's heart determined
the result today.

2713
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:34,750
- I can't guess what's on their minds.
- Ha Neul is unpredictable.

2714
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,490
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2715
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:39,920
Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2716
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,360
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

2717
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:47,970
Their relationships in Italy
continue in Seoul.

2718
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:50,940
Let's find out how the atmosphere
changed in the Pairing House...

2719
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,070
after the text messages.

2720
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:56,740
(A tense night)

2721
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:00,740
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2722
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:01,980
(It feels new and joyful to see you again
in Korea.)

2723
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,580
(Let's make a lot of good memories
together.)

2724
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,150
She's contemplating.

2725
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:10,450
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min. Right.

2726
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,720
(I feel like I got to know you more.
Let's keep in touch.)

2727
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:16,230
What did Chang Hwan say?

2728
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:20,200
(An unexpected charm)

2729
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:21,530
That's neat.

2730
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:23,300
- He didn't write much. Good job.
- Good job.

2731
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,700
- Good job, Chang Hwan.
- That's good.

2732
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:26,070
He didn't include any pathetic sentences.

2733
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:27,810
That's not something he should say
via text.

2734
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:29,040
(Agreed)

2735
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:34,110
- The men's room.
- Did you all send the texts?

2736
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,210
I did.

2737
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,410
- It's quiet.
- I know.

2738
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:40,150
I still remember saying,

2739
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:42,690
"Writer, I think there's something wrong
with the text today."

2740
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,920
"Ji Min, it's already over."

2741
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:49,860
If none of us got it,

2742
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,900
- does it mean Chang Hwan got everything?
- Did he sweep everything?

2743
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,570
- He swept everything.
- That's cool.

2744
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,770
- Chang Hwan is the big boss.
- I never saw that coming.

2745
01:53:57,070 --> 01:53:58,140
Seriously.

2746
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,370
You got it.

2747
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:03,910
(I'm curious about how you look
when you draw.)

2748
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:06,040
(If I get a chance,
I'd like to visit your studio.)

2749
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:09,150
- Oh, my.
- She wants to visit his studio.

2750
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,320
Ji Min's getting a lot on his mind.

2751
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,760
(Sighing)

2752
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,500
I think I know what's on Woo Jae's mind.

2753
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,930
He's serious-minded.

2754
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:28,670
(I was glad you were the first person
I saw in Seoul.)

2755
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:29,800
It's from Ha Neul.

2756
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,940
(I was glad you were the first person
I saw in Seoul.)

2757
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,370
I better push myself.

2758
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:36,840
If I work eight hours every day,

2759
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,980
I'll lose my chance to all men here.

2760
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:41,650
I like how Ji Min is honest.

2761
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,480
- Ji Min's charming.
- Yes.

2762
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:47,580
(Chan Hyeong's phone rings again.)

2763
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:49,750
It won't be easy to maintain it every day.

2764
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:52,860
- To do that every day.
- Chae Eun's interested in Chan Hyeong.

2765
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:55,760
I used all my vacation days
to go to Italy.

2766
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,630
- You used your vacation days for Italy?
- Yes.

2767
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,230
- He's down to earth.
- Yes.

2768
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:02,100
(Ji Min got the feeling
that he didn't get any texts.)

2769
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:22,750
(0 vacation days and texts)

2770
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:24,120
It's a depressing night for Ji Min.

2771
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,290
(Keep talking to me a lot as usual.)

2772
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,330
"Keep talking to me a lot as usual."

2773
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,230
Thank you, Ji Won.

2774
01:55:35,230 --> 01:55:37,770
- Ji Won.
- That's really appealing.

2775
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:40,740
(Keep talking to me a lot as usual.)

2776
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:54,950
(Everyone was more fluttered than usual.)

2777
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,790
(Their first night
in Seoul Pairing House draws.)

2778
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:03,030
I'd lose a lot of weight here.

2779
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:06,060
Yes, but I'm eating a lot.

2780
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,830
- Are you? Good job.
- I'm eating a lot.

2781
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:10,470
How am I going to get there tomorrow?

2782
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,970
(Ji Won and Je Yeon's last task is
to do the laundry.)

2783
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:17,040
(Whirring)

2784
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,010
(The residents wrap up in their own ways.)

2785
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,040
Done.

2786
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,050
It's cooking.

2787
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:24,050
What? He's really cooking.

2788
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,190
Your laundry basket.

2789
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:31,760
I forgot. I'm so clumsy.

2790
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,600
Look. The stain is all gone.

2791
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,700
You're right.

2792
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,700
It's neat. It smells nice.

2793
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:46,800
I have sensitive skin,
and this is nice and mild.

2794
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:51,210
(It's been two days
since they returned to their lives.)

2795
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:53,310
(Don't keep a distance from me...)

2796
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,780
(because of the age gap.)

2797
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:58,020
(The reality turned out to be crueler
than expected.)

2798
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,780
(I should...)

2799
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:03,050
(take a step back first.)

2800
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,420
(Do you want to go out together tomorrow?)

2801
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:05,860
(Yes)

2802
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:08,090
(I can't wait to see your studio.)

2803
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:09,630
I'll soon invite you.

2804
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:12,230
Today? The real estate?

2805
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:13,860
That's not my field of expertise.

2806
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:27,710
What's this? A contract relationship?

2807
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:29,250
How does that make sense?

2808
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:30,850
- I'll be someone's boyfriend.
- Yes.

2809
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,020
We'll be each other's date.

2810
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:35,090
I thought I should make myself clear.

2811
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,220
Did they go on a date?

2812
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:38,360
Already?

2813
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,320
This is no time for me to be cooking.

2814
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,290
I thought I should do my best...

2815
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,990
to leave no regrets.

2816
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,300
I thought you called me.

2817
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,700
I'm leaving.

2818
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:51,500
Okay. I thought you called me.

2819
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:54,570
I know it won't work out
between me and Je Yeon.

2820
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,710
You should still try.

2821
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:05,480
If I was one of your candidates,

2822
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:10,050
let's go on a contract relationship.

2823
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,960
Are you sleeping?

2824
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:17,244
