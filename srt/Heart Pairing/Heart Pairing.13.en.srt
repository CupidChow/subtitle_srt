1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,200
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,670
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,740
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,240
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,310
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,580
(An all-around youngest member, Mimi)

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,980
(Heart Pairing starts energetically!)

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,020
Last week, with postcards from Italy,

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,150
Chang Hwan and Ji Won,

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,450
Woo Jae and Je Yeon,

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,060
and Ji Min and Ha Neul had a pairing date.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,530
The postcard
created a huge butterfly effect.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,660
I personally supported
Chang Hwan and Ji Won as a couple.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,130
- Chang Hwan and Ji Won.
- I waited to see Chang Hwan and Ji Won...

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,200
go on a date.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Chang Hwan explained
why he couldn't get close to Ji Won,

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,340
and that made me feel sad.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,780
That was a feeling
I hadn't seen in a long time.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,940
- That feeling.
- Exactly.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,110
He loved her,

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,410
but he thought it would be hard
for Ji Won if he took the initiative.

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,380
So he cut loose with her out of worry.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,750
- They needed that conversation for sure.
- Definitely.

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,050
All of us have been waiting to see it...

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,020
and wondered why they wouldn't resolve
a misunderstanding.

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,860
How Chang Hwan felt...

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
- is the emotion of men in ballad songs.
- Really?

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,900
"I love you, but I will let you go."

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,530
- Goodness.
- That kind of feeling.

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,400
- Wasn't it in your second album?
- Right.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,070
"For you, I will let you go."

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,100
And he pretends he's cold.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,140
(A main character
of Yoon Jong Shin's ballad song)

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,710
(Emotional)

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,340
And like a dream,

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,780
Woo Jae and Je Yeon met again.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,210
- Their feeling back then...
- Right.

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,510
- were looked back on.
- Yes.

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,650
Je Yeon...

40
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,950
- has a very neat personality.
- Right.

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,450
After a few dates...

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,720
and after a few conversations,

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,860
she found out that Woo Jae...

44
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,560
- and she didn't click.
- They didn't click.

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,260
She was attracted to him at first,

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,560
but she got herself sorted clearly.

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
- Right.
- Right.

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
"We made a good memory..."

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,130
- "back then."
- Right.

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,230
- They were just looking back.
- Right.

51
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,070
- They didn't show any lingering feelings.
- No.

52
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,370
They don't have any lingering feelings
at all.

53
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,570
They finished their relationship neatly.

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,940
And there's another couple.

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,110
- Ha Neul and Ji Min.
- He Neul and Ji Min.

56
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,910
As expected, Ha Neul went straight for it.

57
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,740
It had been quite a while,
but she didn't give up.

58
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,750
- Right.
- Exactly.

59
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,250
The biggest butterfly effect from Italy...

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,620
is that Ji Min, Ha Neul,

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,820
and Je Yeon formed a love triangle.

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,290
When they returned home,

63
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,160
the atmosphere was quite strange.

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,060
For Ji Min, Je Yeon seemed...

65
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,930
to have stronger emotions than I thought.

66
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,030
From now on, the emotional impact
might become more significant.

67
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,970
I'm both worried and excited.

68
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,200
(Ready to see it)

69
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,610
(Jealous Christmas)

70
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,870
We're close.

71
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,710
Thank you for the food.

72
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,410
- Sure.
- Thank you.

73
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,450
You already had it?

74
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,980
I guess she ate it in a hurry.

75
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,490
That looks amazing.

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,350
It has a strawberry inside.

77
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,890
The strawberry mochi looks good.

78
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,190
- It was so good that I was knocked out.
- Let's put it here like this.

79
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,760
- A knockout taste?
- A knockout taste.

80
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,330
It looks good.

81
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,630
Where do you find out about this?

82
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,530
Look at this. It's amazing, isn't it?

83
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,800
If I stick to Chae Eun, I won't starve.

84
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,070
Of course not. I give good food only.

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,970
She's a good cook...

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,010
and brings nice food
when she comes home from work.

87
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,110
The best.

88
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,480
The best mom.

89
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,910
Gosh, you're setting boundaries.

90
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,850
No. I mean to her children.

91
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,590
"To her children."

92
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,690
That was a wonderful interpretation.

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,120
You hit and run,
and made them fight each other.

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,590
She's being weird right now.

95
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,730
- Am I?
- You're being strange.

96
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,400
No, she's right.

97
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
She explained it in a strange way.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,270
My explanation was so right.

99
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,930
A man dearly wants to meet a guy
who's like his mom.

100
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,200
"A guy who's like his mom?"

101
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,340
No.

102
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,470
You regard me as a guy?

103
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,810
He sees me as a guy.

104
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,510
Oh, my.

105
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,350
He's been caught.
He revealed what he really thinks.

106
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,620
- Chae Eun, shall I cut all of these?
- Yes, let's do that.

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll cut them.

108
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,580
- Was it clearly different...
- Yes.

109
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,590
from the other one?

110
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,620
- Yes.
- I see.

111
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,360
I brought a cheesecake too.

112
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,460
Who wants to compliment me?

113
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,560
You did a good job. It looks so good.

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,730
- Yes.
- Is this matcha?

115
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,960
- It looks good.
- It should be good.

116
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,300
- We need forks.
- It's a Basque cheesecake.

117
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,860
I'm holding it.

118
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,930
Do you feel comfortable?

119
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,100
Yes.

120
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,330
I feel very comfortable.

121
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,000
Would you like to have tea or warm water?

122
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,440
I want tea. Do you have it?

123
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,980
- Tea?
- Yes.

124
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,880
We have a yellow one,
a purple one, a blue one,

125
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,280
- Is this all right?
- and a gray one.

126
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,480
I'll have the yellow one.

127
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,120
Hold the rim.

128
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,560
And Sang Yun brought this.

129
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,790
Great.

130
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,430
Please tell us about today's pairing.

131
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,030
Right. I'm curious.

132
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,630
(The couples paired by postcards...)

133
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,800
(suddenly become silent.)

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,300
Why is everyone silent?

135
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,810
How was it, everyone?

136
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,610
I met Je Yeon.

137
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,310
It'd been several weeks
since our last date.

138
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,680
So what did you do today?

139
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,550
We talked over coffee.

140
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,750
- Was that all?
- Yes.

141
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,590
We had written the postcards back then,

142
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,520
so we used honorifics and all.

143
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,890
Seeing it again reminded me
of the memories from that time.

144
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,490
So we talked about those things.

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,590
How was it?

146
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,360
- It was like what you said.
- It was, right?

147
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,170
"It was like what you said."

148
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,700
(She didn't expect the sudden question.)

149
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,370
- I surprised you, didn't I?
- What?

150
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,470
- I surprised you.
- I didn't expect you to throw that to me.

151
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,180
That was mean.

152
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,740
"That was mean."

153
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,180
It was like what he said.

154
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,050
- Ji Won and I were paired.
- I was paired with Chang Hwan.

155
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,990
Back then, we were close,

156
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,960
and we kept meeting by coincidence.

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,130
It amazed me,

158
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,660
and we had a good time together.

159
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,530
- The date brought back memories.
- Right.

160
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,840
Just like what I said
when I was with the men here...

161
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,540
I said that I wanted to have
a chance to meet Ji Won...

162
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,910
and speak frankly about what happened...

163
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,910
and that I will get a chance to do so.

164
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,320
I thought it would be today or tomorrow,

165
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
and we got a chance today.

166
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,660
So we talked a lot,

167
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,700
and we talked about
everything we thought about.

168
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,530
I liked it so much.

169
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Right.

170
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,870
There was a misunderstanding.

171
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,310
What misunderstanding?

172
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,780
That's between us.

173
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,450
That's what it is.

174
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,250
(Bothered)

175
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,320
What about you, Ji Won?

176
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,490
Me?

177
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Was it like what he said?

178
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,030
- It was like what he said.
- It was like what he said.

179
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,890
(Answering on behalf of her)

180
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,060
- He ended the conversation.
- What?

181
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,370
- Did he end the conversation?
- He blocked it like a goalkeeper.

182
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,930
He answered on behalf of Ji Won.

183
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,440
"Stop talking about it."

184
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,140
- He's awesome.
- Ji Won is happy.

185
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,010
(Glancing)

186
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,680
(Bitter)

187
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,550
After we...

188
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,120
came back to Seoul,
I felt that Chang Hwan and I...

189
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,120
didn't get a chance to talk,

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,030
but we had a chance today.

191
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,860
So as Chang Hwan said,

192
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,000
we talked about many things,
starting from what we liked in Italy.

193
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,300
I wanted to talk to him
after coming back to Seoul,

194
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,770
and it was nice to do so today.

195
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,080
We had a good time.

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,820
This is what we said. Back then,
each of us made the best choice.

197
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,120
Even if I had to go back,
if I didn't have her detailed information,

198
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,690
I would have made the same choice.

199
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,590
First, we felt...

200
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,730
that we were similar.
That's why we chose each other.

201
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,000
When he talks,

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
there are moments
when he smiles in a foolish manner.

203
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,100
It's Ji Two.

204
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,940
To every word I say,

205
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,610
he pays attention, and I feel that
he's a very delicate person.

206
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,080
I sometimes crave it.

207
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,180
(They like the same movie
and the same food.)

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,850
On the postcard, I wrote,

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,290
"Regardless of your age and occupation,"

210
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,260
"I was glad that I could get to know you,
Chang Hwan, as a person."

211
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,490
That was what I wrote.

212
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,260
I find that Chang Hwan...

213
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,900
is a good person,
the more I get to know him.

214
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,040
Back then, it felt warm...

215
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,140
and nice.

216
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,040
We...

217
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,250
(Smiling)

218
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,950
We just...

219
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,490
were reminded...

220
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,790
of our choices back then.

221
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
Ji Min told me...

222
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,300
that he had sent his postcard to Ha Neul.

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,100
Surely,
I paid attention to the look on his face.

224
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,740
We looked back on...

225
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,950
what thoughts and feelings...

226
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,680
made us write the postcards back then.

227
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,850
It felt like we went back to that moment.

228
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,520
And after that,

229
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,960
the new life here felt different.

230
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,700
We talked about that too.

231
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
(Glancing)

232
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,670
It was like what he said.

233
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,240
So everyone just had coffee?

234
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,270
I had to meet her after work.

235
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,470
Yes, we met late.

236
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes, around 8:30 p.m.

237
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
Yes, I was done at 8 p.m.

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,810
What did you have?

239
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,480
- It was in Seongsu.
- Seongsu?

240
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,150
Yes. It was a beautiful restaurant.

241
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,650
So I saved the place.

242
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,590
- Was the food also good?
- Yes. The food was good too.

243
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,820
- Tell me later.
- I will. The place was really pretty.

244
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,230
Right. Back then,

245
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,300
I was actually a bit surprised.

246
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,730
I was surprised like, "What?"

247
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,470
I suddenly got jealous somehow.

248
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,780
We had a glass of wine over dinner.

249
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,810
- Did you drink wine?
- Yes.

250
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,380
- Do you want it?
- No.

251
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,720
- You look so jealous.
- I was just responding.

252
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,820
- You were responding. I see.
- That's so funny.

253
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,260
Maybe it's because
I'm with many other people,

254
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,660
but even if I don't feel good,

255
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,490
I tend to hide it.

256
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,130
However, I couldn't hide it back then.

257
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,500
However, writing in honorifics...

258
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,010
- That was funny.
- made me cringe a little...

259
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,310
- and think about how I was back then.
- That was the sentiment then.

260
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,610
- Yes, at that time.
- Right.

261
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,250
And next to her, Ji Min kept talking.

262
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,780
And I could listen to
what the other person said back then.

263
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,850
- Right.
- Yes.

264
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,050
It was fun.

265
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,590
(Agitated)

266
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,000
Frankly,
I think I did the same thing to Ji Min.

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
I could understand it in my head,

268
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,470
however...

269
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,470
First, the whiskey.

270
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,510
Who wants to drink it?

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,410
Just a little bit.

272
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,280
- Is it okay?
- I'll just taste it.

273
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,310
Woo Jae!

274
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,780
- Good work today.
- What? Is Je Yeon drinking too?

275
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,450
Cheers.

276
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,650
- Of course.
- The two of you are being brave.

277
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,590
You might find it's the 25th
when you open your eyes again.

278
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,160
It might be the end of our show.

279
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,390
It might be the 26th.

280
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,330
Right.
You might have to make the final decision.

281
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,860
Je Yeon should have the ice only.

282
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,200
- Only the ice?
- Only the ice.

283
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,170
I can drink a little bit.

284
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,440
Merry Christmas.

285
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,110
What will happen?

286
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,270
I can't wait.

287
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,270
(Please show me what happened after that.)

288
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
We got a text message.

289
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,460
(Who are the two people
you want to be with this Christmas Eve?)

290
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,490
What?

291
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,430
- Gosh.
- What?

292
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,100
Does it mean tomorrow?

293
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,400
(Will the residents be able to spend
Christmas with people they want?)

294
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,340
Christmas is my favorite day,

295
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,610
(Glancing)

296
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,580
so I was excited.

297
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,620
I thought I wasn't brave enough,

298
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,080
so this time,

299
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,790
I wanted to say what I felt...

300
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,760
because it was Christmas.

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,910
I wrote Je Yeon's name, of course,
in one second.

302
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,440
When I was selecting the next one...

303
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,180
This isn't easy.

304
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,680
I couldn't decide.

305
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,940
- We have to pick two people again.
- Yes.

306
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,540
- I've decided on one person,
- Yes?

307
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,440
but I can't decide on the other one.
Isn't it the same with you?

308
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,380
If I can meet him again on Christmas,

309
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,580
my mind will be made up for certain.

310
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,480
Where do you want to go?

311
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,020
Tomorrow?
With whom I go will matter more, I think.

312
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,390
We never know what will happen
until the last moment.

313
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,720
- That's right.
- Yes.

314
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,830
You never know what will happen here
when you're away.

315
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,890
Exactly.

316
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,000
(Lee Chan Hyeong, Lee Sang Yun)

317
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,670
(Chae Eun is the first one
to send the text message.)

318
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,540
(Ahn Ji Min, Park Chang Hwan)

319
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,710
(Soo Ah sent the text message second.)

320
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,250
(Hidden rule: Between the 2 names,
the one sent 1st will be selected.)

321
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,920
(Ahn Ji Min, Lee Sang Yun)

322
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,450
- Did everyone send it already?
- Yes.

323
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,450
(Ahn Ji Min, Lee Chan Hyeong)

324
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,220
(Shin Woo Jae, Lee Chan Hyeong)

325
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
(A lot on his mind)

326
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,400
We're doing this every day.

327
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
(Bothered)

328
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,500
We're sending a text message every night.

329
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,700
(After a lot of thinking, Ji Min...)

330
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,240
(sent the text message last.)

331
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,440
(What will this Christmas mean
to the residents?)

332
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,180
(The long-awaited...)

333
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,120
(Christmas Eve comes.)

334
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,020
(It makes them feel nervous somehow.)

335
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,720
What do you want to do today?

336
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,390
- Me?
- Yes.

337
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,190
I think the person I'm with matters.

338
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,330
- The person I'll spend today with.
- Right.

339
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,900
(Removing)

340
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,330
(Doing his best getting ready)

341
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,770
How should I dress today?

342
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,940
(Trying to look the best he can)

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,150
(Putting in more effort to look nice)

344
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,190
(Rolling)

345
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,560
(Changing the tool)

346
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,190
(Trying to sync it to the mobile app)

347
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,030
(Bouncy curls)

348
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,830
(Waking up)

349
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,100
Your outfit is Christmas-themed.

350
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,400
Now, I'm wondering if it's too red.

351
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,870
(Looking pretty)

352
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,410
- Ha Neul, you look gorgeous.
- Should I wear it on Christmas?

353
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,780
I might pass out. You look stunning.

354
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,650
I was looking for the brush. Here it is.

355
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,280
(They get ready for their date
in their own way.)

356
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,490
Soo Ah, try this later.

357
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,290
- Yes, I'll make sure to try it.
- Yes. This is nice.

358
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,890
(Will they be able to go on a date
with the person of their choice?)

359
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,170
(The first date on Christmas Eve...)

360
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,700
(goes to Chae Eun.)

361
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,240
(Nervous)

362
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,640
(Who will spend the day with Chae Eun?)

363
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,040
- Who is it?
- I wonder who it is.

364
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,810
Hello.

365
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,810
- Hello, Chan Hyeong.
- It's Chan Hyeong.

366
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,050
Hello.

367
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,980
I bet you were expecting to see me. Right?

368
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,120
- Gosh, they picked each other.
- Yes.

369
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,180
Of course.

370
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,490
You look great.

371
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,520
- Right?
- Yes.

372
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,390
- I had a good night's sleep.
- That's great.

373
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,420
(Checking on Chan Hyeong's condition
before going)

374
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,890
I had a good night's sleep.

375
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,260
That's so cute!
"I had a good night's sleep."

376
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,000
- He's acting cute.
- Chan Hyeong.

377
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,630
He can only act cute like that
when he feels safe enough to know...

378
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,770
that she truly likes him.

379
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,770
- Right.
- Yes.

380
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,970
- He must feel, "I'm being loved."
- Right.

381
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,010
Exactly.

382
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,510
- She can't look away from him.
- Guess what? We're going to the sea.

383
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,910
- Really?
- Yes.

384
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,250
- Really?
- Yes.

385
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,950
- It'll take 3 hours.
- It'll take 3 hours and 20 minutes?

386
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,280
It will take three hours.

387
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,080
About 3 hours and 2 minutes.

388
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,750
You know what?
We should switch halfway through.

389
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,990
- I don't want to.
- No.

390
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,320
No.

391
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,160
- Or I'll drive on our way back.
- No.

392
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,330
I want to show you that I can drive.

393
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,190
No.

394
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
I don't want to see you drive.

395
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,300
Oh, my.

396
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,900
- You'll be so tired.
- No, I had a good night's sleep.

397
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,400
This is great.
It feels like we're going on a trip.

398
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm genuinely excited today.

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,410
- My gosh.
- What am I going to do?

400
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,970
- She's so happy with him.
- Right.

401
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,580
Tell me about your meeting
with your sister.

402
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,710
- Her twin sister.
- Her older sister.

403
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,150
There's one thing my sister looks for
in my future husband.

404
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,820
This is one of the important qualities
my sister seeks in my future husband.

405
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
Okay.

406
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,190
Someone who can understand
the relationship between her and me.

407
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,620
Right. That's so important.

408
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,260
Sometimes, people think our relationship
goes beyond interesting.

409
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,760
- They think it's a bit too much.
- Right.

410
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,430
They might think
our relationship is a bit excessive.

411
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,430
My sister has been...

412
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,500
- in all of my life experiences.
- Right.

413
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,470
When I learned a lot of life lessons,

414
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,870
my sister was there with me.

415
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,840
I spent most of my life
with my brother too.

416
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,380
I thought it would be great
if my boyfriend could understand...

417
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,410
this side of my relationship...

418
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,220
- and get along with her too.
- Right.

419
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,450
- My sister...
- I have a similar thing with my brother.

420
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,920
- Right. I like that.
- So...

421
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,520
- Right. They must see eye to eye on that.
- Yes.

422
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,220
Sharing a similar family background...

423
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,260
- really matters in relationships.
- Right. It's important.

424
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,330
(Another important factor
that could make the relationship work)

425
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,690
She calls you Eun?

426
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,200
- Yes. Eun.
- Eun from Chae Eun?

427
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,500
(All of a sudden, his phone rings.)

428
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,470
Hello.

429
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,940
Hello, sir. Oh, you're out.

430
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,740
- It's a CEO moment.
- We received an email.

431
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,770
- Yes.
- So...

432
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,270
- I'm also out now.
- Did you check it?

433
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,910
- I was wondering if you were at work.
- I see.

434
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,950
I'm driving out to see the East Sea.

435
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,850
- So...
- I see. I got it.

436
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,350
(The CEO is done with the work call.)

438
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,220
Look at the sea.

439
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,190
- Look. It's the East Sea.
- It's beautiful.

440
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,290
(They arrive at the East Sea in no time.)

441
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,390
(Fresh Coastal Trail)

442
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,430
Goseong.

443
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,830
Going to the beach...

444
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,700
on Christmas Eve is so romantic.

445
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,730
(The East Sea unfolds before them.)

446
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,370
- It's so beautiful.
- It's picturesque.

447
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,470
That's a beautiful color.

448
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,340
- What a beautiful shade of turquoise.
- The color looks beautiful, right?

449
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
- Right?
- Yes.

450
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,440
It's so beautiful. The sun is setting now.

451
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,680
The rainbow colors on the horizon
look beautiful.

452
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,080
- Yes.
- Gosh, they make a great couple.

453
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,650
It looks like a painting.

454
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,720
The one in my book?

455
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,290
- Right. That's it.
- In my book, right?

456
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,990
- In my book?
- Have you been here before?

457
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,520
- No.
- How did you know we'd be here?

458
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,020
Did you have foresight?

459
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,660
I remember that drawing. Chae Eun drew it.

460
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,500
You pictured us standing here together.

461
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,430
- Right. We were walking here.
- That's what you drew, right?

462
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,970
My gosh, they make such a cute couple.

463
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,640
- Are you sure you can get closer?
- I like doing that.

464
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
- Really?
- A challenge to make a lap...

465
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,370
when the waves roll back.

466
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,180
If our clothes get wet,
we'll head back tomorrow then.

467
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Really?

468
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,380
(He rushes over with an ulterior motive.)

469
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,210
But the sand will get in your shoes!

470
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,320
How beautiful. It's like a painting.

471
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,850
It's so beautiful.

472
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,890
(The waves ambush them.)

473
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,460
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

474
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,960
You didn't get wet, right?
But it was close, right?

475
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,400
- You were so agile, Chan Hyeong.
- My gosh. Right.

476
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,130
I was so startled. I'm serious.

477
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
You almost...

478
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,370
You were like a mommy bird
snatching a baby bird.

479
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,610
- They make a good couple.
- Yes.

480
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,740
Even their outfits match.

481
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,340
- So I have this dream.
- Okay.

482
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,610
I want to get a house...

483
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,010
- by the beach.
- Yes?

484
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,950
- I can set it up like a vacation home.
- That sounds so good.

485
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
- Was it scuba diving?
- Yes.

486
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,720
I'll get the equipment.

487
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,620
I'd also live a life full of dreams.

488
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,660
- That sounds lovely.
- Yes.

489
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,090
People always ask...

490
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,900
if sharing the same hobbies
is important...

491
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
- in relationships.
- Yes.

492
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,500
But personally, I prefer people
who can embrace differences...

493
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,100
- to people whom I share hobbies with.
- Right.

494
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,800
So I don't think
sharing the same hobbies isn't imperative.

495
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,340
To be honest, it brings me more happiness
as long as I can enjoy...

496
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,810
my significant other's hobbies.

497
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,710
It gives me a chance
to experience more things.

498
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,380
Maybe, people are able
to do all that for one another...

499
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,720
because they're in love.

500
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
- Right.
- What a sweet way to put it.

501
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,220
- The view looks amazing.
- One, two, three.

502
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,450
They look beautiful together.

503
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,620
One more. One, two, three.

504
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,860
(They make memories together
on Christmas Eve.)

505
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,790
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun
were at the East Sea.)

506
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,500
- How beautiful.
- They look great together.

507
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,170
Are there pretty shells?
Something to take as a souvenir?

508
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,400
Both of them are innocent like children.

509
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,840
Yes. They're pure-hearted.

510
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,670
This one is pretty too. Look.

511
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,710
(They commemorate their moment together.)

512
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,080
The day felt so short.

513
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,140
- Right. It's so sad.
- It felt so short.

514
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,210
- Look. The sun is already setting.
- Yes.

515
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,180
I love them.
We can take them as souvenirs.

516
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes.

517
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,790
I think the sand got in my shoes.

518
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,060
Chan Hyeong, it would be odd if it didn't.

519
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,760
Remember how you ran all over the beach?

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
It would be strange if it didn't.

521
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,200
This is so nice. I love it.

522
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,170
We're at a sashimi restaurant. Oh, my.

523
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,510
We're at a sashimi restaurant.

524
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,510
(A sashimi restaurant
in Goseong-gun, Gangwon Province)

525
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,610
- Do you think you can eat a lot?
- Yes.

526
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,280
I like it.

527
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
She's cute.

528
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

529
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,280
(A full spread of food
is laid out on their table.)

530
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,190
Here you go.

531
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,720
Thank you.

532
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,120
(Squeezing out the chogochujang,
preparing the chopsticks)

533
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,220
(Is he also preparing the fish?)

534
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,990
You're so good at deboning the fish.

535
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,890
(Is he also preparing the fish?)

536
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,000
How are you so good at removing the bones?

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
- This is my area of expertise.
- Really?

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,630
There are some tiny bones here.

539
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,340
- He's a doctor, after all.
- Right. His surgery skills are great.

540
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,170
I've never seen a guy remove bones
as thoroughly as this.

541
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,340
- Really?
- Yes.

542
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,810
You're super thorough.

543
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,880
(Focused)

544
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,780
This is amazing.

545
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,080
They're like a real couple.

546
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,290
My gosh.
We might hear good news from them.

547
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,360
You made it look so pretty.
It's too pretty to eat this now.

548
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,420
What?

549
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,690
I did it so you could eat it.

550
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,790
(Munching)

551
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,660
(Humming)

552
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
(Finding her cute)

553
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,670
This is so good.

554
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,210
Seriously. It's so good.

555
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,740
(A tasty meal
shared with the perfect company)

556
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,280
It's so chewy, right?

557
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
(Cheers.)

558
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,980
Gosh, I love it.

559
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,120
- It's Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas.
- Yes.

560
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,090
Merry Christmas.

561
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,890
How romantic.

562
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
Did they put honey in this?
It tastes so good.

563
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,560
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

564
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,640
(Happily celebrating Christmas in advance)

565
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,510
(A cafe overlooking the ocean,
Goseong-gun, Gangwon Province)

566
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,080
Is there a type of woman
your brother or family wants?

567
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,010
- For your future wife.
- For my future wife?

568
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,350
I'm curious.

569
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,510
(Pondering)

570
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,280
Yes, there is. A wise woman.

571
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,650
My parents especially don't care
about appearances.

572
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,290
That's fair, you know?
Appearances aren't important.

573
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,230
But it's not possible for men
to ignore appearances, is it?

574
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,690
Who said I did?

575
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,260
(Smiling)

576
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,700
- I love it.
- I never did.

577
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,730
Really?

578
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,470
That was a misunderstanding on my part.

579
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,130
It's true that
we can't ignore appearances.

580
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,770
Well, it must be the same for you.

581
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,740
I don't think
you're disregarding appearances, right?

582
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,380
- I can't ignore them completely.
- Right.

583
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,440
That's not possible.

584
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,750
And you decided to care more
about men's height.

585
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,950
Height is so important.

586
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,150
My ideal type is a tall guy now.

587
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,450
(Thanks to him,
her ideal type changed recently.)

588
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,260
I've said it many times.
Height is so important.

589
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,230
Why are you laughing?

590
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,830
This is fun. I'm just happy.

591
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,830
You're so fun to talk to.

592
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,500
So I'm happy about that.

593
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,070
They look so happy together.

594
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,140
(Even a silly joke can make them laugh.)

595
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,110
Recently,
I didn't expect to find someone...

596
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,940
I would be able to connect with
this deeply.

597
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,380
- This is surreal for me too.
- That's true.

598
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Yes.

599
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,220
(The two of them are
on the same wavelength.)

600
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
This is interesting.

601
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,490
(The two of them are
on the same wavelength.)

602
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,960
(Feeling all warm and fuzzy inside)

603
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,390
There are no conflicts with them.

604
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,560
(An innocent, conflict-free couple)

605
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,760
We got to see Chan Hyeong's cute act,
which we had never seen before.

606
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,060
- Right. "No."
- Right.

607
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,100
"No."

608
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,130
He removed every single bone in the fish.

609
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,740
- Right.
- He operated on the fish.

610
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,070
He's sweet and kind.

611
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,100
Do you do that for your wife?

612
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,870
She can manage well on her own.

613
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,170
- Really?
- She grew up by the ocean.

614
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,240
- I see. Okay.
- Yes.

615
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,440
- She grew up around the ocean.
- Yes.

616
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,210
- She grew up by the ocean in Gunsan.
- I see. Okay.

617
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,720
(A sunny and clear day)

618
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,280
(Fine Dust Level: Good)

619
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,690
(The woman on her way to a date is...)

620
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,690
- It's Ji Won.
- Ji Won.

621
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,790
(Ji Won.)

622
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,530
(And...)

623
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,900
(a man sets out to see Ji Won.)

624
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,870
(Peeking)

625
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,940
(With whom will Ji Won go on a date?)

626
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,580
(Smiling)

627
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,380
It's Woo Jae.

628
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,780
- They're a good-looking couple too.
- Totally.

629
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,950
(Waving)

630
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,050
Hello.

631
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,350
Woo Jae.

632
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,620
(Eyes fixed on him)

633
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,630
This is nice.

634
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,960
How nice.

635
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,360
- They started to resemble one another.
- Yes.

636
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,560
(She can't hide her smile.)

637
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,730
This is so nice.

638
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,200
Ji Won can't stop smiling.

639
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,770
I was talking to Ji Min this morning.

640
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,470
I kept saying,
"I want a date with Ji Won."

641
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,480
Me too. I was in my bed this morning.

642
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,050
"I hope my date is with Woo Jae."

643
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,820
That's what I said.

644
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,490
Thanks to this date,
we'll get to go to the East Sea today.

645
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,520
Right.

646
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,790
Let's have fun today.

647
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,160
- Sounds good.
- They're all going to the East Sea.

648
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,190
Great.

649
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,330
(The first long-distance date
for Woo Jae and Ji Won)

650
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,390
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm okay.

651
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,760
Did you also skip your meal?

652
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,260
I peeled and packed an apple.

653
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,370
- Really?
- Yes.

654
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,570
(He prepared the apple
early in the morning.)

655
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,900
You were going to pack it?

656
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,040
To have it in the car.

657
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,010
- Thank you so much.
- I brought a camera too.

658
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,210
My gosh.

659
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,920
- Is it too big?
- Well, look at them now.

660
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,950
- That was smooth.
- Is it okay?

661
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,190
(Seeing Your Ocean
for the First Time Today)

662
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,500
All my life,

663
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,270
- I've always had a dream.
- I see.

664
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,300
But when I quit soccer,

665
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,910
for the first time in my life,
I had lost my dream. Or something...

666
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,140
I wanted to achieve.

667
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,810
I had never felt that kind of loss.

668
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,910
But...

669
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,980
when I quit soccer,

670
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,350
- the worst feeling I had was...
- Yes?

671
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,520
letting my parents down.

672
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,520
When I quit...

673
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,060
I mean, when I played soccer,

674
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,560
- Yes?
- they knew that I worked hard.

675
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,660
My parents always came to watch me play.

676
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,630
They were supportive.

677
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,370
My dad had never said anything
like this before.

678
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,100
But around the time I quit soccer,

679
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,710
he said...

680
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,080
Well,

681
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,380
he told me it was tough on him.

682
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,850
Hearing that broke my heart.

683
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,050
He said, "That was tough for me too."

684
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,390
"But you should follow your heart."

685
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,620
"Your happiness is more important to me."
That's what he told me.

686
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,700
For the first time,
he and I had a heart-to-heart talk.

687
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,800
When I heard that, I felt so sorry...

688
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,300
and grateful at the same time.

689
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,100
I see.

690
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, anyway...

691
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,710
- This is just me.
- Yes.

692
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,280
- But I'm sure it's the same with you.
- Yes.

693
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,550
- My parents are the best. Yes.
- Right.

694
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,580
I had a similar experience.

695
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,920
I did too.

696
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,050
Actually,

697
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,790
it costs a lot of money
to train someone to be a dancer.

698
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,590
Seriously.
I'm sure it's the same with fine art.

699
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,460
- Art and sports are expensive.
- That's how it is with art and sports.

700
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,730
But it was so expensive. Seriously.

701
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,330
Putting on one performance...

702
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,300
I mean,
I participated in competitions and so on.

703
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,670
- And it cost a fortune.
- Yes.

704
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,570
My parents have always been this way.

705
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,810
- They're always up for giving advice.
- Yes?

706
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,180
But they always let us...

707
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,750
- make the final decision.
- I see.

708
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,680
My older sister's major used to be...

709
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,450
- hotel management.
- I see.

710
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,790
To get a degree in hotel management,
she had to go abroad to study.

711
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,860
When I was training to be a dancer,

712
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,760
she was preparing to go abroad.

713
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,060
Our timeline overlapped.

714
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
So my parents had to spend
a lot of money...

715
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,370
- on both of our education.
- I bet.

716
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,800
- Later on, my sister came back to Korea.
- Yes.

717
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,870
- And I stopped dancing by then.
- Okay.

718
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,750
After some time passed,
we went on a trip and had a beer together.

719
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,180
And my parents told us that...

720
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,620
back then when we were in school,

721
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,220
they took a huge financial hit.

722
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,150
- They said it was tough back then.
- Of course.

723
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,560
- Right.
- But they didn't let us know that.

724
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,690
- They couldn't. Of course not.
- They didn't.

725
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,830
After hearing that,
I realized how hard it had been on them.

726
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,860
Right.

727
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,700
I was grateful too.

728
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,440
I used to do traditional Korean dance
up until middle school.

729
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,310
When I trained to participate
in competitions and so on,

730
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,950
my passion for dance started to go away.

731
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,080
I thought that I should keep dancing
only as a hobby.

732
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,950
Back in high school,
I sat next to the top student in my class.

733
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,750
So I learned a lot
while observing my seatmate.

734
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,860
Back then, I liked math and science.

735
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,490
I learned how to study.

736
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,260
Getting a job at Samsung Electronics was
my goal the whole time I was in college.

737
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,660
So I remember working really hard
to get a job there.

738
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,400
I often talked to my dad on the phone.

739
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
In the beginning, I didn't have a phone.

740
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
I had to ride a bicycle
to the downtown area.

741
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,140
There was a place I could make
international calls with some coins.

742
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,510
I exchanged the euro banknotes for coins.

743
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,180
I had a lot of coins prepared
and called my dad.

744
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,280
I cried a lot after the call ended.

745
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,360
So I must be good to my parents.

746
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,100
I could relate a lot
to his life experiences.

747
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,360
That made me like him more.

748
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,300
These moments we shared together...

749
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,870
fascinated me.

750
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,140
- This looks good.
- Gosh.

751
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,900
(They unexpectedly found
something in common.)

752
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,780
Is it good?

753
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,610
- It's good.
- It's good.

754
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,780
It's already beautiful.

755
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,050
The weather was great.

756
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,520
- It's so beautiful.
- It's amazing.

757
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,990
- It sort of reminds me of Jeju.
- Yes?

758
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,090
- Yes.
- Right?

759
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,260
It's beautiful.

760
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,630
- The waves are strong, right?
- Yes.

761
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,630
But the waves are making
the view even prettier.

762
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,170
This beach has a different vibe
from the one we saw earlier.

763
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Look at the colors of the sky.
The colors are changing.

764
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,770
It's so beautiful.

765
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,640
It's the blue sea, your favorite.

766
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,710
But I also like the colors
of the sunset such as these.

767
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,950
So I always observe sunsets.

768
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,150
I observe the colors.

769
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,320
That's why when I paint,

770
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,390
I often include colors like these.

771
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,090
The colors of the sunset or the sky.

772
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,660
- They make a great couple together.
- Yes.

773
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,960
- I have something to give you.
- What is it?

774
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,030
I have something for you.

775
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,940
When you look inside,

776
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,370
you'll see a drawing I did this morning.

777
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,810
Really?

778
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,010
It's cool when painters do that.

779
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,610
You'll see a drawing I did this morning.

780
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,710
- It's a postcard. Yes.
- Really?

781
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,980
You drew this?

782
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,420
A Christmas postcard.

783
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,480
(This morning before the date)

784
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,660
(Woo Jae's drawing goes on the postcard.)

785
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,790
He's sweet.

786
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,860
(Drawing)

787
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,730
(Once he cuts it
into a beautiful shape...)

788
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,790
How cute.

789
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,930
(A present only for Ji Won)

790
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,470
Seriously. It's a present only for Ji Won.

791
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,000
- It's a drawing just for her.
- Yes.

792
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,740
(He expresses his feelings to her
in the postcard.)

793
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,400
This is beautiful.

794
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,040
How did you draw this?

795
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,440
I didn't want it to crumple,
so I kept it in my book.

796
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,280
I put it in my Pairing Book.

797
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,180
When I brought that with me,

798
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,610
I thought if I didn't end up with you,

799
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,780
I would have to bring it again tomorrow.

800
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,180
So...

801
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,490
(Luckily, the postcard goes
to the rightful recipient.)

802
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,690
Thank you.

803
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,860
I'll keep it for the rest of my life.

804
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,730
- I love it.
- I'm glad.

805
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,830
It looks great.

806
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,300
(Flying up)

807
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,530
Is that Chang Hwan?

808
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,740
- Isn't that Chang Hwan?
- Come on.

809
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,040
- The waves are quite high. Look.
- Yes.

810
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,410
The color of the sea is so beautiful.

811
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,410
- Right?
- Right.

812
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,380
We met in Italy.

813
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,210
Now, we're at the East Sea.

814
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,420
Right?

815
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,950
Where can I find more cups?

816
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,050
Hello.

817
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,420
(They awkwardly said hello to each other.)

818
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

819
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,120
- Hello.
- That was their first meeting.

820
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,360
It must still feel fresh...

821
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,390
- in their memories.
- Right.

822
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,900
- We met for the first time in Italy.
- Right.

823
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,530
- Isn't that just so romantic?
- Right.

824
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,270
I'm glad. This is great.

825
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,300
I'm so happy to be here with you.

826
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,370
Me too.

827
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,540
They keep saying how happy they are.

828
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,910
How many seconds do you think
you can last if you fall into the water?

829
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,880
Are you Type T?

830
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,050
"Are you Type T?"

831
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,050
- Gosh.
- I think she is.

832
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,980
I see. They're getting snow crabs.

833
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,520
Gosh, this looks tasty.

834
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,160
- I know which dish you'll go after first.
- Tell me.

835
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,760
- Let's point on the count of three.
- Sure.

836
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,030
One, two, three.

837
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,960
- It was the abalone.
- I knew it.

838
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,200
- Doesn't this look the tastiest?
- Right.

839
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,670
(It's tasty.)

840
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,410
How cute.

841
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,240
There it is.

842
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,350
- This is crazy.
- I'll put this away.

843
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,380
This looks amazing.

844
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,820
It looks so good.

845
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,990
- It looks so fresh, right?
- Yes, indeed.

846
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,620
- This has a lot of meat.
- Right?

847
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,690
It keeps coming out.

848
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,530
(A big spoonful)

849
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,230
It looks good.

850
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,430
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

851
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,010
(They dig in the snow crab.)

852
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,310
It's tasty.

853
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,540
You're enjoying it well.

854
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,680
- Let's eat a lot.
- I love it.

855
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,850
When... I suddenly got curious.

856
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,920
When was the time
your heart fluttered the most until now?

857
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,290
When did my heart flutter the most?

858
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,350
She should answer that kind of question.

859
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,660
There were so many things
that made my heart flutter.

860
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,990
Is that so?

861
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,460
That's the right answer.

862
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,900
The time when we went to
do the flower arrangement.

863
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,270
The process of making one together
made my heart flutter.

864
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,240
And the owner of the place
was a friend of yours.

865
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,240
Talking about things with your friend...

866
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,280
made me feel like we got so close.

867
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Right.

868
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,120
- That made my heart flutter.
- It felt like you were my girlfriend?

869
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,450
- Yes.
- Goodness.

870
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,590
I love this.

871
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,390
It made my heart flutter because
it felt like we were a real couple.

872
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,390
You feel close when you meet
the other's acquaintance.

873
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,300
(Of course.)

874
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,130
My heart fluttered the most
when we did the contract relationship.

875
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,070
When you came down the stairs...

876
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,570
At that moment,

877
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,810
I was surprised,
and my heart fluttered so much too.

878
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,280
"If Ji Won is coming down,
it means she wrote my name."

879
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,350
- Right.
- "So she wrote my name?"

880
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,120
I couldn't believe it.

881
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
But it really made my heart flutter.

882
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,750
- He really liked it.
- And...

883
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,760
the rest, we could talk about later.

884
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,820
Right.

885
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,260
It's like a drama.

886
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,870
(What kind of day will today become
for these two?)

887
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,340
So Woo Jae and Ji Won...

888
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,540
- He drew a postcard and wrote a letter.
- Right.

889
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,340
In the letter, he wrote,
"My December is you."

890
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,210
That's what he wrote.

891
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,880
- It was so touching.
- I know.

892
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,420
Jong Shin,
I'm sure you've made songs for your wife.

893
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,190
- Oh, right. You make songs too.
- My songs...

894
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,790
They're not a gift.
They're for me to sing them.

895
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,230
But of course,
there are songs about my wife.

896
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,230
(Gosh, that's so romantic.)

897
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,030
- That's so cool.
- There are songs about my kids too.

898
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,100
There's a song called
"I Can't Live Without You."

899
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,870
How would you feel
if you got something like that, Mimi?

900
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,270
It would make my heart flutter.

901
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,140
I won't get something like that,
but it would make my heart flutter.

902
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,840
(I want to get it too.)

903
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,140
(The third person to go on a date
on Christmas Eve.)

904
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,280
- It's Je Yeon.
- With Ji Min.

905
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,280
(Who will she spend her day with today?)

906
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
As the day for the final selection
got close,

907
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,720
I thought, "I hope there was more time."

908
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,920
That's what I've been thinking.

909
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,890
Because I wanted to make
the best decision.

910
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,460
When I look back on myself,

911
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,130
I liked someone quite easily,

912
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,470
but it was hard for me
to get into a deeper relationship.

913
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,010
It's like I'm in between liking someone
and loving someone.

914
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,680
To get to the next step,

915
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,610
it takes me some time.

916
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,220
If I'm not 100 or 120 percent certain
about my feelings,

917
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,290
Do you want me to do as I want?

918
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,690
I don't say those things that easily.

919
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,130
I have to be really certain
about my feelings...

920
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,900
to say that I love someone.

921
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
(Will she be able to become certain
about her feelings?)

922
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,870
First of all, Ji Min...

923
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,850
As for Ji Min,
when we talked for the first time,

924
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,180
it felt cold.

925
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,890
"Will I be able to click with him?"

926
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,450
That's what I thought at first.

927
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,520
But when we did the contract relationship,
I thought we could be good together.

928
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,530
(Touching)

929
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,260
I felt drawn to him.

930
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,200
(He's someone she's drawn to
more and more.)

931
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,030
(Her second date, Sang Yun)

932
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,230
As for Sang Yun,

933
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,770
I thought he was like me inside.

934
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,640
So I thought we could be a better match
and go well together.

935
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,420
(Maybe, today is the most important day
for Je Yeon.)

936
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,450
I think it's Sang Yun.

937
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,450
I also think it's Sang Yun.

938
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
(Spotting)

939
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,590
(Ji Min is here.)

940
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,530
- My goodness.
- Gosh, it's Ji Min.

941
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,660
Here? I don't think it's here.

942
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,230
(Hi.)

943
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,740
Hold on. No.

944
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,070
- No?
- What's going on?

945
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,140
Hold on.

946
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,480
(Ji Min leaves, passing Je Yeon.)

947
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,550
- Goodness.
- He passed her.

948
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,820
- Is it a twist?
- Did he ask the direction?

949
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,000
My goodness.

950
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,060
He left her there?

951
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,670
Now, Ji Min knows it too.

952
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,530
That they're not a match.

953
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,300
It wasn't here. What do I do?

954
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,570
Ji Min was on his way
to a different place.

955
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,240
So it was...

956
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,340
I was typing in my destination.

957
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,980
But it wasn't typed in well.

958
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,910
I use an app for it.

959
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
Just a second.

960
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,050
But the Bluetooth wasn't working well.

961
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,790
It wasn't typed in well,

962
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,790
but I left, thinking I'd enter it later.

963
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,790
But it didn't work.

964
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,520
Hold on.

965
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,760
(He left without setting the destination.)

966
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,830
So I went down the road as I knew the way.

967
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,130
And Je Yeon was there. I wrote her name.

968
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,070
I thought I came to the right place,
and she greeted me.

969
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,200
But when I looked outside,
it didn't feel right.

970
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
What?

971
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,280
Here? I don't think it's here.

972
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,440
Hold on.

973
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,680
No.

974
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
Hold on.

975
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,390
(They parted as soon as they met.)

976
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,810
Which direction is it?

977
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:03,660
(Je Yeon was left alone again.)

978
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,730
I thought it would be Ji Min.

979
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,740
Actually, even until then,

980
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,910
I wasn't sure if he left...

981
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,440
or if he was coming back
because he got here so early.

982
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,810
I wasn't sure about it.

983
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,420
So I thought he could come back.

984
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,490
(Ji Min's car)

985
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,520
He went back.

986
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,420
- I guess it was on the same route.
- My goodness.

987
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,560
How did this happen?

988
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,630
No. Maybe this is...

989
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,730
- This could be a chance for Ji Min.
- But why did they run into each other?

990
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,430
Gosh, this was impactful.

991
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,540
(Speechless)

992
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,170
So I thought he could come back.

993
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,470
(She looks in the mirror,
expecting to see Ji Min again.)

994
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,340
She's fixing her makeup.

995
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,020
She doesn't show her emotions much,

996
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,760
but this made her feel
so many different emotions.

997
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,430
A different car is coming?

998
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,900
(At that moment,
a different car approaches her.)

999
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,280
Hi.

1000
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,250
It's Sang Yun.

1001
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,050
Love is all about timing.

1002
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,790
(Je Yeon's date today is Sang Yun.)

1003
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,560
- You must be starving.
- Yes, I'm starving.

1004
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,260
So we meet again.

1005
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,700
Thank you.

1006
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,570
- I have bread too.
- Bread?

1007
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,510
I thought you must be starving.

1008
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,210
Really? Thank you.

1009
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,050
We're going to the East Sea.

1010
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,050
- The East Sea?
- Yes.

1011
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,850
- I see. The East Sea.
- Everyone is going to the East Sea?

1012
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,180
It will take three hours.

1013
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,790
I'll get you something tasty.

1014
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,230
We're going to Mukho Port.

1015
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,630
This place feels like that place.

1016
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,530
There's a mural village there.
Where was it?

1017
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,170
- In Busan?
- Yes.

1018
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,730
Yeongdo?

1019
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,200
I think it's similar to this place.

1020
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,970
Like a fishing village.

1021
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,410
It's been a while
since I last went to the East Sea.

1022
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,840
I think there will be
so many tasty foods there.

1023
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,520
There will be a lot of sashimi.

1024
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,980
You said you wanted to
have some grilled clams, right?

1025
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,090
Right. We should have...

1026
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,150
- some grilled clams.
- Of course.

1027
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,520
What about ramyeon?

1028
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,090
- Wouldn't it be good?
- Right. The grilled clam restaurants...

1029
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,760
- must have ramyeon too.
- There must be ramyeon too. Right.

1030
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,000
- I'm already happy.
- Yes.

1031
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,400
Earlier, Soo Ah, Ji Min, and I were...

1032
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,570
sitting at the table.

1033
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,470
- This morning?
- Yes.

1034
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,540
Is that so?

1035
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,510
We had apples.

1036
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,920
So? What did you talk about?

1037
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,380
She's curious about it.

1038
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,620
I think Soo Ah is a propulsive person.

1039
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,790
"Propulsive?"

1040
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,560
To whom?

1041
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,530
It seems like she wants to
spend some time with everyone.

1042
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,960
Today, we were sitting there,

1043
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,200
and Ji Min asked her something.

1044
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
I see.

1045
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,830
He asked who she wanted...

1046
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,170
- to get to know more.
- Right.

1047
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,470
And she said, "You."

1048
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,500
- Really?
- Yes.

1049
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,080
- Who do you want to go on a date with?
- Me?

1050
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
(This morning at the Pairing House)

1051
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,140
You, actually.

1052
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,980
(Startled)

1053
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,120
I mean,
who do you want to go on a date with?

1054
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,450
You.

1055
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,450
- Me?
- Yes.

1056
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,290
Hold on a second.

1057
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,250
No, don't go.

1058
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,460
- I'll give you room.
- Come back.

1059
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,420
- What are you going on about?
- What's wrong?

1060
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,290
- It's out of the blue.
- It's understandable.

1061
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,960
- She might want to get to know you.
- Why is that out of the blue?

1062
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,030
- You want us to talk.
- I said so yesterday.

1063
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,530
I see.

1064
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,370
Soo Ah said
she wanted to make a decision...

1065
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,770
- after talking to everyone.
- Right.

1066
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,010
Sang Yun knows that something's up.

1067
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,120
I keep thinking of your superpower
when we talk about our reaction.

1068
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,750
You wrote that down as your superpower.

1069
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
Right.

1070
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,690
Sang Yun knows
she's thinking about Ji Min.

1071
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,600
(Bothered)

1072
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,100
Maybe we're all going to a similar place.

1073
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,410
Could our destinations be close by?

1074
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,940
Really? I don't think so.

1075
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,310
Who do you think paired up? Let's guess.

1076
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,620
Ji Min and Chae Eun.

1077
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,020
- Ji Min and Chae Eun?
- Yes.

1078
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,520
How so?

1079
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,030
I'm just getting that feeling.

1080
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,460
I think Ji Min went out with Soo Ah.

1081
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,600
- That's possible.
- Right.

1082
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,840
Ji Min is constantly on her mind.

1083
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,470
- And Sang Yun's aware of it.
- Right.

1084
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,610
I think that's stirring him emotionally.

1085
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,480
- That's possible.
- Right.

1086
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,750
I think he brought up...

1087
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,250
- Ji Min and Chae Eun on purpose.
- Right.

1088
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,720
- To ease her mind.
- Exactly.

1089
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,790
How considerate of him.

1090
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,390
(Well...)

1091
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,760
I talked to Chan Hyeong yesterday,

1092
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,970
and he's also going to
make his decision...

1093
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,400
after talking to everyone.

1094
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:46,970
Right.

1095
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,600
What about you?

1096
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,540
I've talked to almost everyone.

1097
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,680
So you talk to everyone, and...

1098
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,450
What was it again?

1099
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,450
What are you looking for?

1100
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,850
How we click.

1101
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,150
- How you click?
- Yes.

1102
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,020
It's hard to explain.

1103
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,330
You must've talked to everyone by now.

1104
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:15,930
Right.

1105
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,200
This is what I thought yesterday.

1106
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,600
"What..."

1107
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,670
"What was I hoping to find..."

1108
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,540
"by talking to
each and every one of them?"

1109
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,610
Something like that.

1110
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,110
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

1111
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,050
What did you conclude?

1112
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,020
At first...

1113
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,260
I wanted to find someone...

1114
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,430
who shared the same values.

1115
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,460
- Right.
- I see.

1116
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,060
That matters,

1117
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,230
but the feeling I get from him matters...

1118
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,870
just as much.

1119
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,710
I think it boils down to that.

1120
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,940
(Pondering)

1121
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,850
(30 minutes ago)

1122
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,150
- Gosh, that.
- That was brutal.

1123
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,190
(After Ji Min left)

1124
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,290
(Did it make her feel something
she wasn't aware of?)

1125
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,100
That's the hardest part, right?

1126
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,640
Exactly.
I thought I knew myself pretty well.

1127
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,810
Right.

1128
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,610
Knowing yourself
is the hardest thing to do.

1129
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,180
Yesterday,
Soo Ah was talking about baseball.

1130
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,590
- It'd be fun to watch a baseball game.
- Exactly.

1131
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,620
- Do you cheer when you're there?
- Of course.

1132
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,390
- While on your feet?
- What?

1133
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,060
- Do you sing the songs?
- Yes.

1134
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,160
- And do the crowd wave?
- You don't think I would?

1135
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,470
You actually do those things?

1136
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,270
Yes.

1137
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,410
I've been curious about something.
You communicate by signing, right?

1138
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,410
Right.

1139
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,380
The hand gestures are really fast, though.

1140
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,080
Do you have to memorize them all?

1141
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,590
You have to memorize
the basic hand signals,

1142
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,290
but we also learn different ones
for each game.

1143
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,190
- I see.
- They even change during the game.

1144
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,420
- Really?
- Yes.

1145
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,330
You have to memorize them immediately.

1146
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,190
(Startled)

1147
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,560
What if you get confused
and throw a different ball?

1148
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,400
That would result in a missed sign.

1149
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Really?

1150
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,540
Anyway, that's how it goes.

1151
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,040
It gets really confusing.

1152
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,940
You need to have the brains for it.

1153
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,510
I can see why.

1154
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,710
I learned that mind games and strategy
play a crucial role in baseball.

1155
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,850
- Very.
- Right.

1156
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,920
I like that they're finding something
they can talk about.

1157
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,590
(Is the sign between them
changing as well?)

1158
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,560
What's your favorite karaoke song?

1159
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,390
- My favorite song to sing?
- Yes.

1160
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,730
I usually pick songs
from the popular hits list.

1161
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,160
- What's your go-to song?
- What?

1162
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,660
I usually sing songs like this.

1163
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,830
Really? I love this song too.

1164
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,640
I always keep a mic in my car.

1165
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,210
Really? There's a mic?

1166
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,710
Do you sing into the mic, then?

1167
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,310
- Really?
- Like this.

1168
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,610
(Like this.)

1169
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,680
Seriously?

1170
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,350
By the end of a long drive,
my throat feels hoarse.

1171
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,150
- Really?
- Because of all the singing.

1172
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,260
I should've brought a mic today.

1173
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,300
We didn't do much,

1174
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,870
but I enjoyed that brief moment.
I wonder why.

1175
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,300
How should I put it?

1176
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,740
I felt like we were getting closer.

1177
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,110
This is what I thought.

1178
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,610
I felt he had much to say
but was unable to.

1179
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,480
Because I kept thinking we were alike,

1180
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,650
I assumed he'd think the way I did.

1181
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,820
That was at the core
of everything I thought.

1182
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,090
He obviously had much to say...

1183
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,260
and a lot on his mind.

1184
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,300
This doesn't suit your character.

1185
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,840
I could tell
he wasn't telling me everything.

1186
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,170
I can finally say it now,

1187
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,140
but I couldn't back then.

1188
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,440
I know Je Yeon is a great person,

1189
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,880
and our relationship can grow.

1190
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,620
I tread lightly because we're on a show,

1191
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,590
but I knew I needed
to make myself clearer.

1192
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,120
His songs are great too.

1193
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,860
This one's good.

1194
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,360
- Here.
- This was in the book.

1195
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,300
Right. And it was at the beginning too.

1196
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,400
When Justin Bieber got married,

1197
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,170
he wrote this song with his wife in mind.

1198
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,240
- Really?
- The lyrics are beautiful.

1199
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,610
- "I spent 10,000 hours,"
- Okay.

1200
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,880
"but I will spend 10,000 hours more."

1201
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,550
- That's the message.
- I see.

1202
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,750
(Je Yeon's choice of song)

1203
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,780
It's similar to the song we just heard.

1204
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,350
I know this song.

1205
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,690
- Together...
- It played during the wedding scene...

1206
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,260
- in "Twilight."
- That's the one.

1207
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,790
"A Thousand Years."

1208
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,960
Gosh, this song.

1209
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,160
Is it a similar song?

1210
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,670
In terms of the message.

1211
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,370
The previous song was about
spending 10,000 more hours.

1212
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:23,470
In this one,
she's saying she waited 1,000 years...

1213
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,910
to be with you.

1214
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,170
That's right.

1215
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,340
Time works differently for vampires.

1216
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,410
Right?

1217
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,180
Justin Bieber is only spending
10,000 more hours, but...

1218
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,380
I love it.

1219
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,020
(Exclaiming)

1220
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,090
The ocean looks amazing.

1221
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,690
What a beautiful color.

1222
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,820
It truly is.

1223
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,730
The waves.

1224
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,670
(They arrive at the East Sea.)

1225
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,140
(Exclaiming)

1226
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,180
Seagulls are squawking.

1227
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,690
- The timing is perfect.
- Right.

1228
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,290
It's beautiful.

1229
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
That reminds me.

1230
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Thanks.

1231
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,370
Sang Yun's a gentleman too.

1232
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,940
Let's get closer.

1233
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,270
They make a great couple.

1234
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,270
- I know.
- Totally.

1235
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,310
- The sky looks like a rainbow.
- What?

1236
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,540
- It's filled with rainbow colors.
- I love it.

1237
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,810
Do you like staring blankly out
at the sea or the sunset?

1238
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,190
- I do.
- Really?

1239
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,820
I've been to Gwangalli alone a lot.

1240
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,320
Really?

1241
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,530
Hey, our footprints.

1242
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,400
Look.

1243
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,160
Ours are the only ones.

1244
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,070
Aren't these all clams?

1245
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,170
Oh, the holes?

1246
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,640
- They breathe through that.
- Right.

1247
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,040
Clam soup sounds delicious.

1248
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,880
You always think about what to eat.

1249
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,180
I'm hungry right now.

1250
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,320
- This is stunning.
- Tell me about it.

1251
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,550
Should I take some photos?

1252
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,260
(Nice!)

1253
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,660
No way.

1254
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Look over here.

1255
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,800
Hold on!

1256
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,000
How did it get all the way here?

1257
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,570
No way.

1258
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,170
Hey, delete that one.

1259
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,470
"Hey, delete that one."

1260
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,640
Look.

1261
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,670
(Check out the photo.)

1262
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,210
- What do you think?
- It's good.

1263
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,950
- Don't you think you look good?
- I look great in this.

1264
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,150
I like it.

1265
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,220
Je Yeon's laughing again.

1266
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,730
This is beautiful.

1267
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,060
I like how Sang Yun just lets her be.

1268
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,260
- Right.
- He doesn't pry or force things.

1269
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,330
This is great.

1270
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,430
I feel like I can breathe again.

1271
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,040
I don't want to go back.

1272
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,290
(Glancing)

1273
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,290
You can tell that Je Yeon has a lot
on her mind.

1274
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,460
What is it?

1275
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,030
Nothing.

1276
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
I wanted to know
what expression you were wearing.

1277
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,100
- What was that? What I was thinking?
- No, your expression.

1278
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,870
Oh, my expression.

1279
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,650
(Quietly, they gaze at the sea.)

1280
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,600
(What kind of thoughts...)

1281
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,800
(are seeping through Je Yeon's mind?)

1282
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,780
(Sighing)

1283
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,380
- I'm sure Je Yeon's mind is screaming.
- Right.

1284
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,150
I think she saw Ji Min as someone...

1285
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,980
who'd never change his mind.

1286
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,150
- That he'd only have eyes for her.
- Right.

1287
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,120
But now that's gone,
she feels empty inside.

1288
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,760
I believe this might be how...

1289
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,060
- she confirms her feelings for him.
- Right.

1290
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,130
- That's true.
- Absolutely.

1291
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,700
I also see this as an awakening for her.

1292
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,470
She wasn't expecting it, but she...

1293
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,100
- Hugely...
- found herself emotionally stirred.

1294
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,770
She probably realized
how much she liked Ji Min.

1295
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,710
- Even I was surprised by it.
- I think...

1296
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,480
- Sang Yun felt it.
- Right.

1297
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,750
- He sensed everything.
- In the car,

1298
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,480
he could tell it disturbed Je Yeon.

1299
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,680
However,

1300
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,750
he just let her be.

1301
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,320
- That's right.
- Anyway,

1302
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,120
I'm curious about
how the rest of the day will go.

1303
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,030
Will he try to make his way
into her empty heart?

1304
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,760
Or will he simply lend her his ear?

1305
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,100
(An important moment
in their relationship)

1306
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,400
- That will be most important.
- Right.

1307
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,100
(Snow still blankets the day
on Christmas Eve.)

1308
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,870
(Who is Soo Ah waiting for?)

1309
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,970
She looks so pretty.

1310
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,970
Who could it be?

1311
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,410
Who is it?

1312
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,810
(Soo Ah's going on a date with Ji Min.)

1313
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,480
(Grinning)

1314
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,050
Soo Ah's excited.

1315
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,750
Soo Ah was second to send the text
after Chae Eun.

1316
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,060
Since it's 1st-come, 1st-served,
she was paired with Ji Min.

1317
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,060
(She was paired with Ji Min
as per the rules.)

1318
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,060
- She's ecstatic.
- Goodness.

1319
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,570
I didn't expect this at all.

1320
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,870
- Really?
- Yes.

1321
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,970
Well, I did.

1322
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,240
How were you able to guess?

1323
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
She's adorable.

1324
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Earlier...

1325
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,080
You, actually.

1326
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,210
(Flustered)

1327
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,250
What...

1328
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,020
I mean,
who do you want to go on a date with?

1329
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,780
- You. Yes.
- Me?

1330
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,990
- Goodness.
- Hold on a second.

1331
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,050
(Swift)

1332
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,060
No, don't go.

1333
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,160
- I'll give you room.
- Come back.

1334
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,860
This is incredible.

1335
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,130
- Is it?
- Yes.

1336
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,560
- Am I the fourth person you've met?
- Yes.

1337
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,270
- Can I hold onto you?
- Sure.

1338
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,470
Soo Ah's not fooling around.

1339
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,370
- No way. What's with this place?
- Why?

1340
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,280
- I can't believe we're going to Sokcho.
- Tell me about it.

1341
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,380
I love it.

1342
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,510
Both of them are good
at starting conversations.

1343
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,810
Still...

1344
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,920
How long has it been for you?

1345
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,520
It's been...

1346
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,750
- five days.
- Five?

1347
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,920
How has it been?

1348
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,160
(Well...)

1349
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,990
I feel at ease, then suddenly nervous.

1350
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,260
Were you relaxed at first?

1351
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,530
It felt simple since I thought
I only had to focus on myself.

1352
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,970
- That's a good approach.
- Right.

1353
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,740
But once that moment passed,

1354
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,670
I started to get nervous.

1355
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,040
Soo Ah's completely different today.

1356
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,050
She looks more nervous than usual today.

1357
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,410
- When did you start to get nervous?
- When?

1358
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,220
Since yesterday.

1359
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,620
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

1360
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,420
Did something happen yesterday?

1361
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,790
I experienced this moment
while we were all gathered yesterday.

1362
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,000
I wondered what others were thinking.

1363
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,660
- Was that on your mind?
- Yes.

1364
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,500
I began feeling curious.

1365
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,330
Then how did you decide...

1366
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,270
whom to have your first meal with?

1367
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,310
You must've chosen someone
you were attracted to.

1368
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,180
That depends on the guy.

1369
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,010
I'm curious.

1370
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,550
After a lot of thought,

1371
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,180
I chose Chan Hyeong,

1372
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,790
and then...

1373
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,690
Then I chose you.

1374
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,560
- As the second guy to ask out on a date?
- Yes.

1375
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,290
- I chose you.
- Right.

1376
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,760
But you seemed too uninterested.

1377
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,500
You didn't seem to care.

1378
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
(You weren't interested in anyone else.)

1379
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,170
It felt like you wouldn't make room for me
in your heart.

1380
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,410
Bye. I'll see you later.

1381
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,110
(What Soo Ah saw)

1382
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,640
She had expressed her feelings.

1383
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,350
(They seemed like a solid couple.)

1384
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,120
- You have something for me?
- Yes.

1385
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,520
- I thought I'd get flustered.
- Right.

1386
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,750
So,

1387
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,090
I chose you,

1388
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,760
but then switched to Sang Yun.

1389
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,330
I asked him out to dinner...

1390
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,760
to get to know him better.

1391
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,770
But then I realized...

1392
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,670
I had spent my two tickets.

1393
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,740
When we talked yesterday evening,

1394
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,770
they mentioned there would be something...

1395
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,240
- lined up for us on Christmas.
- Right.

1396
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,310
I thought that was my chance.

1397
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,010
How so?

1398
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:51,280
Because I'd get a full day with someone.

1399
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,220
- And more time to get to know someone?
- Yes.

1400
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,250
And thinking about that...

1401
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,790
made me nervous yesterday.

1402
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,020
I got nervous
after that thought crossed my mind.

1403
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,260
You didn't know who'd show up.

1404
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,590
Exactly.

1405
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,260
- Right.
- Right.

1406
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,770
- As for you...
- Yes?

1407
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,370
You left a strong impression
on the first day.

1408
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,640
How so?

1409
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,010
When I first arrived at the house,

1410
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,680
you were staring blankly into the air.

1411
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,550
- Was I like that?
- Yes.

1412
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,450
- Like...
- I don't remember.

1413
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,750
You were spacing out.

1414
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,150
(Soo Ah's first day at the house)

1415
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,350
You look like a flight attendant.

1416
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,190
Thanks.

1417
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,960
That means she's wrong.

1418
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,430
(Spacing out)

1419
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,730
Soo Ah knows what she saw.

1420
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,630
(Glancing)

1421
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,440
At the time,

1422
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,800
all he could think about
was Sang Yun and Je Yeon.

1423
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,270
I thought you were true to your feelings.

1424
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,380
You were honest.

1425
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,110
You seemed nonchalant
and like you didn't care,

1426
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,050
but you turned out to be someone
who noticed a lot.

1427
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,850
You were sweet as well.

1428
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,150
- I was sitting on the floor,
- Right.

1429
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,760
and you told me to get up,
saying ladies don't sit on floors.

1430
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,460
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

1431
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,260
You gave me your chair.

1432
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,860
Can I join you?

1433
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,460
- You should come here.
- What?

1434
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,430
- Really. Take my seat.
- Really?

1435
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,900
The floor isn't a place for a lady.

1436
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,470
(He gave her his chair without blinking.)

1437
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,310
The men watching should take note of this.

1438
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,240
I didn't expect that from you.

1439
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,080
It came as a twist.

1440
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,520
Ji Min's caring like that.

1441
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,950
(Jammed with traffic)

1442
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,290
What's going on?

1443
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,060
I was just as startled.

1444
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,790
Was there an accident?

1445
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,630
- I could've crashed.
- I know.

1446
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,700
- That startled me.
- I couldn't see either.

1447
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,000
Your ears are flushed.

1448
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,370
- That really startled me.
- I see.

1449
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,240
We almost died.

1450
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,340
No way.

1451
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,110
(They have to switch lanes.)

1452
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,110
(Glancing)

1453
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,110
(Determined)

1454
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,350
(Please let us through.)

1455
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
Why?

1456
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,490
They let you cut in if you do this.

1457
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,520
Gosh, this is hilarious.

1458
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,190
(Please.)

1459
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,760
Soo Ah's so charming!

1460
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,760
(Please.)

1461
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,970
- No way.
- What?

1462
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,570
I bet they burst out laughing.

1463
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,870
This way, no one has to feel bad.

1464
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,670
I feel better too.

1465
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,610
(They managed to switch lanes
thanks to Soo Ah.)

1466
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,880
We've never had anyone like her before.

1467
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,250
(They beam at this new side of her.)

1468
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,550
- This is a new paradigm.
- She begged them to let her through.

1469
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,620
"Please."

1470
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,050
Turning on the emergency light
will make the sequence perfect.

1471
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,850
I love it.

1472
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,520
You said you wanted to talk to me today,

1473
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,760
and I'm worried
I won't be able to entertain you.

1474
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,700
I asked you out
because I'm already entertained by you.

1475
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,930
- She's charming.
- I'm worried it'll be cold at the beach.

1476
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,870
That'll all be part of the memory.

1477
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,810
(Ji Min can't help but think of someone.)

1478
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,040
This is how nervous I was.
When they tell you their name...

1479
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,680
(Chang Hwan told Ji Min
how he felt about Soo Ah.)

1480
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,180
I completely lost it.

1481
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,420
I've never enjoyed a date
that much before.

1482
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,690
Exactly. Chang Hwan told him that.

1483
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,590
Guys are like that, you see.

1484
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,690
- And they're roommates.
- Goodness.

1485
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,190
(Pondering)

1486
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:28,660
Didn't you say your ideal guy
was someone manly and masculine?

1487
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,200
- That's right.
- Goodness.

1488
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,170
Someone who's manly,
transparent, and honest.

1489
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:35,540
Someone who has a sense of responsibility
and loyalty.

1490
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,210
How about physically?

1491
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,680
Do you have a celebrity type?

1492
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,540
- A celebrity type?
- Yes.

1493
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,080
- Do you know Choi Kwang Rok?
- I see.

1494
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,020
He has a thick beard. I know him.

1495
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,590
You're into guys who look very masculine.

1496
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,220
(A man with a manly beard)

1497
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,260
Goodness.

1498
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,730
(And a great physique)

1499
01:05:58,730 --> 01:05:59,860
(It's my roommate.)

1500
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:02,400
He's his roommate. Oh, no.

1501
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,460
Do you like guys with a beard?

1502
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,370
It's not about the beard.

1503
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,310
What matters is the person's overall vibe.

1504
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,080
Right. Whether it's a woman or a man,
it's about the person's vibe.

1505
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
Exactly.

1506
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,850
Do you have a rough idea about
which men the girls are interested in?

1507
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,290
- Do I?
- Yes.

1508
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,420
I had a conversation about that
with the other girls.

1509
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,460
- Whom did you talk to?
- In the room.

1510
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,590
I talked to Je Yeon and Ji Won.

1511
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,690
With your roommates?
What did you talk about?

1512
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,360
(Last night)

1513
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,430
Are you the type
who talks with everyone...

1514
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:38,130
- before making your decision?
- Yes.

1515
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,670
Really?

1516
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,100
I didn't know they talked about that.

1517
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,440
It depends on the person.

1518
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,210
What about you, Je Yeon?

1519
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:45,440
I'm the same.

1520
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,470
Are you the same?

1521
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,410
Do you think Sang Yun
and Ji Min are similar to each other?

1522
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,050
- No, they're completely different.
- They are? How?

1523
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,050
Ji Min is...

1524
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,780
more tender-hearted.

1525
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,020
- Tender-hearted?
- That's what I think.

1526
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,090
Also, he seems to be someone
who only has eyes for one woman.

1527
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:03,560
She understood him exactly.

1528
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,560
(Nodding)

1529
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,330
It's easier to see his true feelings.

1530
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,260
People like Chang Hwan
and Ji Min tend to...

1531
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,400
have eyes for only one woman.

1532
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,000
Did you have a heart-to-heart
with Je Yeon?

1533
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,440
Yes, we confided in each other.

1534
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,210
The sea looks very beautiful.

1535
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,180
(They arrived after a long drive.)

1536
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,350
That looks beautiful.

1537
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,380
We're here.

1538
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,980
(After a long drive,
they arrived at the blue winter sea.)

1539
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,120
(Snapping)

1540
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,790
(First,
Soo Ah takes a photo of Ji Min's back.)

1541
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,950
She's taking photos of Ji Min.

1542
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,160
You look great in the photo.

1543
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,290
Gosh.

1544
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,430
I like taking photos of the seawater.

1545
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,700
The sea is interesting.

1546
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,030
I can daydream in front of the sea
for four hours.

1547
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,600
I know that you like to daydream.

1548
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,040
- From when?
- You're always daydreaming.

1549
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,640
- Me?
- Yes. When everyone is together.

1550
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,580
- I do that?
- Yes.

1551
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,080
Really?

1552
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,090
Shall we go on the Ferris wheel?

1553
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:06,890
The view is pretty.

1554
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,390
This is so lovely.

1555
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,990
Looking at the sea makes me feel good.

1556
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,500
It also makes me get lost in thought.

1557
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,770
- Goodness.
- She's on his mind.

1558
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,240
Soo Ah sensed him spacing out again.

1559
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,540
He's spacing out even when he's with her.

1560
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,750
(It becomes quiet
as they are lost in their own thought.)

1561
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,280
This is suffocating to watch.

1562
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,820
There must be a lot on your mind.

1563
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,290
Things keep happening here.

1564
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:44,290
The person I'm interested in
can spend time...

1565
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,490
with someone else.

1566
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,890
- When you have to pay...
- Right.

1567
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:50,260
attention to such complex matters,

1568
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,730
you feel...

1569
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,370
Such things.

1570
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,040
It looks like he has a lot on his mind.

1571
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,810
I'm not having a hard time at all.

1572
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:05,610
- Seriously?
- I decided to enjoy it.

1573
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,120
Is that a promise?

1574
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,090
- A promise?
- Is that a promise to yourself?

1575
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,520
You can put it that way.

1576
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:18,690
But this isn't a difficult matter.

1577
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,400
- Am I wrong? Is it difficult?
- It is difficult.

1578
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,230
So I won't be hasty about it.

1579
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,540
Soo Ah is amazing.

1580
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,040
I need...

1581
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,810
to take my time
to make an objective decision.

1582
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,010
- You'll do well.
- Yes.

1583
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,450
I wonder whom you'll choose.

1584
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,850
Me? Who do you think I'll choose?

1585
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,420
I don't know you at all.

1586
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,460
I just talked to you a little today.

1587
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,260
We talked over two hours.

1588
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:53,930
Will you spend tomorrow with Chang Hwan?

1589
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:55,860
- Tomorrow?
- If possible.

1590
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,330
I think so.

1591
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,730
If you pick each other.

1592
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,100
Yes, that's right.

1593
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,480
At first, this is what I thought.

1594
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,550
Let's say that I picked...

1595
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:17,280
one person I liked the most.

1596
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,350
However, he doesn't pick me,

1597
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,590
or he isn't sure if I'm the one for him.

1598
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:26,390
That could be scary to think about.

1599
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,030
At first, I was very worried...

1600
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,860
about being rejected.

1601
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:35,270
However, that's not how I feel anymore.

1602
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:41,040
Not expressing my feelings
out of fear of being rejected...

1603
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,710
would damage my pride even more.

1604
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:46,950
That's amazing.

1605
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,720
Her words seem to apply to Ji Min.

1606
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,260
I like it when...

1607
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:01,030
the other person tells me clearly.

1608
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,370
In this situation,
who would come up to me...

1609
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,870
and make it clear how they feel?

1610
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,140
The same goes for everyone.

1611
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,210
Then the one who can muster up
the courage first can do so.

1612
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,680
If possible, I can be the one
who musters up the courage.

1613
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:18,980
(Nodding)

1614
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,050
Currently, Ji Min feels very worried,
and he's having a hard time.

1615
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,150
So Soo Ah's confident attitude can have...

1616
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:26,150
a huge impact on him.

1617
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,760
I don't want to make
the other person wait and feel frustrated.

1618
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,630
Whether he's interested in me or not.

1619
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,460
All of you have been waiting
for long enough.

1620
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,800
Then I should have more strength
and energy than the rest of you.

1621
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,540
So I should be the one who makes the move.

1622
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:45,670
I don't know anymore.

1623
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,550
While listening to you,

1624
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,380
my mind was overwhelmed
with so many thoughts.

1625
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,920
(Both in Italy...)

1626
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,190
(and in Korea)

1627
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:06,490
(Ji Min always approached her first.)

1628
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:09,630
(He made a move courageously
and got a chance with her.)

1629
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:12,670
(He didn't make it obvious,)

1630
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,740
(but he has been anxious all this time.)

1631
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,200
(Then someone who resembled him
approached him.)

1632
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,040
(You're cold and unfriendly.)

1633
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,880
(In the end, he hurt her feelings.)

1634
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,750
(To the person who mustered up courage
like himself,)

1635
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,550
(he can't help but feel sorry.)

1636
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,220
It feels strange.

1637
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,420
It must be complicated for Ji Min.

1638
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,760
(Ji Min has a lot on his mind.)

1639
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,570
I'm so glad to spend time with you.

1640
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,200
- Why?
- It's nice.

1641
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,270
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

1642
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,000
I agree with you.

1643
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:57,280
I wonder what's on their mind.

1644
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,280
(What could be on their mind?)

1645
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:04,950
What's this?

1646
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,750
Have you taken these before?

1647
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,390
- Four-cut photos?
- Yes.

1648
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,920
I've taken them before.

1649
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,060
Really? Let's take photos here.

1650
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,490
- Here?
- What do you think?

1651
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,760
- In Sokcho?
- Yes.

1652
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,530
- Wait, Ji Min.
- Okay.

1653
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,770
Je Yeon will see their photos.

1654
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,600
I know. What is he thinking?

1655
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,370
(Peace sign)

1656
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,010
Let's take one more. Switch places.

1657
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,170
Switch places.

1658
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,610
(A souvenir from the sea in Sokcho,
Ji Min and Soo Ah)

1659
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,780
They're so close.

1660
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,150
Only one came out.

1661
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,880
- Only one came out?
- Yes, you take it.

1662
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,020
- Really?
- Yes.

1663
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,850
- No, let's cut it at home.
- Like this?

1664
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,960
Which ones do you want, Ji Min?

1665
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,830
- Whatever you don't want.
- Okay.

1666
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,060
You should keep the ones
where I came out well.

1667
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,360
- It's you who will look.
- Oh, right.

1668
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,470
(Sashimi center
in Sokcho, Gangwon Province)

1669
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,270
- They like sashimi.
- This is wild-caught.

1670
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,100
This is insane.
What would you like to eat?

1671
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,970
Have the one that's in season now.

1672
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,940
- Okay.
- Yellowtail sashimi, and...

1673
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,640
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll take that.

1674
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,180
Gosh, did you see it flop?

1675
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,580
It's insane.

1676
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,550
- You're both so good-looking.
- Thank you.

1677
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,020
Please come this way.

1678
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,020
It's huge.

1679
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1680
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,990
It looks delicious. Hurry and try it.

1681
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,230
Isn't it good?

1682
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,230
(Laughing)

1683
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,100
It's so delicious.

1684
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,640
I just thought of something interesting.
Do you want to hear it?

1685
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,080
What?

1686
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,180
We're spending Christmas Eve together.

1687
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:40,950
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Yes.

1688
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,250
Gosh, he's thinking about her again.

1689
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,690
(During their last dinner)

1690
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,230
I'd like to spend Christmas with you.

1691
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,200
(He brought up Christmas quietly.)

1692
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,770
(He expressed his feelings
to her again in a postcard.)

1693
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,800
Goodness.

1694
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,570
Each of these moments is a chance
to confirm his true feelings.

1695
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,440
(Staring)

1696
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,840
Thinking about it that way
makes me feel strange.

1697
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,350
It makes me very happy.

1698
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,050
Are you glad that I came?

1699
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,190
Yes, I'm glad.

1700
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:20,850
Of course.

1701
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,420
You seem like someone
who's been staying with us from the start.

1702
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:30,600
(Hot spicy seafood stew to warm them up)

1703
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:37,000
(Noticing)

1704
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,240
(Mixing)

1705
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,780
Is that how you eat it?
You know how to eat.

1706
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,480
(Finishing up
the spicy seafood stew neatly)

1707
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,850
This is great. There's a view of the sea.

1708
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,130
It's been so chaotic this week.

1709
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,090
(Hesitant)

1710
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,300
- He said it without thinking.
- Right.

1711
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,600
(His feelings slipped out
unintentionally.)

1712
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,840
Did everyone express their feelings
to each other?

1713
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
You expressed your feelings
to the one you like.

1714
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,540
- The one...
- I did it a long time ago.

1715
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,740
The one who likes you
expressed her feelings to you.

1716
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,180
Yes.

1717
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,580
(Sighing)

1718
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,550
I'm dying to get everything...

1719
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:26,720
- off my chest.
- Right.

1720
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,390
But I can't tell you
because it's not just about me.

1721
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,760
Because it involves other people?

1722
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:32,630
That's right.

1723
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,960
So I want to deal with it alone
without telling anyone,

1724
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,500
but I want to get it off my chest.

1725
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,230
Ji Min is such a good person.

1726
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,970
It sounds very difficult.

1727
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,010
- Tell me about you.
- About me?

1728
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,280
I don't want to regret anything,

1729
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,150
so I want to listen to my heart.

1730
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:57,450
I want to stay polite,
friendly, and myself.

1731
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,120
If I have...

1732
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,520
feelings for someone,

1733
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,390
I'd like to let him know
without feeling embarrassed.

1734
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,630
If I let it get in the way,

1735
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,230
I won't be able to choose at all.

1736
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,700
- She's very straightforward.
- She really is.

1737
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,180
You look like Jung Yong Hwa right now.

1738
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,080
- Why?
- You're handsome.

1739
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:34,990
(It's a Christmas Eve
with many thoughts on their mind.)

1740
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,760
Soo Ah was different
from when she was on a date...

1741
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,920
with Chan Hyeong and Chang Hwan.

1742
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,060
Her feelings were more clear
during this date.

1743
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,900
The way Soo Ah spoke...

1744
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,770
encouraged Ji Min to reflect on himself.

1745
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,670
- Soo Ah kept talking that way.
- I agree.

1746
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,740
Listening to them talk made me think this.

1747
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,410
Ji Min feels very anxious,
and he's going through a hard time.

1748
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:58,380
He'd want to keep talking to Soo Ah
in this situation.

1749
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,650
- Continuously.
- That can be very powerful.

1750
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,450
He said earlier,
"I'm glad that I came out with you."

1751
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,890
- Didn't he say that?
- Right.

1752
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,650
I think he likes her as a person now.

1753
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:07,750
As a person?

1754
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,960
- I don't know if he has feelings...
- We don't know that yet.

1755
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,090
for her yet.

1756
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,090
I believe that taking four-cut photos...

1757
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,960
with Soo Ah will cause...

1758
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,800
a huge stir later on.

1759
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,570
If Je Yeon and Ji Min become a couple,

1760
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,170
Je Yeon could say to him,
"You took these photos with her."

1761
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,170
- That could happen.
- It would be so nice...

1762
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,470
- to see her get jealous.
- I hope that it happens.

1763
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,040
- Ha Neul.
- It's Ha Neul.

1764
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,610
I thought that he would come out
because we were paired recently.

1765
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,750
I was hoping for it.

1766
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,720
What? We got a text.

1767
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,220
Ji Min was having a hard time
making up his mind that day.

1768
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:53,770
(Ji Min couldn't decide
until the last moment.)

1769
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,770
He was struggling a lot to decide.

1770
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:58,670
He was probably the last one to respond.

1771
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,880
I was hoping for it.

1772
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,040
She's thinking about him.

1773
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,380
(The sight of him made her hopeful.)

1774
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:08,780
(She arrived at the meeting place.)

1775
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,450
(Will she spend...)

1776
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,460
(Christmas Eve with the person
she's hoping for?)

1777
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,630
- Who is it?
- Who is that?

1778
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:25,070
It's Chang Hwan.

1779
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,730
- What?
- Did he come after a flight?

1780
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,470
What's going on here?

1781
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,200
(Ji Min didn't come again this time.)

1782
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,570
Oh, no.

1783
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,280
Aren't you tired?

1784
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,240
- I'm tired.
- You must be tired.

1785
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,310
Everyone is tired.

1786
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,080
- You must be really tired.
- I was kidding.

1787
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,220
- Let's get some good food.
- Okay.

1788
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,250
Seriously.

1789
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,720
Chang Hwan and Ha Neul...

1790
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,660
I didn't expect to see them together.

1791
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,360
Ha Neul didn't pick Chang Hwan, did she?

1792
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,420
- No.
- No, she didn't.

1793
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,890
Does it mean that
neither of them got matched?

1794
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,030
(Unfortunately,
neither of them was matched with anyone.)

1795
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,630
- Eat something warm first.
- Okay.

1796
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,000
- Thank you.
- The pupae are delicious.

1797
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
- Really?
- Yes.

1798
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,270
I'll eat a lot of them.

1799
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,670
- Enjoy your food, Chang Hwan.
- Let's hurry and eat.

1800
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,740
Enjoy.

1801
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,210
How is it with Soo Ah?

1802
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,110
It seemed like...

1803
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,450
you fell in love at first sight.

1804
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,450
To put it simply.

1805
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,020
- This is delicious.
- He's flustered.

1806
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,090
It's delicious.

1807
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,620
They're like siblings.

1808
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,720
The abalone is fresh.

1809
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,230
We were saying that
we were happy to see...

1810
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,800
- your face light up.
- That's true.

1811
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,140
You were concerned about something
for a few days.

1812
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,440
It wasn't a concern, but...

1813
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,710
It's true that I got a sense
of direction now.

1814
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,210
- It's impossible not to worry about it.
- Right.

1815
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,880
- Gosh.
- It's complicated and difficult.

1816
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,150
- As you know, it's hard being here.
- I definitely agree with you.

1817
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,320
Now, it's weighing me down.

1818
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,680
- Only now?
- It was also hard last week,

1819
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,820
but it's worse now.

1820
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,890
- Is it worse now?
- Yes.

1821
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,190
You keep thinking about her, right?

1822
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:55,520
- I see her.
- Right.

1823
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,390
It doesn't matter
if you don't see that person.

1824
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,390
It's because you see her.

1825
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,590
She's right.

1826
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,860
I imagine that you're feeling the same.

1827
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,370
(Chang Hwan understands Ha Neul
better than anyone else.)

1828
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,270
I don't know if you know how I feel
or whom I'm interested in.

1829
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:11,610
It's either Chan Hyeong or Ji Min.

1830
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,980
I think that you make a good match
with either of them.

1831
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,950
As you said,
I was very interested in Ji Min.

1832
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,320
I see.

1833
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,950
Yesterday, I had a talk with Ji Min.

1834
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:26,950
- That's right.
- We got paired.

1835
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,720
I shared everything that was on my mind.

1836
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,390
- Really?
- With Ji Min.

1837
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,930
He also told me what was on his mind.

1838
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,600
To be honest,

1839
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,170
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my feelings for him.

1840
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,640
Considering what he told me yesterday...

1841
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:52,850
- Ha Neul knows.
- Right.

1842
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:58,320
I never imagined that
Ji Min had written me the postcard.

1843
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,690
Exactly.

1844
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,160
That was also unexpected.

1845
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,130
- After writing me the postcard...
- I'm also surprised by that.

1846
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,190
Right?

1847
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,960
I wish he had considered my feelings
at least once.

1848
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,130
- Right.
- Honestly.

1849
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:15,000
Right, I agree with you.

1850
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,170
When Ha Neul got paired with Ji Min
because of the postcard,

1851
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,740
it gave her false hope.

1852
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:28,550
It became the reason for holding onto him.

1853
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,520
Yes, I can see that.

1854
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,950
He said that he was overwhelmed.

1855
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,290
- Ji Min did?
- He felt overwhelmed.

1856
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:37,090
He was so overwhelmed
that he couldn't reflect...

1857
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,560
I mean, he couldn't pay attention...

1858
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,860
to other people.

1859
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,600
"During the remaining time,"

1860
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,140
"will I be able to keep thinking
about him..."

1861
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,710
"after hearing what Ji Min told me?"

1862
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,040
That's what I think.

1863
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,040
Right.

1864
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,010
You aren't as lively as before.

1865
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,040
I also feel drained.

1866
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,310
- Even now.
- Yes.

1867
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:00,980
He witnessed her
going through a hard time.

1868
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,780
- I've calmed down a lot, haven't I?
- Yes.

1869
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:04,580
- Right?
- It makes me sad.

1870
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:07,450
- I must have matured.
- No, that's not it.

1871
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:14,860
(Will there be a change
in Ha Neul's feelings?)

1872
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,330
- Their conversation breaks my heart.
- I agree.

1873
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,930
Here's why. Usually, Christmas is...

1874
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,130
- an important day.
- Right.

1875
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:23,100
- Besides, they must be very popular.
- Definitely.

1876
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,670
They're spending Christmas like that...

1877
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,510
because they're on Heart Pairing.

1878
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,540
(Feeling bitter)

1879
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:30,840
Yes, and Chang Hwan is...

1880
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,250
in the same boat as Ha Neul.

1881
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,250
But Chang Hwan still has his chance.

1882
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,890
He's at the stage
where he can push forward...

1883
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,920
- Right.
- and be assertive about his feelings.

1884
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:44,890
For today's date,
Chang Hwan could've been disappointed...

1885
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,660
- about not being with Soo Ah.
- Right.

1886
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,030
- There was absolutely no sign of that.
- Right.

1887
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,800
Instead,
he listened to Ha Neul attentively.

1888
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,130
- I agree.
- Yes.

1889
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,770
He's an amazing guy.

1890
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,700
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun
at a nearby sashimi restaurant)

1891
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,770
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1892
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,940
(Clinking)

1893
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,450
It's fascinating that
you eat half-dried saury.

1894
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,620
You're a woman from Gyeongsang Province,
indeed.

1895
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,390
Let's eat after clinking glasses.

1896
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,720
- Clink glasses?
- It's okay.

1897
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:19,430
Merry Christmas.

1898
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,130
Merry Christmas.

1899
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,730
- It's Christmas Eve today.
- It is.

1900
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,700
What time do you get back home
on Thursday?

1901
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,170
She promised to make him...

1902
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,210
- At 7 p.m.
- spaghetti alle vongole.

1903
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:33,210
- At 7 p.m.?
- Yes.

1904
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,610
We can't eat at that time.

1905
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,550
If we do,
you might have to make it for ten people.

1906
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,050
(The two made a bet with a wish at stake.)

1907
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,320
I thought I should make a wish...

1908
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,820
to make something happen.

1909
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,720
I had to make a wish
to make something happen.

1910
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,090
If she got the chance to make a wish,

1911
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,230
she would think a lot
about what to wish for.

1912
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,770
(Using his wish as an excuse,)

1913
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:01,470
(he wanted to get closer to her.)

1914
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,000
I thought of winning...

1915
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,400
- and asking her...
- This far?

1916
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,110
to do something for me.

1917
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,810
I'll definitely get food.

1918
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,310
So I made sure to win,
even though it wasn't necessary.

1919
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,050
For me, 7 p.m. is...

1920
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,050
I don't want anyone to see me cook.

1921
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,690
I want to be alone in the kitchen.

1922
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:31,200
I noticed that you didn't dip
your eggs in salt.

1923
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,100
Do you prefer bland food?

1924
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,700
It still tastes good to me
without any salt.

1925
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,300
Because I love eggs.

1926
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:42,040
It's true that
I normally enjoy bland food.

1927
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:48,880
(They still have a lot to learn
about each other.)

1928
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,480
He's drinking quite a lot.

1929
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,780
- Yes.
- Sang Yun is.

1930
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,620
When a guy drinks that much,

1931
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:55,660
it means he's got a lot on his mind.

1932
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,690
That's true.

1933
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,360
Perhaps, he has something to say.

1934
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:03,530
My first impression... Never mind.

1935
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,700
- Tell me.
- No.

1936
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,730
- Tell me.
- No.

1937
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:07,770
Tell me.

1938
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,800
Please tell me.

1939
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,270
He said, "Please."

1940
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,340
Never mind.

1941
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:13,970
- Just say it.
- What?

1942
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Say it.

1943
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,080
What is it?

1944
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,780
You're really different
from how you seemed at first.

1945
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,920
How did I seem at first?

1946
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,490
At first?

1947
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:29,790
I told you last time.

1948
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,960
I want to hear it again.

1949
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:34,090
You forgot, didn't you?

1950
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,090
No.

1951
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,600
Probably not.

1952
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,430
I think I mentioned that
you seemed cold at first.

1953
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,470
Right.

1954
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,370
- We've gotten closer, though.
- Yes.

1955
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,910
So, you can add another one.

1956
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,180
Another one?

1957
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,390
I thought you were an actor.

1958
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,750
What did you say?

1959
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,190
You had clear facial features.

1960
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,660
That's not what I mean.

1961
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,030
- No?
- The impression.

1962
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:07,190
- Impression of you?
- Yes.

1963
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:12,270
I think the impression of someone
matters a lot.

1964
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,270
(Je Yeon said the impression
of the person mattered.)

1965
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,600
Oh, he meant that.

1966
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,040
Other than you seeming cold?

1967
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,250
I seemed cold, and that's it?

1968
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,920
(Staring)

1969
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,650
Her current impression of him
is what matters.

1970
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,150
Is that really all?

1971
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,290
All you said to me was
that I looked elegant.

1972
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,600
You could add another one
now that we're closer.

1973
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,860
She turned it around on him.

1974
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,060
You can't use the same request.

1975
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,570
- It's not going to work.
- Why not?

1976
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,440
Because I asked you first.

1977
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,500
Other than what you already told me.

1978
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:54,210
I said that
you looked like an idol singer.

1979
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,610
You said that last time.

1980
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,940
- So, you remember.
- Yes.

1981
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,450
But...

1982
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,820
- you seem quite different...
- Yes?

1983
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,590
between when we're alone...

1984
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:10,060
and when we're with everyone else.

1985
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,330
When the others are around,

1986
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,630
you're more talkative.

1987
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,730
I don't want to seem frivolous
when we're alone.

1988
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,000
But I do get more playful
when I feel closer.

1989
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,340
- Do you?
- Yes.

1990
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:33,450
I was actually thankful.

1991
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,620
Because...

1992
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:41,720
we both needed some time to get familiar,

1993
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,690
and I could sense that you were trying.

1994
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:49,060
The way you asked questions, I mean.

1995
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,330
Yes, Je Yeon asked him
a lot of questions at first.

1996
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,170
Because I'm also that type of person.

1997
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:00,370
I could totally understand how you felt.

1998
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,910
Because I could relate to you,
I was grateful...

1999
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,450
- for how you were always trying.
- Really?

2000
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,750
Ever since we ate together.

2001
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,720
I joined the program later than others,

2002
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,830
and it was the day after I had come.

2003
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,000
But I still don't regret
making that decision.

2004
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,100
I think it was the right choice.

2005
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,870
(It was the right choice.)

2006
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,900
Sang Yun doesn't use fancy words,

2007
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,770
- but he's sincere.
- Yes.

2008
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,780
It's embarrassing to say this.

2009
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,060
I think it leaves me with more regrets,
though.

2010
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:52,690
The fact that
we don't have much time left.

2011
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,360
I wish...

2012
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,570
we had just one more week.

2013
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,870
So do I.

2014
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,270
I just want to get to know you better.

2015
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,610
He really mustered up his courage
to say that.

2016
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,450
To find out who you really are.

2017
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,560
I wonder how Je Yeon feels...

2018
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,720
after hearing that
he wants to get to know her.

2019
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,160
Because I'm curious.

2020
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,830
I said that I wanted another week,

2021
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,400
but I just meant that
I wanted to be with you longer.

2022
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:43,480
(He carefully tells her
how he really feels.)

2023
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,280
(Glancing)

2024
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:58,020
How about you?

2025
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,390
Me?

2026
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,560
I am curious.

2027
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,700
You don't have to answer me
if you don't feel like it.

2028
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:12,310
But this might be our last chance
to officially spend time together.

2029
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:15,110
That's why I'm asking.

2030
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,010
I wonder...

2031
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,410
what's on your mind.

2032
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:21,410
You know,

2033
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:22,680
your honest thoughts.

2034
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,420
That's all I need.

2035
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,620
(Sipping)

2036
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,290
He's drinking so much!

2037
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:35,130
It seems that he's getting help
from the influence of alcohol.

2038
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:39,400
I actually thought...

2039
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:43,240
that I had set my mind on who to choose.

2040
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,040
Until last week,

2041
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:51,610
I think I've been going at my own pace.

2042
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:53,680
Okay.

2043
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,420
- But we only have a week left.
- Yes.

2044
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,590
So, I decided...

2045
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,690
to speed it up...

2046
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,490
a little.

2047
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,700
That's what's on my mind.

2048
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:20,010
I can sense it.

2049
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:25,280
I can sense your thoughts...

2050
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,210
from your actions.

2051
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,050
- Is your throat okay?
- What?

2052
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,320
My throat? Why?

2053
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,760
You said it hurt last night.

2054
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,660
That's why it's a bit confusing for me.

2055
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,970
But while I was here,

2056
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,210
I didn't have any regrets.

2057
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,410
I don't think that it was a waste of time.

2058
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:58,810
I had a lot of fun.

2059
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,150
I also don't regret...

2060
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:03,550
making this decision today.

2061
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:08,790
I don't regret anything.
I'm so glad and thankful...

2062
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:10,790
that you made this choice tonight.

2063
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,830
(Staring)

2064
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,260
That's all.

2065
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:22,370
(Who are they leaning toward right now?)

2066
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,300
That last line, though.

2067
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,640
"I decided to speed things up
and follow my heart."

2068
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,240
That means that
she's set a course for herself.

2069
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:34,480
She's made up her mind, and she's
determined to enthusiastically go for him.

2070
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,680
But she said it in front of Sang Yun.

2071
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:40,520
Sang Yun might be in a better position...

2072
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,220
- Exactly.
- or not.

2073
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:44,290
There were moments...

2074
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:47,660
during their date today
when I caught glimpses of something...

2075
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,100
in Je Yeon's expression.

2076
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,630
Like a shadow passing through,

2077
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,100
a bit of sadness, or distance.

2078
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:55,100
I believe she means Ji Min.

2079
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,200
Sang Yun will need another bottle.

2080
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,570
(You're so harsh.)

2081
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:00,470
Judging from the way
Sang Yun was drinking,

2082
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:03,680
I could tell that
he was very into Je Yeon.

2083
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,210
He was.

2084
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,610
And he seems like the type
to swallow his feelings.

2085
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,280
He wants to show his charms, but...

2086
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,820
He never got a chance.
There weren't any opportunities.

2087
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:16,020
He couldn't show that
when Je Yeon was feeling...

2088
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,060
- empty all day.
- Right.

2089
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,160
I can't wait to find out
what Je Yeon will do once she returns.

2090
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,460
I'm dying to watch it.

2091
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,100
(How will they react
when they return to the Pairing House?)

2092
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,800
I'm tired.

2093
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,240
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

2094
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,540
- It's comfortable, right?
- Yes, it's nice and comfy.

2095
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,610
I'll turn on the seat heater.

2096
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,090
(They all go back home after the dates.)

2097
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,760
It's freezing.

2098
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,990
Let's get changed and regroup upstairs.

2099
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:56,030
Okay.

2100
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:01,930
(Taking photos)

2101
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:07,470
(Saving the photo they took together
again)

2102
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,580
Thank you. Thanks for today.

2103
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,850
Let's go.

2104
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,180
There they are.

2105
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,150
- Are they here?
- I think only one couple came back.

2106
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,190
Sorry.

2107
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:22,050
I think they're here.

2108
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,160
Someone's here.

2109
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:28,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

2110
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:30,260
How was the flight?

2111
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,900
Why are you sighing so deeply?

2112
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:34,900
It was a long day.

2113
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,640
What did you do today?

2114
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,670
We had clams in Eurwangni.

2115
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,670
(Looking)

2116
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,610
With Ha Neul? Why do you look so tired?

2117
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,280
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, no.

2118
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,010
- What can I do to help?
- We're both tired.

2119
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,150
What do you mean?

2120
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,690
She's leaving.

2121
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,450
I'm so tired.

2122
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,060
Did you two have dinner together?

2123
01:35:58,660 --> 01:35:59,660
What did you have?

2124
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:00,890
We had...

2125
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,030
sashimi.

2126
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,130
She seems depressed.

2127
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:19,550
Ha Neul, are you tired?

2128
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:21,150
- What?
- Are you exhausted?

2129
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,410
(Nodding)

2130
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:23,450
So am I.

2131
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,220
- Meet with me there.
- What?

2132
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,420
Come over. Do you want to rest?

2133
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,920
I should get some rest.
I thought everyone would be here.

2134
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,530
We're going to order ice cream.

2135
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,660
- What?
- Ice cream.

2136
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,500
- You're going to order ice cream?
- Yes.

2137
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,430
(Nodding)

2138
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,030
No, you should get some rest.

2139
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,770
(Turning away)

2140
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
She's cold.

2141
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,370
I've never seen her leave without a smile.

2142
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,140
That day, I think...

2143
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,810
I felt disappointed above everything.

2144
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,450
I thought, "How come Ji Min..."

2145
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:01,290
"never chose me?"

2146
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,590
I knew that Ji Min knew how I felt
better than anyone else,

2147
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:08,390
so why wouldn't he choose me even once?

2148
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:10,800
Those thoughts upset me.

2149
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,170
She must have liked him so much.

2150
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,830
She was so into him.

2151
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,290
I didn't know what to do.

2152
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,520
Rather than being considerate...

2153
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,060
about Ha Neul's feelings,

2154
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,300
I wanted to help Je Yeon...

2155
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,100
feel relaxed. That's why I acted that way.

2156
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,740
It still made me feel bad.

2157
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:54,670
After all, there's only one Christmas...

2158
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,910
for her in 2024.

2159
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,280
- Je Yeon, let's have ice cream.
- Soo Ah!

2160
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,320
- Let's have ice cream.
- Did you order it?

2161
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,920
Hi!

2162
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,730
Hello.

2163
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,130
Are you guys eating something?

2164
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,200
(Hi.)

2165
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,430
Where did you go?

2166
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:20,230
- Gangneung.
- Gangneung!

2167
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,670
We went to a sashimi center or something.

2168
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,570
- So did we.
- So did we.

2169
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,940
Ha Neul, where did you go?

2170
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,940
- Should we get changed first?
- Yes.

2171
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,380
She seems cold too.

2172
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:33,810
- Go and get changed.
- You should get changed.

2173
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:35,610
Je Yeon can't look at Ji Min.

2174
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:46,330
(Ha Neul leaves the room again.)

2175
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:47,390
I can't...

2176
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:49,230
What is this vibe?

2177
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,340
(Anxious)

2178
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:02,610
Why are there so many...

2179
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:06,210
Then,

2180
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,080
should we leave two packs, just in case?

2181
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,080
(Ji Min can't seem to go up to Ha Neul.)

2182
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,320
Or leave three packs?

2183
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,480
- How many are there?
- Five packs in total.

2184
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:14,690
I think we'll eat at least three.

2185
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:17,290
Why don't we open two at a time...
Never mind. I'm not sure.

2186
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,490
It's chaos.

2187
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:19,590
It's a lot, right?

2188
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:22,700
- Do we have too many?
- I didn't think it'd be this much.

2189
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:23,800
(He hesitated for a long time.)

2190
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,830
Let's put it over there.

2191
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,400
Are they the same?

2192
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,240
(Ji Min ends up leaving the room.)

2193
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:51,590
(Following his heart...)

2194
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:57,260
(ended up hurting someone's feelings.)

2195
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:08,810
- Ji Min must be suffering so much.
- Yes.

2196
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,780
I wouldn't have been able to join them...

2197
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,280
as it would be uncomfortable.

2198
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,810
- Why am I so hungry all of a sudden?
- Me too.

2199
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:17,750
I'm suddenly craving bossam.

2200
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,790
We were thinking of buying bossam earlier.

2201
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,920
- It sounds delicious.
- I want cake.

2202
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:24,960
This is so pretty.

2203
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,490
They said it was healthy
as it was made with vegan collagen.

2204
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:29,290
Do you want to try it?

2205
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,930
It tastes good.

2206
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,340
(Skincare routine finished)

2207
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,540
Shaved ice?

2208
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,240
I talked about shaved ice on my way back!

2209
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,380
Chae Eun, are you happy?

2210
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:46,910
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.

2211
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:48,350
Am I allowed to enjoy such extravagance?

2212
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:50,280
Yes. Enjoy it tonight.

2213
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:52,320
She said, "Extravagance!"

2214
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:55,090
Maybe it's...

2215
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,060
- Are you all recharged now, Je Yeon?
- Sorry?

2216
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,130
Do you feel recharged?

2217
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:04,760
- Did you take a nap?
- I took a nap on my way here.

2218
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:06,530
You must be exhausted.

2219
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:08,870
It's tasty.

2220
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,370
- I think I'm done.
- Are you going to try one?

2221
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:13,910
- Me? Yes.
- It's tasty.

2222
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:16,040
Where's the spoon?

2223
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:17,810
Didn't we have spoons here?

2224
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:18,910
No? Did we use them all?

2225
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:20,310
Spoons? I think so.

2226
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,580
He keeps looking after her.
It's instinctive.

2227
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,980
We can't exactly pick the meat
from the snow crabs.

2228
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,890
Je Yeon is also reading the room.

2229
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,120
It's good.

2230
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:32,290
What did you eat?

2231
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,730
We had sashimi.

2232
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,030
We also rode the Ferris Wheel.

2233
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,330
That must have been beautiful!

2234
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,130
- They had a Ferris Wheel?
- Yes.

2235
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:44,570
We rode that, and...

2236
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,270
- What was it?
- Did you take a walk on the beach?

2237
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,210
- We did.
- That sounds romantic.

2238
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,080
And we had sashimi.

2239
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:56,280
I like this one the best. A photo sticker.

2240
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,750
No, not a photo sticker.

2241
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:02,250
There was this photo booth.

2242
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,260
Soo Ah looked good.

2243
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,600
It must have been an expensive camera.

2244
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,600
(It's harmonious in the room.)

2245
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,470
- There is.
- Oh, there's whiskey.

2246
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,000
I'll go to my room too.

2247
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:19,170
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, scoot over, guys.

2248
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,640
- Have fun.
- Get some rest.

2249
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,940
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

2250
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,680
She worked too hard.

2251
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:38,590
Our private moment had ended,

2252
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:42,660
and it made me realize...

2253
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,160
that it was over for good.

2254
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,810
- She's crying.
- Is she crying?

2255
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:01,980
(She bursts into tears
that she's been holding back.)

2256
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:12,490
(Sniffling)

2257
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,230
Do you want this one or that one?

2258
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:19,230
(Concerned)

2259
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,900
- Do you have both?
- Yes.

2260
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:22,730
- Or do you want a mix?
- I'll take a mix.

2261
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:25,000
- Is it okay to mix them?
- I was joking.

2262
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,910
Were you actually going to mix them?

2263
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,170
(Ji Min leaves.)

2264
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:30,810
- You can try mixing them.
- No.

2265
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,110
- Should I try it?
- She seems concerned.

2266
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:36,180
- This is wine, not a cocktail.
- Because this one's a bit...

2267
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:47,160
Can we talk? Outside?

2268
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:52,660
I'll come outside once I'm ready.

2269
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,940
Ha Neul is kind of ignoring me.

2270
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:06,140
- I can see why.
- "I can see why."

2271
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:09,310
What do you think I should do?
I genuinely don't know.

2272
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,090
She can feel disappointed.

2273
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:16,920
You still have the right to reject her,
even though you know how she feels.

2274
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,120
- You also went through emotional pain.
- Yes.

2275
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:21,260
- As you are right now.
- Yes.

2276
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,230
But even when you knew...

2277
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:26,330
It wasn't like you didn't know.
You knew how she felt.

2278
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,840
And yet, you did that to her.
But she gets it.

2279
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,440
You had your hands full.

2280
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,340
Going to work was tough alone.

2281
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:40,280
And pouring your last bit of energy
into one person wasn't easy either.

2282
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,220
So she gets it.
But either way, as a result...

2283
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,420
You were also disappointed, weren't you?

2284
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:47,890
- I was. I know.
- It's the same for her.

2285
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:52,520
Someone has the same experience
that he has.

2286
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,060
(Thinking)

2287
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,300
You...

2288
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:11,710
seem to feel very small and down,

2289
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,780
which bothers me.

2290
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:21,490
Why all of a sudden?

2291
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:23,490
It's not sudden.

2292
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:30,760
It's because of the pairing, right?

2293
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,240
Of course, I was upset with you.

2294
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,680
It's just that...

2295
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,220
today and tomorrow...

2296
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,920
are meaningful days.

2297
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,120
I wanted to spend it meaningfully.

2298
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,030
All I hoped for, and quite a lot at that,

2299
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:12,670
was that you'd notice my feelings for you,
even if just a little.

2300
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:25,880
It's true that I've been avoiding
going on dates with you.

2301
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,660
And I’ve been avoiding it...

2302
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,460
because I’ve already devoted myself
to someone.

2303
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:45,840
I thought leaving no room for doubt
would be less painful for me.

2304
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,710
That was why.

2305
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,350
I've somewhat figured out my feelings.

2306
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:07,990
Honestly, I've devoted myself to her
for three weeks.

2307
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:10,560
The bond I formed...

2308
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:14,470
and the time I spent with her...

2309
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:18,340
- are important to me.
- Of course.

2310
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:25,480
I want to focus
on the initial choice I made.

2311
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:27,550
To do so,

2312
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:31,620
spending time with you
is too demanding for me.

2313
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:53,170
I swear there wasn't a single moment
when I tried to ignore your feelings.

2314
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,740
- Right.
- Of course not.

2315
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,740
He's like a nice big brother.

2316
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,860
Don't cry.

2317
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:20,800
Don't cry.

2318
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,300
There's no need to cry.

2319
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:32,310
You should do whatever feels right to you.

2320
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,750
Simply because...

2321
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,320
of my current feelings,

2322
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,650
there's no need for you to waver.

2323
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,890
And I don't think
you're the type to waver.

2324
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,290
I...

2325
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:53,930
confessed all my feelings to you,

2326
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,770
and you already knew.

2327
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,280
I...

2328
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:08,910
may not have given it my all,

2329
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,950
but I did express my feelings a lot.

2330
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,360
So, I'm okay.

2331
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,900
I'm okay.

2332
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,270
Starting tomorrow, I'll change.

2333
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:37,080
No, that's unnecessary.

2334
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,380
If you're upset, tell me all about it.

2335
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:42,250
If you want to insult me, go ahead.

2336
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,820
I can take it all.

2337
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:46,820
Use me if you want to.

2338
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,360
Tell me if you're craving anything.

2339
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:55,890
And don't cry.

2340
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,730
(A pinky promise)

2341
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,000
I can't move on from Ha Neul.

2342
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,440
I feel bad for her.

2343
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:10,810
There’s a different side
when it's just the two of us.

2344
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:12,240
It's completely different.

2345
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:15,250
- Does that include everyone?
- Yes, everyone was different.

2346
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:18,520
But that difference had its own charm.

2347
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,450
Getting to know the other by talking...

2348
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:23,690
- leaves a great impression.
- Totally.

2349
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:25,320
- Right?
- Yes.

2350
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,520
That matters the most.

2351
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,160
I feel that again.

2352
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,600
She's going to him. She's going to Ji Min.

2353
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:40,440
(Peeking)

2354
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:42,670
Je Yeon must've been concerned.

2355
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:44,380
What is it, Je Yeon?

2356
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:45,940
Sorry?

2357
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,310
- Are you here to see me?
- What?

2358
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:49,450
- Are you here to see me?
- Yes.

2359
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,920
When Ji Min came by accident,

2360
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:00,030
I couldn't help but think that
my feelings had finally settled...

2361
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,490
with someone.

2362
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:09,700
(Je Yeon's feelings
have settled with someone.)

2363
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,610
(If I got the wrong idea about anything,)

2364
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:15,770
(Yes?)

2365
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:18,440
(I hope you...)

2366
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,250
(will clear it up...)

2367
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,880
(as soon as possible.)

2368
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:27,520
(What will happen to our feelings?)

2369
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:31,390
(Thank you for always being with me.)

2370
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,090
This is how I do things.

2371
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:35,030
I don't lack courage.

2372
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,030
How everyone wavers is confusing.

2373
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:43,540
We get along way better
and have way more fun than I expected.

2374
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:44,570
It's amazing.

2375
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:49,870
What?

2376
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:54,750
- This is crazy.
- It wasn't what you said.

2377
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,250
"Only the two couples."

2378
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,620
The rest will stay at home.

2379
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,250
We'll stay at home.

2380
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,950
Let's eat.

2381
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:04,520
Had I been wishy-washy
and just gone with the flow,

2382
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,720
I would've regretted it later on.

2383
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:11,860
- Je Yeon. What do I do?
- I know.

2384
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:14,870
This is all just too chaotic.
What do I do?

2385
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:16,330
I'm going to write your name.
