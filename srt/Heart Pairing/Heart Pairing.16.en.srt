00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,370
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,570
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,570
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,010
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,980
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,240
(Psychology expert, Park Ji Seon)

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,910
At last, on Heart Pairing...

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,550
they will make the final decision.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,680
Exactly.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,980
My goodness.

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,550
Does this show really end today?

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,450
Does it?

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,460
It doesn't feel real yet.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,860
- It can't be real.
- We've been...

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,260
- very immersed in this show so far.
- Right.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,130
Last week, they had a home date
for 1 night and 2 days.

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,330
Woo Jae and Ji Won,

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,570
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun,

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,530
and Ji Min and Je Yeon.

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,400
A total of three couples were paired.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,970
Which couple's home date
was most memorable to you?

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,570
- I guess...
- Yes?

23
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,570
Ji Min and Je Yeon?

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,040
Ji Min and Je Yeon!

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,210
They were lovey-dovey,
sitting on the couch.

26
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,680
- They were joking around.
- Yes.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
Ji Min has totally changed...

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,390
- after Je Yeon gave him confidence.
- Yes.

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,390
He became relaxed.

30
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,520
And Je Yeon became more affectionate.

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,860
- She did.
- Yes.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,200
The couple without any trouble
was Woo Jae and Ji Won.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,130
It was a time to rediscover Woo Jae.

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,500
He put away groceries...

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,070
and cooked tteokguk nicely.

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,340
He's a family-oriented
and ready for marriage.

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,070
- Would they ever argue?
- I know.

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,440
I guess they'd have no reason to argue.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,780
Still, they would argue in reality.

40
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,110
(Laughing)

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,110
If they don't argue,
it means they're not in love.

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,110
Even if they argue,
Woo Jae would say this.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,350
"Are you angry?"

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,120
- "Are you upset?"
- However, for now,

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,720
I wondered if that couple
would ever argue.

46
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,560
- I know.
- They make me think that.

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,320
They're such a nice couple.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,390
They're a perfect match.

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,390
In the case of Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun,

50
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,100
their home date felt...

51
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,600
like the camera went...

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,370
- into a married couple's home.
- I know.

53
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,370
It felt like the camera
interrupted them...

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,870
because it was like their real life.

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,870
And left in the Pairing House...

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,810
were four people who were not paired,

57
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,540
Chang Hwan, Soo Ah, Ha Neul, and Sang Yun.

58
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,710
Chang Hwan and Soo Ah were not paired.

59
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,840
They were not.

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,010
Chang Hwan drank from the bottle.

61
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,410
We could see that scene.

62
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,620
Chang Hwan was so into Soo Ah,

63
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,620
and I guess we were absorbed in him.

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,290
However, we...

65
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,360
- haven't talked about her feelings.
- I know.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,290
We've seen Chang Hwan...

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,300
- much longer than we've seen Soo Ah.
- Right.

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,700
And since we're so aware...

69
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,930
of how sensitive and delicate
Chang Hwan is,

70
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,570
we sympathize a lot...

71
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,110
with how Chang Hwan feels now.

72
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,040
However, for Soo Ah,

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,910
it's best to follow her heart.

74
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,140
- Right.
- That's right.

75
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,950
So it's right for Soo Ah
to be true to her heart...

76
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,950
- and make a choice.
- Right.

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,790
Today,
it's the last episode of Heart Pairing.

78
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,120
The long-awaited final decision
is approaching.

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,620
From the three couples paired last week,

80
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,930
would there be any difference?

81
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,560
- I expect three couples.
- Same here. Three couples.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
- But Heart Pairing is about marriage.
- Yes.

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
Getting married is different from dating.

84
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,570
You're talking about the final decision.

85
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,000
And its standard is marriage, right?

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,470
- Marriage...
- With the intention to marry.

87
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,170
It's whether they date
with the intention to marry.

88
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,810
- I see. Okay.
- However,

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,740
let's say someone out of the three couples
says something like this.

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,310
"I really like you,"

91
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,950
- "but I..."
- "About marriage..."

92
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,180
"want to think more carefully."

93
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,650
I don't think those six would say that.

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,880
I hope they don't.

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,250
- I know.
- I mean it.

("Doenjang Stew Is So Good
That We're in Big Trouble.")

97
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,420
Hi.

98
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,660
Do you want some coffee?

99
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,990
- Coffee?
- Yes.

100
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,230
- We decided to cook for you girls.
- Really?

(chefs gather in the kitchen.)

108
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,650
Hi.

109
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,880
Do you need some help?

110
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,320
What do you want me to do?

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,320
It's fine.

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
You can just enjoy the food.

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
The main chef is Chang Hwan.

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
- I'm much better.
- Shall I cook doenjang stew?

115
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,530
I filled the pot with water earlier.

116
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,000
Hi.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,370
Are we cooking something?

118
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,730
- Yes.
- We're going to cook for you.

119
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

120
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,540
How nice.

121
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,370
We'll cook...

122
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,440
doenjang stew, stir-fried pork,
and kimchi fried rice.

123
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,080
Kimchi fried rice cooked by you?

124
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,350
It's my last time cooking here.

125
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,350
- It's my last dance.
- I love that.

126
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,920
It feels like the last dance.

127
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,650
It feels sad
to hear you say the last dance.

128
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,850
- I mean here.
- Gosh.

129
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

130
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,490
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Ha Neul, good morning.

132
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,630
Are you going to mix all these vegetables?

133
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,300
Since all the dishes are strong,

134
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,600
it will be nice if you can cook
the doenjang stew in a mild style.

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,270
Can you adjust the flavor?

136
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,470
Okay.

137
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,270
It doesn't have a strong flavor.

138
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,010
I need an onion.

139
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,410
(Cooking begins in earnest
with Chef Park leading them.)

140
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,580
That looks good.

141
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,880
Just spread it in the pan.

142
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,180
Is it all cooked? It is, I guess.

today as usual)

146
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,560
What? Mayonnaise?

147
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,800
This is the kick.

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,770
It doesn't look like
there's not much vegetables, does it?

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,500
- I'll cook a generous amount, okay?
- Okay.

150
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,670
He's a good cook.

151

This pan is so small.

155
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,510
The vegetables will get soggy.

156
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,080
You're struggling alone.

157
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,850
So I don't think I can add that.

158
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,550

- Did you bring it from home?
- Yes.

- For fried rice.
- With laver.

- It looks so good.
- Yes.

because of the strong garlic aroma?

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,570
- Yes, it has a strong garlic aroma.
- You can add more laver,

182
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,730
and it will be all right.

183
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,070
I'm seasoning with laver.

184
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,070
Being in a cluster
in the kitchen like that...

185
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,470
- looks so nice.
- Right.

186
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,410
- It's good.
- Is it good?

187
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,040
It tastes so good.

188
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,210
- Does it?
- Yes.

189
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,480
(The doenjang stew is almost done too.)

190
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,980
(Boiling)

191
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,050
Should I have added more chili peppers?

192
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,590
The chili peppers I used
are not spicy at all.

193
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,150
This one was spicy. Let's add these.

194
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,590
- Is that spicy?
- It's definitely spicy.

195
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,330
- Sang Yun is a good cook too.
- He's a foodie.

196
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,160
- It tastes so good.
- It's spicy enough.

197
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,900
It's enough. It tastes so good now.

198
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,370
(Okay.)

199
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,170
I'll boil it a bit more...

200
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,640
and finish with some tofu.

201
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,840
(Stir-fried pork that calls for rice
is ready too.)

202
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,480
Here comes your server.

203
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,740
How many are there?

204
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,780
Four.

205
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,980
- Sesame seeds.
- That's nice.

206
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,220
(The last main chef tastes.)

207
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,260
- It's good.
- Let's go, then.

208
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,960
- Let's call them now.
- It tastes mild and nice.

209
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,260
- Shall I call them?
- Yes.

210
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,300
Let's bring them in.

211
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,770
Chan Hyeong, as you go in,

212
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,200
say, "Princesses!"

213
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,940
- Let's do it together.
- "Princesses, it's time for breakfast."

214
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,140
- Let's do it together.
- Okay.

215
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,210
(A playful word accompanies the meal.)

216
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,110
- Who is it?
- Princesses.

217
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,410
- Yes.
- It's time for breakfast.

218
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,750
Princesses, it's time for breakfast.

219
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
(The princesses are happy.)

220
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,420
- They like it, don't they? Right.
- They're so happy.

221
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
He's charming.

222
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,490
(In the Pairing House,)

223
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,690
These look so good.

224
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,690
(they have the last breakfast.)

225
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,690
This is amazing.

226
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,230
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

227
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,600
- Enjoy.
- This is our last meal here.

228
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
It's the last meal we'll have together.

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,170
- It looks good.
- We need to portion it.

230
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,240
Shall I grab some for you?

231
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,470
I can tell it tastes good already
from its smell.

232
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,080
This looks good.

233
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,710
You got up so early.

234
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,680
I know. Woo Jae got up so early.

235
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,610
- You woke up at 8 a.m.?
- At 8:30 a.m.

236
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,650
Why did you wake up so early?

237
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,580
- My eyes just opened.
- What did you do?

238
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,690
- You looked forward to today.
- I took a shower.

239
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,890
It's...

240
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,890
(Patting)

241
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,560
- Did you?
- Really?

242
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,690
Woo Jae is doing this here,
but he might hit you like this outside.

243
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,930
Woo Jae might.

244
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,000
I can give your hair in the back
a down perm...

245
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
with my hand.

246
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,330
"With my hand."

247
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,630
I can push it hard.

248
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,410
- Have you tried it? Is it good?
- It's a hangover soup.

249
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,470
- Does it taste all right?
- Thank you.

250
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,980
This doenjang stew is to die for.

251
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,410
It would have been nicer...

252
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,680
The doenjang stew tastes good.

253
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,550
This doenjang smells
like the country-style doenjang.

254
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,050
It actually smells different.

255
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,150
She can recognize it from its smell.

256
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,920
Is it country-style doenjang?

257
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,030
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

258
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,360
Right. It feels like eating at home.

259
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,330
(The second doenjang stew Sang Yun cooked)

260
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,870
- Gosh, the kimchi fried rice.
- It's for a hangover.

261
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,070
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

262
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,140
It tastes amazing.

263
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,540
It tastes wonderful, Chang Hwan.

264
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,610
Without Chang Hwan,
we wouldn't have had nice dinners.

265
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,050
(Opening his mouth wide)

266
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,120
It's so good.

267
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,760
- It was really good.
- Yes.

268
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,130
This meal was the best.

269
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,500
This is insane.

270
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
I'm feeling full and warm.

271
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,100
(Sweating after eating
spicy doenjang stew)

272
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,630
I feel so hot.

273
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,500
I'd look so sloppy,
but I can't help but take off the shirt.

274
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,170
(Bursting into laughter)

275
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,570
(Laughing)

276
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,870
These are my pajamas.

277
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,380
- That's funny.
- We're not done yet.

278
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,250
That's so funny.

279
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,410
(Focusing on eating
after taking off his shirt)

280
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,410
He's really funny.

281
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,980
Would this affect your decision
by any chance?

282
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,420
(Giggling)

283
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,690
You might get zero votes, all of a sudden.

284
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,150
It will be so funny
if that affects our decisions.

285
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,690
(Thanks to Ji Min,)

286
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,430
(they finish the meal with laughter.)

287
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,790
I enjoyed the meal,
all thanks to you guys.

288
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,830
- Right.
- Yes.

289
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,930
- I enjoyed it so much.
- Right.

290
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,030
- Thank you for the meal.
- It was delicious.

291
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,600
- Thank you for the meal.
- It was so good.

292
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Thank you for the meal.

293
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,040
I can't go out like this.

294
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,680
- You can go out in that shirt.
- What's that?

295
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,710
- They will get untangled, right?
- I'm leaving.

296
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,290
(Chan Hyeong receives tangled necklaces.)

297
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,290
I love it when a man cares for you
without drawing attention.

298
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,490
It feels like he's operating.

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,770
- Really?
- Chan Hyeong, are you going to wear them?

300
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,170
Well,

301
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,770
he's trying to untangle them.
That's really funny.

302
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,240
Seriously.

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,870
- Is it hopeless?
- Doing this might help.

304
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,910
- No.
- No?

305
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,180
- I really worked hard on them.
- I might be able to do it.

306
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,680
- I'll try using my nails.
- No.

307
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,880
Don't focus on me. I think I can make it.

308
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,520
Those are not Chan Hyeong's, I guess.

309
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,050
They are Chae Eun's.

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,990
(That's how
Chan Hyeong's challenge began.)

311
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,490
Has he decided to do that today?

312
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,560
I think it's possible.

313
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,160
I guess you need a needle for that.

314
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,760
I know.
You can do it quickly with a needle.

315
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,860
What on earth happened in this house?

316
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,070
(Whatever people around him say,)

317
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,100
Look at him. He's so focused.

318
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,270
(he only focuses on
untangling the necklaces.)

319
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,170
You're still at it.

320
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,140
- Yes, these are...
- Are you done?

321
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,110
- She's been at it for some time.
- All day long.

322
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,740
- She says 3 necklaces are tangled.
- It's 3 of them.

323
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,210
I'm serious about this.

324
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,280
But no one is answering.

325
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,350
(Chae Eun holds the necklaces
during the meal too.)

326
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
(Bothered)

327
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,760
This is so difficult.

328
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,190
What on earth happened in this house?

329
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,460
That's what I'm saying.

330
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,430
Did the necklaces cause a commotion?

331
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
It's working.

332
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,030
If you untie one knot,
it will be done smoothly.

333
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,070
He's done with one now.

334
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,970
- It's three necklaces.
- I'm untangling them now.

335
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
You've progressed a lot, though.

336
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,940
(A challenge of the century
with everyone focusing)

337
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,740
Watching it makes me stressed out.

338
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,880
I kind of feel satisfied
watching these things.

339
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,350
- You know what I mean?
- Right.

340
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,690
I like these things too.

341
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,060
- Do you want to pass the baton to me?
- It's almost done.

342
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,220
It really is almost done.

343
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,920
I think it's almost there.

344
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,730
It's unbelievable.

345
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,700
Amazing.

346
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,200
(For Chan Hyeong who's struggling,)

347
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,470
(Chae Eun stays by his side.)

348
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,050
Chan Hyeong, if you are...

349
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,380
- too stressed out by that...
- No, I'm not. It's fun.

350
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,850
- This one.
- Okay.

351
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,560
It's because he's a doctor.

352
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,390
(A doctor for 11 years
shows amazing concentration.)

353
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,660
- He's studying the necklaces.
- Seen from the back,

354
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,960
he looks like he's taking a medical exam.

355
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,900
(Engrossed in it without moving at all)

356
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,870
I untangled them all.

357
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
You actually untangled them.

358
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,110
(Just amazed)

359
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,280
Let's wear the necklaces.

360
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,050
You and I will wear the necklaces
and go to her.

361
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,050
Okay.

362
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,820
- Would you like to see how it looks?
- Okay.

363
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,160
Your neck is rather thick.

364
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,890
- It's small for you.
- You can wear it on your face.

365
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,160
It's too small for you.

366
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,860
- Chae Eun.
- Yes?

367
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,030
- We have some gifts for you.
- What gifts?

368
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You'll be surprised.

369
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,170
(Touched)

370
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,670
I never expected it.

371
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,940
I'm so happy. This is amazing.

372
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,410
Chan Hyeong is so sweet.

373
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,810
That's true. Thank you, Chan Hyeong.

374
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,220
- Now, I feel so...
- Never let them get tangled.

375
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,080
See which one suits me the best.

376
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,690
- Don't ever get them tangled.
- Okay.

377
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
This one looks fine.

378
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,820
You're amazing.

379
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,230
You have a high level of focus,
as expected.

380
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,690
It's been a while.

381
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
I knew you'd make it.

382
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
(Times with small pleasures go by.)

383
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,970
I wonder how they feel now.

384
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,610
Hi.

385
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,510
- Hi, Chan Hyeong.
- Hi.

386
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,410
It's Chan Hyeong.

387
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,710
It's already...

388
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,520
You're wearing the thinnest clothes,

389
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,050
and you're in a space
that feels the coldest.

390
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,920
You shouldn't do that.

391
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,490
I shouldn't, right?

392
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
(Smiling)

393
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,060
(Smiling)

394
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,600
Back then.

395
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,240
We...

396
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,240
- spent so much time together.
- Right.

397
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,280
It started when we were in Italy.

398
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,950
I thought we were very similar...

399
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,320
since we were in Italy.

400
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Right.

401
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,290
When we went to the hill
where we could see Florence...

402
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,660
- When we saw the sunset?
- In the cafe, yes.

403
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,830
When we were talking at that time...

404
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,200
That's why I focused more
on my current career.

405
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,140
- That's a good thing.
- Right.

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Because I'll see only one person later.

407
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,220
- It will remain as a memory, right?
- Yes.

408
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,920
(The two of them
who got to know each other...)

409
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,390
(and Ha Neul)

410
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,830
I did avoid you
because I didn't want to get in your way.

411
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,170
A big part of me wanted
to take some pressure off you.

412
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,740
I believe...

413
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,010
everything turned out
the way it was meant to.

414
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,710
Right.

415
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,820
We acted in a way that we wouldn't regret.

416
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,980
Right.

417
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,290
With that being said,
I'm sure you have your own thoughts.

418
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,960
- Right.
- What a sorrowful conversation.

419
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,560
Whatever decision you make,

420
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,330
I just hope you don't get hurt.

421
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,030
- Same to you.
- I want you to be healthy too. Right.

422
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,100
- I guess we used up...
- Actually...

423
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
- a lot of our energy in the beginning.
- Right. Yes.

424
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,040
- Right.
- Yes.

425
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,280
(Extending her hand)

426
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Thank you.

427
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,550
I spent almost all of my time
with you in Italy.

428
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,980
And all of my early memories are with you.

429
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,950
You were in the center of those moments.

430
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

431
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,030
Thanks.

432
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,730
(Ha Neul and Ji Min's conversation)

433
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,030
I was grateful that
you approached me first...

434
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,970
to have a conversation at that time.

435
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,070
And you told me your honest feelings.

436
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,510
Right.

437
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,580
You didn't avoid me.

438
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,180
I wouldn't. That's not in my nature.

439
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,020
You're way too transparent.

440
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,720
I am transparent.

441
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
So because of that,

442
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,260
- I felt so bad.
- Right.

443
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Same here.

444
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,700
Why would you feel bad for me?

445
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,330
I made you feel uncomfortable.

446
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,370
I didn't mean to, but I ended up
making you feel uncomfortable.

447
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,240
You can't put it that way.

448
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,540
You didn't make me uncomfortable.
I was grateful.

449
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,450
But I could understand how you felt.

450
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,390
Taking this month
to get to know one person...

451
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,090
isn't enough time, to begin with.

452
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,120
Right.

453
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,990
So I could understand
why you were feeling that way.

454
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,130
But you seem quite liberated
from your feelings now.

455
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,570
- Is that so?
- Yes.

456
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,410
I'm more grateful to you
more than anything else.

457
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,550
It's been a long time since I felt
this way for anyone. I mean it.

458
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,820
I've been busy with networking
and working on my career these days.

459
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,120
I didn't have that many chances to develop
this kind of feeling for anyone.

460
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,630
"Oh, right. Yes, I could feel this way."
You helped me have these feelings...

461
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,000
after a long time.
So I'm grateful for that.

462
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,400
I mean it. Thanks.

463
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,400
Good job.

464
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,570
Gosh, no.

465
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,340
I was happy that I could get
to meet a great guy like you.

466
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,310
Same here.

467
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,410
It sounds like Ha Neul liked him a lot.

468
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,110
- She did have feelings for him.
- Right.

469
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,180
- Seriously.
- Ha Neul...

470
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,890
(Spotting him)

471
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

472
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,030
(Chae Eun and Sang Yun's conversation)

473
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,100
My gosh.

474
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,470
Did you expect I would ask
to have a conversation with you?

475
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,640
I thought...

476
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,150
it would be nice if you did.

477
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,220
To be honest, I wanted...

478
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,760
to explain to you...

479
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,890
about my decision.

480
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,560
- I see.
- She must've felt bad about that.

481
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,300
Honestly, in the beginning, I...

482
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,070
I mean, you were the first person
to be of the same age as me.

483
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,740
I found you really funny.

484
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,040
I thought, "This guy is so funny."

485
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,440
"I'd like to get to know him more."

486
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
When I got to know more about you
in a group setting,

487
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,980
I noticed that
you and I had a similar taste in food.

488
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,680
I felt so comfortable around you,
and I had fun with you like good friends.

489
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,750
(The two of them felt comfortable
and had fun with each other.)

490
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,820
So...

491
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,620
I did...

492
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,190
find myself paying more attention
to you then.

493
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,260
Okay.

494
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,060
But at the same time, I had already begun
developing feelings for someone else then.

495
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,330
- Right.
- So this was...

496
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,670
She's being honest.

497
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,670
Right.

498
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,870
After that decision,

499
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,240
I could feel that
you had made up your mind.

500
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
Yes.

501
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,920
Personally, I really had a lot of fun,

502
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,420
spending those two days with you.

503
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,220
- I had such a great time.
- Me too.

504
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,730
Having an honest conversation about this
is helping me feel at ease.

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
- Right.
- Yes.

506
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,740
We need to overcome this,
so we can continue to hang out...

507
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,900
- I think we can be good friends.
- as good friends later. Yes.

508
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,270
Right.

509
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,380
Thank you for everything.

510
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,850
I'm on the same page with you.
Thank you for thinking about me.

511
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,720
It could've been
just uncomfortable for you.

512
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,490
But you still gave it your all...

513
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,190
when choosing your partner
for the home date until 1:55 p.m.

514
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,290
So thank you so much.

515
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,400
(Chae Eun and Chan Hyeong's conversation)

516
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,810
By the way, you and I talked so much.

517
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,840
Right.

518
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,310
So are you saying
you have nothing to tell me?

519
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,980
No, I have a lot to tell you, but...

520
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,110
I have a lot to tell you.

521
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,080
- It was when we met for the home date.
- Yes.

522
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,220
When you saw me, you smiled so brightly.

523
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,290
Right.

524
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,360
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun
had the home date together.)

525
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,490
Right.
Chan Hyeong was really happy that day.

526
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,500
What?

527
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,800
- Hello.
- What?

528
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,270
(Chan Hyeong couldn't stop smiling
the whole time he looked at her.)

529
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,740
I really liked that moment.

530
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,580
- For some reason, I felt so happy.
- I see. Really?

531
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,310
Out of all the feelings I had here,

532
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,550
that was the most memorable.

533
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,880
- Really?
- Yes.

534
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,750
I was truly happy.

535
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,760
So I just couldn't control myself.

536
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
They're so cute.

537
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,190
I really didn't think
you would be waiting for me there.

538
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
- Really?
- Yes.

539
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,030
I could predict the outcome
of my decision.

540
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,870
In a way, I knew what was going to happen.

541
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,240
But when I saw the look on your face,

542
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,610
I kind of felt bad.

543
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,680
Then I became so certain
about my feelings.

544
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,780
And those two things hit me
quite hard that day.

545
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,480
That's what happened in that moment.

546
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,550
While waiting for you,
I was cold and so on.

547
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,820
But after that moment, all was forgotten.

548
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,860
I thought...

549
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,260
A part of me was like,
"Why did I even hesitate?"

550
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,530
That crossed my mind too.

551
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,260
I felt bad for putting you through that.

552
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,830
So...

553
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,070
I thought, "Yes, this feels right."

554
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,370
That's how I felt too.

555
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,410
I was just so happy at that moment.

556
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,610
I see. That's good.

557
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm glad to hear that.

558
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,510
We didn't get to share our feelings...

559
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,780
during our last date,
which was the home date.

560
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,820
Right.
I wanted to talk about this that night.

561
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,260
I think I need to express
my feelings with words.

562
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,760
Otherwise,
I don't think people can pick up on that.

563
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,860
Right.

564
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,230
It's hard to read you.

565
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,270
"What is she thinking?"

566
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,030
I did wonder about your feelings.

567
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,600
"Is there anything else she's telling me?"

568
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,870
I tried to focus on that too...

569
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,010
because...

570
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,310
it felt off to ask you directly.

571
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,240
I guess I wanted to be careful
about this subject.

572
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,310
Really?

573
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,550
The feelings I had...

574
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,180
The feelings we shared...

575
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,220
I mean, they felt real to me.

576
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,690
But as for the feelings you had,

577
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,390
- I wasn't sure if they...
- You weren't sure if they were real.

578
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,120
- The feelings are true at this moment.
- Right.

579
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,960
- But...
- But will we feel the same way afterward?

580
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,690
- That's your concern, right?
- Honestly, we can't be certain.

581
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,560
I bet none of us feel certain.

582
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,330
That's why...

583
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,670
- I really liked our date that day.
- I see.

584
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,700
When we met that day, I could feel that...

585
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,600
we were genuinely so happy...

586
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
- to see...
- Right.

587
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,910
- each other. You know?
- That's right.

588
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,710
- I was glad that I chose you.
- Yes.

589
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,250
Seriously. As for me...

590
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,350
(Thinking)

591
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,720
the more I talked to you,

592
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,790
the more curious I became about you.

593
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,450
I mean it.

594
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,060
I haven't said anything
that hasn't come from the heart.

595
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,660
- I see.
- Yes.

596
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,330
(Smiling)

597
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,010
They're so cute.

598
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,240
- I can't wait to find out what happens.
- Me neither.

599
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,390
(Ji Won)

600
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,950
Why did you start laughing
the moment you saw me?

601
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,460
- You can't do that.
- Come on.

602
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,890
- You're funny.
- This isn't good.

603
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,290
- I came here to have a serious talk.
- Right.

604
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,100
(Ji Won and Chang Hwan's conversation)

605
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,930
- Isn't it dry here?
- No.

606
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,330
- Water...
- I had water.

607
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I was hoping...

608
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,740
- you would pick me...
- Okay.

609
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,510
- to have a conversation today.
- Okay.

610
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,140
- I was sincerely hoping for it. Yes.
- Really?

611
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,250
I didn't have to think about it that much.

612
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,920
- I chose you almost right away.
- Really?

613
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,890
- When we were in Italy,
- Yes?

614
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,760
- we spent a lot of time together.
- Yes.

615
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,860
Maybe, it was because...

616
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,960
it was still in the early stage
of the shoot.

617
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,300
- So whenever I see you, I always laugh.
- Okay.

618
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
- I rely on you a lot.
- Okay.

619
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Things you just blurt out...

620
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,540
help me relax.

621
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,810
Is it because I have big feet?

622
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,910
You definitely helped me a lot.

623
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,950
I was a bit sad and felt bad for you.

624
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,820
I think you helped me a lot,

625
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,160
but you rarely told me about your stories.

626
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,490
When I reflected on my time here
one last time,

627
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
it made me regret and feel bad for you.

628
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,340
- I'll be honest.
- Yes.

629
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,870
The fact that I could...

630
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,510
travel in Florence with someone
who gave me butterflies...

631
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,180
This place is beautiful. Awesome.

632
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,480
- This looks like a set for a movie.
- Right.

633
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,220
This way?

634
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,390
Your flustered reaction is so funny.

635
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,330
I couldn't hide it.

636
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,130
Thinking back now, it's like a miracle.

637
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,670
It was...

638
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,940
so special and delightful.

639
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,470
Thinking back now,

640
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,180
I can't believe we did that.

641
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,480
It's fascinating.

642
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,880
That memory alone...

643
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,720
I was looking at the pictures
we took in Florence and Siena.

644
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
It made me quite emotional.

645
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,560
(Ji Won looked at the pictures
when she came back to Korea.)

646
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,030
I looked at the pictures
you took yesterday.

647
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,330
You took great pictures.

648
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I was hoping at least one of them
would come out well...

649
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
- I'm happy with them.
- while taking multiple pictures.

650
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,270
- It was so beautiful.
- Right.

651
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,040
It's such a good memory for me.

652
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,140
I thought to myself,
"Gosh, this was good."

653
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,570
Those memories with you...

654
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,140
helped me...

655
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,210
stay engaged and happy until now.

656
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,420
In the beginning,
we got to know each other as individuals.

657
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,620
When we first met, I thought...

658
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,820
- you and I were quite similar by nature.
- Yes.

659
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,530
- Since you and I are similar,
- Okay.

660
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,900
I hope...

661
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
when you have problems...

662
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,630
- or need someone to talk to,
- Okay.

663
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,470
you would come and find me.

664
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,210
Thank you for saying that.

665
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,310
I'm your biggest cheerleader.

666
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,640
I mean it.

667
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,180
I can't help but feel for you.

668
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,180
The two of them had a mature conversation
to wrap things up.

669
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

670
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,120
(Ji Won and Woo Jae's conversation)

671
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,260
I...

672
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,590
(Ji Won and Woo Jae's conversation)

673
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,030
You're wearing pink earrings today.

674
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,000
They suit you well.

675
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,830
You look pretty. They look good on you.

676
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,870
(Smiling)

677
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,240
I thought about this...

678
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,340
- before going to sleep last night.
- Okay.

679
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,210
- The best thing...
- Okay.

680
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,410
I did after coming here...

681
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,520
- was writing down your name...
- Okay.

682
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,220
for my first contract relationship.

683
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
I think that's the best thing I did here.

684
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,930
And during our time here,

685
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,000
you...

686
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
You...

687
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,170
You...

688
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,570
(Choking up)

689
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,370
- She's choking up.
- Oh, my.

690
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,640
She likes him a lot.

691
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,550
You were always...

692
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,150
a part of those moments.

693
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,750
I was grateful that you came to me.

694
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,260
Gosh, Ji Won says the sweetest things.

695
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,260
Thinking back,

696
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,800
I also think...

697
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,600
the best thing I did after coming here...

698
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,340
I'm getting nervous as I talk.

699
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,310
I'm nervous.

700
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,250
Every day with you felt like a present.

701
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,680
Spending time with you
only made me feel grateful and happy.

702
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,190
It's all thanks to you.

703
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,990
- Same here. I feel the same way.
- Okay.

704
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,100
- Both of them look so good now.
- Yes.

705
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,230
Things kept improving between them
throughout the show.

706
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,200
- Right.
- They never had a bump on the road.

707
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,770
- Right.
- It was smooth sailing for them.

708
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,400
From the last conversation they had,

709
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,640
this is almost a done deal.

710
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
They just need to register...

711
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,480
- their marriage.
- Yes.

712
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,320
("If You Name Your Heart")

713
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

714
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,220
(Soo Ah and Ji Min's conversation)

715
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,730
Actually, there are a lot of things
I wish I could have told you.

716
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,500
- I wanted to get to know you better.
- Okay.

717
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,730
I was drawn to you.

718
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,540
So I thought that...

719
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,040
I should be more honest and expressive.

720
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,840
But we didn't have a lot of time left.

721
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,080
- We couldn't build any memories together.
- Right.

722
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,380
- Right.
- Given the situation,

723
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,980
I should have been more direct.

724
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,280
But I couldn't do that...

725
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,880
because I was scared.

726
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,250
You're so transparent.

727
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,890
There was a time when I realized
that you were honest to a fault.

728
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,230
- After... Yes.
- When everyone was together?

729
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,830
It was my third day in the house.

730
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,300
(Day 3 since Soo Ah moved in)

731
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,570
- Je Yeon, do you want to drink it?
- It's a waste. Do you want to drink it?

732
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,400
- I have some left.
- You do? I see.

733
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,440
(It was clear
whom Ji Min was interested in.)

734
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,470
I knew whom you were going to pick.

735
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,740
But despite that,

736
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,710
I'm still telling you how I feel
because I want to do that.

737
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,610
Soo Ah didn't have much time.

738
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,350
You were the first person
I was curious about...

739
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,750
and romantically drawn to.

740
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,920
You've been away for two days.

741
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,220
So it's a risk for me to say this.

742
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,090
I know it too, but...

743
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,930
I want to know more about how you feel.

744
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,130
So I think it's better for me
to tell you this.

745
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,610
I'll be honest with you.

746
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,170
First off...

747
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,780
Ever since I joined this show,

748
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,780
I've been expressing my feelings
toward only one person.

749
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,120
This person whom I've been
expressing my feelings to...

750
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,890
- During the last two days,
- Okay.

751
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,720
she expressed her feelings to me as well.

752
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,090
- She did?
- Yes.

753
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,460
Of course, I don't know
what her choice will be tomorrow.

754
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,340
When I came home with this person
whom I expressed my feelings to,

755
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Yes?

756
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,110
I felt so relaxed.

757
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,810
- Is that so?
- Yes.

758
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,780
That's a relief. Isn't it?

759
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,280
He told her clearly.

760
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,380
I just want you to know, that's all.

761
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,550
Regardless of the final result,

762
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,290
I just wanted to express how I felt.

763
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,920
So...

764
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,830
I think I could...

765
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,960
clear my mind.

766
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,100
This is what I'm like.
When I'm focused on something,

767
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,870
I can't pay attention
to the other things around.

768
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,370
If I had upset you somehow...

769
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,040
because of that,

770
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,050
I'd like to apologize to you about it.

771
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,310
And...

772
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,820
if there's anything I can make up to you,

773
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,750
I'll do that.

774
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,350
You already did.

775
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,460
- Is that so?
- Yes.

776
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
You did great.

777
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,260
Gosh, my hands are sweaty.

778
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,770
Why? It's okay.

779
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,980
- You've done a great job.
- You too.

780
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,980
It seemed like she made him
feel comfortable to talk about it.

781
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,050
That's what she did.

782
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,420
(Smiling broadly)

783
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,890
(Soo Ah and Sang Yun's conversation)

784
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,900
You went through a lot. Seriously.

785
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,700
I think you and I talked
about this the most.

786
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,330
About what a shame it was
that we didn't have much time.

787
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,370
- Right.
- It was really tough for us.

788
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,970
Yes.

789
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,210
If I had come a week earlier.

790
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,310
If I had joined just three days earlier.

791
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,850
- Seriously. What a bummer.
- Yes.

792
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,750
I've never done the dishes
since I came here.

793
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,780
Really?

794
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,090
I feel bad for this.

795
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,190
I understand.

796
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,420
You're the only one who can understand me.

797
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,360
Right. That's true.

798
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,730
Actually, when you said that yesterday,

799
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,430
it made me feel like I would cry.

800
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,500
I thought I was the only one
who had felt that.

801
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,310
Because I was someone new to this place.

802
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,240
- You know, you came home late yesterday.
- Yes.

803
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,050
I thought someone on my side came.

804
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,150
(The two comforted each other
when they thought they were alone.)

805
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,650
So, even though I never said this,

806
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,620
I always felt thankful.

807
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,290
Actually,
I'm the one who should be thankful.

808
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,760
So...

809
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,030
I think...

810
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,400
I can make my choice now.

811
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,870
That's good to hear.

812
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,540
I think I can do it.

813
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,250
It was like a comradeship.

814
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,520
When I looked at Sang Yun
at times when my eyes were shaking,

815
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,750
I could see that his eyes
were shaking too.

816
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,190
There were times like that.

817
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,350
I felt close to him without noticing.

818
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,390
I guess I don't have to
feel uncomfortable.

819
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,760
Being comfortable with others?

820
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,160
I think that's really important.

821
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,770
The two went through so much. Seriously.

822
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,030
It must be so disappointing.

823
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,970
- Hi.
- Hello.

824
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,610
I found something on my way here.

825
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,640
I just picked it up on my way.

826
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Let me tell you what it is.

827
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,380
This is a postcard for Christmas, and...

828
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,050
- The dryer is not working.
- Okay.

829
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,050
- Really?
- We're drying them now.

830
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,890
Thank you, Chang Hwan.

831
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,090
I made some kimchi stew.

832
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,160
It seems like he's doing his best
until the end.

833
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,870
This is something
pilots and flight attendants use a lot.

834
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,570
Gosh, why is she...

835
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,770
Why are you crying? This is nothing. So...

836
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,710
It came to my mind, so I brought it.

837
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,590
- How are you doing?
- What do you mean?

838
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,790
You've been feeling down
for the last few days.

839
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,630
It wasn't delightful, but...

840
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:07,500
Like I said,
someone needed that kind of time.

841
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
And for me,

842
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,930
I thought...

843
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,770
I needed to spend some time like this.

844
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,420
There must be things
that you find charming,

845
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,660
and I might not have them.

846
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,620
But there are things that I have,

847
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,860
and I wanted you to find them charming.

848
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,470
I don't know how kind or nice
I was to you.

849
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,610
"I hope she felt it even for a moment."

850
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,740
"I hope she remembers me
as someone who was kind and nice."

851
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,540
"I hope..."

852
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,350
"she liked this."
That's what I've been thinking.

853
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,190
And that's how I've been watching you.

854
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,330
(Dwelling on
Chang Hwan's famous line again)

855
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,630
"Chang Hwan really cherishes me."

856
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,900
I did think this, though.

857
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,000
- Is he my dad or what?
- He's like a dad.

858
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,640
Before you came, I used to call him Dad.

859
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
I would go,
"Dad, what's for dinner today?"

860
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,810
Seriously.

861
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,650
This is touching.
There are no men like him.

862
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,580
That's true.
There are no men like him, honestly.

863
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,350
Even when you go out there,
there are no men like him.

864
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,490
Someone like Chang Hwan.

865
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,990
Without noticing,

866
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,830
there were times
I felt comfortable with you.

867
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,230
But...

868
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,410
But I think I need someone...

869
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,880
who can do more than
make me feel comfortable.

870
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,920
- I see.
- She made it clear for him.

871
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,530
I don't know if this is because
we didn't spend much time...

872
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,530
or because of this situation.

873
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,500
I think I need something more
that makes me think there's a connection.

874
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,770
So...

875
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,140
Goodness.

876
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,180
About Chang Hwan, he makes me
feel comfortable for just being there.

877
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,310
"There's someone who cares this much
and talks to me like this?"

878
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,320
You have no slippers?

879
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,250
"He's serious."

880
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,560
- I'll use a fork.
- Hold it.

881
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,460
You don't have chopsticks, right?

882
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,170
His feelings are very significant.

883
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,470
I'm only beginning...

884
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,270
to realize how I feel,

885
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,670
and we're nearing the end.

886
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,040
So, I couldn't answer him that easily.

887
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,810
I could tell, though.

888
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,360
Good job.

889
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,690
They're both awesome.

890
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,430
(The two were honest with each other
until the end.)

891
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

892
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,040
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun's conversation)

893
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,640
- These two have a lot...
- They have a lot to talk about.

894
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,410
- to talk about.
- I'm sure they do.

895
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,340
How long has it been since you joined us?

896
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,750
A few days, right?

897
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,480
I think this is the 12th day.

898
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,950
The 12th day?

899
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,420
It really was short.

900
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,020
It must have been so short for you.

901
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,660
Even a month was short for me.

902
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,460
But you've been here for 12 days.

903
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,600
That's all I've been saying.
That it was too short.

904
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,130
- That it was too short?
- Exactly.

905
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,000
You must have a lot of regrets.

906
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,310
(The gift from Je Yeon)

907
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,610
Have you made up your mind
regarding the final decision?

908
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,180
Me?

909
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,380
Yes. I've made up my mind now.

910
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,780
- I see.
- Yes.

911
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,320
Have you?

912
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,060
(Last night)

913
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,830
- Sang Yun, did you shower?
- Yes.

914
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
I was supposed to cook...

915
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,100
- What was it?
- Yes?

916
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,340
I meant to cook spaghetti alle vongole
on Thursday.

917
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,370
You did.

918
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,310
You don't need to feel bad about that.

919
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,310
Okay.

920
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,150
First of all,

921
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,850
I couldn't face her.

922
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,850
I just couldn't.

923
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,090
She approached me,
even though she knew I didn't choose her,

924
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
so I was grateful.

925
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,760
Should we head upstairs?

926
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,670
- This is our last moment together.
- I know.

927
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,100
Maybe it's because I've let it all go...

928
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,940
or she's made up her mind.

929
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,170
We would...

930
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,140
casually talk when we ran into each other.

931
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,780
Sang Yun, are you the only one here?

932
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,650
- No, they're upstairs.
- Are they?

933
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,490
- What's up?
- I'm in the massage chair.

934
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,920
- She's resting.
- I'm resting.

935
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,950
Have you eaten?

936
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,060
She laughed more easily than before.

937
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,890
I noticed that she felt more comfortable.

938
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,500
Je Yeon seems more relaxed now.

939
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,560
It's what I've always wanted to see,
in fact.

940
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,370
As I said
in front of everyone yesterday...

941
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,400
Yes.

942
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,410
The moment we shared on the ice rink...

943
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,610
I don't think...

944
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,150
I'll ever get to experience that
for the rest of my life.

945
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,580
- I see.
- I loved every part of it.

946
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,890
Okay.

947
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,890
- All three days.
- Right.

948
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,020
(He loved every moment of those 3 days.)

949
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,730
I also have a lot to thank you for.

950
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,470
I was genuinely touched
when you made breakfast for me.

951
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,210
I only did it because I wanted to.

952
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,950
The more I talk to you, the more I realize
I have a lot to learn from you...

953
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,990
and how amazing you are.

954
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,250
That's good.

955
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,560
I mean it.

956
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,590
Yes.

957
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,800
- Hi.
- I wonder who it is.

958
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,070
Hey.

959
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,540
You wore the necklace I gave you.

960
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,170
It looks good on you.

961
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,680
- It's beautiful.
- It suits you.

962
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,950
- Does it?
- Yes.

963
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,780
- It's really cute.
- Really?

964
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,480
- Thanks.
- Keep it on.

965
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,520
I will.

966
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,420
Ji Min is holding his smile again.

967
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,260
(Je Yeon and Ji Min's conversation)

968
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm sure you feel the same way,
but it doesn't feel like the end.

969
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,830
At least, that's how I feel.

970
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,600
It makes me feel like this will continue.

971
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
So, rather than saying goodbye,

972
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,310
I thought it'd be better
to express my gratitude.

973
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,340
Okay.

974
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,750
I wish...

975
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,520
I could continue to maintain
a good relationship with you.

976
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,890
The whole month has been ecstatic,
thanks to you.

977
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,790
So, I simply wanted to...

978
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,500
thank you.

979
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,440
Me too.

980
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,140
It was always fun when I was with you.

981
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,240
And I felt comfortable.

982
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,480
I realized...

983
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,980
that you could easily tell how I felt...

984
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,650
and what I was thinking.

985
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,160
It's not easy for me either.

986
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,130
I know that.

987
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,960
"Although it's been tough for you
as well,"

988
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,230
"you've been keeping an eye on me."

989
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,640
I'm thankful that you made me feel that.

990
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,540
You must have struggled...

991
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,780
as we took relationships
at different paces,

992
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,910
so thanks for waiting.

993
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,610
Yes, he did wait.

994
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,650
So, there's that.

995
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,820
Thank you.

996
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,820
- Let's...
- Yes?

997
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,860
keep getting along. The two of us.

998
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,830
Okay.

999
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,470
Good work.

1000
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,040
Good work.

1001
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,680
They're always so sincere.

1002
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,950
The way they converse is so mature.

1003
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,990
- Totally.
- Also,

1004
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,720
they did their best
with the most sincerity,

1005
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,360
so it even made me a little proud of them.

1006
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,230
(They make the viewers proud.)

1007
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,330
(For Once and For a Long Time)

1008
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,730
They're going out together?

1009
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,530
- Because it's the last day.
- It's so cold!

1010
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,870
I'll look forward to your driving.

1011
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,170
I'm going to swerve so hard.

1012
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,110
Thanks.

1013
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,580
Je Yeon can't sit in the front.

1014
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,180
- Wait.
- Your shoe fell off.

1015
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,210
Are you Cinderella?

1016
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,350
- What?
- I kicked my shoe...

1017
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,550
- Your shoe...
- toward Sang Yun.

1018
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,780
- You're Cinderella.
- I thought she was Cinderella.

1019
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,020
You totally are Cinderella.

1020
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,720
That's so funny.

1021
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,320
How do you feel?

1022
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,820
- I feel gratified.
- She's gratified.

1023
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,960
- Do you feel gratified?
- Yes, I feel at ease.

1024
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,230
That's good.

1025
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,100
I can't believe the day has come.

1026
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,970
I know.
It feels like we're going on a trip.

1027
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,100
I can't believe it's the last day.

1028
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,740
(They all leave together.)

1029
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,510
I noticed that you two...

1030
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,380
were especially physically tired...

1031
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,780
as we neared the end.

1032
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,180
- Me?
- Yes.

1033
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,220
I wasn't physically tired.

1034
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,050
I was emotionally struggling,

1035
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,050
- Right.
- That's right.

1036
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,420
and I couldn't sleep,
even though I had a lot of time.

1037
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,760
Like, "I have to talk to her tomorrow.
How should I bring it up?"

1038
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,760
I only slept an hour,
trying to organize my thoughts.

1039
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,360
- You only slept for an hour?
- Yes.

1040
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,100
I've only gotten 6 hours of sleep
in the last 2 days.

1041
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,000
I didn't want to leave any regrets,

1042
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,900
but I was worried
I wouldn't be able to talk.

1043
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,070
(Tossing)

1044
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,810
(He tossed and turned all night
due to his conflicted thoughts.)

1045
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,110
If I were Soo Ah,

1046
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,150
I would have felt too much pressure
about making a decision...

1047
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,620
- when it's only been a week.
- That's true.

1048
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,520
- She seems so depressed right now.
- Yes.

1049
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,820
- The pressure is immense, you know.
- I do.

1050
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,990
She had a hard time
falling asleep last night.

1051
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,830
(Soo Ah was also...)

1052
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,090
I see.

1053
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,700
(tossing and turning all night.)

1054
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,400
You also said that this wasn't the end.

1055
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
I did.

1056
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,110
Just like how you start over in real life,
you can share a meal...

1057
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,240
- Yes, we start over from scratch.
- Exactly.

1058
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,080
It's not like I want to hold on to her
no matter what.

1059
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,580
But I'm not exactly a quitter either.

1060
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,180
I'll keep things open to possibilities,

1061
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,720
and if they don't work out,

1062
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,220
I'll have to quit when it's time.

1063
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,390
- He honestly says what's on his mind.
- He does.

1064
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,890
(A rooftop cafe in Haebangchon)

1065
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,830
It's so beautiful.

1066
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,460
- Is it on the rooftop?
- Yes!

1067
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,770
(Amazed)

1068
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,200
It's so cute.

1069
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,400
I love it.

1070
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,110
(The open night view of Seoul
clears their minds.)

1071
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,910
It's so refreshing.

1072
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,150
- Should we take one?
- Do you want me to take one?

1073
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,190
Thanks.

1074
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,060
In 1, 2, 3.

1075
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,260
(Looking)

1076
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,000
Do you want to take a photo?

1077
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,030
In 1, 2, 3.

1078
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,470
- All the girls, come over.
- Only the girls.

1079
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,900
- Yes!
- Just the girls.

1080
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,270
I'll take one for them too.

1081
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,670
In 1, 2...

1082
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,970
- I'll just take them randomly.
- Okay.

1083
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,780
Let's giggle on the count of three.

1084
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,810
In 1, 2, 3.

1085
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,280
(Giggling)

1086
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,910
How lovely.

1087
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,550
Their eyes must be fixed
on the girls they like.

1088
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,620
You bet.

1089
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,020
The guys are too tall.
I can't keep all of you in one frame.

1090
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,720
- So cool.
- Let's take one.

1091
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,260
Are you guys the F5?

1092
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,760
Let's put our thumbs up.

1093
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,160
Yes, every man's typical pose.

1094
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,200
In 1, 2...

1095
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,870
In 1, 2, 3.

1096
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,300
Look up.

1097
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,000
All the guys are good-looking.

1098
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,380
- Okay.
- It's cute.

1099
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,340
Don't tell me you zoomed in on Woo Jae.

1100
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,380
I did.

1101
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,910
- To keep it for yourself?
- How did you know?

1102
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,190
I noticed that she was aiming at him,
and it made me wonder.

1103
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,050
- Why don't we take a selfie?
- Great idea.

1104
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,220
- Who has the longest arms?
- Right.

1105
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,520
- Is it Chang Hwan?
- Yes.

1106
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,790
- Come in.
- Get over here.

1107
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,930
You too, Je Yeon.

1108
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,460
Come on.

1109
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,930
- Are you in the shot?
- Yes.

1110
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,730
In 1, 2, 3.

1111
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,100
(A selfie with everyone
who spent December together)

1112
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,870
Oh,
they did spend all of December together.

1113
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,740
- That's nice.
- Yes.

1114
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,410
(Flashing)

1115
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,540
Oh, my gosh.

1116
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,280
That was like a flash grenade.

1117
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,120
(At the end of December)

1118
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,020
- It's so wholesome.
- Knowing...

1119
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,520
- that I won't see them next week,
- Right.

1120
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,860
it feels strange...

1121
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,920
- as I watch it.
- Yes.

1122
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,760
- I can sense all of their feelings.
- Same.

1123
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,260
Aren't we practically family
at this point?

1124
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,300
Exactly.

1125
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,670
(Surprised)

1126
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,870
- What is it?
- It's so...

1127
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,440
- Awesome!
- What's going on?

1128
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,110
- That's...
- Goodness.

1129
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,510
What is this?

1130
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,380
- They're photos.
- No way.

1131
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,620
- It's a collection of memories.
- They must get emotional.

1132
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,520
This is so touching.

1133
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,450
- It's amazing.
- Oh, my gosh.

1134
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,760
I almost burst into tears just now.

1135
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,820
These are all so cute!

1136
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,490
Oh, my gosh.

1137
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,460
- I'm sure they're emotional.
- This is incredible.

1138
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,200
This one's lovely.

1139
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,330
It is.

1140
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,670
I'm so touched.

1141
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,000
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- So am I.

1142
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,970
What's this?

1143
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,740
(Memories of the month
they shared together)

1144
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,410
It's back when we were in Florence.

1145
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,150
(Memories of the month
they shared together)

1146
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,480
I should pick one.

1147
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,320
This was so long ago.

1148
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,220
- This one looks fantastic.
- Right?

1149
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,690
- It's straight out of a drama.
- You're in a film noir.

1150
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,390
I love the colors in this one.

1151
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,900
Do you remember this, Ji Won?

1152
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,400
When we were walking in a group.

1153
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,230
- We used to walk around in a group.
- Yes.

1154
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,370
It's such a good memory.

1155
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,340
- Chae Eun looks so pretty in this one.
- I know.

1156
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,810
She's beautiful.

1157
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,310
He looks like an actor.

1158
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,950
- When was this?
- I'm not sure.

1159
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,520
- Italy?
- Oh, it's when we got...

1160
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,880
- the caricatures.
- I know.

1161
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,220
(Florence Republic Square, Italy)

1162
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,720
- "Comic?"
- Yes, comical.

1163
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,020
- No.
- Not comic.

1164
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,190
Not comic.

1165
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,300
(He repeatedly asked him
not to make them comic.)

1166
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,870
Not comic. Normal.

1167
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,300
A normal drawing. Yes.

1168
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,900
(But what they got was a comical drawing.)

1169
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,110
Oh, no!

1170
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,170
I don't think he understood.

1171
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,810
Is it funny?

1172
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,210
It looks good.

1173
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,850
Don't I look silly?

1174
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,050
This one looks great.

1175
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,450
- I'm smiling so brightly.
- She has such a pretty smile.

1176
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,090
I'd want to come back here.

1177
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,830
- With me?
- Yes.

1178
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,500
We look so good in it.

1179
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,770
It's like a still image of a drama.

1180
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,570
They have rice cake skewers.

1181
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,140
Do you want one?

1182
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,540
Should we share one?

1183
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1184
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:34,280
(The rice cake skewer that they shared)

1185
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,280
- It's good.
- It's so good that it makes you frown.

1186
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,390
I love it.

1187
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,730
It's lovely. It reminds me of that day.

1188
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,360
Right?

1189
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,730
- We take this, and put it...
- Yes.

1190
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,500
(Focused)

1191
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,800
And this one.

1192
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,840
This one?

1193
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,410
You feel like my dad.

1194
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,750
You're being so attentive next to me.

1195
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,750
Check this out. It's fantastic.

1196
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,620
- The color looks great.
- I like the vibe.

1197
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,960
Me too.

1198
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,030
Things never go as planned.

1199
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,800
That's why.

1200
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,740
(This December was so special
that they'll never be able to forget.)

1201
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,950
It would feel so nice
to review those moments...

1202
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,410
in photos.

1203
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,220
It even reminds us.

1204
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,380
So cool.

1205
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,640
These are like paintings.

1206
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,470
- Totally.
- Totally.

1207
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,850
- It feels so strange.
- Right?

1208
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:25,930
(How will they remember
these moments in the future?)

1209
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,800
(Sighing)

1210
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,330
I don't think any of them will be able
to forget this.

1211
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,000
It makes you realize that
this is the last episode, right?

1212
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,400
- Yes, I'm so sad.
- Indeed.

1213
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,570
All the things we said during the shoot...

1214
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,810
flash by.

1215
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,040
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

1216
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,870
I was rooting for every one of them.

1217
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,110
When you start watching it
from one person's perspective,

1218
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,450
you gradually root for that person.

1219
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,350
I'm sure the participants
also were reminded...

1220
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,420
of the past while looking at those photos.

1221
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,520
"This is how I felt back then."

1222
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,320
"Now, this is how I feel."

1223
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,620
Despite what happened,
all ten of them went out together tonight.

1224
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,090
- They're clinging to each other...
- Right.

1225
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,130
because they're happy.

1226
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,600
Doesn't it feel strange for no reason?

1227
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,900
(A strange feeling)

1228
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,730
I thought of each participant appearing...

1229
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,370
for the 1st time on Episode 1.

1230
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,640
- I didn't know about Ji Min's character.
- Right.

1231
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
Neither did I know about Woo Jae...

1232
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,380
nor Je Yeon.

1233
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,210
- Seriously.
- I realized once again...

1234
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,250
that it takes time
to understand someone's personality.

1235
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,550
You're right.

1236
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,350
It looks so lovely.

1237
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,950
I'm probably going to overeat.

1238
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,990
Isn't this the perfect party for Chae Eun?

1239
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,020
- An all-you-can-eat?
- This is amazing.

1240
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,490
They must think, "I can't believe
that I'm enjoying such luxury."

1241
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,160
It's so beautiful.

1242
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,770
This is really incredible.

1243
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,600
(Impressed)

1244
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Do you want some?

1245
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,510
- Thank you. Why don't we...
- Look at that.

1246
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,610
- Well done.
- Well done.

1247
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,650
This is great.

1248
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,580
(They enjoy their last dinner party.)

1249
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,850
It's good.

1250
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,190
(Humming)

1251
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,630
It looks delicious.

1252
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,830
Is it over there too?

1253
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,760
If you hand me the knife, I'll cut it.

1254
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,030
Chan Hyeong.

1255
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,030
(Diligent)

1256
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,840
I remember
when you cut the pistachio bread.

1257
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,280
- I know.
- Right.

1258
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,110
(Their awkward first day in Italy)

1259
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,410
Back then, he was with Ha Neul.

1260
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,780
(Chan Hyeong
cut the pistachio bread diligently.)

1261
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,420
What a memory.

1262
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,090
We only have memories left.

1263
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,260
That's true.

1264
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,290
A moment ago,

1265
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,960
I went upstairs for a minute.

1266
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,400
From seeing the empty kitchen,

1267
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,770
I got a strange mix of emotions.

1268
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,640
It's a place I can't return to again.

1269
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,710
Everyone has to leave now.

1270
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,940
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1271
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,610
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1272
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,110
It looks delicious.

1273
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,680
(Gathered around the table)

1274
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,820
(The days they spent together)

1275
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,490
(They spent...)

1276
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,990
(a lot of happy times together.)

1277
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,390
Goodness.

1278
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,160
- The past month must feel...
- Right.

1279
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,260
like a dream.

1280
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
When we were taking photos together,

1281
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,530
I got emotional.

1282
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,410
- Just cry.
- Cry?

1283
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,170
(Crying)

1284
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,750
- Did you bite your tongue?
- What?

1285
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,810
Did you bite your tongue?

1286
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,850
(He never disappoints us.)

1287
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,380
(Woo Jae makes them laugh until the end.)

1288
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,450
- Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae.

1289
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,260
(Sharing their last thought)

1290
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,430
They're sharing their thought.

1291
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,860
Some of us spent a month together.

1292
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,800
With Soo Ah and Sang Yun,

1293
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,340
we spent 1 or 2 weeks together.

1294
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,840
This is a December that I'll never forget.

1295
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,010
In that scene...

1296
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,550
(As they met precious people,)

1297
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,320
(no day went by without laughter.)

1298
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,630
I was very happy to spend time with you.

1299
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:21,760
Thank you.

1300
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,000
- Gosh.
- I feel emotional.

1301
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,070
For me...

1302
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,380
Before coming here,
my life was just about work.

1303
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,210
There was not much excitement or thrill...

1304
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,920
in my everyday life.

1305
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,990
(His mundane life...)

1306
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,660
(suddenly became meaningful.)

1307
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,300
I felt a lot of good energy,

1308
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,600
and I had an amazing time here.

1309
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,730
Aren't you one of his subscribers?

1310
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,100
You subscribed to him.

1311
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,540
(He could recharge...)

1312
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,180
(his tired body and mind.)

1313
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,110
I hope that our relationship...

1314
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,880
will continue.

1315
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,090
They won't get to experience it again.

1316
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,920
Chang Hwan is about to cry.

1317
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,590
I avoided...

1318
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,800
meeting new people.

1319
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,270
I was busy.

1320
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:37,070
For a while, I thought that
meeting new people was pointless.

1321
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,280
"How efficiently am I spending my time
when meeting people?"

1322
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,080
I knew the value of my time.

1323
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,750
I found myself calculating
whether the value matched...

1324
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,180
what I was gaining from meeting someone.

1325
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:54,620
Then I became a child again.

1326
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,190
In Italy, we didn't know...

1327
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,060
each other's age or occupation.

1328
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,900
Without knowing anything,

1329
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,070
we met each other casually like friends.

1330
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,930
(The time when they could see each other
for who they truly were)

1331
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,100
My life got richer.

1332
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,710
I thought, "I can actually live..."

1333
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,240
"a better life."

1334
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,210
So I'd like to thank you again.

1335
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,420
It must feel so strange.

1336
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,920
To be honest,

1337
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,960
I've been feeling...

1338
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,890
quite empty inside recently.

1339
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,330
- Promise me that we'll get sundaeguk.
- Okay.

1340
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,540
(I found myself in high spirits.)

1341
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:47,210
It awakened the emotional side of me...

1342
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,210
that had been numb.

1343
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,680
I don't think...

1344
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,650
I'll get another chance
to meet people like you.

1345
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,490
And, so...

1346
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,660
Thank you.

1347
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,960
Everyone is getting emotional.

1348
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,460
Well, I...

1349
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,570
This is very moving.

1350
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,980
She must've been emotionally drained.

1351
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,190
It's the same for me.

1352
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,290
During our month together,

1353
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,260
so many things happened.

1354
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,360
I also made so many memories.

1355
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,630
Two? Like this?

1356
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,830
- Your arm around me?
- Yes.

1357
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,200
(Close)

1358
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,470
(Days filled with unforgettable moments)

1359
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,910
(Approaching)

1360
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,540
- Am I gripping too hard?
- Yes.

1361
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,950
(Someone who makes you laugh
over trivial things)

1362
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:03,150
Each of you is amazing, beautiful,

1363
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:06,020
kind, and sweet.

1364
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,360
I got to know you.

1365
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,660
Being able to continue
my relationship with each of you...

1366
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,600
is such a big and generous gift.

1367
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,470
That's what I keep thinking.

1368
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:29,280
Thank you so much for being there...

1369
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,110
and getting along with me.

1370
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,020
(Every day was like a present.)

1371
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,020
I love you.

1372
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,090
Don't cry.

1373
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,900
Goodness.

1374
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:08,980
I got very worried when I entered my 30s.

1375
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:15,260
Until then, I had lived my life working
endlessly and always doing something.

1376
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,690
I thought that...

1377
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,760
I was growing and developing myself,

1378
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,630
but strangely, I kept feeling empty.

1379
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,140
I had rarely opened my heart to someone...

1380
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,140
and approached first.

1381
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,110
It was because...

1382
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,710
I was afraid of what
the other person would think of me.

1383
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,150
Fear played a big part.

1384
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,880
I faced that fear here
in such a short period of time.

1385
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,120
(Despite the short period of time,)

1386
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,220
(she was more honest than anyone else.)

1387
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,830
(Soo Ah was more sincere
than anyone else.)

1388
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,370
(Can I spend Christmas with you?)

1389
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,740
Thankfully...

1390
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,410
no one tried to push me away.

1391
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,610
Everyone tried to accept
my fragile yet beautiful side.

1392
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,420
So I thought, "I must be very blessed."

1393
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,190
"I'm being rewarded for the efforts
I made in the past."

1394
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,980
That's what I thought,
so thank you very much.

1395
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,210
I'll do my best
to continue for a long time.

1396
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,490
Je Yeon is about to speak.

1397
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,670
I got to meet wonderful people.

1398
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,180
Spending time with you was meaningful,
and it made me happy.

1399
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,180
And...

1400
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:24,020
I've been grateful to you
for taking care of me.

1401
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,890
I tend to keep...

1402
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,830
my problems to myself.

1403
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,300
I haven't been able to listen
to each of your concerns...

1404
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,270
Oh, no. She must be getting emotional.

1405
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,810
Oh, no.

1406
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,660
Why is it so sad to see Je Yeon cry?

1407
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,160
- Ha Neul, are you moving?
- Yes, I'm moving.

1408
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,060
- Don't go.
- Should I stay?

1409
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,060
- Should I stay, Je Yeon?
- Stay.

1410
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,070
(Hopping)

1411
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,530
(She wasn't quick.)

1412
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,500
Should I stay?

1413
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,900
Don't go.

1414
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,270
(However,
Je Yeon was always warm and kind.)

1415
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:20,210
How did you act cute?

1416
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,640
No, I didn't act cute.

1417
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,880
- No?
- He's just teasing me.

1418
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,910
- Come on.
- I didn't act cute.

1419
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:27,650
That's cute.

1420
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,050
Let's pour it first.

1421
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,550
(Although it wasn't obvious,)

1422
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,590
I'll try it.

1423
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:36,390
(you could feel warmth in her.)

1424
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,990
- It's really good.
- Is it?

1425
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,390
- It's delicious.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1426
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,500
You're a good cook.

1427
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,760
Your gomtang is delicious.

1428
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,370
- It's really good.
- Really?

1429
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,170
- How do you make your broth?
- Right.

1430
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,940
You did a good job.

1431
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,880
You treated us well. Don't worry.

1432
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,160
Thank you.

1433
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:17,030
Even after spending a week at a retreat,

1434
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,130
- Seriously.
- everyone cries at the end.

1435
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,170
Everyone gets so close.

1436
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:22,600
It must have been emotionally draining
during the month.

1437
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,470
Due to so many mixed emotions...

1438
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,140
(They must feel a mix of emotions.)

1439
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,580
For me,

1440
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,610
I thought...

1441
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,620
that I would never like someone again.

1442
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:42,460
Like we do in our early 20s...

1443
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,830
I thought it was impossible
to get to know people for who they are.

1444
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,160
Can we share it?

1445
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,570
I'd love to.

1446
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,770
You have to consider their background...

1447
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,900
and age.

1448
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,070
We live in that environment.

1449
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,080
"Will I be able to get into it?"

1450
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,450
That was a concern I had.

1451
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,650
You're eating raw fish two days in a row
because of me.

1452
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,620
- I'm so happy.
- Is it okay with you?

1453
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,690
I'm very happy.

1454
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,420
- You're very happy?
- I can eat it again tomorrow.

1455
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:14,720
Tomorrow?

1456
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,420
Then let's get raw fish again tomorrow.

1457
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,560
Like in my teens and early 20s,

1458
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,200
can I still love someone so purely?

1459
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,500
Realizing that I can still open up...

1460
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,700
and like someone...

1461
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,300
makes me happy.

1462
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,940
(It was one happy month.)

1463
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,550
This is...

1464
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,850
a very important turning point in my life.

1465
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,680
It was an honor to spend...

1466
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,390
the end of my last year in my 20s
with amazing people like you.

1467
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:54,300
For the emotional side of me
that I know I lack,

1468
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,770
I learned a lot from you.

1469
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,970
(Unaware of them for a long time)

1470
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,500
(Unfamiliar feelings)

1471
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,080
I wanted to see the look on your face.

1472
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,740
The look on my face?

1473
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,720
(It was a chance
to understand myself better.)

1474
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,120
Thank you.

1475
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,220
It was nice and concise like Sang Yun.

1476
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,230
- It's our...
- Ha Neul.

1477
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,150
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

1478
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,680
I can relate to Ha Neul's tears the most.

1479
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,990
I agree.

1480
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,450
(Stay strong, Ha Neul.)

1481
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,560
Ji Won is also crying.

1482
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,860
Goodness.

1483
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,290
She must have a lot to say.

1484
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,430
From the beginning,

1485
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,370
I hoped that everyone would be happy.

1486
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,740
(Hoping that everyone is happy
during their stay)

1487
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,040
I hoped that we would leave here with joy.

1488
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,440
That's what I thought.

1489
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,550
Ssanghwatang?

1490
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,450
- Gosh.
- Take both of them.

1491
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,420
- Take it for your upset stomach.
- Should I cry?

1492
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,650
It's for you.

1493
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,590
- Did you do well?
- Yes.

1494
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,560
(That's what she hoped for
during the month.)

1495
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,890
Like this?

1496
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,860
This morning, everyone looked...

1497
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:40,970
very happy.

1498
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:44,410
It made me happy as well.

1499
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,310
I was relieved as well.

1500
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,450
(During that month,)

1501
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,320
(Ha Neul's wishes had already come true.)

1502
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,950
Let's be even happier.

1503
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,960
Thank you.

1504
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:07,490
She's so sweet.

1505
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,000
Do I take it from the top again, then?

1506
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,900
- That's hilarious.
- I love how Woo Jae is.

1507
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,100
The three of us should probably go again.

1508
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,440
We weren't as good.

1509
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,240
Maybe you should say more.

1510
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,940
- You should.
- I didn't start things off well.

1511
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:24,880
I don't think I said anything personal.

1512
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,510
I don't know when things took a turn,
but...

1513
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,690
(A month full of memories
is now coming to an end.)

1514
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,920
(The bell finally rings.)

1515
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,060
It's time.

1516
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,360
Was that the final bell?

1517
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,390
Yes.

1518
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,860
- I want a bite.
- Let me cut it first.

1519
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,900
- Let's cut the cake.
- I'll try it first.

1520
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,140
"Have you found the one you want
to share your life with?"

1521
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,110
(Have you found the one you want
to share your life with?)

1522
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:06,350
(Express your feelings to them
through a postcard.)

1523
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,830
(Who you write to
will be your final choice.)

1524
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,660
Oh, dear.

1525
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Now, it's time for the ultimate choice.

1526
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,070
(Tuscany, Italy)

1527
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,210
(A place where nothing felt familiar)

1528
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,710
(For a moment,
they forgot about everything else.)

1529
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,890
(Instead, during that time,
they saw only each other.)

1530
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,420
- I'd love to come back here.
- Me too.

1531
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,030
(After 5 days together,)

1532
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,590
(they sent their first postcards.)

1533
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,460
(Seoul)

1534
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,870
(They were met with reality.)

1535
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,700
(Being in a different time zone
and place...)

1536
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:02,640
(changed how they felt about each other.)

1537
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,750
(New beginnings...)

1538
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,480
(and goodbyes)

1539
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:16,060
(Unfamiliar and puzzling feelings)

1540
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,860
Right? That'd be so tasty.

1541
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,700
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's mine.

1542
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:28,370
(Their hearts fluttered,)

1543
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,500
(ached with longing,)

1544
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,610
(and overflowed with emotions.)

1545
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,150
(Wind back the clock of memories.)

1546
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:49,160
(When you look back on your time,)

1547
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:54,190
(who made your heart flutter the most?)

1548
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,300
(who made your heart flutter the most?)

1549
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:02,540
(After much thought,)

1550
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,780
(it's time to express
what's in your heart.)

1551
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:12,210
(Will the heartfelt words
in their postcards...)

1552
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,920
(reach the one they've chosen?)

1553
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,690
(Do you see the couples
who found their special someone?)

1554
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,660
(Mission 16:
Guess the final pairings now.)

1555
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,130
During this month,

1556
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,830
they must have experienced
a whirlwind of emotions.

1557
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,400
They had to win over the one they liked,

1558
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,870
all while being approached
by someone unexpected.

1559
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,300
At one point,

1560
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,840
I imagined how it would feel to be...

1561
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,100
in their shoes.

1562
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,240
Some days,
I would've been excited to return...

1563
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,770
to the Pairing House,

1564
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,910
but on others,

1565
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:44,650
- I would've wanted to escape it.
- Exactly.

1566
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,180
Through the show,

1567
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,710
I learned how to be...

1568
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,950
in a relationship.

1569
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,780
Also, I was reminded that
my hunches were completely off.

1570
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,220
(Laughing)

1571
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,590
And now...

1572
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:55,820
(Attention, everyone.)

1573
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,760
This is to win a hotel stay in Italy.

1574
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,260
I had forgotten about that.

1575
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,490
The one who guesses best...

1576
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,900
will win a two-night stay
in the Tuscany Pairing House.

1577
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,430
To stay beyond two nights,
pay for the extra nights yourself.

1578
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,730
What a bummer.

1579
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:06,900
Now,

1580
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,100
let's see who's captured the hearts...

1581
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,340
of the ten residents.

1582
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,610
- Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae.

1583
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,770
This is an easy one.

1584
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,240
Woo Jae will choose Ji Won.

1585
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,240
- Of course.
- Sure.

1586
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,780
Next is Ji Min.

1587
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
(Ji Min's choice)

1588
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,950
- Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

1589
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,210
Ji Min will choose Je Yeon.

1590
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,380
Chan Hyeong?

1591
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,620
- Chae Eun.
- Chae Eun.

1592
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,020
There we go.

1593
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,290
- No arguments there.
- Of course.

1594
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:27,450
Chang Hwan.

1595
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,520
Soo Ah.

1596
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,620
He'll choose Soo Ah, right?

1597
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,720
- Yes.
- Yes, Soo Ah.

1598
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,990
Until the very end.

1599
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,430
(Until the very end, he'll choose Soo Ah.)

1600
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,130
The toughest guy to read. Sang Yun.

1601
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,970
(Will he pick Chae Eun,
the one he had a friendly bond with?)

1602
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,170
There's one scene that's been on my mind.

1603
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,700
Last week,

1604
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,700
he didn't talk about Chae Eun,

1605
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,210
- but brought up Je Yeon instead.
- That's right.

1606
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,240
(All night long,
Sang Yun thought about Je Yeon.)

1607
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,210
I believe...

1608
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,280
that was him speaking from the heart.

1609
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:54,510
They're not sending texts
but writing postcards.

1610
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,850
Since they're writing postcards,

1611
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,920
I think...

1612
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,850
he'll write to someone
he shares more memories with.

1613
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,360
I'll also choose Je Yeon.

1614
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,990
All right, then.

1615
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,620
Next up is Je Yeon.

1616
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,460
- Je Yeon...
- Right. We know who she's choosing.

1617
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,630
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

1618
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:09,800
(Has Je Yeon decided on Ji Min?)

1619
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,160
What about Ji Won?

1620
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:12,930
Woo Jae.

1621
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,470
Chae Eun will choose Chan Hyeong.

1622
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,200
Chae Eun, Chan Hyeong.

1623
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,210
(They predict Chae Eun
will choose Chan Hyeong.)

1624
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,880
What about Ha Neul?

1625
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,340
- Ji Min, of course.
- Ji Min.

1626
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,580
- Ji Min?
- My guess is Ji Min.

1627
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,350
She'll express her gratitude.

1628
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,080
If that's the case,
Soo Ah will also choose Ji Min.

1629
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,420
(Did Soo Ah...)

1630
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,150
(choose Ji Min?)

1631
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,590
- Ji Min for me.
- I think so.

1632
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
I want to focus on Soo Ah's...

1633
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,390
last conversation.

1634
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:42,900
I feel like her conversation with Sang Yun
came out of nowhere.

1635
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,400
- She left the door open for him.
- Right.

1636
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,730
I think...

1637
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,600
Soo Ah chose Sang Yun.

1638
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,510
Wait. Hold on.

1639
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,840
I want to say that Sang Yun chose Soo Ah.

1640
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,170
Really?

1641
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,410
- Then they'll be paired.
- Right.

1642
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,710
I'm changing my prediction too.

1643
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,750
In my mind,
I can't allow Soo Ah and Sang Yun...

1644
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,950
to be paired.

1645
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,350
(Laughing)

1646
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,920
The show wouldn't be able
to explain the couple.

1647
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,850
(There's no way to describe the couple.)

1648
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,850
The pair came out of nowhere.

1649
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,890
(A couple without a backstory)

1650
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,290
- We think Sang Yun chose Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

1651
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,860
We share the same view.

1652
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,990
- Except for Soo Ah.
- Right.

1653
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,830
- Chung Ah and I...
- We have the same predictions.

1654
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,760
Mimi and I have the same predictions.

1655
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,030
Let's take a look.

1656
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:21,770
Who did Woo Jae choose?

1657
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,240
Drum roll.

1658
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,270
(Coming soon)

1659
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,970

1660
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,910
(The end of a memorable winter)

1661
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:33,580
(Nervous but also excited)

1662
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,710
He's nervous.

1663
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,180
(Nervous but also excited)

1664
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,520
(They head to their meeting spots.)

1665
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,790
(Who did Chang Hwan choose?)

1666
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,560
They're calling each other
from their real phones for the first time.

1667
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,360
(Who did Chang Hwan choose?)

1668
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,970
(Well...)

1669
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,140
Soo Ah.

1670
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,780
It's me.

1671
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,680
This is embarrassing.

1672
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,980
(Chang Hwan's final decision is Soo Ah.)

1673
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,950
As we expected,

1674
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:12,020
- Chang Hwan chose Soo Ah.
- Right.

1675
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,450
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

1676
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,090
(Chang Hwan chose Soo Ah.)

1677
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,330
It's cold, isn't it?

1678
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,860
Are you wearing the muffler?

1679
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:28,270
(Before leaving,
he gave Soo Ah a muffler.)

1680
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,540
Good. I'm glad.

1681
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,740
(Soo Ah wore the muffler.)

1682
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:35,610
I'm just grateful
you wore the muffler today.

1683
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,340
Goodness.

1684
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,450
Anyway,

1685
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,850
that's what I'll think.

1686
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:48,490
I think I've expressed
everything I was feeling.

1687
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,930
I hope...

1688
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,700
that you also follow your heart.

1689
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,530
Thanks to you,

1690
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,240
the last week at the house was a blast.

1691
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,110
It was a blast.

1692
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,780
I like how he said it was a blast.

1693
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:18,690
(He calmly expressed his feelings.)

1694
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,720
(Will Chang Hwan's feelings be returned?)

1695
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,430
That's the best he could do, right?

1696
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,730
Exactly. You're right.

1697
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,360
(Chang Hwan did his best.)

1698
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,170
Who's that? It's Woo Jae.

1699
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:38,770
(Woo Jae's final decision)

1700
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:45,310
(Who will Woo Jae call?)

1701
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,180
(The one Woo Jae holds in his heart)

1702
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,990
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,260
Hey.

1704
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,220
Ji Won.

1705
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,560
- Of course.
- It's me.

1706
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,560
(Woo Jae's final decision is Ji Won.)

1707
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,130
Ji Won's smiling like a baby.

1708
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,540
I enjoyed all of our time together.

1709
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,610
(The two brought each other great joy.)

1710
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,470
Thanks for everything.

1711
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,080
Will I be able to see you today?

1713
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,520
Woo Jae's final decision is Ji Won.

1714
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,020
Of course, he chose Ji Won.

1715
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:32,860
Next, we'll see who Chan Hyeong chose.

1716
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,230
(Who did Chan Hyeong choose
for his final decision?)

1717
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,070
I'm nervous about this couple.

1718
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,280
I bet hearing each other's voice
on the phone will feel different.

1719
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,780
Hello?

1720
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,380
Hello?

1721
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,350
Hey.

1722
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,790
Hey.

1723
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,220
- Of course.
- There.

1724
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,220
- As expected.
- Chan Hyeong's final decision...

1725
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,260
is Chae Eun.

This past month...

1729
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,300
has been special for me.

1730
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,740
I experienced a whole new kind...

1731
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,740
of excitement.

1732
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:27,610
You were so understanding
during my busiest times.

1733
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:33,520
(When Chan Hyeong was busy,
Chae Eun put him first.)

1734
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,890
You worried about me
more than I worried about myself.

1735
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:40,790
I feel like I received more from you...

1736
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,200
than I was able to give.

1737
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,970
If there's ever a chance,

1738
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,810
I'd want you to let us...

1739
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,470
spend more time together,

1740
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,640
so I can make it up to you.

1741
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,320

1743
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:09,190
- This is great. I'm loving it.
- Really?

01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,190
(Taking pleasure in it from afar)

1745
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:18,800
(Ji Min gave his heart to only one woman.)

1746
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:26,770
(Who will be Ji Min's final choice?)

1747
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,750
Hello?

1748
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:45,260
- Hi.
- He's already loving it.

1749
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:47,130
Can you guess who I am?

1750
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,060
It's cold, isn't it?

1751
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,100
It's freezing.

1752

Je Yeon,

1753
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,270
for a whole month,

1754
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,440
because you were here,

1755
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:09,050
my heart raced, and I had so much fun.

1756
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,850
We made so many romantic memories...

01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:14,850
I'll never forget.

1758
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,660
His final decision is Je Yeon.

1759
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:22,030
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

1760
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,870
Now,
let's see who Sang Yun's final choice was.

1761
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,400
Who did Sang Yun choose?

1762
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,400
(The moment of truth is here.)

1763
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,740
I still can't read Sang Yun.

1764
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,740
This is a tough one.

1765
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:32,770
(It's hard to guess
what Sang Yun is feeling.)

1766
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:40,510
(Sang Yun's final decision)

1767
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,320
(He had less time than the others.)

1768
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:46,820
So...

1769
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,950
(That's why it was hard for him
to choose.)

1770
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,290
- I think he'll choose Je Yeon.
- Right.

1771
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,890
(Who did Sang Yun choose?)

1772
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,030
- Hello?
- It's Je Yeon.

1773
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,060
Hello?

1774
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,570
(Sang Yun's final decision is Je Yeon.)

1775
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,370
- Goodness.
- It's Je Yeon.

1776
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,040
It's freezing, isn't it?

1777
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,110
It is.

1778
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,110
It was always you.

1779
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,550
Really?

1780
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,620
Everywhere we went was beautiful.

1781
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,560
I truly enjoyed our time together.

1782
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,360
That's all I needed to hear.

1783
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,400
Thank you.

1784
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,650
It's a bummer, though.

1785
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:50,320
Sang Yun's feelings for her were sincere.

1786
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,420
(He's so cool.)

1787
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,160
Sang Yun's final decision is Je Yeon.

1788
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,460
(Sang Yun chose Je Yeon.)

1789
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:04,130
(Now, Let's See Who the Ladies Chose.)

1790
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:10,900
(Who did the women choose?)

1791
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,610
(After much thought,)

1792
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:21,680
(it's now time to choose.)

1793
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:28,320
(Who did Ha Neul end up choosing?)

1794
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,560
We'll see who Ha Neul chose.
Who did she choose?

1795
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,560
(Well?)

1796
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:35,760
I wonder what she's feeling right now.

1797
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,580
(After collecting her thoughts,)

1798
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:54,150
(she places the call.)

1799
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,550
Hello?

1800
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,090
Hello?

1801
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:08,190
- Hello?
- Hey.

1802
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,230
Who are you?

1803
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,570
Can you tell who I am?

1804
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,400
By just your voice, yes.

1805
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:19,610
I just called you.

1806
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:25,450
Ji Min, thanks for this past month.

1807
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,520
Why are you thanking me
when I only tortured you?

1808
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,290
I was grateful for even that.

1809
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:41,390
Don't stay outside in the cold
for too long.

1810
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,200
You too.

1811
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,660
Okay.

1812
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,470
(Ha Neul's final decision is Ji Min.)

1813
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:55,740
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

1814
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:58,340
(Ha Neul chose Ji Min.)

1815
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,680
She's straightforward.

1816
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,950
That makes it much better.

1817
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,650
- Ha Neul's final decision was Ji Min.
- Yes.

1818
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,120
Great work, Ha Neul.

1819
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,320
Now then,
what's Chae Eun's final decision?

1820
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,090
(To whom...)

1821
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:18,900
(will Chae Eun's feelings be directed?)

1822
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:29,180
(A mysterious person)

1823
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,450
(A transparent person)

1824
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,750
Oh, no.

1825
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,420
Hello?

1826
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,980
(Smiling)

1827
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,690
Hi, Chan Hyeong.

1828
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:41,350
Hi.

1829
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,960
Were you waiting for my call?

1830
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:44,460
Of course.

1831
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,060
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

1832
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,430
(Chae Eun chose Chan Hyeong.)

1833
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:52,700
Even Chae Eun's song is cheerful.

1834
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,170
I know, right? The background music.

1835
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:55,400
It's therapeutic.

1836
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,640
- Since you must be cold,
- Yes?

1837
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:01,170
I'll make it short.

1838
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,310
- It doesn't have to be short.
- Really?

1839
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,750
- Brace yourself.
- "Brace yourself."

1840
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,980
Let's pull an all-nighter.

1841
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:14,050
Would you like to come over?

1842
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,860
I'm on my way.

1843
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,060
Should we grab something to eat together?

1844
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,090
I'm in.

1845
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,470
- He's walking like a baby.
- Why are you running?

1846
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:30,040
- Why did you run?
- Why are you outside?

1847
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,800
I was waiting for you.

1848
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,610
You ran so fast.

1849
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:37,780
I could even hear you coming from afar.

1850
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,250
You sure are different.

1851
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,120
(Chae Eun also chose Chan Hyeong.)

1852
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,320
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

1853
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,320
Okay.

1854
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,090
- I'm really happy to see you.
- Same here.

1855
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,060
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun
have become a pair.

1856
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:52,290
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun)

1857
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,430
The two suit each other. Right?

1858
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,560
There were no twists.

1859
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,630
Next is Ji Won's final decision.

1860
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:01,030
(Is Woo Jae also Ji Won's final decision?)

1861
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:02,030
Please.

1862
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:05,070
(Is Woo Jae also Ji Won's final decision?)

1863
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:09,610
Hello?

1864
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,410
- Woo Jae, it's me.
- Hey.

1865
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,280
A callback.

1866
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,380
(Touched)

1867
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,450
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

1868
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:23,260
(Ji Won chose Woo Jae.)

1869
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:27,930
- Woo Jae looks happy.
- Where are you right now?

1870
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,460
Me?

1871
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,570
I'm somewhere.

1872
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,570
I'm under a tree.

1873
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,440
- "Under a tree?"
- Where?

1874
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,610
Let's have dinner together.

1875
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:49,050
(Ji Won's final decision is Woo Jae.)

1876
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,890
- Ji Won.
- Woo Jae.

1877
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,160
(Hugging)

1878
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,890
(Their dreams come true.)

1879
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:02,800
(They are overjoyed.)

1880
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,000
I'm so happy.

1881
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,000
(Hugging)

1882
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,670
- What was that?
- I wanted to hug you.

1883
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:13,440
- Isn't it cold?
- I'm okay.

1884
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:15,810
Thanks for coming.

1885
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,380
All right. Ji Won.

1886
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,450
(Suddenly hit with reality)

1887
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,080
So that's the kind of face I make.

1888
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,420
Woo Jae and Ji Won have become a pair.

1889
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,290
(Congratulations.)

1890
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:35,260
(Woo Jae and Ji Won)

1891
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,360
Shall we move on?

1892
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,730
What's...

1893
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,170
Soo Ah's final decision?

1894
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,000
- Our guesses are different here.
- Yes.

1895
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:46,410
I think it'll be Ji Min.

1896
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,540
(Not confident)

1897
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,280
- Soo Ah's a tough one.
- I'm all nervous.

1898
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:56,850
(Who does Soo Ah have feelings for?)

1899
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,260
(In the final moment,)

1900
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:09,060
(the faces flash through her heart.)

1901
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,970
I don't mind being wrong.
I just hope she becomes a pair.

1902
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,840
(Please let it be Sang Yun.)

1903
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:39,390
Hello?

1904
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,160
Hello?

1905
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,340
What is it?

1906
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:50,970
- It's Sang Yun.
- Sang Yun.

1907
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:51,970
- It's Sang Yun, right?
- Yes.

1908
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,210
(Ji Seon, Si Won, and Mimi
guessed Soo Ah's decision.)

1909
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,680
Right? Yes!

1910
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,680
(Come, Tuscany!)

1911
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,340
What a twist.

1912
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,580
(This show has a good twist.)

1913
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,350
- I didn't think you'd call.
- He didn't expect it.

1914
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,650
- Right?
- As you said,

1915
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:08,920
- we didn't have enough time.
- Yes.

1916
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,020
- It's a shame.
- Exactly.

1917
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,660
I don't think I'll get...

1918
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,830
to experience such happiness again.

1919
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,300
No, you can after the show.

1920
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,100
We can all get along well after the show.

1921
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,300
True.

1922
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,880
(Sighing)

1923
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:34,210
I really enjoyed our time together.

1924
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:38,480
While going through a lot,
I found myself laughing with you the most.

1925
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:40,590
- Your words...
- Yes?

1926
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:42,590
- cheer me up.
- They do?

1927
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:48,160
Thank you. I mean it.

1928
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:50,130
(Thinking)

1929
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:54,470
Soo Ah's final decision is Sang Yun.

1930
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,000
(Soo Ah chose Sang Yun.)

1931
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,740
I'm starting to think that
Mimi and I got them all right.

1932
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:01,410
I think it'll be Professor Ji Seon.

1933
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,880
Now then,

1934
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,850
what's Je Yeon's final decision?

1935
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:07,750
Come on!

1936
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,560
(For whom does Je Yeon have feelings?)

1937
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,100
(The person...)

1938
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:32,770
(who made my heart flutter
out of the blue one day)

1939
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,610
(The person...)

1940
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:40,180
(who always had his eyes on me)

1941
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,990
(After much deliberation,)

1942
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:57,900
(she makes the call.)

1943
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:03,770
(Who is Je Yeon's final choice?)

1944
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,920
Hi.

1945
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:19,790
Je Yeon's final decision was Ji Min.

1946
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,850
(Je Yeon chose Ji Min.)

1947
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,060
You being on this show...

1948
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:26,430
made it enjoyable.

1949
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:29,500
And the more I get to know you,

1950
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,500
the more I realize how attentive
and warmhearted you are.

1951
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,070
I'm hungry.

1952
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:40,840
(How cute.)

1953
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,610
- Hi.
- I kept you waiting, didn't I?

1954
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:48,710
What took you so long?

1955
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,420
They're giving me butterflies.

1956
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,520
Ji Min and Je Yeon have become a pair.

1957
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,490
Congratulations.

1958
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,220
(Ji Min and Je Yeon)

1959
01:35:56,590 --> 01:35:57,820
It's perfect.

1960
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:00,490
(This is the final destination of love.)

1961
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,400
It's warm and nice in here.

1962
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,230
I have something for you.

1963
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,370
Check what's underneath the tray.

1964
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:15,540
(Surprised)

1965
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,580
Is it a surprise?

1966
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:21,710
What did he write?

1967
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,050
(Dear Chae Eun,
I've made unforgettable memories...)

1968
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:27,420
(in this one month,
which felt both long and short.)

1969
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:30,060
(Please give me the chance
to make you even happier.)

1970
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,590
(Thank you, and you make me happy!)

1971
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:34,560
(From Chan Hyeong)

1972
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,030
Chan Hyeong.
This is truly so sweet of you.

1973
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,500
The way you wrote it is right up my alley.

1974
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,170
I think they're really cute.

1975
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:46,570
(Chan Hyeong.
Meeting you has helped me discover...)

1976
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:48,770
(parts of myself and feel emotions
I've never experienced before.)

1977
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:49,810
Thanks.

1978
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,810
(Thanks for gifting me such fun, exciting,
and relaxing moments. From Chae Eun.)

1979
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:01,820
(To Ji Min, I can still vividly remember,)

1980
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,720
(and will never forget,
the moment you opened the door...)

1981
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,160
(and walked in on our first day in Italy.)

1982
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,860
She remembers everything.

1983
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,060
I thought you were a hedgehog.

1984
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,130
Me?

1985
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,270
But you turned out to be a puppy
wanting to become a fox.

1986
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:20,070
(The more I talked to you,
the more I realized how attentive...)

1987
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:23,010
(and warmhearted you are, much more
than my first impression of you.)

1988
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:25,840
(Let's continue to have fun
and honest conversations!)

1989
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,650
(Great work over the last month!
From Je Yeon)

1990
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,550
(Hi, Je Yeon.
How was our one month together?)

1991
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:35,420
(Because of you,
I made many memories I'll never forget.)

1992
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,620
(I hope only happiness lies
ahead for you.)

1993
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,790
(Thank you for gifting me
an unforgettable December.)

1994
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,830
(Wrapping up one month...)

1995
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:41,890
Thank you.

1996
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,360
(in the Pairing House with you.)

1997
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,660
Me too.

1998
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,570
How exciting.

1999
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:53,210
(To Ji Won. The way your sweet eyes...)

2000
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,310
(looked at me with sincerity
felt warm and kind.)

2001
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:56,940
(Our time here may be ending,)

2002
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,980
(but I hope this is the start
of a new chapter for us.)

2003
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,050
(Thank you for gifting me
an unforgettable December! From Woo Jae)

2004
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,950
(To Woo Jae. Getting to know you...)

2005
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:10,220
(and spending a wonderful time together
have been a great blessing to me.)

2006
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:14,860
(I hope that blessing continues.)

2007
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,600
I can't imagine
how excited the two must be.

2008
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:19,100
- Now that I have your phone number,
- Yes?

2009
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:22,740
I'll be able to talk about the things
I couldn't on the show.

2010
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,540
That'll be my way
of making another impression.

2011
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:27,310
Sounds nice.

2012
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:29,340
I feel it's only natural...

2013
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,580
to get to know you better.

2014
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,210
With that,

2015
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:35,780
we'll grow closer to each other.

2016
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,880
That's what I'm expecting.

2017
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,350
Can I call you before going to bed?

2018
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,560
- Can I?
- Yes.

2019
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,360
What are you doing tomorrow?

2020
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:49,360
That's adorable.

2021
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,160
- By the way...
- Yes?

2022
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,200
I like to be clear about stuff.

2023
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:59,370
Okay.

2024
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,010
So...

2025
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,910
we're dating, right?

2026
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,720
Do you want to go out with me?

2027
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:16,790
Yes, sure.

2028
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,860
Today marks Day One.

2029
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,660
- Yes.
- What?

2030
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,930
I'm loving it.

2031
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:37,210
- After we leave the house,
- Yes?

2032
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,150
let's meet Friday afternoon.

2033
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,080
Friday afternoon, after I get off work.

2034
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,220
Okay.

2035
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:46,150
I'm in. Let's meet on Friday.

2036
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:47,420
Good. Let's meet on Friday.

2037
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:49,250
I'll see you on "Friday."

2038
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,760
(Laughing)

2039
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,760
- Okay, I'll see you on Friday.
- It's a song.

2040
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:56,830
"Friday."

2041
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,700
(It looks like this Friday
will be special.)

2042
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,570
(Touched)

2043
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:03,640
With that,
a total of three couples have been paired.

2044
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,300
(3 couples have been paired.)

2045
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,110
- There were no twists.
- No.

2046
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,570
Great work.

2047
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,710
- Yes.
- Gosh.

2048
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,810
Of all the Heart series,

2049
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:13,580
Heart Pairing matched
the most number of couples.

2050
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,910
- That's amazing.
- Really.

2051
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:16,580
It's a great outcome.

2052
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:18,920
- For real.
- Even pairing one couple is hard.

2053
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,220
This is impressive.

2054
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,950
And so,

2055
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:23,990
the winner who gets to stay
in the Pairing House...

2056
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:26,860
in Tuscany, Italy, where the residents
went to find their fate,

2057
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:27,990
is...

2058
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,030
(An exciting moment)

2059
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,100
It's...

2060
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:34,170
Professor Park Ji Seon.

2061
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:37,270
(Park Ji Seon,
who was always earnest in her deductions)

2062
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:39,510
(They're bummed out but can't deny it.)

2063
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:40,940
Here.

2064
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,910
You have to leave...

2065
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,080
for the two-night trip.

2066
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,380
(She must cover the flight herself.)

2067
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,710
Only for two nights.

2068
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:47,850
(Only provided with
the 2-night lodging voucher)

2069
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,020
We now know everyone's result.

2070
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,820
How was it being on Heart Pairing?

2071
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:54,290
"Have I ever cheered..."

2072
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,760
"for someone's love this much before?"

2073
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,920
- Right?
- I kept...

2074
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,930
asking that while I was on Heart Pairing.

2075
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,900
"I must marry such a person."

2076
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,270
It has taught me a lot in that area.

2077
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,900
And...

2078
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:11,340
there are many moments...

2079
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,240
when people back down
from love out of fear.

2080
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:17,140
Watching the residents of Heart Pairing...

2081
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:19,080
made me reflect on the times...

2082
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,480
when I was a coward and the feelings...

2083
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,680
I didn't even know I had.

2084
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,280
I think I can navigate...

2085
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:27,020
my own path to happiness better now.

2086
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,760
- Thank you, Heart Pairing.
- Nice.

2087
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:32,690
And so, Heart Pairing has come to an end.

2088
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,230
Thank you to the viewers...

2089
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:37,060
who were deeply absorbed
until the very end.

2090
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,700
Yes. May everyone be happy.

2091
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:39,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2092
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,400
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2093
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,340
The final moment.

2094
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,670
(Stay tuned for the post-credits scenes.)

2095
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,040
How about it?

2096
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,280
Was it Seongbuk-dong Baeksuk?

2097
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,350
- Nurungji Baeksuk?
- Nurungji Baeksuk.

2098
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:54,950
It's nearby.

2099
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:56,680
Do you want to go?

2100
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,720
- Really?
- Yes. I'm serious.

2101
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,050
It just came to my mind.

2102
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:02,190
- It's close.
- I'm in.

2103
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:04,020
- We can go.
- Okay.

2104
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,430
With everyone?

2105
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:09,190
We can sneak out in the middle.

2106
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,360
- Okay.
- Nice.

2107
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,700
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2108
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,800
It'd be nice
if we could visit Italy again.

2109
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,400
- Right?
- Yes.

2110
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:20,740
We can revisit the places we went to.

2111
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:21,840
Yes.

2112
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:24,240
I don't think...

2113
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,980
we'll be able to visit
that house in Italy.

2114
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,150
No.

2115
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,350
- That house was...
- It was...

2116
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:33,390
We didn't go on dates in Italy.

2117
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:35,790
No. We can do what we didn't do next time.

2118
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,290
When it was the three of us,
you were sitting in the back,

2119
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,860
so you barely talked.

2120
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:42,930
Right?

2121
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,030
Actually,

2122
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:46,470
it's a really funny story.

2123
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,340
I thought you were interested in me
back then.

2124
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,410
You did?

2125
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,810
Maybe I was.

2126
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,050
That wasn't like you just now.

2127
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:11,490
If I find it,

2128
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,460
- let's go together.
- Okay.

2129
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:17,360
- I heard it was pretty at night.
- Yes.

2130
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:37,750
(Thank you for loving Heart Pairing.)
