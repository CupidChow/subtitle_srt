1
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,000
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,470
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,970
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,140
Heart Pairing starts now.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,440
(Are you ready to be with Heart Pairing?)

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,450
(Ready)

8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,050
Heart Pairing is getting so popular.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,380
We have heated responses.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,550
People talk about this show a lot, right?

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,890
Many people have asked me
where their residence was...

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,120
and whether I knew the results.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,590
They're curious about the pairing.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,820
- Right.
- So,

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,190
I said that I didn't know yet.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,930
I didn't know...

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,430
that when I was so immersed in a show,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,330
I made such facial expressions.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,940
I thought that was too much.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,910
I don't know who it was, but you were
especially immersed in someone.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,470
You got me.

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,280
- I support Ji Won consistently.
- Right.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,810
- Ji Won.
- I support Ji Won.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,950
I support Ji Won.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,520
Last week, two couples were paired.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,750
Woo Jae and Je Yeon,

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,350
and Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul
were the couples.

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,320
We managed to get it right.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,330
I've watched the 1st episode
4 times so far.

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,190
- What? Really?
- Four times?

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,760
I've watched it four times,

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,030
and every clue is in the video.

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,370
- That's right.
- Right.

34
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,100
So if I watch the video carefully,

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
I can get the answer right today.

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,910
I came with that belief.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,340
It was easy to guess
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul's pairing,

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,850
but it was a bit hard to guess
Woo Jae and Je Yeon's pairing.

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
In fact, on the first day, Woo Jae...

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,350
- was interested in Ji Won.
- I know.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,750
(During the first meeting,)

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,030
(Woo Jae had
a special feeling for Ji Won.)

43
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,290
(Woo Jae sent a text to Ji Won
on the first day.)

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,960
But after that, not to mention a date,

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,230
they rarely had an interaction.

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,300
But dating Je Yeon, Woo Jae...

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,670
had a good time...

48
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,310
and found common ground with her.

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,940
In addition,
at the end of the second episode,

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,610
Ji Min kind of provoked him.

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,810
Honestly, I'd never seen Woo Jae...

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,720
show that he was upset even for a moment.

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,620
- He looked like he lost his nerve.
- Exactly.

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,650
I think he rebelled against
Ji Min's provocation.

55
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,920
Woo Jae looks careful and delicate.

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,060
- Right.
- Yes.

57
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,190
Meanwhile, Ji Min is straightforward...

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,530
- and smart.
- Yes.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,260
He's quite active.

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,770
Ji Min and Ji Won, after a date,

61
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,200
became totally estranged.

62
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,940
It really broke my heart.

63
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,270
Ji Won sent a text to Ji Min,

64
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,840
- but Ji Min leaned toward Je Yeon.
- Right.

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,410
- He's single-hearted.
- Right.

66
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,350
The date that day didn't affect him.

67
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,610
He has his heart on Je Yeon.

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,220
- He's so loyal.
- He is.

69
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,780
That makes a woman's heart flutter.

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,250
However, Je Yeon...

71
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,760
sent a text to Woo Jae
since the first day.

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,620
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul...

73
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,130
were paired twice in a row.

74
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,400
Will their pairing become solid
from the beginning?

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,830
I don't think so.

76
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,270
To me,

77
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,100
it didn't look like a relationship
with an intense attraction.

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,810
Rather than having tension
between a man and a woman,

79
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,210
their date looked too comfortable.

80
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,140
Do some people prefer that?

81
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,310
- I'm asking because I don't know.
- Some people do.

82
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,580
In many cases, a romance burgeons
from a comfortable relationship.

83
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,050
On the first day,

84
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,050
Ha Neul was looking at Ji Min.

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,450
- That look of hers lingers in my mind.
- Right.

86
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,260
Things might change from now on.

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
I like...

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,390
- Chan Hyeong.
- Do you?

89
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,600
- I thought so all along.
- I like Ji Won.

90
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,730
- Yes.
- Since he's my favorite,

91
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,630
I hope things turn out well for them.

92
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,100
And...

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,970
a catfish appeared
earlier than we expected.

94
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,140
- Chang Hwan has come.
- He's awesome.

95
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,810
Including on all seasons
of "Heart Signal,"

96
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,580
he's a catfish of a character
we've never seen.

97
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
He's so manly.

98
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,810
He cooked steak
with his sleeves rolled up.

99
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,350
Would Chang Hwan, the new guy,

100
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,750
be able to shake things up?
What do you think?

101
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,950
I think...

102
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,260
people may recognize his charms
as time goes on.

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,860
I think, whether it's a man or a woman,

104
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,430
when someone is cute,
that's the end of the game.

105
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,760
- That's right.
- And...

106
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,660
Chang Hwan looks like a guy
who'll look cute before long.

107
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,860
- Really?
- Yes, he has such charms.

108
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,670
It's getting harder to predict...

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,540
people's hearts on Heart Pairing.

110
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,010
Today, let's go to Italy once again.

111
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,080
(Pairing House, Italy)

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,740
(The fourth morning)

113
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,650
- Who's that?
- It's Ha Neul.

114
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,950
(Stretching in the Sunset Room)

115
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,090
That's cute.

116
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,450
(Stretching in the Sunset Room)

117
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
(Stretching)

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,590
- She's flexible.
- Does she practice yoga?

119
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,300
(Stretching)

120
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,130
I'm a good horseback rider.

121
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,330
You're even a good horseback rider?

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,530
I mean, I'm not excellent,

123
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,800
but I can ride a horse by myself.

124
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
- I can ride it alone.
- That means you're good.

125
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,040
You surprised me.

126
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,070
(Ha Neul has amazing motor skills.)

127
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,010
She's so good.

128
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,510
(Is Ha Neul a former athlete?)

129
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,320
(Meanwhile, Chang Hwan is having coffee.)

130
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,480
This is Chang Hwan.

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
It's like a piece of art.

132
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,120
I love him.

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,590
(Immersed)

134
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,690
He's just my type.

135
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,930
- He's like a boy next door.
- He's wearing track pants in the morning.

136
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,700
He needs to feel the sentiment
early in the morning.

137
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,830
(Swinging his arm)

138
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,700
(Is Chang Hwan doing
his morning exercise too?)

139
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,580
(Patting)

140
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,140
Is he going to hit his back on the tree?

141
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,480
(Jumping)

142
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,650
I love that!

143
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,680
Oh, my.

144
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,080
He's my type.

145
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,250
(Doing pull-ups on wisteria)

146
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
He's having fun
in everyday life like that.

147
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,860
I like that kind of person very much.

148
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
He's so good, by the way.

149
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,440
(He can't lose his muscles in Italy.)

150
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
(Taking off his jacket)

151
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,140
I haven't worked out for quite a while.

152
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,140
(Taking a deep breath)

153
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,850
(Preparing to do his 2nd set right away)

154
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,950
I have this right here.

155
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,080
What a fool.

156
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,320
(Bringing equipment)

157
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,690
(Exhaling)

158
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,530
(Groaning)

159
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,430
(Ji Won is taking a morning walk.)

160
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,700
- It's Ji Won.
- Ji Won is out.

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,870
(Last night)

162
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,510
(Ji Won didn't get a text from Ji Min.)

163
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,370
- She didn't get a text yesterday.
- No.

164
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,740
Ji Won, it's okay.

165
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,280
It's okay, Ji Won.

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,010
She was upset that day.

167
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,180
It's okay not to get a text
on the first day.

168
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,890
You can do it.

169
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,620
Fourteen.

170
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,120
Fifteen.

171
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,290
(Exhaling)

172
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,730
One more.

173
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,130
- One more time.
- One more time.

174
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,330
There you go.

175
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,430
Well,

176
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,000
you need to see a man
who gets back up after taking a fall.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,530
All right. He's doing great now.

178
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,240
Let me try just one more time.

179
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,410
- Eight, nine...
- Yes!

180
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,010
Ten!

181
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,450
(Groaning)

182
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,280
(Panting)

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,480
(Gasping)

184
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,620
Why am I doing this?

185
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,720
Why am I doing this?

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,390
Chang Hwan has passion.

187
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,590
He has such a nice character.

188
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,030
(Same space, different energy)

189
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,460
There she goes.

190
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,630
I need to exercise my lower body.

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,070
(Jumping up to his feet)

192
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
I need to exercise the lower body
after the upper body.

193
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,940
Right?

194
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,110
I need to exercise my lower body.

195
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,210
- Who are you talking to?
- He keeps talking to himself.

196
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,240
He should.

197
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,950
Broadcasting stations would like him.

198
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,950
(He fills the audio up.)

199
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,150
Five, six,

200
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,890
seven, eight, nine,

201
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,120
ten, eleven, twelve... Gosh!

202
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,260
Chang Hwan is so energetic.

203
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,490
Oh, goodness.

204
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,660
Gosh.

205
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,730
Ji Won and Chang Hwan are going to meet.

206
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,030
No way.

207
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,510
(While Chang Hwan is catching his breath,)

208
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,810
(Ji Won passes him by.)

209
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,310
- Why?
- I guess she didn't see him.

210
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,080
- "Didn't see?"
- What was that?

211
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,520
- Did she pretend she didn't see him?
- When he has such a presence?

212
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,420
- Or...
- She didn't see him as she was thinking?

213
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

214
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,230
Gosh.

215
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,730
I just worked out.

216
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,100
Did you work out?

217
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,640
How did you work out here?

218
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,580
I was hanging up there.

219
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,310
Really? That's amazing.

220
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,080
Bodyweight exercise is the best.

221
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,310
Did you sleep well?

222
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes, I think so.

223
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,590
All right.

224
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,290
- That was natural.
- Did you just hear how he said it?

225
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,660
- "Did you sleep well?"
- "Did you sleep well?"

226
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,060
- "Did you sleep well?"
- He talked like Choi Min Su.

227
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,590
(The way he talks
reminds him of Choi Min Su.)

228
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,660
"Did you sleep well?"

229
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
Gosh.

230
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,460
- Did you take a rest?
- I worked out too hard.

231
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,930
You worked out too hard?

232
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,430
It's been a long time.

233
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,400
- It was made of steel, with the wisteria.
- Yes.

234
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,370
I shook it, and it seemed strong.

235
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,710
Did you work out using it?

236
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,410
I did pull-ups there...

237
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,310
- about 70 to 80 times.
- What?

238
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,110
(Surprised)

239
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,350
Is that possible?

240
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,150
- Was it 50 to 60 times? Anyway...
- What?

241
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,390
Oh, my. I can't do it even once.

242
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,450
Really?

243
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,790
I can do 100 push-ups.

244
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,660
(He shyly confesses his motor ability.)

245
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
You're so good at exercising.

246
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,430
(Grinning)

247
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,530
- It was so cold yesterday.
- Right.

248
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,500
So I took a cold medicine
before I went to sleep last night.

249
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,630
Really?

250
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,170
- I feel better after getting some sleep.
- Do you?

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,970
- Ji Won looks thinner than yesterday.
- Yes.

252
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,170
She looks gaunt.

253
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,940
I have attachable warmers.

254
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,580
- Really?
- Give her one.

255
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,640
Do you want one?

256
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,040
I brought three.

257
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,180
- Really?
- This much.

258
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,850
- I brought them,
- You're prepared.

259
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,720
but I haven't used one.

260
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,550
- I'll give you one.
- Thank you.

261
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,690
I have cold hands and feet,
although I'm a man.

262
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,320
No, I have cold feet only.

263
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,060
(He has cold feet only?)

264
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,090
He's cute.

265
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,200
"I have cold hands and feet,
although I'm a man." That's so funny,

266
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,700
(I have cold hands and feet,
although I'm a man.)

267
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,130
(No, I have cold feet only.)

268
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,770
- My hands sweat excessively.
- Is it because you're tall?

269
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,170
Maybe because I have big feet.

270
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,340
(Revealing his physical information)

271
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,540
That's a possibility.

272
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,380
My feet are 300mm.

273
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,110
I've never seen anyone like that.

274
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,150
May I show you?

275
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,820
(Lifting his feet)

276
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,820
He has a cute personality.

277
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,520
- What's your shoe size?
- It's 250mm.

278
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,890
- It's 250mm?
- Yes.

279
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,200
Your fingers are very...
You have beautiful hands.

280
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,230
Really?

281
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,330
- I have long fingers.
- Let me see.

282
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,800
He might touch her hands.

283
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,370
Your hands are really...
You have big hands too.

284
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,340
My hands.

285
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,340
It's because I did this so much
when I was little.

286
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,010
I can't make sounds doing it.
I just did it.

287
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,640
What? You just did it.

288
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,110
You didn't realize your skill.

289
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,980
He made Ji Won laugh.

290
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,280
Nice work, Chang Hwan.

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,120
The yellow book is Chang Hwan's.

292
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,550
- Right.
- Look at Chang Hwan's flirting skills.

293
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,920
"I have rather big hands.
So when a woman mentions my big hands,"

294
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,060
"I tell her to put our palms together.
When our hands meet,"

295
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,900
"I compare our hands,
and then hold her hand."

296
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,160
He holds her hand when their hands meet.

297
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,200
(Cutting)

298
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,270
(Chang Hwan, Ji Won, and Ha Neul
prepare breakfast.)

299
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,380
How do I cut onions
for stir-fried potatoes?

300
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,650
You can julienne them.

301
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,110
Cut them thinly.

302
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll try.

303
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,450
They don't need to be very thin.

304
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,920
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yes.

305
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,820
I got it,
but I'm not sure if I can do that.

306
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,920
Anyway, I understand.

307
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,730
Ji Won is kind of falling for Chang Hwan.

308
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,630
- Cook them fully, to be safe.
- Okay.

309
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,730
- If it turns out...
- Right.

310
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,470
- raw...
- We need to cook them thoroughly.

311
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,470
That's right.

312
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,870
(Focused)

313
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,980
(Glancing)

314
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,280
Four eggs...

315
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,920
(At this moment,
Chang Hwan is serious about onions.)

316
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,050
All right.

317
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,720
(Cutting)

318
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,890
He's detailed.

319
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,960
(Detailed cutting with a solid body)

320
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,190
- Can you get me some butter?
- Butter?

321
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,830
- A cut one?
- I saw butter a while ago... No.

322
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,100
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

323
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Here it is.

324
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,200
(He completely figured out
what's in the fridge.)

325
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,670
The onions here are so spicy.

326
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,440
The onions here are especially spicy.

327
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,910
I guess they're different.

328
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,410
I know. They're foreign onions to us.

329
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,850
(It's not over until it's over.)

330
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,720
- You're good.
- I have no basics.

331
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,950
That's not true.

332
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,620
- She complimented him.
- Ji Won keeps complimenting him.

333
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,860
I went to a good place...

334
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,100
(Top-class wine and steak)

335
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,700
(Chang Hwan gave them
a strong first impression.)

336
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,330
For your partner,

337
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,940
is there something you can never allow?

338
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
As for me,

339
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,380
I don't like someone who bluffs.

340
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,580
He was paying attention then.

341
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,280
I shouldn't have cooked steak.

342
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,350
No, that wasn't bluffing.

343
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,750
You were really good.

344
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,590
(Working hard)

345
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,490
Shall I bring you a hoodie from upstairs?

346
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,790
You can zip it up in the front.

347
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,290
- You have a choice.
- Thank you.

348
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,730
You can wear a padded jacket...

349
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,100
- They're creating a nice mood.
- May I wear this one?

350
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,600
(He brings outerwear for Ji Won
who took a cold medicine.)

351
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,130
- What?
- What was that?

352
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,170
It makes my heart flutter.

353
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
Like this.

354
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,340
- It's big for me too.
- Did I wear it right?

355
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,040
- Be careful.
- Okay.

356
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,540
(Ji Won is in Chang Hwan's clothes.)

357
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,550
- But we have no chopsticks.
- No chopsticks.

358
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,150
Chopsticks...

359
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,290
- I think I saw them.
- Did you see them?

360
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,090
- I think I saw them.
- Forks...

361
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,590
He's cute.

362
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,390
Why do I feel like I saw them?

363
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,530
(This man is a much warmer person
than his first impression.)

364
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
All right. Let's dig in.

365
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,340
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for your work.

366
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,840
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

367
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,340
Who cooked this?

368
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,710
(The three of them
prepared a delicious meal.)

369
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,210
- As expected.
- It truly is a sumptuous feast.

370
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,510
Oh, my. I spilled it.

371
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,550
- This is a potato dish, right?
- The chef cooked it.

372
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
Did you cook the potato dish?

373
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,090
Ha Neul is a good cook.

374
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,730
(Enjoying)

375
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,060
It tastes so nice.

376
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,030
- It's good.
- Chan Hyeong keeps looking at Ha Neul.

377
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,170
- The potato tastes so good.
- Does it?

378
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,570
- Is it seasoned all right?
- Yes.

379
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,040
- It tastes good.
- Does it?

380
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,180
(Proud)

381
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,580
The way she looks at Ji Min is different,
right?

382
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,710
Yes, it's so different.

383
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,150
You can't reach the potato, right?

384
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,050
Take some.

385
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,750
He cares about Ha Neul so much.

386
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,760
I got enough.

387
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,290
Chan Hyeong clearly has
a relaxed personality.

388
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,730
- You revealed your forehead.
- Yes.

389
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,460
- You covered it yesterday.
- I'll keep...

390
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,700
- Will you reveal it even more?
- revealing it more.

391
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,160
Later.

392
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,530
(Glancing)

393
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,470
Tell us what you talked about last night
among the men.

394
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,940
We talked about so many things.

395
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,880
- If I say it here, it won't be fun.
- I heard you guys didn't talk a lot.

396
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,510
We also talked about which book we chose.

397
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,880
- Really?
- Yes.

398
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,680
We haven't talked about that yet.

399
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,250
I know. Shall we talk about it today?

400
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,830
(Last night)

401
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,300
I think we need some time
to have 1-on-1 conversations.

402
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,930
- I thought of this as we talked today.
- You're right.

403
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,440
If we are going to do that,
we should do it now.

404
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,000
(The guys decided to try a 1-on-1 date.)

405
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,070
That's true.

406
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,510
Then...

407
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,740
Let's do that freely tomorrow, okay?

408
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
- Okay. Let's just wing it.
- Right.

409
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,910
I think that's what we should do.

410
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,420
He's trying to read the room.

411
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,520
(The women don't know about their plan.)

412
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,690
We've been talking about this and that.

413
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,930
We noticed that there wasn't much time...

414
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,230
to talk to each other. Especially 1-on-1.

415
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,800
- We thought it was a shame.
- I see.

416
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,600
We talked about
how we could talk to each other for long.

417
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,370
(Chan Hyeong suggests 1-on-1 dates.)

418
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,740
Chan Hyeong makes the suggestion.

419
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,650
(Chan Hyeong suggests 1-on-1 dates.)

420
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,950
We don't have to do that in the house.

421
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,350
- Right?
- Of course not.

422
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,780
We can put on something warm.

423
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,490
Let's put on something warm
and see Florence.

424
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,560
That sounds good.

425
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,930
Make sure you put on something warm today.

426
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,690
- Okay.
- All three of you.

427
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,060
Is there someone
you want to talk to first?

428
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,200
Am I too direct?

429
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,970
I want to talk to Je Yeon.

430
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,900
Okay.

431
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,610
He didn't hesitate.

432
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,310
Gosh. What do we do with Woo Jae?

433
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,610
He said it out loud.

434
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,320
Are we going to Florence?

435
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,790
She's not looking at him.

436
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,690
We'll do this in Florence?

437
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,120
We haven't decided on anything yet.

438
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,860
I just said it because we could go out.

439
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,800
Are you guys okay with going out to talk?

440
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,830
- We...
- Since we don't have much time.

441
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,830
Right?

442
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,800
Look at Woo Jae.

443
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,810
We can see their characters.

444
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,480
We'll do the dishes.

445
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,510
You can get ready.

446
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,950
(There's tension in the dining room.)

447
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,190
There's tension.

448
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,060
Shall we?

449
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,090
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

450
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,790
We enjoyed it.

451
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,130
They are not staying there for a month.

452
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,630
They only have a week in Italy.

453
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,600
I guess they want to make...

454
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
some good memories while they're in Italy.

455
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,770
This is what I have.

456
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,270
- That's it?
- Yes.

457
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,440
And it's too thin.

458
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,610
I think I should bring my coat.

459
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,540
(Sighing)

460
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,130
(The men are becoming impatient.)

461
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,700
(There are three women.)

462
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,640
- Goodness. He looks manly.
- Gosh. Look at Chang Hwan.

463
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,740
Look at him.

464
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,010
(If you don't muster up your courage,)

465
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,380
(you might miss your chance.)

466
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,150
(you might miss your chance.)

467
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,660
He doesn't hesitate.

468
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,870
Chan Hyeong goes first as expected.

469
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,970
(Chan Hyeong goes first.)

470
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,510
Today... No one came before me, right?

471
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,480
(Whose room did Chan Hyeong go to?)

472
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,910
Today... No one came before me, right?

473
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,250
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

474
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,780
Do you want to go out with me today?

475
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,950
Let's go.

476
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,220
Let's decide where to go later, okay?

477
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,530
Okay. Bye.

478
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,230
(He's the first one to get a date.)

479
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,370
Chan Hyeong is so...

480
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,470
He has his way.

481
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,470
(Relaxed)

482
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,370
He was here just now for you.

483
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,480
Was it Ji Min?

484
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,850
Wasn't it his voice?

485
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,120
They talk about Ji Min
as soon as he leaves.

486
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,380
- The one just now.
- When I was in the bathroom?

487
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,920
- Right.
- Yes.

488
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,260
(Ji Min went outside
without crossing Je Yeon.)

489
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,540
(He's waiting for Je Yeon.)

490
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,610
You shouldn't be out there, Ji Min.

491
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,120
But he already said out loud
that he'll go on a date with Je Yeon.

492
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,950
Who will Woo Jae go to?

493
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,490
(Woo Jae is ready too.)

494
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,100
- Well...
- Yes?

495
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,430
- Is he...
- What?

496
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,570
going to ask Ha Neul out?

497
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,700
(Is he going to ask Ha Neul out?)

498
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,040
This makes me feel so nervous.

499
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,440
(Will Woo Jae...)

500
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,210
(ask her out?)

501
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,390
Yes?

502
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,630
Is she getting ready?

503
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,060
Yes.

504
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,830
Ji Min went to see Je Yeon,
but he couldn't.

505
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,960
She doesn't seem happy.

506
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,740
Gosh, it's so tense.

507
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,320
Is he there?

508
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,780
They told me that Ji Min came downstairs.

509
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,750
Did you ask someone out?

510
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,120
- How...
- You didn't, right?

511
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,320
Are you going to do it now?

512
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,920
You can ask someone on your mind.

513
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,490
You should do it.

514
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,230
If you want, you can do it here.

515
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,730
Let's ask them out here and go out.

516
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,270
But...

517
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,100
What I'm thinking is...

518
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Well...

519
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,070
(What I'm thinking is...)

520
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,140
First,

521
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,840
I'll do as I like.

522
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,880
You'll see how it goes?

523
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,750
- Yes.
- Okay.

524
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,680
- If you hesitate,
- Yes?

525
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,550
I don't know who that will be,

526
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,190
but I could ask her out first.

527
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,790
- Oh, my.
- Right? So...

528
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I see.

529
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,230
So he thinks about others
in situations like this.

530
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,930
- He doesn't step up.
- Woo Jae doesn't.

531
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,630
He's telling him to go first.

532
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,400
- Are they in their rooms?
- Yes, they are.

533
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,440
All of them?

534
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,770
I saw Je Yeon.

535
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,540
But I'm not sure about Ji Won.

536
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,010
- I'll ask her out then.
- Ji Min is going.

537
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,010
(I'll ask her out then.)

538
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,680
I think Ji Min will ask Je Yeon out.

539
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,150
I think so too.

540
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,860
(Ji Min goes to ask someone out
on a date.)

541
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,930
(Ji Won came out of her room
at that moment.)

542
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,030
(Knocking)

543
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,630
- Yes?
- He ran into Ji Won.

544
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,930
He didn't even look at her.

545
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,070
He could have said hi, at least.

546
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,200
(Upset)

547
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,300
How could this happen?

548
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,340
(It's so interesting.)

549
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,210
Yes?

550
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,190
(She stops.)

551
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,220
(Standing still)

552
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,390
Do you have a date?

553
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,690
Do you want to go out with me?

554
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,190
Okay.

555
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,700
- Now?
- No, a little later.

556
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,140
- Oh, no.
- It's all right, Ji Won.

557
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,740
(Ji Min leaves.)

558
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,640
You're going to feel cold again.

559
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,550
- I'm going to put on a coat.
- Do you want a warmer?

560
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,420
- Or you can stick it when you're there.
- Sure.

561
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,450
I'll take one now.

562
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,750
Are you going to go with him?

563
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,390
I'm not sure.

564
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,720
- You should come with me.
- Okay.

565
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,090
- Are you all right with that?
- Yes.

566
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,860
You can go anywhere if there's a place...

567
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,600
you want to go.

568
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,660
Sounds good.

569
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,570
- I'll go downstairs.
- Okay.

570
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,900
- Take your time.
- Okay.

571
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
(Ji Won will go on a date
with Chang Hwan.)

572
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,440
Good for her.

573
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,110
He asked her out so calmly.

574
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,570
I have a feeling...

575
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,210
- that Chang Hwan knows what women think.
- Really?

576
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,480
I think he instinctively knows
how to make them feel comfortable.

577
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,710
Ji Min saw Ji Won,

578
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,680
but he didn't even say hi.

579
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,290
I don't think Ji Min...

580
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,550
can see anyone else for now.

581
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,720
- Everyone but Je Yeon is blurred.
- But I think...

582
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,320
acting like Ji Min is...

583
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,560
the right way instead of confusing others.

584
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,330
- That's true.
- If he has no feelings for Ji Won,

585
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,260
it's better that he doesn't look at her...

586
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,670
No, he just couldn't see her.

587
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,930
Is that it?

588
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,670
- I think so.
- I don't think so.

589
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,240
But here's another thing.

590
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,270
Ji Won didn't see Chang Hwan earlier
either.

591
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,740
- That's true.
- She missed Chang Hwan.

592
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,310
But she had a reason to miss him.

593
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,440
She didn't need to see him.

594
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,780
She didn't.

595
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,580
Anyway,

596
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,910
there's only been three episodes,

597
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,580
but I don't think
Ji Min and Ji Won will work out.

598
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,720
That's why things need to go well
between her and Chang Hwan.

599
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,500
They must be taking a while to get ready.

600
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,770
Woo Jae, are you going to talk to anyone?

601
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,440
- I think we need...
- Yes?

602
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,450
some time to spend in groups of two.

603
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,180
So, will Woo Jae be alone?

604
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,720
His true colors are showing.

605
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,890
Oh, no.

606
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,660
So, you're yielding today?

607
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,160
Yes.

608
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,100
I mean,

609
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,730
I'm not being laid-back.

610
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,430
I feel like we need some time to do so.

611
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,300
- But I spent a day with her yesterday.
- Right.

612
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,270
I also spent some time with Ji Won
when I drove, although it was short.

613
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,540
I thought there should be a person
who lets others have a chance.

614
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,780
Just one.

615
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,710
Have you been thinking about
doing that since yesterday?

616
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,250
No. I just decided today.

617
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,550
- From what you saw today?
- Yes.

618
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,290
I'd want to spend at least one more day
with someone I like...

619
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,330
while I'm in Italy.

620
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,530
Maybe, you're far more generous than I am.

621
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,470
He's the bigger person.

622
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,970
(What outcome...)

623
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,540
(will Woo Jae's decision bring?)

624
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,450
Woo Jae might find those words
pretty disturbing.

625
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,510
- Yes.
- Right.

626
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,450
Ji Min and Woo Jae need to...

627
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,450
eat and sleep in the same house,

628
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,250
and they can be slightly in disagreement.

629
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,590
So, if they start liking the same girl,

630
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,830
- there will be some conflict.
- I'd love to see that.

631
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,000
- Yes.
- I...

632
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,500
I believe they already had...

633
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,430
three imaginary fights in their heads.

634
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,100
- They fought in their heads a few times.
- Yes, they did.

635
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,170
Woo Jae seemed to be deep in thought
at the table in the morning.

636
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,110
A man like Woo Jae...

637
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,110
needs some alone time
to think things through.

638
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,650
He texted Ji Won on the first day.

639
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,620
- On the second day, he texted Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

640
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,390
He might be pretty confused as well.

641
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,890
- You know, about his feelings.
- But...

642
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,530
it doesn't seem like a wise choice
as he's in a competition.

643
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,660
- What would you have done, Si Won?
- To be honest,

644
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,700
I could only see Chang Hwan
among the men today.

645
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,770
(So could I.)

646
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,600
He looks so charming.

647
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,740
(A date between Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul)

648
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,510
- You can get in first.
- Thank you.

649
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,940
(Affectionate)

650
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,080
I'll get the door for you.

651
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,680
- Ha Neul smiles so easily.
- They look cute together.

652
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,280
I like how cheerful she is.

653
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,650
- It's my 1st 1-on-1 date.
- Exactly.

654
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,250
- The very first one.
- We...

655
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,990
- It's my first time too!
- Is it?

656
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,390
- We've been together the whole time.
- Oh, you're right.

657
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,630
The whole time...

658
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,030
You're right.

659
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,060
Let's go.

660
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,460
(Squirming)

661
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,100
- You really laugh a lot.
- Do I?

662
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,600
(Nodding)

663
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,540
You're like that with everyone,
aren't you?

664
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,910
- You're always smiling, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

665
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,810
I don't believe you.

666
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,180
Chan Hyeong can be
pretty straightforward too.

667
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,780
- He hopes she doesn't.
- Exactly.

668
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,320
(Their first private date)

669
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,290
I'm relieved
as I know you're a good driver.

670
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,720
I'll take you there safely.

671
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,620
This is lovely.

672
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,630
(They're excited from the beginning.)

673
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,370
Haven't you talked about this...

674
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,730
with other men?

675
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,000
Our jobs?

676
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,740
No, the women you're interested in.

677
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,200
We're a bit careful.

678
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,910
But they just told us...

679
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,110
when we didn't even ask.

680
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,610
Like, "I want to go on a date with her."

681
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,020
- So...
- They told you the truth?

682
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,820
So, I picked one first,

683
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,750
and they went next.

684
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,690
- They made a move pretty soon.
- I guess no one liked the same girl.

685
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,620
I went to you twice.

686
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,830
That was my second time.

687
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,890
- I heard.
- You did?

688
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,060
They said, "Chan Hyeong was here earlier."

689
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,040
(This morning)

690
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,540
(Snooping around)

691
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,270
Is Ha Neul here?

692
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,140
No?

693
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,850
(He failed in his first attempt
to ask her out.)

694
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,620
Oh, he went to her twice.

695
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,820
Yes?

696
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,250
Do you want to go out with me today?

697
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,990
Let's go.

698
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,190
(Nodding)

699
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,360
(He succeeded in asking her out.)

700
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,130
I could finally ask you out
after visiting twice.

701
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,830
There could have been more men
who wanted to get to know you.

702
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,900
- I find that hard to believe.
- I actually...

703
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,040
Chan Hyeong knows it.

704
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,070
You can tell from the number of texts.

705
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,010
I don't know.

706
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,650
- So it was more than one.
- I don't know.

707
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,850
- You got more than one.
- I don't know.

708
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,520
There will be new events
when we go back to Seoul.

709
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,590
Like what?

710
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,830
- There will be a new girl.
- Oh, a new participant.

711
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,030
You look so happy!

712
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,830
That's not it.

713
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,260
I was just embarrassed.

714
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,200
- That's not...
- Seriously.

715
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,300
You know what I mean.

716
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,140
That wasn't what I meant.

717
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,470
I just thought it was funny.

718
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,710
That's all.

719
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,010
I'll check your face
once the new girl comes.

720
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
(Reading his face)

721
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,610
Chan Hyeong seems more into her, right?

722
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,850
Yes, he's definitely into her.

723
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,150
- He is.
- He asked her what he was wondering...

724
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,220
too early.

725
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,120
I feel like Ha Neul
is also starting to like him.

726
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,150
A little.

727
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,390
(They drove from Florence
for 20 minutes...)

728
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,190
(to arrive at Fiesole)

729
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,860
That's amazing.

730
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,360
Where should we go?

731
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,330
- I think that's the plaza.
- Right.

732
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,340
- This looks like the place, right?
- Yes.

733
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,440
Is it?

734
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,940
(A local bakery by the main square
of Fiesole)

735
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,780
Are those cookies?

736
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,610
(It's known for its welcoming owner
and celestial pastries.)

737
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,380
They smell so good.

738
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,350
How about this?

739
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,320
- Sure.
- Right?

740
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,090
This one and this one.

741
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,220
This and this?

742
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,920
You can get anything you want.

743
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,390
- We can keep them for later.
- Then, from here to there.

744
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,130
- I'm joking.
- "One of every kind, please."

745
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,930
- I'll get it.
- No, it's on me.

746
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,270
Then,
I'll buy you better things next time.

747
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,640
When we go back to Seoul.

748
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,870
Is she implying that
they should meet up in Seoul?

749
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,640
It'd be so interesting when we go back.

750
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,470
They're leaving the door open
to future possibilities.

751
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,380
(They feel closer already.)

752
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,440
I'll cut it now.

753
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,620
(Working hard)

754
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,190
He's delicate.

755
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,290
(Eating)

756
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,460
(Feeling proud)

757
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,030
- He's so cute!
- You're so cute, Chan Hyeong!

758
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,430
He can't hide his joy.

759
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,640
(Pressing)

760
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,010
You really do a lot of stuff.

761
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,180
You do horseback riding,
you play the violin,

762
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,780
and you're a good cook.

763
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,950
"That's right."

764
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,320
(Thinking)

765
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,390
What is this?

766
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,800
- Is her job being revealed?
- Is it what she does?

767
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,930
(We're revealing...)

768
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,530
(the versatile Ha Neul's job.)

769
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,310
(Using her elegant and beautiful lines,)

770
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,340
She must be a dancer.

771
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,850
(she touches people's hearts
with every movement of her body.)

772
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,620
That's why she was so flexible.

773
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,750
(She started dancing
when she was captivated by Korean dance.)

774
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,190
- Korean dance!
- Oh, she's a Korean dancer.

775
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,220
How gorgeous.

776
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,530
(And late at night,)

777
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,200
(she uses her natural-born charms
and expressiveness.)

778
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,260
What is it?

779
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,400
(She shows people...)

780
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
She's beautiful.

781
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
(another type of beauty.)

782
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,940
She's not so shy in front of cameras.

783
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,840
(A professional mindset)

784
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,480
(Ha Neul is a model and a dancer.)

785
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,950
She's a model and a dancer.

786
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
What else are you good at?

787
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
- What else?
- Yes.

788
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,520
(Thinking)

789
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,820
She's a good cook.

790
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
What else?

791
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,420
I'm not that eloquent.

792
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,390
What you're good at...

793
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,100
- must be connected to what you do.
- That's right.

794
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,900
- To her job.
- Yes. I almost gave it away.

795
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,200
He wants to know what she does for work.

796
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,140
What are you good at, then?

797
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,740
What am I good at?

798
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,810
(Thinking)

799
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,940
I...

800
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,950
never went to school.

801
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,780
Were you home-schooled?

802
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,150
Yes. With my older brother.

803
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,160
- That's interesting.
- Right?

804
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,120
- Were you abroad?
- I wasn't.

805
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,890
- You were in Korea? How fascinating.
- In Korea.

806
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,360
I think I got to try...

807
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,760
a lot of stuff during that period.

808
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,800
(Fascinated)

809
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,410
Since when?

810
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,410
I finished elementary school,

811
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,610
and then I was home-schooled.

812
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,880
(Amazed)

813
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,250
I was home-schooled for about three years.

814
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
- That was pretty short.
- Yes.

815
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,790
What about high school?

816
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,320
Then, I went straight to college.

817
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,160
- He went to college early.
- He's a genius.

818
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,030
Doesn't that mean he went to college
when he was a teenager?

819
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,900
(He went to college
after he was home-schooled for 3 years?)

820
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,430
They're telling us his job now.

821
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,000
Is it Chan Hyeong's job?

822
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
(As soon as he gets to work,)

823
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,470
(he takes out a white gown.)

824
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,810
(Flapping)

825
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,680
- He's a doctor?
- Is he a doctor?

826
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,210
(He's been practicing as an internal
medicine physician for 6 years.)

827
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,450
I do mostly two jobs.

828
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,690
I treat patients as a doctor...

829
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,860
He was home-schooled,
and he became a doctor?

830
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
That's impressive. He must be intelligent.

831
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,690
(After 2 years of pre-medical studies,
4 years of medical school,)

832
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,160
(followed by 5 years of internship
and residency training,)

833
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,060
(he became an internal medicine specialist
when he was 26 years old.)

834
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,300
(He started practicing
earlier than others.)

835
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
I will now begin the endoscopy.

836
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,970
He was confident for a reason.

837
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,740
You might feel uncomfortable
as it's gone deep now.

838
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,780
Every time they asked me
what my dream was in elementary school,

839
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,350
I wrote, "Doctor."

840
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,350
(His childhood dream, doctor)

841
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,790
So, I started studying for it
when I was home-schooled.

842
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,460
- That's incredible.
- I only studied at home,

843
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,160
so it took a toll on me
to keep studying...

844
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,800
for so long.

845
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,600
So, I went through the courses
faster than others...

846
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,300
and went to college early.

847
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,910
He must be gifted.

848
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,140
("The youngest person in Korea
to enter and complete medical school")

849
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,080
I became a medical student when I was 15.

850
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,180
Oh, my gosh.

851
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,080
He went to medical school
at the age of 15?

852
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Oh, my gosh.

853
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,020
He became a doctor really fast.

854
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,090
He did.

855
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,020
(Little Chan Hyeong
dreamed of helping others,)

856
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,130
(so he chose internal medicine,
where he treated a cold to cancer.)

857
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,360
He's excellent.

858
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,660
That's so impressive.

859
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,600
(In the evening after his work)

860
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,930
I don't think that's all.

861
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,100
That's when I decided...

862
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,070
to do things that would create meaning.

863
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,750
So, I went on a medical volunteer trip
to Cambodia,

864
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
and I noticed that a lot of them...

865
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,790
already had phones.

866
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,790
But they had never seen a doctor before
in their lives.

867
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,020
I was like, "What?"

868
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,820
The devices are up-to-date,

869
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,590
but they weren't provided
with up-to-date medical care.

870
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,900
Treating them individually
would be helpful, but I thought...

871
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,730
numerous people could benefit
from systematic changes.

872
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,140
I thought I could make a difference
in an IT sense.

873
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,470
That's when I started going around,
looking for developers.

874
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,540
I'm currently working hard
as the CEO of a start-up company.

875
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,950
He started a company?

876
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,250
(For more people
to benefit from medical care)

877
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,850
The sky's the limit for him.

878
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,620
To be precise, we're looking to reach
Stage 8, but we'll start from Stage 6.

879
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,650
(He's busier than anyone else.)

880
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,720
As we keep executing it,

881
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,060
we'll be able to plan a digital system.

882
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,290
He's a doctor and a start-up CEO.

883
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,060
He's intelligent.

884
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,960
- I've never seen such qualifications.
- Exactly.

885
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,230
He's practically a genius.

886
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,370
He was the youngest person in Korea
to enter medical school.

887
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,000
He was the youngest person to enter...

888
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,370
- and earn a master's and doctoral degree.
- Gosh.

889
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,910
Considering his achievements,
we might be able to look him up...

890
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,010
in an encyclopedia.

891
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,710
I'm a parent of students,

892
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,880
so I'm like, "Chan Hyeong is impressive!"

893
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,520
(You want him as your son-in-law,
don't you?)

894
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,390
He's become the ace participant
of this show now.

895
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,750
You're number one!

896
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,490
- I wish I had a son like him.
- At the age of 15...

897
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,420
Yes, I also wish I had a son like him.

898
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,390
Only extraordinary people
can achieve what he did.

899
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,200
With such qualifications,

900
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,600
it's easy to be conceited.

901
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,470
- But he's considerate to others,
- Right.

902
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,240
and he had the ability to draw out...

903
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,640
people's best qualities.

904
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,670
(You're right.)

905
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,610
Ha Neul is also impressive.

906
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,280
She finished a master's program
in Korean dance.

907
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,480
Most of them have a master's degree
or a doctoral degree.

908
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,780
You have no place there
with only a bachelor's degree.

909
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,020
(Disappointed)

910
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,290
- I think she's also a model.
- She is.

911
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,390
I thought she was too pretty.

912
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,860
(Pondering)

913
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,130
Am I the only one who knows
that you were home-schooled?

914
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,970
Yes. No one else knows.

915
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,640
- Not even Ji Min?
- No one but you.

916
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,210
Really? But when you're sharing a room,

917
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,610
- you may bring it up.
- No, this is my first time.

918
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,180
- She keeps mentioning Ji Min.
- He still has a place in her heart.

919
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,380
You're making me curious.

920
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,090
(Glancing)

921
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,650
You seem really clever.

922
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,420
That's why I can't wear glasses.

923
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,730
- Will you look like an engineering major?
- When I wear a pair of glasses,

924
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,360
it might amplify that image of mine.

925
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,770
- Did you bring your glasses?
- I did.

926
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
- Show me later.
- When I'm working...

927
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,040
Well, there are two kinds.

928
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,070
(Serious)

929
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,140
Show me.

930
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,240
- That's cute.
- I'll show you one of them for now.

931
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,280
Sure.

932
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,050
I've gotten even more curious now, though.

933
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,380
- Sorry?
- I'm even more curious now.

934
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Same here.

935
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,880
Well... How should I put this?

936
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,550
- Even yesterday...
- Right.

937
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,720
And this morning too, when I asked you...

938
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,630
to spend the day with me,
my curiosity toward you....

939
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,830
- It grew.
- grew.

940
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,030
I felt some sort...

941
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,430
of kinship with you.

942
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,570
- In many ways.
- But then,

943
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,300
I learned you did a lot of things.

944
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,770
Also,

945
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,010
you seem to be good at what you do.

946
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
I try hard.

947
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,380
Were you easily able to fit this trip...

948
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,320
in your schedule?

949
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
(Curious)

950
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,520
I have a job
that allows me to be flexible.

951
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,690
If I work harder, I can do a lot more
in the same time frame.

952
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,460
If I want to rest,
I can take some time off.

953
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,870
- Also, I can be flexible...
- That sounds great.

954
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,640
by talking it out
and asking for more time.

955
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,440
(I see.)

956
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,380
I wanted to meet someone
who was their own boss.

957
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,280
Because that's how I would define
my work and job as well.

958
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,120
- She could easily understand.
- Right.

959
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,950
- I wouldn't have to explain as much.
- Of course.

960
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,790
- You're right.
- It still won't be easy...

961
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,760
if both of us are busy,

962
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,090
especially if we're to start a family.

963
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,300
We wouldn't have enough time.

964
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,600
(An in-depth conversation continues.)

965
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,170
He mentioned having a family.

966
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,510
(Proud)

967
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,580
(A red sunset
envelops the nighttime of Fiesole)

968
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
It's really pretty.

969
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,680
They make a great couple.

970
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,890
- I can see the sun from here.
- You're right.

971
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,290
- Right?
- That's the right expression.

972
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,220
It's so pretty.

973
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,690
It's beautiful.

974
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,160
Why don't we observe from here?

975
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,500
- Sounds good.
- They're speaking casually now.

976
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,930
If you look over there,
you'll see the moon.

977
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,000
- Where?
- Over there.

978
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
- I don't see it.
- Look at it from here.

979
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,540
A plane just flew...

980
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,440
- over it.
- You're right. It's there.

981
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,640
(The moon photographed by Chan Hyeong)

982
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,550
Isn't it fascinating?
The sun and the moon...

983
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,350
- are together.
- They're together.

984
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,150
What makes it perfect is this branch.

985
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,120
You're right. It adds charm and romance.

986
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,990
(A charming and picturesque evening)

987
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,660
- This is interesting.
- Why am I so amused by this?

988
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,270
- We're the only ones here.
- Right.

989
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,330
The others are at the square.

990
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,470
- That's why I love it more.
- Right.

991
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,970
- I'm sure we had the most fun today.
- Also,

992
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,810
I bet we enjoyed
the most beautiful scenery.

993
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,780
Where they're at...

994
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,340
- It should be beautiful.
- would be beautiful too, but still.

995
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,210
(Snapping)

996
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,080
You're good at taking photos.
I noticed that.

997
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,490
(Flustered)

998
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,320
I knew you had been receiving texts.

999
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,490
You were aware of it.

1000
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,760
There's a pattern to your words.

1001
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,590
(A gentle nudge)

1002
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,600
I guess I should've...

1003
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,770
changed how I talked.

1004
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,570
- I still would've known.
- Of course.

1005
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,610
Goodness.

1006
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,310
(Chan Hyeong has been
texting Ha Neul every night.)

1007
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,410
Chan Hyeong's only been texting
one person.

1008
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,080
(I hope the weather tomorrow
will be as good as today's!)

1009
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,950
(I hope you have a restful night!)

1010
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,150
That's how he sent his texts.

1011
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,690
"I hope..."

1012
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,790
No wonder Ha Neul pointed out the pattern.

1013
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,830
Right.

1014
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,300
Being consistent is a great quality.

1015
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,330
Absolutely.

1016
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,260
Being consistent is important.

1017
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,470
It sure is.

1018
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,270
I hope you won't change.

1019
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,340
Goodness.

1020
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,710
I wasn't expecting that.

1021
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,510
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,280
(Does it end here?)

1023
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,280
- Come on!
- What?

1024
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,550
(The bride enters.)

1025
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,350
Gosh, the dates are really important.

1026
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,890
- No way.
- They're so important.

1027
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,060
Things rapidly progressed
between those two.

1028
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,030
- They were fond of one another,
- Right.

1029
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,430
but doesn't it feel like Ha Neul,
who seemed reserved,

1030
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,630
- took a big step?
- A huge one.

1031
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,400
- It was enough to solidify things.
- Right.

1032
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,100
Chan Hyeong's great on 1-on-1 dates.

1033
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,100
He reached deep into her heart.

1034
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,110
To me, Ha Neul was the one
who delivered the last punch.

1035
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,780
(Ha Neul's meaningful words)

1036
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,620
- It signaled to a future.
- I wasn't expecting that.

1037
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,320
Also, Chan Hyeong couldn't stop smiling.

1038
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
- That's right.
- He was beaming.

1039
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,620
- He likes her a lot.
- Absolutely.

1040
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,290
Here's what I want to know.

1041
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,260
Both of them have
positive energy and attitudes.

1042
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,990
There's a good chance
they'll be going on dates...

1043
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,000
- with other people.
- Right.

1044
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,330
I wonder how he'll be...

1045
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,530
with other women.

1046
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,330
I bet he'll be nice to them.

1047
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,940
Ha Neul smiles brightly
and engages in conversations too.

1048
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,210
So even though the date went well,

1049
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,140
I feel like we'll have to keep watching.

1050
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,340
Because the two...

1051
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,550
are naturally cheerful and kind.

1052
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,450
There's a scene that's been bugging me.

1053
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,650
The date was going just fine,

1054
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,750
but Ha Neul suddenly asked
if Ji Min also knew it.

1055
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:50,490
(During her date with Chan Hyeong,)

1056
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,390
(Ha Neul mentioned Ji Min.)

1057
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,760
There's a reason she brought him up,

1058
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,600
and it must mean she was thinking
about Ji Min during their date.

1059
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
(No way.)

1060
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,840
- I'm bothered by how she mentioned him.
- I see.

1061
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,100
Ha Neul, don't be like that.

1062
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,610
Ha Neul, my gosh. Don't do that.

1063
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,710
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won's date)

1064
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,840
Are you cold? Should I turn it on?

1065
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,750
It's funny how it looks so warm though.

1066
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,820
I know.

1067
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,680
It could be summer by the looks of it.

1068
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,950
- This is so cool.
- I know.

1069
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,090
- It's amazing.
- I'm curious about that building ahead.

1070
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,990
- Is it a cathedral?
- Beats me. It does look like one.

1071
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,930
It could be owned by the boss
of this town.

1072
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,930
The town's richest person.

1073
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,700
It's to symbolize who's boss.

1074
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,200
(The scenery is a wonder.
How will their date go?)

1075
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,100
Their conversation flows.

1076
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,370
What's your preference
when it comes to trips?

1077
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,710
Are there places you like to visit?

1078
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,550
I pin a few locations on a map.

1079
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,080
- Then...
- You save them on the app?

1080
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,780
That's right.

1081
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,590
But I don't stress out
when things become impromptu.

1082
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,290
- Right.
- I actually find that amusing.

1083
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,630
However, I don't take a single step...

1084
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,160
without having a plan first.

1085
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,600
Those who don't mind random trips...

1086
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,430
don't even look up the transportation
they must take.

1087
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,400
- They just head out the door first.
- I can't do that.

1088
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,310
There are people like that.

1089
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,640
It surprised me.

1090
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,180
I wouldn't be able to sleep
due to the worry.

1091
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,210
Exactly.

1092
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,410
- They're on the same page.
- What a relief.

1093
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,610
It seems like Ji Won's having a good time.

1094
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,580
Chang Hwan makes people feel relaxed.

1095
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,150
(Thinking)

1096
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,220
What do you do in your spare time?

1097
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,990
In my spare time?

1098
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,760
I like baseball.

1099
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,290
Do you like going to the stadium?

1100
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,400
I don't go there often.

1101
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,400
I watch the game on TV,
but at the stadium?

1102
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,330
I have my cat and dog to look after.

1103
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,800
He has both a cat and a dog?

1104
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,210
It's obvious which book is yours.

1105
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,910
- Busted.
- Oh, dear.

1106
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,980
He's Mr. Yellow.

1107
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,650
(Before leaving for Italy)

1108
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,720
Could it be...

1109
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,520
Who is it? Is that Ji Won?

1110
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,420
(Smirking)

1111
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,290
(The Pairing Book Ji Won selected)

1112
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,420
Was it yellow?

1113
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,460
(The Pairing Book Ji Won selected
was yellow.)

1114
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,460
- I think you're right.
- I got goosebumps.

1115
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,600
I got goosebumps.

1116
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,630
(Ji Won...)

1117
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,840
(chose Chang Hwan's Pairing Book.)

1118
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,940
That's exciting.

1119
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,210
There was a question about...

1120
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,510
a normal day you'd like
to enjoy with your spouse.

1121
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,280
"After coming home from work,"

1122
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,780
"I'd like us to talk about our day
and how we felt..."

1123
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,820
"over warm dinner
so that we could relate..."

1124
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,690
"to how we each feel
and comfort each other."

1125
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,320
That's about a 99-percent match...

1126
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,030
to what I picture
as my everyday life with my spouse.

1127
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,030
His view on marriage
seems to be similar...

1128
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,000
to mine.

1129
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,440
She figured out it was him
when he talked about his cat and dog.

1130
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,880
Goodness.

1131
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,680
("Because I have a cat and a dog,
I'm busy on my days off.")

1132
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,150
(Glancing)

1133
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,420
Look at her glancing at him.

1134
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,220
She smiled.

1135
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,120
(Is Chang Hwan from the yellow book
the person Ji Won imagined?)

1136
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,420
- I'm curious about something.
- Sure.

1137
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,360
Can a cat and dog live together?

1138
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,330
My dog's on the sensitive side.

1139
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,570
It's sensitive,

1140
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,540
so rather than friends,

1141
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,070
they're more like roommates.

1142
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,410
- They're just roommates.
- That's cute.

1143
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,210
- They're complete strangers, but...
- A cat as a roommate...

1144
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,350
- and a dog as a roommate.
- That's right.

1145
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,080
They don't hate each other,

1146
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,780
but they don't like each other either.

1147
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,990
They just live their own lives.

1148
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,550
(Chang Hwan's dog, Seong)

1149
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,220
- How adorable.
- It's so cute.

1150
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,090
(His cat, Yeon)

1151
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,190
And they live together?

1152
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,260
Them being that close
means they get along.

1153
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,930
A Chinese restaurant in Florence?

1154
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,670
- They went to a Chinese restaurant?
- Shall we head farther in?

1155
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,070
Doesn't this look
like a traditional Japanese ramen?

1156
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,300
You're right.

1157
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,910
Maybe that's what we should order.

1158
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:58,870
We'll ask them
to make it exactly like this.

1159
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,580
(Joking)

1160
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,380
- It's ramen.
- That looks good.

1161
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,810
That looks really good, though.

1162
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,380
- Enjoy.
- And dim sum.

1163
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,550
We'll enjoy it together.

1164
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,350
- I'll enjoy it.
- I'll enjoy it.

1165
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,620
- It's good.
- Isn't it good?

1166
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,560
- My body just melted.
- Doesn't it...

1167
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,090
- remind you of tteokguk?
- Yes.

1168
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,100
Ji Won's looking even more relaxed.

1169
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,560
They seem relaxed around each other.

1170
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,600
- It's delicious. My gosh.
- That's so good.

1171
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,770
- It's so good.
- This is amazing.

1172
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,510
My body's warming up,

1173
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,910
- thanks to the tasty dish.
- Right?

1174
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,410
I suddenly feel much kinder.

1175
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,610
(Laughing)

1176
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,680
That's a unique expression.

1177
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,720
- When you're cold...
- You become snappier.

1178
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,550
Snarkier and unkinder.

1179
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,020
I don't think we need to order beef.
Or should we?

1180
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,230
- I'm good.
- I'm good as well.

1181
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,700
- This seems just right.
- Right.

1182
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,160
I can't eat a lot in one sitting.

1183
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,730
Same here.

1184
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,130
Maybe, I have a small stomach.

1185
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,700
I eat small amounts but often.

1186
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,940
We're the same.

1187
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,100
- They're compatible.
- In about 2 to 3 hours,

1188
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,770
- Really?
- I might enter a shop,

1189
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,840
saying I'm hungry.

1190
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,310
That's why I always
carry around an energy bar.

1191
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,610
That's what I always have for breakfast.

1192
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,950
We seem to have similar lifestyles.

1193
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,780
That's very important.

1194
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,950
They're compatible.

1195
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,750
They should marry.

1196
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,920
We seem to have similar lifestyles.

1197
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,890
- That's cute.
- What...

1198
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,060
What's yours?

1199
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,560
- Your favorite food.
- My favorite food?

1200
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,300
Ever since I was a kid,

1201
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,270
I enjoyed jjajangmyeon.

1202
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,630
Jjajangmyeon.

1203
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,700
- Likewise.
- What?

1204
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,840
- Really?
- Yes.

1205
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,110
Seriously?

1206
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,170
I prefer ganjjajang.

1207
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,280
Yes, that's what he wrote.

1208
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,440
- Really?
- Yes, he wrote that.

1209
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,550
I must say this, though.

1210
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,550
There aren't many places
that make a good ganjjajang dish.

1211
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,620
Do you have a favorite place
that serves a good one?

1212
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,960
(Thinking)

1213
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,490
- Around Mapo.
- Mapo?

1214
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,090
From there, you travel up.

1215
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,500
- Take me there once we're in Seoul.
- Sure.

1216
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,530
(Startled)

1217
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,770
Something got stuck.

1218
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,070
(What on earth?)

1219
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,010
- Ji Won.
- I love it.

1220
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,280
(Please have ganjjajang in Seoul.)

1221
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,640
(How adorable.)

1222
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,710
- Do you have anything to ask?
- To ask?

1223
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,050
(Pondering)

1224
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,220
It can be anything.

1225
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,350
What I want to know most
is what you do for a living.

1226
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,490
That's something
I'm dying to know as well.

1227
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,160
(The uniquely charming Chang Hwan is...)

1228
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,700
- What does he do?
- Here we go.

1229
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,860
What are we seeing?

1230
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,400
- It's an airport.
- An airport?

1231
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,970
I'm a commercial airline pilot.

1232
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,080
A pilot that operates the Boeing 777.

1233
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,280
- No way. Is he a pilot?
- Is he a pilot?

1234
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,950
(A pilot?)

1235
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,450
Seriously?

1236
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,980
(No way!)

1237
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,250
I've been a pilot for ten years already.

1238
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,690
We constantly look at the sky...

1239
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,090
and the clouds
when operating the aircraft.

1240
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,630
- No way.
- I'm stunned by their beauty every time.

1241
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,900
There are stunning moments...

1242
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,300
that I hope everyone
gets to see at least once.

1243
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,670
(The fluctuating sky has him on edge.)

1244
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,270
(Beautiful scenery
one can't easily see...)

1245
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,440
(Thunderclouds)

1246
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,710
He's even seen the northern lights.

1247
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,940
(He gets to enjoy beautiful scenery
one can't easily see.)

1248
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,310
That's a shot of Jeju Island from above.

1249
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,580
All I did was fly and land the plane,

1250
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,480
but when...

1251
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,520
the passengers thank me
for the safe flight,

1252
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,750
- I feel proud.
- Gosh.

1253
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,190
He's a pilot.

1254
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,160
- That...
- That's unexpected.

1255
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,760
(He's a seasoned pilot who is responsible
for his passengers' safe journey.)

1256
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,990
That's so cool.

1257
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,330
- He gets to travel around the world.
- Exactly.

1258
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,760
On his first day,

1259
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,370
I thought there must be a reason
he knew so much about wine.

1260
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,140
Yes, of course. Exactly.

1261
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,570
He's comfortable
being in foreign countries.

1262
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,510
We don't get to see the pilot often.

1263
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,240
- We rarely get the chance.
- At the airport,

1264
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,710
- we see them when the crew walks by.
- That's right.

1265
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,310
I don't remember seeing a pilot
that handsome before.

1266
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,780
I'm amazed.

1267
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,180
- I'd love to see him in his uniform.
- I bet he looks good.

1268
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,090
- He'll look good for sure.
- Of course.

1269
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,290
It was the same for "Heart Signal,"

1270
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,360
but they seem different...

1271
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,460
- once you know what they do.
- Of course.

1272
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,690
- Right.
- Their profession adds another layer.

1273
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,160
I'm a fan of Chang Hwan's.

1274
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,260
(He now has a new bias.)

1275
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,200
That's what I'm most curious about,

1276
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,960
but it's not something I can ask.

1277
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,800
- I'm now full.
- Right.

1278
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,540
I ate too fast, and now I'm suddenly full.

1279
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,270
- Let's go.
- Sure.

1280
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,610
The food here was delicious, right?

1281
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,240
I'm truly satisfied.

1282
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,550
- They make a good couple too.
- Tell me about it.

1283
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,080
- Isn't it pretty here?
- It is.

1284
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,450
(The sparkling streets of Italy)

1285
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,320
The shops and streets
have Christmas vibes now.

1286
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,620
Right. Goodness.

1287
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,990
- My gosh. This is nice.
- I love it.

1288
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,400
(Here and there, you sense Christmas.)

1289
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,430
- This is cute.
- It is.

1290
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,430
Is that a cat or a dog? What is it?

1291
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,400
- It's cute.
- I see, it's a dog.

1292
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,870
I like things that are cute.

1293
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,340
I don't seem that way though
because of my beard.

1294
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,950
The videos I'm recommended
are about cute dogs, or...

1295
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,580
- They leave you hooked.
- Right.

1296
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,750
- How adorable.
- Look how cute it is!

1297
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,090
Please try some.

1298
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,760
(A gelateria famous for its pastries
and espresso that opened in 1921)

1299
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,430
- I'll go ahead and try some first.
- Sure.

1300
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,430
- Is it good?
- This is a flavor I like.

1301
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,070
I like nutty flavors.

1302
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,740
(Savoring)

1303
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,280
- It's really good.
- It's warm and delicious.

1304
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,240
How is everything today this good?

1305
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,010
Ji Won is beaming right now.

1306
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,920
I'm loving the atmosphere between them.

1307
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,450
Chocolate cake or strawberry cake?

1308
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,790
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry?

1309
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,490
(A game of This or That suddenly begins.)

1310
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,830
Yangnyeom fried chicken
or plain fried chicken?

1311
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,160
A game of This or That?
This needs to be done well.

1312
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,630
I wonder what she'll say.

1313
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,630
(Will this also prove
that they're compatible?)

1314
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,200
Yangnyeom fried chicken
or plain fried chicken?

1315
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
(Laughing)

1316
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,570
That's a tough one.

1317
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,840
If I had to choose,
I'd go with plain fried chicken.

1318
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,800
- Plain fried chicken?
- Yes. What about you?

1319
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,340
I choose yangnyeom fried chicken.

1320
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,580
- I see.
- Because...

1321
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,610
there's this one dish I love.

1322
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,780
- Which is?
- It's from this brand.

1323
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,210
I know what it is.

1324
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,350
This is what I should ask next.

1325
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,090
The controversial ones.

1326
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,990
- Such as?
- Like Hawaiian pizza.

1327
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,920
Hawaiian pizza, like or dislike?

1328
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,190
I don't mind it. I can't say I hate it.

1329
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,700
- I don't hate it either.
- Right.

1330
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,870
- I don't actively order it, though.
- Exactly.

1331
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,630
Or like...

1332
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,400
- Mint chocolate?
- Yes.

1333
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,010
- I don't hate that either.
- I like mint chocolate.

1334
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,170
- I actually prefer it.
- There are days...

1335
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,110
when I really crave mint chocolate.

1336
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,050
You crave that mintiness
in mint chocolate.

1337
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,050
- What about coriander?
- I eat them.

1338
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,620
We've got many options then.

1339
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,550
The two get along well.

1340
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,390
Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

1341
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,420
Do you like Pyeongyang naengmyeon? I...

1342
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,090
- I love them.
- Same here.

1343
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,930
Really? Nice.

1344
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,990
(Totally...)

1345
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,430
(in sync)

1346
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,070
I relieve my stress by eating.

1347
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,630
We're the same in everything.

1348
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,200
(Thinking)

1349
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,010
What do you consider in marriage?

1350
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,540
- "In marriage?"
- Like your partner.

1351
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,440
- That's straightforward.
- Let's go.

1352
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,910
Since I'll be living
with that person forever,

1353
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,580
I've always...

1354
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,290
wanted my spouse...

1355
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,690
to be my best friend...

1356
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:30,830
or something like that since I was young.

1357
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,430
In short, you want him to be your lover
and your friend.

1358
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,870
Yes.
A lover and a friend are different, but...

1359
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,730
I get you.

1360
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,000
It's better than
an uncomfortable relationship.

1361
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,110
We'd talk more.

1362
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,840
That's my ideal type.

1363
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,180
Being able to communicate well
with my spouse...

1364
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,280
is crucial.

1365
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,380
- That was an important point.
- What she said was important.

1366
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,820
Chang Hwan has the same standard.

1367
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,620
- Nice.
- Really?

1368
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,690
Yes.

1369
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,660
Whether or not they can also
be your good friend...

1370
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,230
- seems important too.
- Exactly.

1371
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,260
(They have a serious talk
about marriage values.)

1372
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,500
Isn't that the most essential?

1373
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,730
Marriage is a reality.

1374
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,470
You'll stay with that person all the time.

1375
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,340
That's the one you'll live with forever.

1376
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,270
What's your ideal?

1377
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,040
A friendly person.

1378
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,540
- Really?
- "A friendly person?"

1379
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,580
It really depends. I'm sure everyone...

1380
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,020
is friendly and kind in some situations.

1381
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,850
But even in bad situations...

1382
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,460
Some are born with friendliness,

1383
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,160
while some are born with kindness.

1384
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,760
Right. That's important.

1385
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
(Nodding)

1386
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,460
(Glancing)

1387
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,430
That tendency won't ever change.

1388
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,540
Are you good at dancing?

1389
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,580
"Dancing?"

1390
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,010
I liked dancing in school.

1391
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,210
- I was in the dance club.
- Really?

1392
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,150
(He realizes something.)

1393
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,420
What did he realize?

1394
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,920
(University dance club)

1395
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,060
The dance club?

1396
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:09,860
The Pairing Book.

1397
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,260
(The Pairing Book owner
was in a dance club.)

1398
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,230
(The owner of that very Pairing Book
is Ji Won.)

1399
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,530
(Getting goosebumps)

1400
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,070
They were on the same page.

1401
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,570
Oh, my.

1402
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,440
- That's fate.
- What?

1403
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,640
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won
chose each other's Pairing Book.)

1404
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,380
(And their favorite movie
of all time is...)

1405
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,420
(6. The movie I love and a scene from it)

1406
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,820
("About Time:" The main characters
enjoying the wedding...)

1407
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,550
(despite the heavy rain was beautiful.)

1408
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,890
- "About Time."
- Yes!

1409
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,620
- The two wrote "About Time."
- I got goosebumps.

1410
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,230
I watched it more than five times.

1411
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,290
And I cried at the table tennis scene
every time I watched it.

1412
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,700
That scene was the most...

1413
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,100
I'm tearing up just talking about it.

1414
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,030
It's meaningful in many ways.

1415
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,270
It must feel strange at that moment.

1416
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,570
- It's in "About Time."
- In what?

1417
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,740
"About Time."

1418
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,310
The father tells the son...

1419
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,680
to marry a friendly woman.

1420
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,550
- His heart must've fluttered.
- Right?

1421
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,380
Even my heart is fluttering.

1422
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,520
- What?
- Oh, gosh.

1423
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,650
What? How exciting.

1424
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,390
(A partner sharing the same
ideal marriage values)

1425
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,890
(Tearing up)

1426
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,130
(Touched)

1427
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,860
It must feel strange at that moment.

1428
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,170
We should take this couple out.

1429
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,170
- Stop.
- Right?

1430
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,400
- I'll set them aside like this.
- Okay.

1431
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,440
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won)

1432
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,440
It seemed like Ji Won
didn't have much expectation.

1433
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,410
But didn't "About Time"
bring the situation to the climax?

1434
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,050
- Isn't it like a movie?
- Exactly.

1435
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:51,980
It started with ganjjajang,
then exploded with "About Time."

1436
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,520
(A whirlpool of emotions)

1437
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,550
I loved it.

1438
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,650
(How cute.)

1439
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,590
And for two people
to have so much in common?

1440
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,830
It's called reciprocity of feelings.

1441
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,000
You come to like the person who likes you.

1442
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Right.

1443
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,330
That makes their feelings go deeper.

1444
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:13,370
Especially when the movie they chose
ends up being the same,

1445
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,140
it'll really boost those feelings.

1446
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,180
To think there would be such a pairing.

1447
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,780
I'm seeing Chang Hwan in a new light.

1448
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,880
- Chang Hwan was so cool.
- Absolutely.

1449
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:23,850
We have one couple left.

1450
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,720
Ji Min and Je Yeon.

1451
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,950
- And Woo Jae.
- As for Woo Jae,

1452
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,420
what was he doing?

1453
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:30,990
Let's continue.

1454
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:33,960
Do you have a date?

1455
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,560
Do you want to join me?

1456
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:37,890
(I'm in.)

1457
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,130
- Finally, it's Je Yeon and Ji Min.
- Right?

1458
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:43,530
(Ji Min finally goes on a date
with Je Yeon.)

1459
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,170
(Feeling nervous)

1460
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,270
It could be cold.

1461
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,870
But...

1462
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,080
- It's here.
- You're right.

1463
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,310
Wasn't all of it for Ji Won?

1464
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,180
- I already gave it to her.
- Give me one.

1465
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,620
- Is it attachable?
- I'm good.

1466
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,450
(Je Yeon tidies her outfit
before the date.)

1467
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,490
- You'll use it, right?
- Yes.

1468
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,290
It's quite dirty.

1469
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,830
(Being thorough)

1470
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,330
A place we haven't been to yesterday.

1471
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,300
(He notices her.)

1472
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,620
Do you have a hand warmer?

1473
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,920
I'm warm,
but I got one for you in advance.

1474
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,290
- I'll give it to you.
- Thank you.

1475
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,990
So this is how you take credit.

1476
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,530
- It's not taking credit.
- Who did you get it from?

1477
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,630
It's a technique I should learn.

1478
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,400
(The hand warmer owner)

1479
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,060
- It looks good on you.
- It does.

1480
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,200
- You can have it.
- I feel dizzy.

1481
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,040
I stuck it on.

1482
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,540
- It's on my back.
- Good.

1483
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,580
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's date)

1484
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,550
- Cover yourself with this.
- Thank you.

1485
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,950
- It's soft.
- It's super soft.

1486
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,990
He gave his jacket.

1487
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,160
- Is there silence between the two?
- Yes.

1488
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,870
(Spacing out)

1489
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,540
To Je Yeon, such silence...

1490
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,640
- is nothing.
- Exactly.

1491
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,710
(Smiling)

1492
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,180
- You know,
- Yes?

1493
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,510
out of all the facial expressions,

1494
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,980
you have a spacing-out expression.

1495
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,880
"A spacing-out expression?"

1496
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,520
- What is it like?
- Quite often,

1497
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,420
- you have a blank expression.
- "A blank expression?"

1498
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,060
(During breakfast)

1499
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:55,670
(She was smiling brightly,)

1500
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,040
(then spacing out.)

1501
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,770
The shrimp...

1502
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,310
(Ji Min spotted Je Yeon
spacing out a couple of times.)

1503
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,350
Were you thinking about something?

1504
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,480
I just space out for real.

1505
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,890
- I like spacing out.
- Really?

1506
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,820
(Je Yeon has a reason for spacing out.)

1507
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,560
- What's your favorite food?
- My favorite food?

1508
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,160
Beef?

1509
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Beef?

1510
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,670
We had a lot of beef here,

1511
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,600
- so now, I'm craving pork belly.
- Pork belly?

1512
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,970
- So you like pork belly.
- Yes.

1513
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,510
- I love pork belly too.
- Really?

1514
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,040
I also like sashimi.

1515
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,510
What type of sashimi?

1516
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,240
I like yellowtail sashimi.

1517
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:42,980
- Big yellowtail in season now?
- Yes.

1518
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,080
- I also like rockfish and flatfish.
- I see.

1519
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,680
But you don't drink soju?

1520
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,690
If I had a high tolerance for alcohol,

1521
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,660
- I would've drunk a lot.
- That's so fascinating.

1522
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,890
It's possible not to drink soju
while eating big yellowtail?

1523
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,660
Is there something unexpected?

1524
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,960
I don't know.

1525
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,000
Is this how you're going to play?

1526
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,730
Surprisingly, now that he's with Je Yeon,

1527
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,570
the way he talks became gentle.

1528
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,170
Compared to when he was with the guys.

1529
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,170
I remember the first impression
I had of you.

1530
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,380
- Your first impression of me?
- Yes.

1531
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,680
- You seemed very shy.
- Very shy?

1532
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,520
Yes, that's how she was on the first day.

1533
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,790
(Je Yeon seemed very shy
since the first day.)

1534
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,120
I will try to adjust...

1535
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,490
to your speed.

1536
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,990
- My speed?
- Yes.

1537
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,990
What speed are you talking about?

1538
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,330
You seem to take your time slowly.

1539
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,860
For what?

1540
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,530
The time you take...

1541
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,200
- to get to know someone.
- The time I take to get close to someone?

1542
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,270
- Yes.
- I see.

1543
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,970
I didn't know about that scene.

1544
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,370
He's practically confessing
his love to her.

1545
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,940
For Ji Min,
the difference is extremely clear...

1546
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,580
- between friendship and love.
- It's very clear.

1547
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,380
What I mean is that
you shouldn't feel pressured.

1548
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,420
Okay.

1549
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,590
You don't need to try...

1550
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:58,860
- to break the silence.
- To break the silence,

1551
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,460
- talking nonsense...
- You don't need to.

1552
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,860
- I don't need to?
- No.

1553
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,830
The weather is so beautiful.

1554
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Right.

1555
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,030
- A lot happened in the car.
- Yes.

1556
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,600
It's pretty here.

1557
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,770
- What was this tree called?
- The name of this tree?

1558
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,410
- Cypress tree.
- Cypress.

1559
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,080
Do you know that
there's an avenue of cypresses?

1560
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,080
- Is there?
- It's one of the tourist spots.

1561
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,120
- I saw it in photos.
- I see.

1562
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,180
Those trees are lined up.

1563
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,820
- That sounds so beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1564
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,260
During the day, it's very sunny.

1565
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,260
That'd be so beautiful.

1566
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:36,130
Without buildings like these,

1567
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,630
- Only the trees?
- there are only trees.

1568
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,000
- It's like a forest.
- Yes.

1569
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,470
After some time, we could go there.

1570
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,510
Okay.

1571
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,220
Is your first impression of someone
very important?

1572
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,720
- He's very forward.
- First impression?

1573
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,790
First impression?

1574
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,400
(Smiling)

1575
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,300
Don't answer. It seems hard for you.

1576
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,000
- Let's skip it.
- I was recalling...

1577
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,040
the past.

1578
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,640
You seem way too contemplative.

1579
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,810
It has been so long...

1580
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,540
- Okay, never mind.
- that I can't remember.

1581
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,710
That's enough.

1582
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:32,180
(Thinking hard)

1583
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,050
Things could change.

1584
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,120
My first impression of someone
isn't everything.

1585
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,090
You could become more interested
in someone as you get to know him.

1586
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,760
- I see.
- Yes.

1587
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,300
Once time passes,

1588
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,640
as long as I'm not a bad person,

1589
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,370
I think we can be close.

1590
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,710
Yes.

1591
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,680
- Pardon?
- What?

1592
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,750
Ji Min looks so happy.

1593
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:07,750
Okay.

1594
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,120
- I think you're on the right track.
- Okay.

1595
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,930
This is amazing.
It looks beautiful already.

1596
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,730
Isn't it beautiful?

1597
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,330
Seriously.

1598
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,770
This isn't the bridge
that we saw yesterday.

1599
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:24,830
You're right.

1600
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,570
Ji Min, isn't it because you're seeing it
with someone else?

1601
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,710
It's so beautiful.

1602
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:29,940
(Even the view looks different today.)

1603
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,510
Is it because it was cloudy yesterday?

1604
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,980
- I think so.
- That looks beautiful.

1605
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:34,680
It's a completely different place.

1606
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,520
- We walked here yesterday.
- It looks so pretty.

1607
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,720
Right.

1608
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,650
It didn't look like this.
There wasn't a waterfall either.

1609
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,990
(A new feeling, a new discovery)

1610
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,360
I'm raising my voice.

1611
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,660
(Giggling)

1612
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,500
Gosh, they look great together.

1613
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,770
Are you okay with walking for ten minutes?

1614
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,740
Yes, I'm okay. It's not that cold.

1615
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1616
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,780
As the weather is nice,
it looks so beautiful.

1617
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,010
I agree.

1618
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,880
- I finally feel like I'm traveling.
- Exactly.

1619
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,790
Do you usually walk fast?

1620
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,360
I walk fast when I'm in a hurry.

1621
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,060
That's needless to say.

1622
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,290
- Do you usually walk slowly?
- It's needless to say.

1623
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,600
I usually walk slowly.

1624
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,200
Ji Min wants to be playful with her.

1625
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,870
I tend to walk slowly.

1626
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,670
To answer your question,
the type I like is...

1627
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,370
I don't know if it's okay to say this,

1628
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,980
but I like women who are elegant.

1629
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,140
Elegant?

1630
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,710
(A moment ago, in the car)

1631
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,110
We had a lot of fun yesterday.

1632
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,420
- The four of you?
- Yes.

1633
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,790
All four of us have
different personalities.

1634
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:49,790
I see.

1635
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,450
Our ideal types are also different.

1636
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,990
Did you talk about your ideal types?

1637
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,990
Yes.

1638
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,390
- Could you tell me?
- Whose type you want to know?

1639
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,960
All four of you.

1640
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,500
I'll tell you if you choose only one.

1641
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,970
- Only one?
- Yes.

1642
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,570
What type of women do you like?

1643
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,110
Me?

1644
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,640
You want to know about mine?

1645
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,110
You told me to choose only one.

1646
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,510
She's clever.

1647
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:15,040
- She is.
- Je Yeon is also clever.

1648
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,250
- I like women who are elegant.
- Elegant?

1649
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,220
And calm.

1650
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,720
Something like that.

1651
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,820
Ji Min is very honest.

1652
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,820
- Yes.
- Right.

1653
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,290
Feel free to take photos
if you find it pretty.

1654
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,320
I will.

1655
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,660
If not, you can take photos of me.

1656
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:31,890
Sure.

1657
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,430
- I want to keep souvenirs.
- Okay.

1658
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,800
I came back here after a long time.

1659
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,900
Ji Min doesn't stop smiling.

1660
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,240
I guess you can't hide your feelings.

1661
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,010
It's beautiful. Look over here.

1662
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,810
(Exclaiming)

1663
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,710
There's another person kayaking.

1664
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,580
- Are you cold?
- No.

1665
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,450
Je Yeon, what type of men do you like?

1666
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,520
- Type of men I like?
- Yes.

1667
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,890
Like what I said.

1668
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,560
(Well...)

1669
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,860
Let me think about it.

1670
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,760
I've never thought about it.

1671
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,200
- Okay. Slowly.
- Slowly.

1672
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,160
- Take your time.
- Okay.

1673
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,800
Don't count to ten.

1674
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:17,370
What he said is quite meaningful.

1675
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,280
When he said, "Slowly."

1676
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,280
Among men who say that
they'll match the woman's speed,

1677
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,210
hardly any of them keep their promise.

1678
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,150
(He's so honest.)

1679
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,150
Is that so?

1680
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:29,250
- They always do what they want.
- It's something you say...

1681
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,720
- when things aren't going well.
- Right.

1682
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,290
He wants to see things in the long run.

1683
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,460
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1684
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,660
That was smooth.

1685
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,030
(On a street in Florence,)

1686
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,500
(a Korean couple is taking
wedding photos.)

1687
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,770
Mr. Groom, please step forward a little.

1688
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,100
Ms. Bride, hold your hands in front.

1689
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,670
(Rushing)

1690
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,010
I wasn't the only one mistaken, was I?

1691
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,370
- No.
- Right?

1692
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,480
- Yes.
- I thought that she was talking to us.

1693
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,010
(Something funny happens by chance.)

1694
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,480
When she was calling for the bride...

1695
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
Wait a minute.

1696
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,120
(Flustered)

1697
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,090
- We came the opposite way.
- The opposite?

1698
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,120
Oh, no. I got lost.

1699
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,690
- Then naturally...
- It's the complete opposite.

1700
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,130
- Let's search for it again.
- Goodness.

1701
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,160
Gosh, that startled me.

1702
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,370
I felt so guilty.

1703
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,030
(Thankfully,
they're going in the right direction.)

1704
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,570
I almost broke out in a cold sweat.

1705
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,770
(Their date is in full swing now.)

1706
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,870
It's the merry-go-round from yesterday.

1707
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,680
It's the plaza that I mentioned.

1708
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,850
- Is it where you came ten years ago?
- That's right.

1709
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:33,150
- With buskers in the evening?
- Yes.

1710
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,920
(Ji Min has memories of Florence
Republic Square from 10 years ago.)

1711
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,020
I came here.

1712
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,960
I have good memories.

1713
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,860
- Of this place?
- Did you walk here at night?

1714
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,060
- I didn't walk here.
- It's so beautiful.

1715
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,430
That's so pretty.

1716
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,100
Ten years ago, I was there...

1717
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,730
for 4 to 5 hours and spaced out
while feeling the breeze.

1718
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:54,300
From 7 to 11 p.m.

1719
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,040
I was alone then.

1720
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:02,180
I saw couples spending time together
passing by.

1721
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,110
I also saw old couples.

1722
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,520
I have such a wonderful
and romantic memory of this place.

1723
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:10,990
It's beautiful.

1724
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:15,120
- Do people perform here?
- Yes.

1725
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,090
This place came up when I looked up
"merry-go-round in Florence."

1726
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,390
It must be the only place.

1727
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,300
(Starting with a warm cup of coffee)

1728
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,230
- It looks delicious.
- It does.

1729
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:26,400
Tell me which one you like.

1730
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,770
- One that I like?
- Yes.

1731
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,170
- This one.
- The black one?

1732
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,570
They look delicious.

1733
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,440
Can we order here? Cool.

1734
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,710
Shall we order these four?

1735
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,980
That sounds good.

1736
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,650
- I'll hold it.
- Thanks.

1737
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,820
Which one do you want?

1738
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,460
I'd like...

1739
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,960
- You wanted this one, right?
- Yes, didn't he say...

1740
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,060
- that it's coffee-flavored?
- Yes.

1741
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,960
- Let's have one each.
- Okay.

1742
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,270
(Eating)

1743
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,700
(Eating)

1744
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,940
He keeps looking at her. Goodness.

1745
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,670
- It's good.
- It's so good.

1746
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:05,710
It's really good.

1747
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,910
It's very soft.

1748
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,050
It's like chocolate.

1749
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,220
Eating something good is making you
speak in a dialect.

1750
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,190
(Flustered)

1751
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:19,090
- It's very...
- It's very funny.

1752
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,590
"It's good."

1753
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,630
Aren't you speaking with an accent
right now?

1754
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,000
- Me?
- Yes.

1755
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,870
With people from Gyeongsang Province,
I speak with an accent.

1756
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,600
I'm wondering if you've influenced me.

1757
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,670
- That's cute.
- I didn't speak with an accent.

1758
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,740
I can speak with an accent.

1759
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,370
No, don't do it.

1760
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,610
Why don't we...

1761
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,180
- No?
- Don't do it.

1762
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:41,710
Why don't they?

1763
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,850
- Show us how cute you are.
- Show us.

1764
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,050
Later,

1765
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,350
why don't we do it at home...

1766
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,890
for about ten minutes?

1767
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,150
- He's making a promise.
- Speaking in an accent.

1768
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,990
No way.

1769
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,920
You'd be very different.

1770
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,790
When I came to Seoul for the first time,
I was shocked.

1771
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,000
- Because people are so friendly? Me too.
- Yes.

1772
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,460
You know what I mean?

1773
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,100
People speak so gently.

1774
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,540
In the beginning, when people called me
with the Seoul accent,

1775
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,700
I almost fell in love with them.

1776
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,170
Wasn't that how you felt?

1777
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,110
- People seem so friendly.
- Exactly.

1778
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,480
They're on the same wavelength now.

1779
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,350
It's delicious.

1780
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,180
- Which one? Was chocolate the best?
- Yes.

1781
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,780
I'm on a sugar high right now.

1782
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,050
You know what I mean? A sugar high.

1783
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,290
You seem more energetic.

1784
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:26,160
It's because I had sugar.

1785
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,620
She became very positive.

1786
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,820
She looks hyper.

1787
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,130
- I think...
- You became completely different.

1788
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,930
I needed some sugar.

1789
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,160
(Giggling)

1790
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,530
We didn't eat anything sweet...

1791
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:39,100
at home.

1792
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,340
- Is that right?
- Don't you think?

1793
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,310
For a month,

1794
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:49,250
whenever I see chocolate,
I'll buy some for you.

1795
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,410
Thank you.

1796
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,420
- Goodness.
- He can't hide it.

1797
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,120
(Naturally, they made a promise.)

1798
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:58,790
What if you don't?

1799
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,090
(Laughing)

1800
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,130
We should take a photo of this.

1801
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:11,000
(A photo by Ji Min, A photo by Je Yeon)

1802
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,240
- You aren't cold, right?
- I'm not cold.

1803
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,340
The warmer feels nice.

1804
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,540
My back is warm.

1805
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,550
(Surprised)

1806
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,180
It's very...

1807
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,220
(They notice caricatures on the street.)

1808
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,450
- Hello.
- They're caricatures.

1809
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:33,120
(They stop naturally.)

1810
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,460
Shall we try it?

1811
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,260
Don't we need to pay him in cash?

1812
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,590
- Together. Yes.
- Together?

1813
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:43,230
In his drawings,

1814
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,200
the characters stand out...

1815
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,300
when you look at the mouth.

1816
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,570
They look funny.

1817
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,610
Comical?

1818
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:53,710
Yes, comical.

1819
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:55,440
No, I mean...

1820
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,910
Not comical.

1821
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,980
Not comical.

1822
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,580
Not comical.

1823
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,590
A normal picture. Yes.

1824
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,290
(Okay.)

1825
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,560
It's making me nervous.

1826
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,290
He's drawing without hesitation.

1827
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,030
(Try to smile.)

1828
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,630
(Smiling)

1829
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,970
He's drawing the body too.

1830
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,140
He draws well in detail.

1831
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,610
Someone is busking.

1832
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:30,410
(They hear music from somewhere.)

1833
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,520
You must have thick eyelashes.

1834
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,630
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm not.

1835
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,690
- They look great together.
- I agree.

1836
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,360
(The music is...)

1837
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,300
(followed by bubbles.)

1838
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,070
(Glancing)

1839
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:57,910
(Smiling)

1840
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,780
- Why are you laughing?
- It's nothing.

1841
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,980
Why are you laughing? Tell me.

1842
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,150
(They're laughing for no reason.)

1843
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,760
- There's a good vibe between them.
- Yes.

1844
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,420
(Feeling shy)

1845
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:17,730
They're so nice.

1846
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,730
(Fidgeting)

1847
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,700
Are you good at drawing?

1848
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,270
What was your drawing?

1849
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,470
(Startled)

1850
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,670
Was it a tree?

1851
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,280
Was your drawing in the book a tree?

1852
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:35,140
Was there a tree?

1853
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:40,180
(He wants to know anything he can.)

1854
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,120
(Watching carefully)

1855
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,320
(Watching carefully)

1856
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,420
I look...

1857
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,720
(The front teeth are protruding.)

1858
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,630
- Did you see it?
- That's a funny drawing.

1859
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,500
I haven't seen it yet.

1860
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,960
Does it look funny?

1861
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,700
(Laughing)

1862
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,730
Do you know an animated series...

1863
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:59,800
called "Attack on Titan?"

1864
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:01,700
It looks like
one of the characters from it.

1865
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,270
Is it a titan?

1866
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,110
Yes.

1867
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,310
(She notices the drawing.)

1868
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,110
When he drew up to the eyes,

1869
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,450
- I felt good.
- It looked good.

1870
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,950
- But the mouth...
- The mouth...

1871
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,650
- The teeth shouldn't be showing.
- You shouldn't have smiled.

1872
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,350
I won't smile.

1873
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,090
(Tight lips)

1874
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,320
He closed his mouth.

1875
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,760
No smile.

1876
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,560
Smile.

1877
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,790
- No smile.
- No?

1878
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:26,860
No.

1879
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:29,870
Are you only going to save yourself?

1880
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,130
- Okay, I'll smile.
- Smile.

1881
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,300
(Please draw me with a smile.)

1882
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,740
(How will it look?)

1883
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,980
(The front teeth couple's
drawing is ready.)

1884
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,410
(Bursting out laughing)

1885
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,780
Is that really me?

1886
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,010
(The drawing shows both of their smiles.)

1887
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,150
(Bravo.)

1888
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,080
(The unexpected cuteness
made it a satisfying date.)

1889
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,690
How much is it?

1890
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,720
(Their memory in Florence
is colored like the sunset.)

1891
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,190
I'll pay for it.

1892
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,290
Would you like to take a photo
with the drawing?

1893
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,890
(Their memory in Florence
is colored like the sunset.)

1894
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:00,600
- That's memorable.
- They'll remember the drawing forever.

1895
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,000
They'll remember it forever.

1896
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,770
(Tonight,
you'll have dinner together in Florence.)

1897
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,900
(Before dinner,)

1898
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,170
(find a souvenir gift from Italy.)

1899
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:10,610
Again...

1900
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,280
(Thinking)

1901
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,510
(The residents have to buy
a souvenir gift from Italy.)

1902
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:18,150
What should I get as a gift?

1903
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,950
I can't decide.

1904
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,820
You should decide who it's for first,

1905
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,590
and then think about the gift.

1906
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,360
- A gift that'll suit them?
- Exactly.

1907
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,630
We're currently here. It's a bit...

1908
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,660
- There's a market over here.
- How about this route?

1909
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,430
- Let's go up that road.
- Over there?

1910
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:41,140
(Woo Jae chooses a gift alone.)

1911
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,440
(Attentive)

1912
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:49,710
- How cute.
- You could put olive oil in here.

1913
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,750
(Everyone chooses a gift of their own.)

1914
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,850
It has the vibes...

1915
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,350
- of Florence.
- Yes. They're pretty.

1916
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,720
I want to buy them all.

1917
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:01,420
(He has chosen a heartfelt gift.)

1918
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:04,790
One, two, three? Or only this?

1919
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,730
I see. This one.

1920
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:12,270
(Who will Woo Jae give the gift to?)

1921
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,070
Shall we head to Piazzale Michelangelo?

1922
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:16,170
- Okay.
- Good.

1923
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,340
You don't take photos, do you?
How about one?

1924
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,040
No, I'm good.

1925
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,110
It'd be nice to take one
in Piazzale Michelangelo.

1926
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,920
With the sun about to set...

1927
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,380
- and all.
- I think I can take one.

1928
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,790
Tell me one of the two.

1929
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:37,760
When it's warm
and you're completely sober.

1930
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,530
I like someone who's warmhearted.

1931
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:44,870
Me too. But is that all?

1932
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:48,700
I told you the other one
when everyone was there.

1933
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,210
Someone with a bright smile.
Someone who smiles well.

1934
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
He keeps smiling.

1935
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,480
How cute.

1936
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,980
(He keeps thinking about the ideal type.)

1937
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,850
It's sort of...

1938
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,790
I can kind of get the type you prefer.

1939
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,330
- Really?
- Yes.

1940
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,100
You feel like an office worker.

1941
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,000
- She's speaking casually.
- Why all of a sudden?

1942
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,770
It's the feeling I get.

1943
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,770
After listening to me talk?

1944
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,470
Accounting? Tax?

1945
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:27,010
Sorry?

1946
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:28,880
A tax accountant?

1947
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,450
- Me?
- Yes.

1948
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,580
- Does it suit me?
- Kind of.

1949
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,050
I did like math.

1950
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,420
(What does Ji Min, who seems good
with numbers, do for a living?)

1951
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,620
But I'm not in that industry.

1952
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,050
(Seocho-gu, Seoul)

1953
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,090
What's this?

1954
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:46,500
(Ji Min is busy
from early in the morning.)

1955
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,660
I come up with plans...

1956
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,500
in the Strategy Development Team.

1957
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,470
(His wristwatch)

1958
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,800
He works for a big company.

1959
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:56,410
Samsung Electronics.

1960
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:59,740
I majored in electrical engineering
at Sungkyunkwan University.

1961
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,710
I got a job at LG...

1962
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,280
and worked for them for two years.

1963
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:07,650
My first transfer was to Hanhwa.

1964
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:12,050
I was lucky enough to get a call
from a headhunter...

1965
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:14,360
and started working
for Samsung Electronics in May.

1966
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,260
He's in a core department.

1967
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,390
The Strategy Development Team.

1968
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,160
(Ji Min is competent, getting a call
from Korea's best company.)

1969
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,430
You're an accountant. Aren't you?

1970
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,000
(Who knows?)

1971
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:28,600
I was surprised just now.

1972
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,910
My friend is an executive.

1973
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,740
He graduated from the same university,
majored in the same department,

1974
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,410
and is the executive of the same company.

1975
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,110
- I have a feeling he knows Ji Min.
- Right.

1976
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:39,420
- An alumnus.
- Exactly.

1977
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,450
I'll ask him.

1978
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:45,550
From what I know,
only elites are chosen...

1979
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:48,720
for that company's
Strategy Development Team.

1980
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,190
- Yes.
- Right?

1981
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,830
- Ji Min must have a brilliant mind...
- I agree.

1982
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:55,000
- and be acknowledged.
- Yes.

1983
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,430
We've got some competent people
with us today.

1984
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,600
- As it's Heart Pairing,
- Exactly.

1985
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,200
everyone has a splendid job.

1986
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,140
All the participants are on the show
to get married.

1987
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:07,640
Did you not guess
what other people's jobs might be?

1988
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,810
Really? What did you think mine was?

1989
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:13,850
I thought you must be a rookie
in an office.

1990
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,990
I bet you grew up getting hurt a lot.

1991
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,430
But I think you bottled it up inside
without expressing it.

1992
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,600
(How funny.)

1993
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,410
You looked quite softhearted.

1994
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,310
(What does Je Yeon,
who looks softhearted, do?)

1995
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,980
(Tapping)

1996
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,720
(Seoul Central District Court)

1997
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,920
Don't tell me...

1998
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,350
Hi. My name is Lee Je Yeon.

1999
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:53,590
I was born in 1995 and am an attorney.

2000
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:56,590
(Je Yeon has been an attorney
for 5 years.)

2001
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,890
An attorney?

2002
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,660
(An attorney?)

2003
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:03,130
(Behind her quiet personality...)

2004
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:06,470
(is cool-headed rationality.)

2005
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,610
(She passed the 10th bar exam in 2021.)

2006
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:11,140
- Really?
- That's cool.

2007
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:15,880
When it comes to companies,
there's this neatness.

2008
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,810
Things just sit right in place.

2009
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:20,220
It's fun.

2010
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:23,320
Being able to figure out...

2011
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,950
what the legal issue is right now.

2012
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,660
I've dealt with fields
other than industries,

2013
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,260
like real estate, inheritance, and more.

2014
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,500
I knew I couldn't only do...

2015
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,030
what I wanted to
once I opened my own office.

2016
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,570
The accessibility to the court.

2017
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,540
It has to be close enough
for me to dash out...

2018
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,280
while getting ready.

2019
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,280
(A legal expert ready to rush out)

2020
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,480
(Charismatic)

2021
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,180
Upon hearing that she's an attorney...

2022
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,920
- Now that we know she's an attorney,
- We feel small.

2023
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,450
my thoughts are becoming one-sided.

2024
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,690
Je Yeon seems more rational.

2025
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:03,590
(I totally get it.)

2026
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,090
- I kind of understand.
- Right?

2027
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:07,400
- There's a prejudice with occupations.
- But listen, Jong Shin.

2028
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,000
Such prejudices...

2029
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,330
All of a sudden, I can't help but think
she's more rational than emotional.

2030
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:14,300
I never imagined her to be an attorney.

2031
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,570
An attorney.

2032
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,640
Did you think about her job?
Did an attorney cross your mind?

2033
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,740
No.

2034
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:21,440
People assume
attorneys are good at talking.

2035
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,850
After watching Episodes 1 and 2,

2036
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,780
I was worried she wouldn't speak up.

2037
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,780
(Same here.)

2038
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,490
She graduated from Yonsei University
with honors.

2039
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,950
- Oh, my gosh.
- With honors?

2040
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,220
- Law school.
- And she went to law school.

2041
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,290
I doubt Ji Min can ever guess
she's an attorney.

2042
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,330
- Ji Min is in great trouble.
- Seriously. True.

2043
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:42,230
Ji Min will fall deeper in love
with Je Yeon...

2044
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:43,830
after he figures out her job.

2045
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,800
Three things he looks for
in a partner are...

2046
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:49,070
sincerity, trust, and a strong mentality.

2047
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,240
Aren't those the three qualifications
of an attorney?

2048
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,410
(Totally.)

2049
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:54,640
- Ji Min is in trouble.
- There was a reason...

2050
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,280
he was attracted to her.

2051
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,380
- Yes.
- A reason behind it.

2052
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,510
Je Yeon could look after
Samsung Electronics.

2053
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,920
(Laughing)

2054
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,360
My lips are chapped.

2055
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,690
Mine are too.

2056
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:14,700
- Apply some of this.
- Thank you.

2057
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,700
(Tapping)

2058
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,000
- Do you already like it?
- It's already so pretty.

2059
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,170
- It's pretty?
- Yes.

2060
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,140
- It's gorgeous.
- The sky...

2061
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:24,870
What? It's so pretty.

2062
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:26,810
Look at the sunset.

2063
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,480
(The colors of the sunset
have covered the sky.)

2064
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,650
Seriously.

2065
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,080
How nice.

2066
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,680
That tree is pretty too.

2067
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,120
It's gorgeous.

2068
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,120
Everyone is standing over there.

2069
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,190
(People are gathered at the big tree.)

2070
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,860
You really won't take a photo?

2071
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,830
I'll take one for you.

2072
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:46,430
You want to take one now, right?

2073
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:48,560
(Busted)

2074
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,830
That's adorable.

2075
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,870
- I'm right, aren't I?
- No.

2076
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,840
It's nice to leave memories together.

2077
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,100
True.

2078
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,310
That's what I meant.

2079
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:59,340
(An impressive and unforgettable moment)

2080
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,510
How pretty.

2081
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,180
- The sunset is more intense.
- Now...

2082
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:07,150
The more beautiful it becomes
as time goes by.

2083
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,920
The sunset is amazing.

2084
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:13,590
I like pastel colors.

2085
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,720
- Same here.
- Really?

2086
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,730
- There's a pastel color.
- Over there?

2087
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:18,860
- It looks so picturesque.
- Right.

2088
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,430
It's so beautiful.

2089
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,500
I guess someone's busking here.

2090
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,000
Everyone is sitting on the steps.

2091
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,870
- I see. On the steps here?
- Yes.

2092
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,210
(Skillful)

2093
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:37,780
Did you take a picture of the sunset?

2094
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:39,250
I'm about to.

2095
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,180
(Glancing)

2096
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,390
(Clicking)

2097
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,320
But the sunset is that way.

2098
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,060
(Embarrassed)

2099
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,490
- He finds her cute.
- She's cute.

2100
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:54,760
I wanted to take a picture
of the city too.

2101
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,000
- Okay.
- Yes.

2102
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,370
There's something about him.
He can make her laugh.

2103
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,430
(Trying again)

2104
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:00,970
You're so funny.

2105
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:05,010
- It's so beautiful. Seriously.
- Yes.

2106
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:06,610
There are so many different shades
of colors.

2107
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,140
- Right. They're shades of pastel colors.
- Yes.

2108
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,580
I think that's important in relationships.

2109
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,650
- It wasn't that funny.
- Right.

2110
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,680
That's true.

2111
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:15,950
(Turning)

2112
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,020
The lights are on.

2113
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,690
(Surprised)

2114
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,930
It's so beautiful. How picturesque.

2115
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,090
Truly. What a stunning view.

2116
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:28,900
(The hour when Florence is tinged
with an evening glow)

2117
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,000
- This is amazing.
- It looks beautiful over there too.

2118
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,340
(They are mesmerized
by the night view of Florence.)

2119
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,640
It's beautiful.

2120
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,180
- This view here looks pretty too.
- Yes, it does.

2121
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,710
You know what? This does look like...

2122
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,850
- Right?
- a wallpaper on cell phones.

2123
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:48,880
We only see the moon and a star.

2124
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,990
- You're so right.
- Right?

2125
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,320
I should take a picture of that.

2126
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:56,390
(Clicking)

2127
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:02,830
(Something else grabs their attention.)

2128
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:05,700
(The melody of the guitar in Florence)

2129
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,340
(Staring)

2130
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:16,410
(The two of them become quiet.)

2131
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,380
(Glancing)

2132
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,320
Are you satisfied?

2133
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,420
(Totally.)

2134
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:30,560
(They listen to the music for a moment.)

2135
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:42,940
(What is...)

2136
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:45,610
(on their mind now?)

2137
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:49,910
(Glancing)

2138
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,750
(Focused)

2139
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,280
- Are you enjoying the music now?
- Yes.

2140
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,060
- It's completely night now.
- Yes.

2141
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,260
The lights are shining brightly now.

2142
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,930
(The beautiful night view,)

2143
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:13,100
(accompanied by the melody of the guitar)

2144
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:20,940
(Romance deepens amid the bright lights.)

2145
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:28,380
(Captivated)

2146
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,820
I still can't believe this.

2147
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,950
Why am I in Italy again?

2148
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,690
I don't even know if I'm indeed
enjoying the view of Florence.

2149
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,700
I see.

2150
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,200
- Do you want me to take a picture of you?
- Why do I feel so shy?

2151
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,070
But you still want to take a picture.

2152
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:49,740
(Shy)

2153
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:52,470
- So...
- I think you can stand there.

2154
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,240
Should I take it like this?
Or should I not cover my face?

2155
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:55,940
- Don't cover your face.
- Don't cover it?

2156
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,210
- Could you take it from there?
- From there? The sunset?

2157
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,380
It's cold.

2158
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:04,920
(Ji Min shyly poses for the camera.)

2159
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,060
You don't have to make me look tall.

2160
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,690
Is that so? Okay.

2161
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,360
(Chuckling)

2162
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,030
(Enthusiastic)

2163
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,500
But there are a lot of people
in the picture.

2164
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:16,730
You can come closer to take it.
You can include that in the picture.

2165
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,430
That's not how you take it.

2166
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,000
- What? What's going on?
- What?

2167
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,370
- Did you come here alone?
- Yes.

2168
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,370
What?

2169
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:23,540
(Woo Jae shows up out of the blue.)

2170
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,610
What?

2171
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,910
(Teasing)

2172
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,710
- Did you come here alone?
- Yes.

2173
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:30,780
- Really?
- Yes.

2174
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,680
- After buying the present.
- Were you here...

2175
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,920
- Can you take the picture then?
- the whole time?

2176
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,620
- Should I take a picture of you two?
- Oh, no. How could this happen?

2177
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,520
- No. Of him.
- Yes, take a picture of us too.

2178
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,190
I'm not a good photographer.

2179
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,520
(Exuding the vibe of an expert)

2180
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,760
Wait. That should be in the picture.

2181
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,360
Actually, I'm not that good either.

2182
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:48,660
(Sighing)

2183
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,300
- Ji Min must have mixed feelings.
- I'm not good either.

2184
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:51,400
But you just told me...

2185
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,830
- I wasn't doing a good job.
- I was joking.

2186
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,640
- You were joking?
- Here. Take it.

2187
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,840
- No.
- Wait.

2188
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,010
We should take it here.

2189
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:59,540
Look at Ji Min's facial expression.

2190
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,880
- I don't think this is good.
- It's taking too long.

2191
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,710
Let me zoom in a bit.

2192
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,510
Is it too much?

2193
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,450
(There's some awkward tension
between Ji Min and Woo Jae.)

2194
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,390
I'll just take a lot of them.

2195
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,920
No. I think that's good.
You took a lot of pictures.

2196
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:16,590
- You really don't want to take one?
- Pardon?

2197
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,190
- Let me take one for you.
- I won't.

2198
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,830
- Why not?
- I'm shy.

2199
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,360
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

2200
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,630
I'm good.

2201
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:25,430
What did you do by yourself?

2202
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,270
I walked around.

2203
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:28,670
I bought presents.

2204
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:29,900
- You bought presents?
- You did?

2205
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,310
- I did.
- What did you buy?

2206
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,170
- I didn't buy it yet.
- I just bought simple things.

2207
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,580
What did you do?

2208
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,210
We...

2209
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,450
- We had coffee.
- We had coffee.

2210
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,020
- You had coffee.
- We also had desserts.

2211
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,680
We walked.

2212
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,250
- What did we do next?
- The caricature.

2213
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,290
We got the caricature done.

2214
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:45,390
- Really?
- Yes.

2215
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:46,590
(Smiling)

2216
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,320
(Nodding)

2217
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,790
- Where are you going next?
- Us?

2218
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:53,560
We were going to enjoy the view
and then go for dinner.

2219
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,860
Right, we have to buy presents.

2220
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,800
- You'll go and buy presents?
- Yes, we will.

2221
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,400
It's 5 p.m.

2222
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:00,800
It's... So we must be
at the restaurant by 7 p.m.

2223
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,870
Right.

2224
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:03,440
- What time is it?
- It's 5 p.m.

2225
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,910
Two hours?

2226
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,640
(Thinking)

2227
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,440
Could you take a picture of Ji Min?

2228
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,310
- I...
- You might not like the pictures I took.

2229
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:12,580
No. It's really okay.

2230
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,220
- I'm awful at taking pictures.
- I...

2231
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,280
It doesn't matter...

2232
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,920
- as long as you captured this.
- Really?

2233
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,120
That's all I need.

2234
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:22,320
(Checking)

2235
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,390
(Staring)

2236
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

2237
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:30,830
Should we leave around 5:30 p.m.?

2238
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,000
To buy presents?

2239
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,600
To buy presents? Okay.

2240
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:37,570
(Glancing)

2241
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:40,410
- Oh, my.
- Have fun.

2242
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,480
What should I buy? Where will you go?

2243
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,510
Where will you go?

2244
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:45,650
I don't have a plan.
I thought about getting coffee.

2245
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:46,750
Where?

2246
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,350
- Oh, no.
- Is that a cafe?

2247
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,620
- We...
- Yes?

2248
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,050
(Pondering)

2249
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,720
Then we'll leave a little earlier...

2250
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,130
- and buy presents.
- Okay.

2251
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,590
Do you want to join us later?
So we can head to the restaurant together?

2252
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:01,260
- Before the restaurant?
- Yes.

2253
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,630
Sounds good.

2254
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:04,370
- Then...
- We'll be around...

2255
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,570
and quickly buy presents.

2256
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:07,340
- Ji Min won't ask him to tag along.
- Okay.

2257
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,800
Sounds good.

2258
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,110
Then I'll see you guys
when you finish shopping.

2259
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,440
(Let's do that.)

2260
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:14,780
(Gazing)

2261
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:17,280
Well, let me know once you're done.

2262
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:19,810
- I'll have coffee in the meantime.
- Sure.

2263
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,320
Sounds good.

2264
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,720
- See you later.
- See you later.

2265
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,690
Hey, check out the night view.

2266
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:35,760
(Woo Jae is alone again.)

2267
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,830
Will he feel a bit lonely
if he goes to the cafe alone?

2268
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,170
Oh, my.

2269
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:43,670
I think Je Yeon sort of
wanted him to join them.

2270
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,010
- Actually, Woo Jae was...
- Yes?

2271
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,350
being considerate today.

2272
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,480
He was considerate?

2273
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,350
So...

2274
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,360
Chan Hyeong always went out
in a group of three.

2275
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:02,760
- I see.
- It was always the three of them.

2276
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,890
So they probably didn't have time
to talk to people 1-on-1.

2277
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,400
He thought that it was fair...

2278
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,300
for Chan Hyeong
to have a 1-on-1 date today.

2279
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,370
He didn't mind sitting this one out,
so he yielded today.

2280
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,400
He was being considerate.

2281
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,740
Right.

2282
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,510
I was grateful and felt bad
at the same time.

2283
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,750
That's it. I thought you should know.

2284
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,780
(She learns about
Woo Jae's thoughtful action only now.)

2285
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:38,790
(He's back to walking around the city.)

2286
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:44,130
(And he spends time alone.)

2287
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:49,200
- It's so beautiful.
- Totally.

2288
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,450
Shall we go?

2289
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,480
- Are you done?
- Pardon?

2290
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,220
- We can spend more time here.
- Shall we then?

2291
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,650
Until 5:30 p.m.?

2292
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,850
- You're really enjoying this.
- What?

2293
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:08,990
- You must really like this place.
- I really like it.

2294
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,130
Or we can enjoy the view on the steps.

2295
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:12,330
Sounds good.

2296
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,500
- But...
- Yes?

2297
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,830
- you're wearing a skirt.
- Then... I see.

2298
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:18,900
Right?

2299
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,200
- Let me try it, though.
- What?

2300
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,640
I'll try it.
If I don't think I can, I'll get up.

2301
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,910
- I'll cover you when you sit down.
- Yes.

2302
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,240
- Thank you.
- It's clean here.

2303
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,310
Here?

2304
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,780
Aren't you cold?

2305
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,290
It's nice with this on my legs.

2306
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,960
(Clicking)

2307
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,020
(Leaning in)

2308
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,890
(Surprised)

2309
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,890
The song is over.

2310
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,160
I missed the timing. Let me try again.

2311
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:58,270
(As the night deepens,)

2312
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:01,780
(they get closer.)

2313
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,710
(Focused)

2314
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:07,550
- Aren't you cold? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

2315
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:09,820
(Covering his face)

2316
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,550
He keeps staring at her.

2317
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:16,990
He's looking at her again.

2318
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,900
(Immersed)

2319
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:33,710
(They focus on listening to the music,
forgetting about the cold weather.)

2320
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:39,310
(For some reason,
warmth embraces their body and heart.)

2321
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:42,980
(Can you see couples that are paired up?)

2322
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:48,020
(Mission 3: Guess the results
of tonight's pairing now.)

2323
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,490
We'll be playing individually today.

2324
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:51,290
- They will send messages to each other.
- My gosh.

2325
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:54,900
We must guess
how many couples are paired up.

2326
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,470
Our guessing results will be important,
starting this episode.

2327
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,000
Starting today, the person...

2328
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,940
who wins first place
of correctly guessing the pairings...

2329
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,270
until the last episode...

2330
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,470
will get a chance to stay...

2331
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:08,210
in the Pairing House in Tuscany for
2 nights, which is worth 8,000 dollars.

2332
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:09,580
- Among us?
- Wait.

2333
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:10,880
- Among us?
- Among us.

2334
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,050
- Among us?
- First place among us?

2335
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:13,980
The winner can stay in the house
for two nights.

2336
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,220
- Really?
- My gosh.

2337
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,650
- Is it the same house? Okay.
- Yes.

2338
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:19,320
Can I also do pull-ups?

2339
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,420
- Yes, you can.
- I see.

2340
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,860
- I can do pull-ups there? Okay.
- Yes.

2341
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,520
- So you have to buy a plane ticket...
- I'll take this seriously.

2342
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,030
- to stay there for two nights.
- Okay.

2343
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:26,690
That will probably cost more.

2344
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:28,660
They won't cover the plane tickets?

2345
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,600
- That will probably cost more.
- We must still go.

2346
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,100
- I really want to win the voucher.
- I see.

2347
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,540
- Then...
- It's equivalent to 8,000 dollars.

2348
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,110
All right. Let's go around the room
and present our guesses.

2349
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,340
Should we start with the couple...

2350
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:40,580
- we're certain about?
- Yes.

2351
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,180
I chose Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2352
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:43,180
- Same here.
- Same here.

2353
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:45,250
Toward the end of their date,

2354
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,780
there was so much warmth on their faces.

2355
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:48,450
- I can't forget that.
- Right.

2356
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,150
That made me feel happy to watch.

2357
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,450
Good, Ji Won.

2358
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:54,560
All of us chose Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

2359
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,690
- It's unanimous.
- It's unanimous.

2360
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:57,260
- So we got one couple.
- Yes.

2361
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,990
- And this couple is our insurance.
- Yes.

2362
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:00,800
- Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.
- Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

2363
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,500
I think they will pick each other too.

2364
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

2365
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:05,570
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.
Does everyone agree?

2366
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:06,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

2367
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:07,840
It's unanimous.

2368
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,670
What about Ji Min and Je Yeon?
Let's talk about them.

2369
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,110
Gosh, I'm not sure.

2370
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,780
Ji Min will choose Je Yeon, right?

2371
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,280
- Yes.
- I agree.

2372
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,680
I think Je Yeon will choose Ji Min too.

2373
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:19,380
- Je Yeon too?
- Yes.

2374
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,680
- Here's what I think.
- Yes?

2375
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:24,750
They come back to the house and send
the message as they reflect on their day.

2376
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,620
We saw three couples go on a date today.

2377
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:31,390
I think they had the biggest
romantic chemistry among all the dates.

2378
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,090
That's true.

2379
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,660
Je Yeon kept on smiling.

2380
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,670
- The date went better than expected.
- Yes.

2381
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:40,440
It was a satisfying day for Je Yeon?

2382
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,300
I think it was much better
than she expected.

2383
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,440
(Je Yeon might send the message to Ji Min
after enjoying her day with him.)

2384
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,370
- And...
- If they enjoy the date, do they...

2385
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:46,540
- usually send messages to each other?
- Yes.

2386
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:47,980
Yes, I think so.

2387
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,980
I'm not really sure.

2388
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,180
- Hold on, Chung Ah.
- Yes?

2389
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,250
- Are you up for taking a risk?
- How?

2390
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:56,520
Did you want to go
with Woo Jae and Je Yeon?

2391
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:58,820
- Sort of.
- Same here.

2392
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,260
- We now have a prize. Think carefully.
- Woo Jae...

2393
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,230
- This is how people are.
- Right.

2394
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:07,200
- You know, money can be a scary thing.
- Yes.

2395
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,260
You think Woo Jae and Je Yeon
will choose each other?

2396
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,800
Yes. I get the feeling that they will.

2397
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,730
To be honest, I was certain...

2398
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:15,800
that Woo Jae and Je Yeon
would be a fixed pairing.

2399
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,440
But now, I'm not so sure.

2400
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,840
Here's how Je Yeon could have taken it.

2401
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,080
She could have been disappointed.

2402
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,080
If Je Yeon had to ask the guys,

2403
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,880
she would have asked Woo Jae out.

2404
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,480
- But Woo Jae didn't do that.
- Right.

2405
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,390
That could influence her decision.

2406
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,560
- Ji Min.
- I think she'll send it to Ji Min.

2407
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,820
- When you go down the list,
- Yes. You're right.

2408
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,860
- you end up with one person.
- Yes.

2409
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:39,630
- We all paired three couples.
- Yes.

2410
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:41,800
So our guess is three couples.

2411
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,900
Now, let's think about Woo Jae
and guess where his heart lies.

2412
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,830
I think he will text Ji Won.

2413
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,170
- What?
- I see.

2414
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:50,040
When Ji Won walked in on the first day,

2415
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,410
- Woo Jae looked at her differently.
- It was so different.

2416
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,240
- Right.
- I'd never seen him make that face.

2417
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,580
But he barely interacted with Ji Won.

2418
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,350
No,
he could've chosen her out of curiosity.

2419
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:02,120
I think Woo Jae will send the message
to Je Yeon.

2420
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,850
- I see. Woo Jae and Je Yeon.
- Here's why.

2421
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,420
He mentioned that he wanted...

2422
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,590
to go to this square with her
in the 1st 2 episodes.

2423
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:09,590
He must have gone there today
for a reason.

2424
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:10,590
I agree.

2425
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:11,790
- That's what I think.
- He was checking it out in advance.

2426
01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:13,090
Ji Seon, you also chose...

2427
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,760
- Je Yeon for Woo Jae's message.
- Yes.

2428
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,500
- I think he will text Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon?

2429
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,100
- She's his spokesperson.
- Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2430
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,900
If I'm the only one who gets this right,

2431
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,740
I'll win the prize alone.

2432
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,840
(Winning the accommodation voucher)

2433
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,240
That's crazy.

2434
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,880
I'll sleep in all of those rooms.

2435
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:30,980
That'll be amazing.

2436
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:32,050
You can do that with wine.

2437
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,710
Wait, his message won't play a role?

2438
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,680
(It's important to guess the pairings.)

2439
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,950
- The number of couples...
- I see.

2440
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:38,550
I was getting ahead of myself.

2441
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:39,690
Then...

2442
01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:42,320
- All of our guesses are the same.
- Yes.

2443
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,230
- I see. All right.
- Yes.

2444
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:46,430
Let's check the results now.

2445
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:49,200
We'll start with Chan Hyeong's decision.

2446
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:54,900
(Will he choose Ha Neul
just like he did on the first day?)

2447
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,310
(Who has he chosen?)

2448
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:59,940
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2449
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:03,380
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

2450
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:05,650
- It's Ha Neul. That's right.
- Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.

2451
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,710
That's how it should go.

2452
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,850
Let's check Ha Neul's decision next.

2453
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:10,920
- Please.
- Who did she pick?

2454
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,950
(Hoping)

2455
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:18,460
(It's Day 3 in Italy. Are Chan Hyeong
and Ha Neul already going steady?)

2456
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:23,600
(Ha Neul chose Chan Hyeong.)

2457
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:25,900
- All right. That's one.
- It was Chan Hyeong.

2458
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:27,840
Right.

2459
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,440
Who did Chang Hwan choose?

2460
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,970
(His date with Ji Won was like a scene
from his favorite movie.)

2461
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:37,650
(Did he meet someone kind today?)

2462
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,280
It has to be Ji Won.

2463
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,220
Wait. No way.

2464
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:45,450
(Chang Hwan chose Ji Won.)

2465
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,950
- There you go.
- That's it.

2466
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:47,990
(She was indeed kind.)

2467
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:49,190
- Great.
- Okay.

2468
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,060
- Okay. Let's check Ji Won's decision.
- Great.

2469
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,360
Who did Ji Won choose?

2470
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:58,330
(Was it Chang Hwan
whom she had a lot in common with?)

2471
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:00,400
- They can get married right now.
- Right.

2472
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,070
- They were so compatible.
- Exactly.

2473
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:03,770
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2474
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:07,070
(Ji Won chose Chang Hwan.)

2475
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:08,910
(Chang Hwan and Ji Won's first pairing)

2476
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:11,410
- Aren't they the most certain?
- Yes.

2477
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,780
- Ji Min's consistent.
- Who did Ji Min choose?

2478
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,780
(Who did the consistent Ji Min choose?)

2479
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:19,450
(Heart pounding)

2480
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:21,790
(He'd been waiting
for a 1-on-1 date with her.)

2481
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:23,790
(Did Ji Min obviously choose his date,
Je Yeon?)

2482
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:25,430
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2483
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,430
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2484
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:29,230
- Yes.
- I knew it.

2485
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:31,770
- Now, it's getting difficult. The last.
- Yes.

2486
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:33,930
- Please.
- Shall we check Woo Jae first?

2487
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,940
I was the only one with a different guess.

2488
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,340
Let's see who's right.
Who did Woo Jae choose?

2489
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,440
Oh, no.

2490
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,540
(Who did Woo Jae,
who did not ask anyone out, choose?)

2491
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,180
(Curious)

2492
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:46,550
(Between Ji Won whom he chose
for the first impression...)

2493
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,980
(and Je Yeon whom he went
on his first date with)

2494
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,150
- Did he really choose Je Yeon?
- Je Yeon.

2495
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:53,120
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2496
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,490
(Woo Jae chose Je Yeon.)

2497
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:57,930
(Only Jong Shin was wrong.)

2498
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:59,130
- I knew it.
- I was right.

2499
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:01,400
- He didn't want to lose her.
- I'm excited.

2500
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,060
That was unexpected.

2501
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,100
He's manly.

2502
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,370
If he was going to choose her,

2503
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:09,040
he should've asked her out on a date.

2504
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,240
Exactly.

2505
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,510
Now, it's the last person.

2506
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:12,710
I can't wait to check Je Yeon's choice.

2507
01:44:12,970 --> 01:44:15,040
- Please.
- Until yesterday,

2508
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,910
- Woo Jae.
- she liked Woo Jae.

2509
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:18,810
- Oh, my gosh.
- If it's wrong, we all fail.

2510
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:20,780
If it's right, we all pass.

2511
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,780
Lastly, who did Je Yeon choose?

2512
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,850
Please.

2513
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:28,320
(Ji Min whom she had a good time with
on a date?)

2514
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,590
(Woo Jae who expressed her heart
until yesterday?)

2515
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:33,290
I'm suddenly getting anxious.

2516
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:36,000
Still, be nice.

2517
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,870
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2518
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:42,040
(Je Yeon chose Ji Min.)

2519
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:43,700
(Everyone succeeded in guessing.)

2520
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,740
She changed her mind!

2521
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,440
I took your advice.

2522
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:50,340
I took your advice.

2523
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:53,210
We succeeded in guessing today.

2524
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:54,650
(Everyone passed.)

2525
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,780
I almost got Woo Jae wrong,

2526
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,290
but that wasn't in the rules.

2527
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:00,090
(The person of the Pairing House
becomes a mystery again.)

2528
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:04,260
(Chan Hyeong, Ha Neul)

2529
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:08,260
(Chang Hwan, Ji Won)

2530
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:12,270
(Ji Min, Je Yeon)

2531
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:15,800
(A date with the person they dreamed of)

2532
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:19,040
(What kind of change did it bring?)

2533
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,310
(A 1-on-1 conversation for the 1st time)

2534
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:25,280
I realized he was...

2535
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,480
more amazing than I expected.

2536
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:31,190
Am I the only one who knows
that you were home-schooled?

2537
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,620
- No one else knows.
- I just wanted her to know.

2538
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:38,060
It felt different.

2539
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:40,960
We now have a secret...

2540
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,700
that no one else knows.

2541
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,330
It felt special.

2542
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,930
(I was very happy to talk to you today.
Were you?)

2543
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:50,600
(I want to know more about you.
I had a good time today.)

2544
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,670
I tend to...

2545
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,010
get excited...

2546
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:57,980
when people compliment me.

2547
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,110
Everything we're having today tastes good.

2548
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,220
(Getting up)

2549
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,950
She makes enthusiastic reactions.

2550
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,620
She was like, "I love it."

2551
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:06,950
She was cute.

2552
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,830
(It was cold, but it wasn't cold.)

2553
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:13,330
That kind of amazed me.

2554
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,330
Chang Hwan...

2555
01:46:16,530 --> 01:46:20,000
exercised properly outside.

2556
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:25,210
I never expected someone
to exercise in Italy.

2557
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,610
When he talks,

2558
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:29,810
he smiles like a fool sometimes.

2559
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,180
He wasn't stubborn or strong...

2560
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,850
like I expected.

2561
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:36,850
(The man who made her laugh unexpectedly)

2562
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:40,920
It felt therapeutic.

2563
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,590
(I look forward to having a good time
in Italy.)

2564
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:53,530
Florence Republic Square I mentioned.

2565
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,640
(He wanted to share his memories
from 10 years ago with Je Yeon.)

2566
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:58,070
That also meant that
I wanted to go with Je Yeon.

2567
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,540
(Ji Min's wish...)

2568
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:00,840
(came true today.)

2569
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,010
It meant a lot.

2570
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,620
It was her first time traveling in Europe.

2571
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:09,250
It's beautiful.

2572
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:12,950
She enjoyed it...

2573
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,090
from the bottom of her heart.

2574
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,160
She reminded me of me ten years ago.

2575
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,530
She seems very pure.

2576
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,830
She looked beautiful.

2577
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,740
(Take a warm shower and rest
so you won't catch a cold.)

2578
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:39,310
He said he'd match my speed.

2579
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:42,180
I will try to adjust to your speed.

2580
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:44,690
What speed are you talking about?

2581
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:45,790
A turtle?

2582
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:48,490
Is he saying I'm that slow?

2583
01:47:48,490 --> 01:47:49,590
(He'd keep up with her slow speed.)

2584
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:53,230
- It seemed...
- Are you cold?

2585
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:55,300
his emotions or thoughts
would be his highest priority.

2586
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:59,270
He wasn't how he appeared to be.

2587
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:00,870
We can spend more time here.

2588
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:02,640
Until 5:30 p.m.?

2589
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,370
It must've been very cold,

2590
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:07,810
yet he waited for me
while I watched the night view.

2591
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,980
He cared a lot about me.

2592
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:14,850
He was being considerate.

2593
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,390
(Another person at the square)

2594
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:22,360
- I'll have coffee in the meantime.
- I felt bad about him.

2595
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:23,920
- See you later.
- See you later.

2596
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:28,000
(How did Woo Jae feel today?)

2597
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,230
The possibility...

2598
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:31,600
(Glancing)

2599
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,470
(I enjoyed visiting the square
and the night view.)

2600
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:34,640
(It was nice talking to you. Good night.)

2601
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:38,210
After I chose her,

2602
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,640
I kept thinking that maybe,
I shouldn't have done that.

2603
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,450
(Despite his regrets)

2604
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:46,980
It's not that I'm not at ease.

2605
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,780
That's just who I am.

2606
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:49,920
I choose Je Yeon.

2607
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:52,490
I thought about...

2608
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:54,390
having that time because...

2609
01:48:58,030 --> 01:49:00,160
it was nice to be alone
than with three people.

2610
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,660
Of course, it was a bummer.

2611
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:06,900
(On the previous date,)

2612
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:09,940
(they had to wait for the next chance.)

2613
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:12,640
"This is the last time I do this."

2614
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:16,080
It was a decision I could make
because it was my first time.

2615
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:23,650
(I hope you had a good day today.
Good night.)

2616
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:28,060
(How will this change
affect their hearts?)

2617
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:33,130
(The residents gathered
in a restaurant after the date.)

2618
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,900
We should get some wine.
Even just a small bottle.

2619
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:38,270
- We should.
- What?

2620
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,070
They're late.

2621
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:42,500
(Bugged)

2622
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,070
(And...)

2623
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:49,140
(a mysterious empty seat)

2624
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,180
We'll have to watch the look
on men's faces.

2625
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:52,250
Yes.

2626
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,490
Hello.

2627
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:05,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

2628
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:09,800
- What did you order? I don't know what...
- Excuse me.

2629
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:13,330
- Can you recommend her wine?
- Yes.

2630
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:16,340
- Do you see what's written on the top?
- Yes.

2631
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,370
Take your time.

2632
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:27,250
I was kind of nervous.

2633
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:30,350
This is our first and last time.

2634
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,820
I was excited to see who was coming.

2635
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,190
I wanted to meet you today.

2636
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:40,390
I'm curious about you the most.

2637
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,130
I want to hear your story.

2638
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:44,500
We'll know after a few more dates.

2639
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,940
Do you have any regrets?

2640
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,600
I have a lot on my mind.

2641
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,140
How you felt until now.

2642
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:55,180
Can I say it?

2643
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,240
