1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,340
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,640
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,340
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,810
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,810
Heart Pairing begins again today.

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,840
(Psychology expert, Park Ji Seon)

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,740
(Heart Pairing starts.)

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,580
The appearance of a catfish, Sang Yun,
attracted huge attention.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,920
In our studio,

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,480
a male catfish visited too.

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,920
- He's unbelievable.
- Our MC.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,350
A catfish panelist,

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,720
Paul Kim, is here. Welcome to the show.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,760
It's nice to meet you. I'm Paul Kim.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,990
I heard you love Heart Pairing so much.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,000
For me, being a panelist isn't important.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,970
The fact that I can watch this show
earlier matters more.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,040
Right.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
And at my home,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,540
another regular viewer of this show,
my wife, is waiting for a spoiler.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,670
- I see.
- Really?

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,340
I can't believe he's married.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,480
- I just found out, which surprised me.
- I'm married.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,380
(Congratulations.)

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,880
Which couple grabbed your attention?

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,650
My favorite couple...

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,120
is Ji Min and Je Yeon.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,760
Ji Min and Je Yeon.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,490
From the moment Ji Min asked Je Yeon,

30
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,790
"Am I included in those two?"
they were my favorite.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,100
- That impressed us a lot.
- Right.

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,170
Did you date like Ji Min?
What was your dating style?

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,170
Me? I guess I was better than him.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
Really?

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,940
After all,
he succeeded in getting married.

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,910
He's different.
A married man is different.

37
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,710
Although it's Paul Kim's first time
in the studio,

38
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,550
I felt that he's always been
with Heart Pairing.

39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,120
Because when this show ends,

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,260
we hear Paul Kim's voice. Am I right?

41
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,060
It's true.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,930
What kind of song is it?
Can you sing it for us here?

43
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,600
("Play the Next, Channel A"
by Paul Kim and GroovyRoom)

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,060
(The song entertains her ears.)

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,700
The song goes like this.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,970
(The theme song sounds sweet.)

47
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,270
He was my eardrum boyfriend.

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,670
Now, I can't call him
my boyfriend anymore.

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,410
(Laughing)

50
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,010
If Paul Kim is a catfish in the studio,

51
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,650
in Heart Paring, a true catfish, Sang Yun,

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,950
came and showed his competence.

53
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,190
For Je Yeon, he's the first man
who selected her Pairing Book.

54
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,490
- He chose her for what she is.
- Two of them...

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,020
have similar inclinations.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,860
- Their conversation flowed smoothly.
- Right.

57
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,930
Although it was their first date,
they talked about realistic subjects.

58
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,260
I feel that they had a deep conversation.

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,470
It's not easy for Je Yeon
to talk without reserve,

60
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,170
but she talked with Sang Yun so naturally.

61
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,310
She'd think, "Why am I talking so much?"

62
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,610
I guess she's realizing it herself.

63
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,210
That's dangerous for Type Is.

64
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,010
That's a dangerous signal for a Type I.

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,080
(It's a rather dangerous signal
for an introverted person.)

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,750
And we're not finished yet.

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,820
My favorite, Chan Hyeong.

68
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,650
(Laughing)

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,250
After he and Chae Eun had a date in Italy,

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,320
- they had it again.
- Right.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,830
Watching them,
I felt like I was watching a sitcom.

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,560
(The truth about the wrong delivery
of her text was revealed.)

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,800
(Chan Hyeong found out how Chae Eun felt.)

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,770
That would remain
as a strong memory for him.

75
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,300
- That's true.
- Right.

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,670
Two of them are most serious
about marriage.

77
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,040
- Right.
- They're ready for marriage.

78
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,340
Since such people met and had a date,

79
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,680
- I guess they could marry each other.
- Right.

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,510
They make me expect that.

81
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,750
It'll be great if that happens.

82
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,690
Paul, the second contract relationship
will start soon.

83
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,990
- Is there a couple you want paired?
- I'm curious.

84
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,220
- Which couple do you want to see?
- As for me,

85
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,730
I've been a supporter
of Ji Min and Je Yeon all along,

86
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,660
- Ji Min and Je Yeon.
- Now, the two of them...

87
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,030
cannot have a contract relationship.

88
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,230
- No.
- That can't happen.

89
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,700
You know, people's feelings
work in an amazing way.

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,370
When Sang Yun, the catfish,
and Je Yeon meet again,

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,740
Ji Min will go through confusion,
and I'd like to see how he looks.

92
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,250
- As a viewer.
- Right.

93
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,450
As the show progresses,

94
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,150
the level of dopamine it gives me
is increasing rapidly.

95
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,480
(He's funny.)

96
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,420
Now, let's see what's happening
in the Pairing House...

97
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,020
before the second
contract relationships begin.

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,390
I'm curious.

99
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,330
(Dating and Anxiety)

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,260
(It's two days before a contract
relationship with a new person.)

101
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,730
(Select two people you want to
get to know more by tomorrow.)

102
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,460
- It's the last time.
- A contract relationship.

103
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,730
The last? Is this the last one?

104
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,000
- The last one.
- Right.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,070
I felt that there was not much time left.

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,470
"Select a new person..."

107
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,180
"other than your partner
from the last contract relationship."

108
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,810
We need to select someone other than
the one in the last contract relationship.

109
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,380
I've been watching him all along.

110
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,120
I knew this would happen.

111
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,190
I expected it from the beginning,

112
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,860
but they found out later.

113
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,890
Chan Hyeong probably will have
dinner with Je Yeon.

114
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,000
I knew things would happen that way.

115
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,030
I told all of them to talk with her.
They should do that.

116
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,170
They surely have to do so.

117
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,540
And Je Yeon needs to
make a choice carefully.

118
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,840
Ms. Light Blue?

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,010
(That's what Ji Min had thought...)

120
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,340
(until Sang Yun came.)

121
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,640
I didn't want to think that way.

122
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,810
If Je Yeon...

123
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,420
and Sang Yun are paired...

124
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,820
I felt anxious and shaken.

125
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,120
I'd feel very worried.

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
Ji Min.

127
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,820
He's good-looking, quite competent,

128
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,160
and has a good personality.

129
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,360
I thought that would be
a bit tough for me.

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,100
I guess you feel sorry.

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,730
What should be my choice?

132
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,170
You must be feeling very disappointed.

133
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,440
Because it might be...

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,810
a chance to make people
feel differently about each other.

135
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,450
Right.

136
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,250
Three days can make a big difference.

137
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,120
To be honest, spending three days together
affects you a lot.

138
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,220
Just like how I...

139
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,460
felt huge emotions towards Ji Won,

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,990
that could happen to others.

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,260
Honestly, it made me feel nervous.

142
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,400
I decided...

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
(It might be the last chance
to have no regrets.)

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,070
to try more so that I won't regret.

145
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,340
If I remain like this,
I'll have a lot of regrets, I thought.

146
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,880
- Are you two going to have a talk?
- Yes.

147
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,980
- Really?
- Yes.

148
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,410
- I came for you too.
- What?

149
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,810
- Nothing. Go and talk.
- Okay.

150
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,620
- I'll be downstairs.
- Okay.

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,550
This is for you.

152
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,790
- What is it?
- You said you had a sore throat.

153
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,890
Really?

154
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,030
(Ji Min hasn't left the 2nd floor yet.)

155
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
I wanted to have a talk...

156
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,300
because I've seen you leaving
around late morning...

157
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,000
and thought
you were having a meal outside.

158
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,670
(Hesitating)

159
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,810
So I thought...

160
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,380
that we could have a meal together...

161
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,950
- here in the morning.
- In the morning?

162
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,250
I will cook for you.

163
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,750
You'll cook breakfast? Really?

164
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,820
- I'll go home, bring aged kimchi,
- Yes?

165
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,420
and cook kimchi stew.

166
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,460
Really?

167
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,530
So the two of you are having breakfast
together tomorrow?

168
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,160
- What is he going to cook?
- Kimchi stew.

169
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,100
- He's going to cook kimchi stew?
- Yes.

170
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,930
Maybe, I...

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,140
shouldn't have said this.

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,270
- To me?
- Yes.

173
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,110
- No, I like that.
- Do you?

174
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,280
I guess I bothered you
because I told you about this.

175
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,540
No, I appreciate it.

176
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,480
- I like it better this way.
- Do you?

177
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,820
All right.

178
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,150
I'll also tell you...

179
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,190
- everything...
- Okay.

180
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,820
that happens from now on.

181
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,860
That's what Ji Min is.

182
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,300
This is enough for me.

183
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,340
Okay. I'm glad.

184
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,570
You can go to sleep all right now, right?

185
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,570
How come I feel I'm younger than you?

186
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,080
Let's say you're younger than me.

187
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,610
- Call me, "Older sister."
- Older sister?

188
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,950
I feel that you're an older sister.

189
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,510
Call me that.

190
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,620
Go ahead. Call me "Sister Je Yeon."

191
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,390
"Call me, 'Older sister.'"

192
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
Oh, my.

193
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,830
(What will change from now on?)

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,900
(Next morning)

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
It's Sang Yun.

196
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,900
(Sang Yun starts his day with diligence.)

197
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,680
You're leaving soon, right?

198
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,710
I'm not leaving.

199
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,480
- I'm going to have breakfast here.
- I see.

200
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,580
Here?

201
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,950
- With whom?
- With Je Yeon.

202
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
What are you going to have?

203
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,930
I'll cook kimchi stew and a rolled omelet.

204
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,100
(Last night)

205
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,130
Hello.

206
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,930
You shopped for groceries.

207
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,670
Yes, I brought these to cook something.

208
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,140
(He brought ingredients from home
to have breakfast with Je Yeon.)

209
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,880
He looks like a guy who wouldn't pay
attention to something like that,

210
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,210
but he does, and that's his charm.

211
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,280
He has unexpected charms.

212
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,050
- I bought these.
- When?

213
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,880
Yesterday, after work.

214
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,790
Oh, my.
Cooking kimchi stew in the morning?

215
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,930
I'll cook dinner for you.

216
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,530
I purchased fresh pasta. I'll use that.

217
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,530
I love that.

218
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,730
Have breakfast and go to work.

219
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,700
I'll cook for you.

220
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
You'll cook breakfast?

221
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,810
I guess I often cook pasta at home.

222
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,680
I should have cooked it once in Italy.

223
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,750
I'll look forward to it.

224
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,880
A man who's a good cook
is very charming in the first place.

225
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,920
Of course.

226
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,790
(Cutting ingredients)

227
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,830
(Cooking Guys)

228
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,800
I didn't feel comfortable, to be honest.

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,630
Because it was the first time...

230
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,100
that someone cooked breakfast for me.

231
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,940
(She finds Sang Yun cooking.)

232
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,370
Why did you come down so early?

233
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,440
I just started cooking.

234
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,410
Do you want me to cook with you?

235
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,880
No, it's fine.

236
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,990
- You can have some coffee while waiting.
- What?

237
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,150
You can have some coffee while waiting.

238
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,430
Sang Yun pretends he's indifferent,

239
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,260
but what he says has an impact.

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,530
(Saying things frankly
while looking indifferent is his charm.)

241
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,740
(Glancing)

242
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,380
(Staring)

243
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,290
Why is she feeling hot?

244
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,730
(The kimchi looks delicious.)

245
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,640
How cute. Je Yeon looks so cute.

246
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,840
It looks so good.

247
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
It tastes very sour, though.

248
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,880
Did you say that your mother
made this kimchi?

249
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,250
Yes, it's made at home.

250
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,050
I guess she aged it for 2 to 3 years.

251
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,490
- Two to three years?
- Yes.

252
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,290
(Amazed)

253
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,120
She sends food to me often.

254
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,860
Your mindset
that you have to do something...

255
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,530
is something parents usually...

256
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,670
Are you asking if my parents taught me so?

257
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,570
Did they tell you, "You need to do this,"

258
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,100
or did you find what you want to do?

259
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,970
I think I found it myself.

260
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,010
- Did they tell you, "Do as you like?"
- Yes.

261
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,850
But when I asked them for advice,

262
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,620
they told me what to do.
That's how they raised me.

263
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,290
That's awesome.

264
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,420
That's how I grew up.

265
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,260
It was the same when I chose my major.

266
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,860
That's really awesome.

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,930
To be honest, I was raised
under very strict parents.

268
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,900
That strictness...

269
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,040
still remains as a boundary to me,
and I feel sorry for that.

270
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,750
Recently, they said
they wanted to visit me in Seoul.

271
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,480
So I invited them...

272
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,750
and brought them to my favorite wine bar.

273
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,390
I bought a nice drink for them...

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,760
and helped them with shopping.

275
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,790
I did that for them.

276
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,630
They loved it,

277
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,700
and they sent me a message
when they went back home,

278
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,070
which choked me up.

279
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,570
I don't usually choke up,

280
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,170
but it felt kind of...

281
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,680
It went, "Mom and Dad are not sure..."

282
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,950
"if we should feel this happy."

283
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,080
They sent me a message like that.

284
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,020
The more I watch Sang Yun,
the more I realize his charm.

285
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,760
- Do you like it cooked for a long time?
- Yes.

286
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,690
- It tastes better when cooked longer.
- Right.

287
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,530
(Boiling)

288
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,670
Do you want something to drink?

289
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,240
- Water is fine for me.
- Water?

290
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,340
Do you want cold water or lukewarm water?

291
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,970
- Cold water.
- Cold water.

292
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,610
Thank you.

293
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,740
The broth looks good.

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,350
It looks good.

295
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,250
Do you usually have breakfast?

296
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,750
I don't, usually.

297
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,020
- Me neither.
- I have lunch early.

298
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,020
Do you usually have breakfast?

299
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,460
I usually have it around 11 a.m.

300
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,090
I bring eggs and an apple on my way out.

301
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,800
I like eggs and apples.

302
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,930
Eggs and apples?

303
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,070
I'm cooking it slowly on purpose
because you usually don't have breakfast.

304
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,670
Thank you.

305
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,240
Sang Yun says things clearly.

306
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,440
Je Yeon will find
such a personality comfortable.

307
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
Is your throat better now?

308
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,450
Yes, I had what you gave me.

309
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,550
It totally cured me.

310
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,910
Really?

311
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,780
It tasted good too.

312
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,890
- It tasted like lemon candy.
- It's good, right? Like candy.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,550
Thank you.

314
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,660
I'll have it again
before I go to sleep tonight.

315
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,630
Don't forget to eat it.

316
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,070
I guess Sang Yun is a cool guy.

317
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,900
I feel that he's reliable.

318
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,610
This knife is so sharp.

319
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,440
(Moving aside)

320
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,480
Would this work as a lid?

321
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
- No, I don't think so.
- What?

322
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,090
- I need a lid.
- Where is it?

323
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,750
(The lid for the pot is missing.)

324
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,720
I see something down here.

325
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,830
Isn't that the lid?

326
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,590
I think I can use this as a lid.

327
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,970
- Would you like to taste the broth?
- Yes.

328
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm not sure what suits your taste.

329
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,110
It shouldn't taste good.

330
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,180
(Rooting for Ji Min and Je Yeon)

331
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,450
- It's good.
- Is it okay?

332
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,890
It has a very deep taste. It's good.

333
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
It's almost done.

334
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,470
He might look more amazing to Je Yeon...

335
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,440
because Je Yeon
isn't that good at cooking.

336
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,570
(Thinking)

337
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
I forgot this.

338
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,290
- What's that?
- I forgot adding this.

339
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
It's done.

340
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,160
(Adding a magical powder)

341
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,900
It's time for the rolled omelet.

342
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,230
I haven't cooked a rolled omelet, though.

343
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,670
The stew is enough.

344
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,270
- Are you going to try it?
- I can give it a try.

345
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,400
- Really?
- I will.

346
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,510
How many eggs do you need?

347
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,070
- About 6, I guess.
- About 6 eggs.

348
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,910
It's my first time doing this.

349
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,050
If I fail, I can make it
into scrambled eggs.

350
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,280
(Breaking)

351
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,750
What do you do this afternoon?

352
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,590
I'll go to a hair salon.

353
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,590
My hair tends to stick out,

354
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,520
so I need to get a down perm.

355
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
What kind of hairstyle do you like?

356
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,330
- What? Hairstyle?
- What hairstyle do you like?

357
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,900
I like...

358
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,670
covering the forehead a bit.

359
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,000
Covering the forehead?

360
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,370
There's a name for it.

361
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,380
Do you know what it is?
It's similar to the side part perm.

362
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,880
- Do you mean the adze perm?
- The adze perm.

363
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,480
- Sometimes, showing the forehead.
- I see.

364
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,790
It looks nice so far, doesn't it?

365
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,190
Totally.

366
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,990
I guess you totally are a good cook.

367
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,660
He looks at her in that manner.

368
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,730
He smiles indifferently like that.

369
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,900
- He smiles at her like that.
- Yes.

370
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,130
Ji Min and Sang Yun are totally different.

371
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,170
- Right.
- Right? They're so different.

372
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,930
But both of them are honest.

373
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

374
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,610
Sang Yun doesn't
initiate conversations a lot.

375
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,280
That's why she finds herself
observing him.

376
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
What is it?

377
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,180
I'm getting the feeling
that it might be doomed.

378
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,450
You think it's doomed?

379
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,390
(Rolling)

380
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
It's hot.

381
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Wait, I think it could work.

382
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Right.

383
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,600
Making rolled omelets is fun.

384
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,670
You're good at this.

385
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,670
- Is this really your first time?
- Yes, it really is.

386
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
It's ready.

387
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,740
(Plump)

388
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,170
- I did it.
- You did a really good job with it.

389
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,350
(He's wrapping up the kimchi stew too.)

390
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Chopsticks.

391
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,830
And...

392
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,740
So that's how you do it.

393
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,410
I'm just pretending to know
what I'm doing.

394
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
You are?

395
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,150
She's so cute.

396
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,680
Can I drizzle some ketchup on it?

397
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,260
(Squeezing)

398
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,430
It actually looks pretty good
now that it's plated.

399
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,860
You did such a good job with it.

400
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,270
I'm going to take a picture.

401
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I see.

402
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,670
(Feeling proud)

403
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,870
Gosh, you did an amazing job.

404
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,380
By the way...

405
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,940
(Clicking)

406
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,250
I think you have a knack for cooking.

407
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,350
(Tasting)

408
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,530
- It's delicious.
- Is it to your liking?

409
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,290
It's so good.

410
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,470
It tastes like a home-cooked meal.

411
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,470
- I think it came out well.
- You did a great job.

412
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,870
By the way, it's really good.

413
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,510
What a relief.

414
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
(She goes after the rolled omelet.)

415
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,850
- I'm quite impressed.
- I'm happy with it too.

416
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,920
Gosh, this is...

417
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,330
(Opening wide)

418
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,160
(Taking a bite)

419
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,700
(Taking another bite)

420
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,170
(She just can't stop eating.)

421
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,270
(Humming in approval)

422
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,610
No one has cooked breakfast
for me like this.

423
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,950
I'm touched.

424
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll cook for you again.

425
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,650
- What?
- It's making my heart flutter.

426
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,040
Je Yeon is more honest around him.

427
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,880
Je Yeon doesn't express
her feelings that often.

428
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
- But she said she was touched.
- Right.

429
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,880
Considering her personality, it's direct.

430
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,950
(It's a sign that
she's interested in him.)

431
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,450
Actually, he was the first person
to cook for me other than my parents.

432
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,620
Cooking for someone
requires a lot of care.

433
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,760
(She felt the warmth
of a home-cooked meal...)

434
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,060
(which she hadn't felt in a while.)

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,830
I was really touched.

436
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,510
(A dopamine rush)

437
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,740
You're rooting for Ji Min and Je Yeon.

438
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,310
But as soon as you got here
and watched them,

439
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,310
you had a change of heart.

440
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,650
- I bet he did.
- Oh, no.

441
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,890
Gosh, Sang Yun is good at cooking
and handsome.

442
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,620
He's the perfect guy to join the show
halfway through as a catfish.

443
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,460
He hooks you...

444
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,530
when you're least expecting him
to do something romantic.

445
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,060
Because of this show,

446
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,360
my values are changing every single week.

447
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,460
(What kind of value?)

448
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,830
Let me explain.

449
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,470
When they first met in Italy, Ji Min...

450
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,470
couldn't win over Je Yeon's heart.

451
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,740
Because it seemed that
he had won over her heart,

452
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,380
I thought everything was possible
as long as I made an effort...

453
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,580
- I see.
- and that there would always be chances.

454
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,710
- That's the lesson you learned.
- That's what I thought.

455
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,250
But now, I think you must be born into it.

456
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,580
But I still believe that
we can't be too sure what will happen.

457
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,160
Earlier, we saw that
Je Yeon seemed concerned about Ji Min.

458
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,060
I do agree that Sang Yun
is a very attractive guy.

459
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,660
But I think Ji Min still has a shot.

460
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,800
- He can still be hopeful? I see.
- He still has a good fighting chance.

461
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,400
If I were on Ji Min's side,
I would be nervous.

462
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,970
(I would be nervous.)

463
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,430
- You'd be very nervous.
- Right?

464
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,870
- Yes.
- I'm very nervous.

465
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,080
(Woo Jae is the first to return home
after shopping groceries.)

466
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,010
(He comes straight to the kitchen
and starts sorting them out for dinner.)

467
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,520
(Meanwhile, Ji Won also comes back home.)

468
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,120
- It's Ji Won.
- Ji Won came home right after Woo Jae.

469
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,160
- Woo Jae.
- Hey. Hi.

470
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,230
(Surprised)

471
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,630
- Let me go and take off my jacket.
- You're home. Okay.

472
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,660
Take your time.

473
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
- Is that fruit?
- Yes.

474
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,500
- Did you bring fruit?
- I brought grapes.

475
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Thank you.

476
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,240
- I bought this too.
- What's that?

477
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,480
- Gosh, that looks tasty.
- It's a potato salad.

478
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,050
Let's have this...

479
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,380
- with the pasta.
- That looks good.

480
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,420
- Right?
- Yes.

481
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,280
(Dumping)

482
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,990
- Is there anything I can do?
- Well,

483
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,060
I think I can handle it today.
I'll cook for you today.

484
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,760
I'll only be cooking spaghetti.

485
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,790
- Okay.
- So it won't take long.

486
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
To be honest, I think I eat...

487
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
more spaghetti than ramyeon at home.

488
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,230
He lived abroad for a long time.

489
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
- I'm more comfortable with that.
- I see.

490
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,670
I don't add a lot of ingredients, though.

491
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,640
There are times I only cook it
with just tomato sauce.

492
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,110
Sometimes, I only cook it with some oil
and chopped Cheongyang chili peppers.

493
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,210
But it's still tasty.

494
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,950
- It sounds tasty.
- It is.

495
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,690
(She'll get to taste the spaghetti
Woo Jae promised to cook for her.)

496
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,090
When I lived in Italy,
I'd go back to the dorm after my training.

497
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,760
The school had a culinary department.

498
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,530
So the kitchen was quite nice.

499
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,330
They told me I could use the ingredients.

500
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,270
So I learned how to cook
a simple spaghetti at school.

501
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,640
I used to cook by myself,
have the food, and go upstairs.

502
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,070
Woo Jae, you're good at cooking.

503
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,340
Me? I'm used to cutting ingredients...

504
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,740
because I cooked pasta a lot.

505
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,980
Amazing.

506
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,320
I did regret quitting soccer
from time to time.

507
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,690
Everything that followed afterward
came with great responsibility.

508
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,060
Despite that,
I clearly knew what I wanted to do.

509
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,960
I mostly thought that
I ought to do my best.

510
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,330
- Isn't it hot?
- No.

511
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,940
(Fascinated)

512
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,170
It's good.

513
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,310
This is a lot of food.

514
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,550
(Looking appetizing)

515
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,620
How much is it?

516
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,220
Twelve dollars?

517
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,220
That's expensive.

518
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,360
- That's not bad.
- It's 12 dollars.

519
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,430
Yes.

520
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,300
You can do a 12-month installment plan.

521
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,930
- I can do an installment plan?
- Yes.

522
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,770
You must give me a dollar every month.

523
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,670
- Okay.
- She'll have to see him for a year.

524
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,270
That's a cute way of saying that.

525
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
- Thank you for cooking.
- Let me just clean this up.

526
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't thank me.

527
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,210
Thank you for the food.

528
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,710
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

529
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,550
This looks so good.

530
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,450
(Taking a big bite)

531
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,460
This is so good.

532
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,490
- Really?
- Yes.

533
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,890
It tastes like a restaurant dish.

534
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,000
Was it 12 dollars?

535
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,930
- I like this restaurant.
- Thank you.

536
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,030
They are kind of similar.

537
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,170
I won't starve if I live with you.

538
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,170
You won't.

539
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,370
Of course not.

540
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,640
What did she say?

541
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,880
I'll go to Mount Nam and harvest plants.

542
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
(Bursting into laughter)

543
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,850
They make a nice couple too.

544
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,350
Well...

545
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,990
Don't let this upset your stomach.

546
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,790
(Flustered)

547
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,130
- Did you decide on the 2 guys?
- The 2 guys?

548
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,770
- Yes.
- You did?

549
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,870
- Yes.
- I see.

550
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,270
Is that so?

551
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,340
I did decide on two people as well.

552
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,520
- What's on your mind?
- What?

553
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,750
What's on your mind all of a sudden?

554
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,920
- What?
- You were thinking about something.

555
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,660
- You know...
- Yes?

556
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,120
- What were you thinking about?
- What?

557
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,500
Is it something personal?

558
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Yes.

559
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,470
(What was on Ji Won's mind?)

560
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,600
Go ahead.

561
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,340
(A cafe in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

562
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,850
I can't help...

563
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,320
but think about
the next contract relationship.

564
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,180
- Really?
- So...

565
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,960
we won't be matched again.

566
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,790
I think I'm going to be sad.

567
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,670
It would be really sad
if you hit it off with someone else.

568
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,870
But there's nothing I can do about it.

569
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,310
What about you? Have you...

570
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,170
given it some thought?

571
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,140
This is...

572
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,980
How should I put it?

573
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,880
"Am I being too hasty?"
That crossed my mind too.

574
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,320
- That's understandable.
- Right?

575
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,720
I thought,

576
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,860
"I should care most about how I feel."

577
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,600
- I see.
- That's what I decided to do.

578
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,260
So you made up your mind?

579
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,200
You already did?

580
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,230
- No, not like that.
- So...

581
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,900
- I just sorted out my thought.
- You sorted out your thought.

582
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
I didn't mean it like that either.

583
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,440
- You sorted out your thought. Right?
- Yes.

584
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,980
- While we stay in the house,
- Right.

585
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,580
- let's try to talk every now and then.
- Yes.

586
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,310
- I hope we can do that.
- Yes.

587
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,810
- Same here.
- Yes.

588
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,180
We can make time.

589
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,990
- Of course.
- That's right.

590
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,150
I'll make time.

591
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,190
That was cool just now.

592
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,690
Like the time
you linked your arm with mine,

593
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,130
you surprise me from time to time.

594
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,800
- I can be bold when I need to be.
- Yes.

595
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,230
You were pretty cool then.

596
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,900
I mean it.

597
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,140
- I guess you're excited.
- What?

598
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,340
- I guess you're excited.
- No.

599
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,910
(Dropping)

600
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,510
You're flustered.

601
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,750
- No.
- My gosh.

602
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,350
Woo Jae, what are you doing?

603
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,950
Something got on my clothes.

604
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,350
- Let me help you.
- Sure.

605
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,870
- It removes stains really well.
- Yes.

606
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,510
(Laundry is done.)

607
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,610
(The fragrance permeates the room.)

608
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,310
The scent is quite comforting.

609
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,180
Right?
This is great for drying clothes indoors.

610
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,480
(Looking soft and smooth)

611
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,450
Things are sailing smoothly with them.

612
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,180
(That's right.)

613
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:14,060
(Meanwhile, Ji Min comes back home.)

614
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,390
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

615
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,500
(And the two of them come back home
after having dinner.)

616
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
- Hi.
- Wait.

617
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,630
(The five residents are in the courtyard.)

618
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,170
- What? What is it?
- You suddenly made a serious face.

619
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,700
Right. She always makes that serious face
when she looks at me.

620
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,040
She's so funny.

621
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,040
(The Prescription of Their Own)

622
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,840
I can't believe her.

623
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,920
That hurts.

624
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,320
She's so funny.

625
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,990
What did you two make for dinner?

626
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,160
- Spaghetti.
- I see.

627
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,230
What about you?

628
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,260
Chapagetti.

629
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,100
- That sounds delicious.
- I also had noodles.

630
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,330
- They sound similar.
- The spaghetti...

631
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,000
Did you know the name, Chapagetti,
originated from spaghetti?

632
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,500
- What?
- That was too much information.

633
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,100
- Our dear pilot.
- He's cute.

634
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,110
- That's fascinating.
- I watch informative videos on YouTube.

635
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,410
Ji Min, are you tired?

636
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,880
- Why did you come home so early?
- You're tired today...

637
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,310
because you didn't get to see her.

638
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,080
No, I got off work at 7 p.m.

639
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,520
He was smiling from ear to ear yesterday.

640
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,120
- Right. You were smiling from ear to ear.
- No, I wasn't.

641
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,890
I had a lot of energy yesterday.

642
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,160
I got off work early yesterday.
But I got home at 8:30 p.m. today.

643
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,390
Can I pull it?

644
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,100
- You should tidy up the thread ends.
- It's asking me to pull it.

645
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,300
Really?

646
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,940
Can I bring a lighter and burn it?

647
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,240
Of course. You can do anything.

648
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,310
What if he doesn't have any clothes left?

649
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,070
Why do I want to tease him?

650
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,080
What's wrong with you?

651
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,450
"What's wrong with you?"

652
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,250
I guess teasing me is fun for everyone.

653
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,420
Teasing me must feel satisfying.

654
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,220
- It's our way of showing interest.
- Yes.

655
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,550
And you brought it upon yourself.

656
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,730
Should you be saying that now?

657
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,460
- It means I feel comfortable around you.
- Oh, no.

658
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,930
I was pretty good in Florence.

659
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,300
What?

660
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,930
What? What do you mean?

661
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,270
(Or not)

662
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,040
You were great in Florence.

663
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,310
In Florence.

664
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,880
Yes. That's right.

665
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,180
In Florence?

666
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,680
Fine.

667
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,310
But why not now?

668
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,620
Oh, no.

669
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,790
I feel comfortable around you now.

670
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,630
It is interesting how close we became
over a short period of time.

671
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,500
- We're living together.
- Right. This rarely happens.

672
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,000
- That's true.
- Yes.

673
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,110
When people live together,

674
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,080
they show every side of themselves,
even the raw ones.

675
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,010
You were charming in Florence.

676
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,080
Is that so?

677
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,150
I'm glad to hear that.

678
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,590
Oh, no.

679
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,720
I want to put the kettle right here
and pour it as I drink it.

680
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,930
- Don't we have a kettle for that?
- Yes, we do.

681
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,460
I'll prepare that.

682
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,360
That should be good.

683
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,000
Thanks.

684
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,000
- Will everyone drink it? Do you want tea?
- Yes.

685
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,170
No.

686
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,840
- Let me come with you.
- Yes.

687
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,140
I think we have to wash it
before using it.

688
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,340
- What did you say?
- Let me come too. You might get bored.

689
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
- Because we haven't used it yet?
- Yes.

690
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,780
Okay. Let's wash it.

691
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,250
How do you open this?

692
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,960
Ding.

693
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,720
Let's wash it.

694
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,160
You came home earlier than I expected.

695
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,630
You said you were going to stay late
in the office.

696
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
I was there for two more hours.

697
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,500
- You should try to come home early.
- My gosh.

698
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
- What?
- Try to come home early.

699
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,680
(An awkward silence)

700
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,650
We don't have to boil it here.

701
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,890
We can just bring it there, right?

702
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,130
- It's already hot enough.
- Right.

703
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,790
Give it to me. I'll do it.

704
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,510
Did you guys talk today?

705
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,840
- Did it go well?
- Today?

706
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,450
Well, Ha Neul seems cheerful
on the outside.

707
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,780
But it seemed to me...

708
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,790
she might keep struggling here.

709
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,660
- By the way, I did feel that too.
- Yes.

710
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,760
- Her energy level is different...
- When we were talking to her today...

711
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,690
- compared to when we first started.
- Right.

712
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,770
I asked her if she was having
a hard time with anything in particular.

713
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,640
- Yes.
- Right.

714
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,970
Were you that happy yesterday?

715
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,110
That's what everyone is talking about.

716
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,380
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

717
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,880
I guess I had more energy yesterday.

718
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,750
But I worked a lot today.

719
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,090
I heard that you guys talked about it.
When you were at the cafe.

720
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,350
About what?

721
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,520
That all of you can read how I feel
just by looking at my face.

722
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Right.

723
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,800
(Smirking)

724
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,630
Goodness.

725
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,070
Why would you talk about that
between you guys?

726
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,270
Because he's a good person.

727
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,710
- Who is?
- Me.

728
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,710
Right.

729
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
That answer makes me a bit awkward.

730
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,010
You're a good person
only when you're with just one person.

731
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,680
Only when you're with just one person.

732
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,020
Only when I'm with just one person?

733
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,250
- So not when I'm with everyone?
- No.

734
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,020
Right. I become a bit mischievous
when I'm with many people.

735
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,820
You're a bit cold.

736
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
To you?

737
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,360
I was never cold to you.

738
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,860
Why would I be cold to you?

739
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I treat everyone the same.

740
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,030
It feels like you're not interested in me.

741
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,740
(She tells him how she feels
as if it's a joke.)

742
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,040
Gosh. She's being honest.

743
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,410
- Should I stop?
- Do it some more.

744
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,010
Watch your hand.

745
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,720
It's coming out so slowly.

746
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,690
So today,

747
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,520
I think it'd be nice to hang out
before going to sleep.

748
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,550
(Staring)

749
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,390
- She's staring at him.
- I'm going out late tomorrow.

750
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,330
Your cardigan is pretty.

751
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,260
- My cardigan?
- Yes.

752
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,290
Just my cardigan?

753
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,800
She's so charming.

754
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,270
Again!

755
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
You're doing it again.

756
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,700
I'm just asking if it's just the cardigan.

757
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,470
Okay. Your cardigan looks pretty.

758
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,470
So, just my cardigan?

759
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,210
(Staring)

760
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,610
Don't swear with your eyes.

761
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Don't swear with your eyes.

762
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,590
Just my cardigan?

763
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,050
Gosh, Ji Min.

764
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,020
You shouldn't say it like that.

765
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,020
You have a model's face.

766
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,160
Gosh, you shouldn't say it like that.

767
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,190
How should I say it then?

768
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,760
Your tea is here.

769
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

770
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,030
- Watch your hand.
- Okay.

771
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,600
We just brought warm water.

772
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
We didn't boil it.

773
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,670
Ha Neul, I heard that...

774
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,710
- you had makgeolli today.
- Yes.

775
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,080
(Glancing)

776
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,150
I had cream makgeolli today.

777
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,850
- Hearing that...
- If you two have a drink,

778
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,320
you might have to carry Woo Jae
on your back to get home.

779
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,350
No, that won't happen.

780
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,520
- Like this.
- "Gosh, let's go home."

781
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,620
Don't you want to try it?

782
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,920
- I do.
- Right?

783
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,520
You want to drink it too, right?

784
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,690
(Nodding)

785
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,930
When are you going out tomorrow, Ha Neul?

786
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm going to have a talk
with Sang Yun tomorrow.

787
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,070
- You two are going to have a talk too?
- Yes.

788
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,140
Right. You two only worked together.
If you get to know him in person,

789
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,770
- you don't know what will happen.
- You could see each other...

790
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,810
- as a man and a woman.
- Right.

791
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,940
Right.

792
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,740
So I asked him,

793
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,980
"What are you doing tomorrow?"

794
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,050
He said,
"Tomorrow? I'm not meeting anyone."

795
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,550
So I told him,
"Go talk to Chae Eun right now."

796
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,120
He never talked to Chae Eun.

797
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,950
So you helped them today?

798
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,190
- Yes.
- You did?

799
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,060
It seemed that he didn't know,
so I told him about it.

800
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,260
"Since you came here late,
talk to many different people..."

801
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,600
- "when you have the chance."
- To Sang Yun,

802
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,930
you're such a great supporter.

803
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,400
He said I was reliable.

804
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,100
We should talk casually to Sang Yun
to become close.

805
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,470
We should do that after talking to him.

806
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,570
He's scary.

807
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,380
- Why?
- He's younger than me, but...

808
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,150
- he's scary.
- No. It seemed that Sang Yun...

809
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,180
wanted to talk comfortably too.

810
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,180
- Is that so?
- Yes.

811
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,320
Then, since I'm older...

812
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,820
"Sang Yun, my younger brother."

813
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
Why would you say that?

814
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,960
Is it an idiom?
"Sang Yun, my younger brother."

815
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,760
Sang Yun is enough.

816
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,330
"Sang Yun, my younger brother."

817
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,530
Did you all choose two people?

818
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,570
(They will have
their second contract relationship soon.)

819
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,040
- Isn't it today?
- It is.

820
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,010
I have one in mind,
but I don't know about the other one.

821
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,140
I have only one too.

822
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,890
(Where will the hearts
of the residents head to?)

823
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,820
(They hold their breath as well.)

824
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
- What will happen now?
- Goodness.

825
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
(Nervous)

826
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,730
(Finally, it's time that
everyone has been waiting for.)

827
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,000
Finally.

828
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
I got a text.

829
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,170
(Send two names of the people
who you want to get close to.)

830
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,200
(Male residents can choose
the new female resident.)

831
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,730
"The new female resident."

832
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,670
"The new female resident?"

833
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,710
- Seriously? Now?
- Goodness. Oh, no.

834
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,480
Shouldn't she be here by now then?

835
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,610
- I know.
- Right.

836
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,480
(Send two names of the people
who you want to get close to.)

837
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,450
(Male residents can choose
the new female resident.)

838
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,580
- My goodness.
- This is crazy.

839
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,260
- What?
- What is it?

840
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,360
"Male residents can choose
the new female resident."

841
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,030
(Closing his eyes)

842
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,100
So, we can write,

843
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,170
"The new resident" as our number two?

844
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,900
I think she's coming at a good time.

845
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,470
(They have a chance to...)

846
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,770
(have a contract relationship
with the new female resident.)

847
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,110
(What will the residents choose to do?)

848
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,950
- Gosh. This is going to shake things up.
- Right.

849
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,980
Things might happen.

850
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,850
So in a minute,
we will reveal the result...

851
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,350
of the matching
for the second contract relationship.

852
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,150
They're in trouble.
I'm sure that things will happen.

853
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,590
(Expectant)

854
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,890
(5 hours before
the 2nd contract relationship)

855
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,700
Where should I go for the date today?

856
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,630
You should make a safe choice.

857
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,730
Western food?

858
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,340
- Fusion Korean food?
- "Fusion Korean food?"

859
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,510
Gosh. Did you hear that?

860
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,680
My stomach was growling.
You didn't hear it?

861
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,650
(Nodding)

862
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,650
I'm leaving. Have a good date.

863
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,680
You have a good date too.

864
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,750
You're leaving already?

865
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,990
- Why are you going out alone?
- I need to buy something.

866
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,420
(Ji Min leaves early in the morning.)

867
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,730
(Smiling Practice)

868
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,030
Once in the Sunset Room,

869
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,030
we talked about our ideal types.

870
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,300
Je Yeon said that she liked men
with a pretty smile.

871
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,670
So the next morning,

872
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,340
I practiced smiling on my bed.

873
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,320
To smile,
you need to use the muscles here.

874
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,320
Like this.

875
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:16,990
I was lying down doing this.

876
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,320
(Practicing to smile prettily)

877
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,390
Gosh, he's charming.

878
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,570
(Ji Min fell on his head
while practicing smiling.)

879
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,740
(Nothing is easy.)

880
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,850
He's cute.

881
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,590
(Smiling)

882
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,960
- She's pretty.
- Hi.

883
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,360
Sorry I couldn't pick you up.

884
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,630
- What? It's okay.
- I had something to do.

885
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,830
- You had something to do?
- Yes.

886
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,730
I'm hungry.

887
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,570
- You had nothing, right?
- Right.

888
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,600
- I had a yogurt.
- A yogurt?

889
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,840
This place is a brunch cafe.

890
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,940
I think this is too much.

891
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,150
I think this dish with guacamole...

892
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,450
- Okay.
- would be good.

893
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,750
Okay.

894
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,350
This, and...

895
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,790
- I want to have eggs.
- Okay.

896
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,950
Do you want anything else?

897
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,260
Let's choose this. I like it.

898
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,360
- You're good with this one?
- Yes.

899
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,030
How are you feeling today?
You look pretty in that dress.

900
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,870
I think you've seen this before.

901
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,070
Yes. I think I did.

902
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,170
But I was wearing a coat at that time.

903
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,570
I guess you really like dresses.

904
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,840
Dresses? Well, it's comfortable, so...

905
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,380
But you look good in pants too.

906
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,080
- Is that so?
- When we were at home,

907
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,350
you were wearing black pants.

908
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,520
I was surprised
because you looked so pretty.

909
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,850
- I did?
- When you gave me the shampoo.

910
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
Je Yeon.

911
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,260
Are you sleeping?

912
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,790
I remember getting surprised back then.

913
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,060
I see.

914
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,300
- What did you do in the morning?
- Me? Today?

915
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,870
I had to visit somewhere.
It was a personal thing.

916
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,410
It was nothing.

917
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,780
- I'll take you there.
- Okay.

918
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,710
I'll take you there.

919
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,420
When did you come home yesterday?

920
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,190
About 8:30 p.m.?

921
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,690
I came home around that time.

922
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,360
Ji Won and Woo Jae were home too.

923
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,260
With that couple...

924
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,260
Wherever I go,
when I see them being all lovey-dovey,

925
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,800
it makes me uncomfortable.

926
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,930
Does it?

927
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,800
It's a little embarrassing.

928
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,240
They said they cooked spaghetti,

929
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,140
so I just cooked Chapagetti
and ate it with kimchi.

930
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,270
- Chapagetti?
- Yes.

931
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,680
That sounds delicious.

932
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,480
- I make a good Chapagetti.
- Do you?

933
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,850
Next time, you can judge it yourself.

934
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,280
- I'd like that.
- I'm serious.

935
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,620
I've always been good
at making Chapagetti.

936
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Really?

937
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,820
My secret is using
the right amount of water...

938
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,560
so that I don't have to throw out any.

939
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,330
I'll cook one for you next time.

940
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,460
I may not be a good cook,
but I can cook ramyeon well.

941
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yes.

942
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,230
Thank you. Will you put it at the center?

943
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,370
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

944
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,110
I heard my stomach grumbling earlier.

945
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,140
Okay.

946
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,110
Did you hear that?

947
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,980
It grumbled.

948
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,380
And it reminded me of you.

949
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,820
(He remembered the incident.)

950
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
That's so cute.

951
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,490
We promised not to talk about that.

952
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,890
- Right.
- Why do you keep bringing it up?

953
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,420
But it was so cute.

954
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,160
What's so cute about it?

955
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,060
It is cute.

956
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,670
I can't lie.

957
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I'll give you some.

958
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,070
Thanks.

959
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,970
A big piece with eggs on top.

960
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,140
- Didn't you have anything to eat?
- Not yet.

961
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Really?

962
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,450
I was so startled
when I saw you in the kitchen.

963
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,720
You were so cute.

964
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,250
I went out to drink water,

965
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,720
thinking I wouldn't run into anyone.

966
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,390
But I ran into so many people.

967
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,890
There were more other than me?

968
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,860
(Je Yeon came out of her room
when she wasn't fully ready.)

969
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,430
I should go and tell her.

970
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,030
I'll also tell her I'm ready.

971
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,480
- Je Yeon.
- Wait!

972
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,580
Why did you come so soon?

973
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,780
- It's 12:30 p.m.
- What?

974
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,890
- Is it?
- Yes, 12:30 p.m.

975
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:46,690
How lovely.

976
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,020
(Je Yeon was flustered
by the sudden encounter.)

977
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,160
The doors are closed.

978
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,090
Hi.

979
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,430
Why did everyone get ready so early?

980
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,700
- I also ran into Ha Neul.
- Well, Ha Neul is...

981
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,500
And Sang Yun.

982
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,970
That must have been awkward.

983
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,510
(Embarrassed)

984
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,380
- Do you like guacamole?
- Yes.

985
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,150
You only ate the guacamole.

986
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,850
Have another one.

987
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Thanks.

988
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,090
And shrimp.

989
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,860
Thanks.

990
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,900
Oh, my.

991
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,200
I'm so glad you're not busy today.

992
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,470
- If you had to go to work,
- Yes?

993
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,110
we wouldn't have been able...

994
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,780
to see each other
when we were transitioning.

995
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,250
That's why I took a day off today.

996
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,890
I'll read the book again,
so stay by my side.

997
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Okay.

998
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,800
The book was an excuse.

999
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,370
- It was?
- I can't talk to you...

1000
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,400
with everyone around.

1001
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:08,870
I see.

1002
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,250
We won't be able to spend time
by ourselves together soon.

1003
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,250
How do you feel?

1004
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,650
Starting tomorrow,

1005
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,420
we'll get back to our lives.

1006
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,450
And I believe
new things will happen as well.

1007
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,620
Are you worried or anything?

1008
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,360
Worried?

1009
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
(Laughing)

1010
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,130
It's so funny...

1011
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,370
that you think really hard
whenever I ask you something.

1012
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,270
- Do I?
- That's so funny.

1013
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,810
(Deliberating)

1014
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,580
- You ponder.
- Right.

1015
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,980
It's funny.

1016
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,720
We're starting
a new contract relationship...

1017
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,590
- next Friday.
- Yes.

1018
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,850
- Is that what you mean?
- How do you think you'll feel...

1019
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,950
when I start dating someone else?

1020
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,690
- When you date someone else?
- Yes.

1021
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
That would be a bit...

1022
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,490
What?

1023
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,530
(Smiling)

1024
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,130
- What?
- What?

1025
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,500
A bit what?

1026
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,900
It would be a bit...

1027
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,310
Still, it's good to take some time
to get to know other people.

1028
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,810
I don't think I know the others...

1029
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,180
- that well.
- Right.

1030
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,450
- Right?
- Yes.

1031
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,280
- If I make a decision...
- After talking to everyone?

1032
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,950
without knowing them in depth,

1033
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,420
I'll regret it a bit.

1034
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,260
Regret not making the best decision.

1035
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,990
Yes. You have a point.

1036
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,300
Right? So...

1037
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,470
You seem relaxed.

1038
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,540
- Not exactly.
- Okay.

1039
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,340
But it's true.

1040
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,810
(Staring)

1041
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,810
You're strong on the inside.

1042
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,760
I'm just happy about this short meet-up,

1043
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,320
so I'll take you home right after this.

1044
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,230
So that we won't have to rush it.

1045
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,400
- Are you wearing Gabrielle again?
- What?

1046
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
- Are you wearing Gabrielle again?
- Yes. Can you smell it?

1047
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,610
I'm starting to get used to it.

1048
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,410
I like it.

1049
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,650
Don't wear perfume tomorrow.

1050
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,820
Or wear men's perfume.
Do you want to wear mine?

1051
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,550
I mean...

1052
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,160
He's so different.

1053
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,490
(Grinning)

1054
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,730
- I wanted to thank you for yesterday.
- Yes.

1055
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,860
- What?
- I'm glad you came by last night.

1056
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,500
Knock, knock.

1057
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,070
- Ji Min.
- Yes?

1058
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,140
When are we leaving tomorrow?

1059
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,640
What time are we having lunch?

1060
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,250
- At 12 p.m.
- At 12 p.m.?

1061
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,450
So, we meet on the 1st floor at 12 p.m.?

1062
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,420
I'll come to pick you up.

1063
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,160
Good night.

1064
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,030
You were looking at me.

1065
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,430
You couldn't see me at first, right?

1066
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,800
You were standing there like this.

1067
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,970
I saw you, and...

1068
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,280
So, I liked the ending.

1069
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,050
- He's honest.
- Yes.

1070
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,380
And...

1071
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,950
- you'll spend three more days, right?
- Yes.

1072
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,450
You know,

1073
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,220
we can't exactly...

1074
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,590
label our relationship at the moment,
but...

1075
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,730
I hope you enjoy it...

1076
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,400
and have fun.

1077
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,800
The other guy will prepare a lot of stuff.

1078
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,540
So, have fun.

1079
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,340
I'll also have fun.

1080
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,180
I'm not saying this
because I want to have fun.

1081
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,850
I just hope you'll have fun.

1082
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,290
I think it'll be Sang Yun.

1083
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,430
- What?
- I think it'll be Sang Yun.

1084
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,700
- For me?
- Yes, I have a feeling.

1085
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,970
- You have a feeling?
- Yes.

1086
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,400
You can't help but care
when you're that into someone.

1087
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,770
(Thinking)

1088
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,740
Don't be too attracted to his looks.

1089
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,380
Don't.

1090
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,850
Let's play your song.

1091
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,220
My song?

1092
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,920
I listened to your entire playlist...

1093
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,430
as soon as I woke up this morning.

1094
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,900
- Really?
- You're a bright girl.

1095
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,170
Were all the songs cheerful?

1096
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,370
Yes, they were calm, yet cheerful.

1097
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,000
Including "I stan U."

1098
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,700
Isn't that song great?

1099
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,770
Yes, it was my first time listening to it.

1100
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,940
- It's so good, right?
- Yes.

1101
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,510
Yes, it's a great song.

1102
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,710
We would have had more time
if we had met at 12 p.m.

1103
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,450
- I know, right?
- It was too short.

1104
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,280
Hold on.

1105
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,350
Je Yeon, take these.

1106
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,050
- What are these?
- Eat them there.

1107
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,620
- Oh, goodness.
- It's a gift!

1108
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,720
Macarons.

1109
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,990
- You can have them.
- Seriously?

1110
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,190
When did you get them?

1111
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,260
- I bought them before our date.
- Really?

1112
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,400
He made a promise
to buy her something delicious.

1113
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,170
- Thank you. Really?
- That's why I was late.

1114
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,870
- I wanted to spend more time with you.
- They're gorgeous.

1115
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,170
Thank you so much.

1116
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,240
- I'll leave some for you.
- I got all the flavors...

1117
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,540
- because I didn't know what you'd like.
- Really?

1118
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,880
- I don't think I can eat them.
- Why not?

1119
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,020
They're too pretty.

1120
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,720
- Take a photo and eat them all.
- It's Christmas-themed.

1121
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,420
Ji Min can be very considerate.

1122
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,220
I'm glad it wasn't too cold
during our date.

1123
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,620
Right.

1124
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,990
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes.

1125
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,700
I took one before bed last night,
but not today.

1126
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,130
Because I want to drink with you tonight.

1127
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,030
What?

1128
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,080
Je Yeon looks good with him
when she's with him.

1129
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,750
She makes a cute couple with everyone.

1130
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,720
I'm sure the viewers
also have different opinions.

1131
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,050
Those who like Ji Min
and those who like Sang Yun.

1132
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,650
I wonder who Je Yeon will pick.

1133
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,750
Right?

1134
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,830
(The busy day ends.)

1135
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,660
(Chae Eun waits
for her second contract relationship.)

1136
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,870
Chae Eun?

1137
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,640
(Who does Chae Eun hope it is?)

1138
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,940
- Yes!
- Yes!

1139
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,610
That's what I'm talking about!

1140
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,040
(Smiling brightly)

1141
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Hi.

1142
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,750
Hi.

1143
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,620
- They look like a married couple!
- How come they're so intimate?

1144
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,990
What a surprise. They look so intimate.

1145
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,430
Hi, it's nice to see you.

1146
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,660
It reminds me of that time...

1147
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,870
- in Italy.
- Right.

1148
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,000
I was looking at you from afar.

1149
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,400
(Chae Eun has always been
waiting for him.)

1150
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,770
- Yes, they look so cute together.
- Right.

1151
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:28,040
I'm always waiting for you.

1152
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:33,420
I thought, "Is Chan Hyeong's book yellow?"

1153
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,150
(And all those nights she texted him)

1154
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,090
I texted you.

1155
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,890
It's a sitcom.

1156
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,260
(And it finally got through to him.)

1157
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,890
I sent it to you.

1158
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,200
I even sent the photo I took with you.

1159
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,330
- Right. They talked about that.
- Yes.

1160
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,400
It was almost like a love confession
from Chae Eun's end.

1161
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,940
It's so cold out.

1162
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,140
(It's too cold to wait.)

1163
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,010
Did you...

1164
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,480
know I was coming?

1165
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,640
- Me?
- Yes.

1166
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,110
No, I wasn't so sure.

1167
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,580
What about you?

1168
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,650
I was...

1169
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,250
(After their last date)

1170
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,090
But no one knows who I'm choosing.

1171
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,590
No.

1172
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,960
- I bet no one knows.
- Right.

1173
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,660
That's why.

1174
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,500
(He's been wanting to approach her.)

1175
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,430
I was hoping it would be you.

1176
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,780
These two seem very likely
to be matched now.

1177
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,410
Aren't you hungry?

1178
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,550
A little.

1179
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,380
- Should we go and eat?
- Sure.

1180
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,420
Sure.

1181
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,920
Let's go.

1182
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,820
(A Japanese restaurant in Mapo-gu, Seoul)

1183
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,090
You must be starving.

1184
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,330
They have a separate yellowtail dish?

1185
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,560
I haven't had proper yellowtail
this winter.

1186
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,030
We should get one with yellowtail, then.

1187
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,230
She loves food.

1188
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,930
- You can choose the rest.
- Do you like fish cakes?

1189
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,770
I like them all.

1190
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:03,710
Yellowtail and fish cakes.
And two servings of sukiyaki.

1191
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,310
They seem genuinely excited.

1192
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,180
That's incredible.

1193
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,140
It was cold out,

1194
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,480
so I wanted to eat something warm.

1195
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,550
- I like that.
- So...

1196
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,250
That's cute.

1197
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,290
(Taking a bite)

1198
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,950
(Hot soup warms their bodies.)

1199
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,220
It's delicious.

1200
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,790
It's so good.

1201
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,490
Try the yellowtail.

1202
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,290
I'll put it here

1203
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,300
Thanks.

1204
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,770
I'll top it with the fish.

1205
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,940
Oh, right.

1206
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,080
One of the things I wanted to do
with you was...

1207
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,020
- Well, I'm not sure if you'll like it.
- Okay.

1208
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,450
It's going to a Korean sauna.

1209
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,190
- Really?
- Yes.

1210
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,690
We can bake sweet potatoes...

1211
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,520
in front of a charcoal fire.

1212
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,430
- That sounds fun.
- Bake bar rice cakes...

1213
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,430
- and eggs.
- Really? That sounds great.

1214
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,000
Are you sure it's a sauna?

1215
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,630
- Yes.
- That sounds unusual.

1216
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,130
It's like a charcoal kiln sauna.

1217
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,600
Are there...

1218
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,700
- board games too?
- Board games?

1219
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,440
I don't think they have board games.

1220
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,510
But I love board games.

1221
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,410
- So do I.
- Seriously?

1222
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,410
I have so many board games at home.

1223
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,250
- So do I.
- What do you have?

1224
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,820
There's a ton.

1225
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,750
- Really?
- And, you know,

1226
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,220
- those that take 3 to 4 hours.
- Yes, that's my favorite!

1227
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,560
- Is it?
- Yes.

1228
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,890
We regularly gather...

1229
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,890
- at my house and play.
- Really?

1230
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,130
- My older sister...
- I have a few members who play.

1231
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,260
- Really?
- Board game members.

1232
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,660
Please invite me next time.

1233
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,730
- It's unbelievable.
- I mean it.

1234
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,270
- Do you really want to come?
- Yes, invite me.

1235
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,300
Really?

1236
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,670
I'll carry you.

1237
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,810
Chae Eun has a different look
on her face...

1238
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,010
when she's with Chan Hyeong.

1239
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,980
- I feel like these two will get married.
- Yes.

1240
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,040
It would be nice.

1241
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,580
They've looked good together
since the beginning.

1242
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,350
And they continuously find common ground.

1243
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,450
No woman has ever come to our meetings,
though.

1244
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,920
- Really?
- Yes.

1245
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,360
- But I love board games.
- They'll welcome you with open arms.

1246
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,990
These two are so compatible.

1247
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:05,490
I've always loved playing with Lego,
puzzles, and board games.

1248
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,360
I became a homebody because of that.

1249
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,900
I used to play with Lego all day.

1250
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,570
I also like Lego more.

1251
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,000
I'll give you an example.

1252
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,070
When I was a little kid,

1253
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,470
I told my parents,

1254
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,080
"I'm going to play with these with
my son later, so don't throw them out."

1255
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,410
- Really?
- I used to tell my parents that.

1256
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,880
- Seriously?
- So, when they gave away...

1257
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
all the other toys,

1258
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,390
they always kept my Lego.

1259
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
- They click so well.
- They do.

1260
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,460
That's also one of my dreams.

1261
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,020
Playing with Lego with my son.

1262
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,890
- Me too.
- Really?

1263
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,390
Yes. That's my dream.

1264
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,630
Because I want to play with it.

1265
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,460
- Yes, it's the same reason for me.
- It's so that I can play with it.

1266
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,100
- They can play together.
- Even if I take the kids to buy Lego,

1267
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,600
- I'll buy what I want.
- Exactly.

1268
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
I'd buy what I want too.

1269
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,410
Like,
"Why don't we try one piece at a time?"

1270
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,040
I'd love to see you play with Lego.

1271
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,010
I've never seen a girl
who genuinely loved Lego.

1272
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,180
- Really?
- Yes.

1273
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,150
Really.

1274
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,230
I think it's nice to share a hobby.

1275
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,530
I never knew
you were into that type of stuff.

1276
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,460
Let's see if there's a place
where we can play with it.

1277
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,970
Should we go there...

1278
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,000
on Sunday?

1279
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,210
I have to be at the hospital
tomorrow morning.

1280
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,310
When are you coming back tomorrow?

1281
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,410
I'll leave work at 12:30 p.m.,
so I'll be back by 1 p.m.

1282
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,310
- At 1 p.m.?
- Yes.

1283
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,920
- That's the most important part.
- Then, we should come up with a plan...

1284
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,550
- about what to do from 1 p.m.
- Yes.

1285
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,290
Still, if we manage our time well...

1286
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,120
- We have so much time.
- Right?

1287
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,960
(Smiling)

1288
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:48,700
No need to rush home.

1289
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,970
Chan Hyeong is so cute!

1290
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,070
He seemed a bit sorry...

1291
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,770
- about his busy schedule.
- Yes.

1292
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,070
But that could never upset Chae Eun.

1293
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,070
Exactly.

1294
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,910
As long as he buys Chae Eun
what she wants to eat that day.

1295
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,580
- Right.
- Problem solved, right?

1296
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,610
- He wouldn't even need to do that.
- Right.

1297
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,050
Then,

1298
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,180
what's your dream after marriage?

1299
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,550
Is there something you want to do
with your future spouse?

1300
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,260
Have you read my book?

1301
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,790
- Of course, I did.
- No, not that time.

1302
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,060
Not in Italy. In Korea.

1303
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,130
The book...

1304
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,130
- It disappeared?
- Yes.

1305
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,400
That can't be right.

1306
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,170
Yes, it did.

1307
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,240
No.

1308
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,240
You just left it there.

1309
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,840
- You...
- We're supposed to bring it with us?

1310
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,910
Yes!

1311
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,350
You left it there, didn't you?

1312
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,180
Oh, the tables have turned.

1313
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,550
So, you won't even remember.

1314
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,750
But...

1315
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,420
Don't be so cold-hearted about it.

1316
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,390
I thought that after reading them,

1317
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,020
we had to leave them behind.

1318
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,260
From Italy...

1319
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,560
So you didn't bring
my Pairing Book with you?

1320
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,100
You're making me look terrible.

1321
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,170
You left it in your room in Italy?

1322
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,430
(Chan Hyeong read the book in detail.)

1323
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,670
Chae Eun is so cute.

1324
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,970
She wrote in detail.

1325
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,740
(After finishing the book,
he tossed it indifferently.)

1326
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,980
(He left it in Italy.)

1327
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,250
I wasn't aware that
we had to bring them with us.

1328
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,580
Seriously.

1329
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,250
No way.

1330
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,650
Chan Hwan brought them with him.

1331
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,690
(Glaring)

1332
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,860
- How could you do that?
- Why...

1333
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,100
To make it worse,
no one chose my Pairing Book.

1334
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,330
You're making me sorrier
than I already am.

1335
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,900
You know what?

1336
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,470
- I'll give you mine tomorrow.
- I should read it again.

1337
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,270
This is what I wrote in the book.

1338
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,280
(Chae Eun's dream is a peaceful,
everyday life with her spouse.)

1339
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,480
That's my dream after marriage.

1340
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,250
Cooking together?

1341
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,790
Yes.

1342
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,620
I like to grill a whole chicken...

1343
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,120
in the oven at home.

1344
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,390
While lying in bed with a movie on,

1345
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,060
I like to eat and drink beer
with my sister.

1346
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,260
That's how I'd like to live
when I get married.

1347
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,230
It's wonderful...

1348
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,140
to enjoy your free time
as much as possible.

1349
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,910
It's what busy people need.

1350
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:12,910
I agree.

1351
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,650
If they agreed,
they could definitely get married fast.

1352
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,880
Both of them already have a clear idea...

1353
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,920
about their future.

1354
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,050
So they're looking for a partner
who corresponds to that.

1355
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,890
I keep thinking that
they're perfect for each other.

1356
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,290
I have a question for you.

1357
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,860
Why did you go...

1358
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,130
to medical school at such a young age?

1359
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,870
In the beginning,
I wasn't thinking about going...

1360
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,040
to med school so early.

1361
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,510
I wasn't homeschooled...

1362
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,780
to get an early education.

1363
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,650
When I was in elementary school,

1364
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,120
my parents didn't make me study
outside of school.

1365
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,380
- Really?
- Yes.

1366
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,020
- You didn't get early education at all?
- Not at all.

1367
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,420
I did the opposite.

1368
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,630
To avoid giving me early education
as much as possible,

1369
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,460
my family moved out of Seoul.

1370
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,560
Right before my brother and I entered
elementary school,

1371
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,670
we moved to Taebaek, Gangwon Province.

1372
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,300
- On the contrary.
- Really?

1373
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,300
That's where I started elementary school.

1374
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,070
There were 12 students
in the entire school.

1375
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,240
There was only one other student
who was my age.

1376
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
That must have been fun.

1377
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,120
I had a good time.

1378
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,450
We were free to play in nature.

1379
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,550
After that,

1380
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,890
we moved to Gyeonggi Province
because of my parents' job.

1381
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,290
My school in Gyeonggi Province
was also a school in the countryside.

1382
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:40,530
Your mother had her own view on education.

1383
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,700
My father did too.

1384
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,970
They wanted us to experience everything...

1385
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,640
that was necessary for growth.

1386
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,140
With freedom, I tried various things...

1387
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,670
for a year.

1388
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,780
As they never made us study,

1389
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,750
we became vigilant ourselves.

1390
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,920
We thought,
"At this rate, we won't ever study."

1391
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,390
- They wanted you to do it on your own.
- Yes.

1392
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,360
My brother and I said,

1393
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,160
"We'd like to study
and go to medical school."

1394
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,690
That's what we told...

1395
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,830
- You took the initiative? Really?
- our parents.

1396
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,430
Why did you want to become a doctor?

1397
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,170
Throughout my childhood,
my dream was to become a doctor.

1398
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,440
When I was really little,

1399
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,270
when I found out what occupations were,
I wanted to become a firefighter.

1400
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,710
All of that relates to...

1401
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,550
helping other people.

1402
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,880
I learned early in my life that
helping people made me happy.

1403
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,120
He's a healthy man.

1404
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,390
Everyone gets sick
at some point in their life.

1405
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,160
No one can avoid it.

1406
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,330
Being able to help someone in need...

1407
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,760
during the most difficult time seemed...

1408
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,530
very rewarding.

1409
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,340
Both your mother and her sons
are very impressive.

1410
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,940
I also think that education is crucial.

1411
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,570
With my brother,

1412
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,840
I discuss a lot...

1413
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,340
about how to educate our children...

1414
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,480
who don't exist yet.

1415
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,380
Really? Same here.

1416
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,780
My sister and I also talk about that.

1417
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,290
To be honest,

1418
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,520
starting a family...

1419
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,660
and having children aren't my priority.

1420
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,260
After giving birth to my child,

1421
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,100
how will I raise them,

1422
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,330
- and what kind of world will I show them?
- Right.

1423
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,030
That's the first thing to think about.

1424
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,940
Fostering a good environment
is the parent's role.

1425
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,840
Exactly. It's very important for me.

1426
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,510
I agree.

1427
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,280
I don't think I should have a child...

1428
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,680
just because I want to start a family.

1429
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,750
It's a conversation between adults.

1430
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:44,120
Was there a field
that you were particularly interested in?

1431
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,450
At that time?

1432
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,260
When I was in high school,

1433
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,690
I liked volunteering.

1434
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,190
At school,
we were graded for volunteering.

1435
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,600
You know what I mean?

1436
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,260
We were required to volunteer
for a certain number of hours.

1437
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,870
- Really?
- While volunteering,

1438
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:00,300
I started to enjoy it.

1439
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,570
- It was really fun.
- Where did you volunteer?

1440
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:05,410
I volunteered at a Korean pharmacy.

1441
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,080
The requirement was only 40 hours,

1442
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,780
but I worked there for over 100 hours.

1443
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,250
Later on,

1444
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,380
the director at the pharmacy
thought that I was great.

1445
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,050
I had memorized all types of drugs.

1446
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,060
I could translate everything into Korean.

1447
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,960
You know, the original texts.

1448
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,960
He told me to study them...

1449
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,760
and encouraged me
to go to pharmacy school.

1450
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,560
He told me that he'd hire me
in the future.

1451
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,100
- He ended up needing me.
- It was the big picture.

1452
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,440
She must know about medicine.

1453
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,370
- Chan Hyeong would like that.
- Yes.

1454
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,370
- She has everything.
- She has everything he's looking for.

1455
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:43,180
That's why you look so kind and innocuous.

1456
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,180
- That's true.
- I feel like the guys are teasing me.

1457
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,080
They said that I'm like Mother Theresa.

1458
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,450
Isn't that a good thing?

1459
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,150
I see that as a big compliment.

1460
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,360
That's what I want to pursue.

1461
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,160
- That's how I want to be.
- They're so compatible.

1462
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,160
They have very similar values.

1463
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,900
I feel like I'm more energetic
when I'm with you.

1464
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:05,500
That's good.

1465
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,840
It's because we're compatible.
We both play with Lego.

1466
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,000
What we talk about is exciting.

1467
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,810
That's true.

1468
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,180
(Beaming)

1469
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,740
What is it?

1470
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,610
We're in a contract relationship now.

1471
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,580
You're my girlfriend
for the next three days.

1472
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,860
The spark in Chae Eun's eyes
from time to time said,

1473
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,290
"Is he the one?"

1474
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,160
"He could be the one."

1475
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,030
I noticed glimpses
of 50-percent certainty...

1476
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,030
in her eyes.

1477
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,030
I think Chan Hyeong was the one
for Chae Eun from the start.

1478
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,100
I agree.

1479
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,300
Throughout their conversation,

1480
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,910
they kept saying, "If you get married..."

1481
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,910
- Right.
- They are...

1482
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,610
- "When I get married."
- very future-oriented.

1483
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,580
In some ways,
their conversation is very practical.

1484
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,580
They're an appropriate couple
for Heart Pairing.

1485
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,620
- Exactly.
- Right.

1486
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,580
Whenever one of them brings up something,
such as board games,

1487
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,420
the other says, "I love that too."

1488
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,560
When Chae Eun says that
she likes something,

1489
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,760
she's not trying to please him.
She's being honest.

1490
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,730
It's obvious
when Chae Eun isn't interested.

1491
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,030
- She only talks about food.
- We said it earlier.

1492
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,660
- Right.
- "Is it a man..."

1493
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,570
- "who makes her look away from food?"
- Right.

1494
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,000
- That's right.
- Did you see that?

1495
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,370
Chae Eun stopped eating.

1496
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,500
- She kept...
- Right.

1497
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,940
- looking at Chan Hyeong.
- Exactly.

1498
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,640
- That's really major.
- It is.

1499
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,840
- It's like holding her breath.
- It's going against her instinct.

1500
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,340
Here's what I'd like to know.

1501
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,610
Would Chae Eun know how well we know her?

1502
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,710
Of course not.

1503
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,750
I don't think she'd be interested in us.

1504
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,420
It'd be so funny to meet her in person.

1505
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,720
(Please look at us too.)

1506
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,660
(A snowy night in winter)

1507
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,490
By the third week
after entering the Pairing House,

1508
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:43,160
I was exhausted emotionally.

1509
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,430
I didn't know what to do.

1510
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,200
(The day when Ji Won and Woo Jae
came back from their date)

1511
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,840
Hello. Did you have fun?

1512
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,870
Hello, Chang Hwan.

1513
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,380
Ji Min, you're wearing a cap.

1514
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,880
- What's the dog's name?
- Ji Two.

1515
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,850
(The two became very close.)

1516
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:05,650
(And Chang Hwan found out.)

1517
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,220
(Hesitant)

1518
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,660
(Fidgeting with
the innocent vacuum cleaner)

1519
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,500
(With his wavering heart)

1520
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,560
Chang Hwan looks better than before.

1521
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,700
(He is waiting for his partner tonight.)

1522
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,270
(At that time)

1523
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,310
Doesn't she look like Ji Won?

1524
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:34,320
(She is walking toward Chang Hwan.)

1525
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
- It's Ji Won.
- It must be Ji Won.

1526
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,690
It's Ji Won.

1527
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,220
(She's approaching him step by step.)

1528
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:42,990
(She's getting closer to him.)

1529
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,020
It's not her.

1530
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,160
(She's getting closer to him.)

1531
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,570
- It's not Ji Won.
- It's not.

1532
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,040
(Surprised)

1533
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

1534
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,040
She's someone new.

1535
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

1536
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,810
(She has fresh charms.)

1537
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,450
She looks very charming.

1538
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,780
- She has a different vibe.
- Right.

1539
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:08,780
(Fascinated)

1540
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,020
Hello.

1541
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,350
(Clasping his hands tightly)

1542
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,050
(Chuckling)

1543
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,090
She looks very pure.

1544
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,460
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1545
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,560
My name is Kim Soo Ah.

1546
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,830
My name is...

1547
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,530
My name is...

1548
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,370
Park Chang Hwan.

1549
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,640
Nice to meet you.

1550
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
(Staring)

1551
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,670
- She looks very confident.
- Right.

1552
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,410
She's staring at him.

1553
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,850
You're so beautiful.

1554
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,080
(Bewildered)

1555
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,250
He doesn't know what to do.

1556
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,820
Currently, there are nine of us.

1557
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,450
- Nine?
- Both men and women.

1558
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,960
(He's talking without thinking
out of nervousness.)

1559
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,230
I'm the first one who got to meet you.

1560
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,890
Are there ten including me?

1561
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,300
- There are many.
- It's out first time meeting.

1562
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,930
She never takes her eyes off him.

1563
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:57,930
Right.

1564
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,670
Isn't it snowing so heavily?

1565
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,830
Oh, no.

1566
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,100
- It's okay.
- If you shake it off...

1567
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,170
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1568
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,780
- You have to eat dinner, right?
- Yes.

1569
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,810
We should.

1570
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,280
Since it's cold...

1571
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,080
The snow is beautiful, but...

1572
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,280
Since it's cold, shall we go down...

1573
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,680
and continue our conversation
while eating?

1574
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:16,950
Shall we go down?

1575
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,420
(Exclaiming)

1576
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,550
I was so startled.

1577
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,320
I should've brought some hand warmers.

1578
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,260
It's not freezing.

1579
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,560
It's not extremely cold today, is it?

1580
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,560
- No.
- Just a little cold.

1581
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:29,560
She's a beauty.

1582
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,170
She looks similar to Kim Sa Rang.

1583
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,170
There is an Asian beauty about her.

1584
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,140
She's elegant and confident.

1585
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,340
(Asian beauty, elegant, confident)

1586
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,710
(Bistro in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

1587
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,000
(Looking around awkwardly)

1588
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,700
She looks very sweet.

1589
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:11,040
I'll ask for some napkin and water.

1590
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:14,410
(The man with manners sets out.)

1591
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,050
Thank you.

1592
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,080
(He returns with some water.)

1593
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,290
(Fidgeting)

1594
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:35,930
(Rummaging)

1595
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:36,960
In case...

1596
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,870
I can't talk out of nervousness,

1597
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,740
I made a list.

1598
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,870
He took notes?

1599
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,310
A list of questions.

1600
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,070
You made a list of questions?

1601
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,440
Just a few questions.

1602
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:49,980
I usually don't do this.

1603
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,310
I was so surprised to see you.

1604
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,520
I wasn't expecting it.

1605
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,120
- Meeting me for the first time?
- Yes.

1606
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,790
Me neither.

1607
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,490
Is there any food you can't eat?

1608
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,960
- Not at all.
- Not at all?

1609
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,400
That's good.

1610
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:13,930
What type of food do you like?

1611
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,400
- My favorite food is sashimi.
- Sashimi?

1612
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,470
It's the same as mine.

1613
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,640
Do you like sashimi?

1614
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,970
I'd choose sashimi over meat.

1615
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,010
Sashimi? Me too.

1616
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,880
These days, yellowtail sashimi...

1617
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,880
- I eat it almost every day.
- Really?

1618
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,250
So you like yellowtail sashimi.

1619
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,450
She's not reserved.

1620
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,290
So...

1621
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:39,330
I said that
I'd like to meet the new person.

1622
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,430
How did you choose me?

1623
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,700
I read...

1624
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,170
the books.

1625
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,200
- The books?
- I chose the yellow book.

1626
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,270
(He can't hide his smile.)

1627
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,310
He's happy.

1628
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,940
I picked these two.

1629
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,680
(She chose Chan Hyeong's blue book
and Chang Hwan's yellow book.)

1630
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,480
These are my favorite colors.

1631
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,520
The book's color had an influence
on my choice.

1632
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,650
For me,
these two seemed simple, intuitive,

1633
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,190
and honest.

1634
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:11,090
The one who wrote this yellow book has...

1635
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,560
a childhood memory
of playing baseball in the park...

1636
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,930
with his father every weekend.

1637
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,830
It's not anything big,

1638
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,930
but things like this are important to me.

1639
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:21,240
He seems childlike.

1640
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,270
When I see him smile,

1641
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,570
I might be able to understand him.

1642
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,270
Among the five...

1643
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,340
- Among the five books.
- books?

1644
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,810
That makes me feel quite good.

1645
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,290
(Beaming)

1646
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,720
You wrote about playing baseball
with your father.

1647
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,460
I read that for a long time.

1648
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,230
It's nothing major,

1649
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:50,230
but I have so many good memories
of trivial things.

1650
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,670
It sounds very important for Soo Ah.

1651
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,670
Gosh.

1652
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,300
So I wanted to get to know you.

1653
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,510
Look at him.

1654
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,650
- Oh, no.
- He looks pleased.

1655
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:09,780
Thank you.

1656
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,320
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1657
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,660
Thank you. It looks so delicious.

1658
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,460
Here is your favorite sashimi.

1659
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:22,060
I'll put it closer to you.

1660
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,100
Thank you.

1661
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,830
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1662
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,940
It looks like an avocado, doesn't it?

1663
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,170
Yes.

1664
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,240
I'll try it.

1665
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,740
It tastes like Mexican food.

1666
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,150
Do you also like Mexican food?

1667
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,950
I love it.

1668
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,290
It tastes similar to Mexican food.

1669
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,420
I like cilantro.

1670
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:48,960
Do you eat cilantro?

1671
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,590
- I love it.
- Really?

1672
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,560
Yes.

1673
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,730
Can I cut with this knife?

1674
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,300
- It's been used.
- Of course.

1675
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:59,470
(Cutting without hesitation)

1676
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,440
She expresses herself clearly.

1677
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,470
- She does.
- She doesn't hesitate.

1678
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,910
Her expressions are strong.

1679
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,310
"Extremely. Very."

1680
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,410
(In total agreement)

1681
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,280
I can't cut it into pretty pieces.

1682
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,260
- She looks cute like a chipmunk.
- She's adorable.

1683
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,660
(He keeps drinking water only.)

1684
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:29,330
(Fidgeting)

1685
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,500
Do you feel nervous?

1686
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,770
- Goodness.
- I don't feel normal right now.

1687
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,070
- Oh, my.
- He doesn't feel normal.

1688
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,070
(Everyone in crisis?)

1689
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,910
A woman who stupefies me.

1690
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
That's right.

1691
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,980
I'm here enjoying the food.
What does that make me?

1692
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,410
I'm eating too.

1693
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,020
Is our conversation going well?

1694
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,020
I feel overwhelmed.

1695
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:58,060
You probably go on blind dates.

1696
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,630
If you get nervous every time,

1697
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,560
how do you eat?

1698
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,030
It's a good kind of nervousness.

1699
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,940
(Fidgeting)

1700
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,840
I should hold my hands still.

1701
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,840
You keep moving your hands.

1702
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,650
My hands won't stay still. I'll bind them.

1703
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,250
It's out of nervousness.

1704
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,890
- She finds him adorable.
- She does.

1705
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:29,690
What happened to your list of questions?

1706
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,330
- She's leading the conversation.
- I'm trying...

1707
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,030
to come up with questions.

1708
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:36,160
- I have one. I remember.
- Do you remember now?

1709
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,700
They're making my heart flutter.

1710
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,170
- He seems to like her.
- Yes.

1711
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,270
First of all,

1712
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,870
- we don't know each other's occupations.
- Right.

1713
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,380
- Why don't we try to guess?
- Sure. Let's do that.

1714
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,380
That's the spirit. This is so much fun.

1715
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:54,880
I don't know why,

1716
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,650
- but you look like a nurse.
- A nurse?

1717
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:58,750
That's what I thought.

1718
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,520
- Am I wrong?
- I'm afraid so.

1719
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,160
- Was I way off?
- Yes.

1720
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,330
I'm...

1721
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,890
in HR.

1722
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,160
- Really?
- Really?

1723
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,930
- I oversee general affairs in HR.
- I see.

1724
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,200
- In a fashion company.
- A fashion company?

1725
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,010
I work in HR
for a foreign fashion company.

1726
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,170
I'm Kim Soo Ha, and I was born in 1993.

1727
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,280
I recruit new talent and manage personnel.

1728
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:31,520
(So the company can achieve its vision)

1729
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,820
Finding the right talent
at the right moment...

1730
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,390
and acting as a bridge
is what I find most fulfilling.

1731
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,130
(Even fluent in English)

1732
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,000
(A global talent, Kim Soo Ah)

1733
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,540
My father was given the opportunity
to be an exchange professor.

1734
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,570
The whole family moved with him
and lived in the US.

1735
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,980
(The family followed the dad
to live in the US.)

1736
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,080
We lived in Long Island, New York.

1737
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,180
- Long Island?
- Long Island?

1738
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:02,220
I attended a local school
for about five years.

1739
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,480
Goodness.

1740
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:07,850
After moving back to Korea, I got
into a university of foreign studies.

1741
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,220
(Her experience abroad led to her
studying foreign languages.)

1742
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,890
Since I love interacting with people,

1743
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:18,400
I explored careers that merge
language skills and service.

1744
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,770
I started my career,
working for a foreign airline.

1745
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,170
- A foreign airline?
- That was my first job.

1746
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,810
- A flight attendant?
- No way.

1747
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,370
- They're meant to be.
- Tell me about it.

1748
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,910
After leaving the company,

1749
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:33,510
I worked for about 2.5 to 3 years
as an English teacher.

1750
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,820
That's why she speaks so well.

1751
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,680
(I even taught English to children.)

1752
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,850
Over time, I developed an interest
in beauty and fashion,

1753
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:45,390
so I got my master's degree in that field.

1754
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:49,660
After graduating, I started working
at a foreign fashion company.

1755
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,800
While working during the day,
I've been studying for my PhD.

1756
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,600
- How impressive.
- That's amazing.

1757
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,000
(A passionate individual with many goals)

1758
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,710
Can I try to guess your job?

1759
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,810
Sure.

1760
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,310
Do you work in IT?

1761
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,920
Many assume that about me.

1762
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,790
- Which means I'm wrong.
- That's right.

1763
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,220
It's a tough one.

1764
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,260
I'm clueless.

1765
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,830
I like planes.

1766
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,000
Did you say you like honey traps?

1767
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,500
Honey traps!

1768
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,530
(A communication error)

1769
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:26,230
Someone who likes honey traps?

1770
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,440
(That's hilarious!)

1771
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,740
Did you say you like honey traps?

1772
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,940
- No, planes.
- Planes?

1773
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,270
It'd be wrong to like honey traps.

1774
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,180
- Planes!
- I like planes, so...

1775
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,610
- Are you a pilot?
- Yes.

1776
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,780
- So you're a pilot.
- I work hard...

1777
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,490
transporting passengers and cargo.

1778
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,120
A pilot. That's so cool.

1779
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,360
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

1780
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,360
How was Italy?

1781
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,730
I joined the group on the second day...

1782
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,540
and found myself...

1783
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,040
as the cook.

1784
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,210
Are you a good cook?

1785
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,540
I can't say I'm good, but I like to cook.

1786
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,080
There's nothing proper about it
since I haven't taken any classes.

1787
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,910
Who's to draw the line like that
about any dish?

1788
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,820
That's so sweet of her.

1789
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,280
I follow the recipes I come across.

1790
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,250
I'm impressed by people who can cook.

1791
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,950
Do you cook?

1792
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:21,990
No.

1793
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,160
- You don't?
- No.

1794
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,660
- I...
- I...

1795
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:25,890
I'm good at washing dishes.

1796
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,430
I'm terrible at washing dishes.

1797
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,930
- Really?
- I'll stick to the cooking, while...

1798
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,330
(A man who can cook)

1799
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,670
(A woman who prefers to wash dishes)

1800
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:35,300
- She's charming.
- I know.

1801
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,700
Anyway, we have...

1802
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,640
to spend...

1803
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,470
- the weekend together.
- Right.

1804
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,410
Is there anything you'd like to do
or anywhere you'd like to go?

1805
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,210
(Curious)

1806
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Well...

1807
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,480
Gwangjang Market in Jongno.

1808
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,150
Cheonggyecheon Stream.

1809
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:59,260
Also, there's a part of Seongbuk-dong
with many cafes.

1810
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,360
Really?

1811
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,630
I'd like to go there.

1812
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,230
Then...

1813
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,970
I'm worried about the weather going down
to minus 7°C this weekend.

1814
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,070
I'm okay with that.

1815
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,840
Hand warmers will keep us warm.

1816
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:13,210
I've stocked up on adhesive body warmers,
so if you need any...

1817
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,410
Actually, I...

1818
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,840
Do you know the foot warmers...

1819
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,110
that you place in your shoes?

1820
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,650
I've heard of them,
but I've never used them.

1821
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,680
- They're...
- Are they the best?

1822
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,090
They're the best.

1823
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,820
It's a hot item.

1824
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,060
I see.

1825
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,760
She's not like the other residents.

1826
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,260
- She's different.
- Right?

1827
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,300
No one at the house is like her.

1828
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,330
(Mesmerized by her freshness)

1829
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,670
You know,

1830
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,840
I noticed you weren't making eye contact
with me today,

1831
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:49,810
so I wondered
if something was bothering you...

1832
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,980
or if the situation felt uncomfortable.

1833
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,450
- I was nervous.
- I see.

1834
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,050
Also, I'm terrible at making eye contact.

1835
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,490
Really? I kept trying to meet your eyes,

1836
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,420
but you wouldn't look into my eyes.

1837
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,260
You have such big and beautiful eyes...

1838
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,590
that I found myself looking away.

1839
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,130
That's right.

1840
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,260
- I'll look into your eyes more.
- I love Chang Hwan's honesty.

1841
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,870
I'm suddenly relieved.

1842
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:13,900
(Relieved)

1843
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,440
I think we can marry him off.

1844
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,600
How can the two colors
go so well together?

1845
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,370
Yellow and red. They are a perfect match.

1846
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:21,470
Chang Hwan...

1847
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,440
wasn't expecting anything, but suddenly,

1848
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,110
he met Soo Ah.

1849
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,780
Someone he fell for at first sight.

1850
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,420
It did seem that way.

1851
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,520
It's rare for people to find someone...

1852
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,450
- they're immediately enamored with.
- Exactly.

1853
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,390
It's enough to have him overcome...

1854
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:38,160
- any hardship that follows.
- Absolutely.

1855
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,290
This is a very powerful emotion.

1856
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:43,030
He hasn't been able
to pair up with anyone,

1857
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,100
and it felt like he's being left out.

1858
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,700
Yes, it felt that way.

1859
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,730
But...

1860
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,640
- Although he's extremely charming.
- Extremely.

1861
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,370
If Chang Hwan shows her who he is,

1862
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:53,310
Soo Ah might fall for him too.

1863
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,410
- Of course.
- Of course.

1864
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:04,380
(Je Yeon is waiting
for her next contract boyfriend.)

1865
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,450
When he walked in,
I thought he was an idol.

1866
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:11,490
He had defining facial features.

1867
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:14,290
His job was foreign to me,

1868
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:20,730
so I thought he could be living
in a world different from mine.

1869
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,300
But then we started talking,

1870
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:29,080
and I felt like we shared
a lot of the same values.

1871
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:31,210
- That's huge.
- It's important.

1872
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,120
(It begins to snow.)

1873
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:46,430
(At the end of a winter night,)

1874
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:53,900
(who will find her like the snow?)

1875
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,240
(Striding)

1876
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,710
(A man walks through the snow.)

1877
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,550
I'm nervous for some reason.

1878
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,920
My heart's skipping a beat.

1879
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:18,530
(Is it the partner Je Yeon wants?)

1880
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,180
(He sees her.)

1881
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,650
I'm feeling giddy.

1882
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,150
Je Yeon.

1883
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,250
(Appearing in front of Je Yeon...)

1884
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,960
(is Sang Yun.)

1885
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,560
Hi.

1886
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,630
- She's delighted.
- Hi.

1887
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:54,930
It's snowing.

1888
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,860
I know. It's snowing quite a bit.

1889
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,100
It's pretty, though.
It wasn't snowing like this a moment ago.

1890
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,070
I know. It's beautiful.

1891
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,470
You must be cold.

1892
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,070
- Thank you.
- I have another one.

1893
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,540
Thanks.

1894
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:10,110
- I can see the N Tower in the distance.
- Sorry?

1895
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,280
The N Tower.

1896
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,250
She's shy.

1897
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,780
- This is our first snowfall together.
- I know.

1898
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:21,650
(Another 3 days have been given.)

1899
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,030
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun,
The 2nd contract relationship begins.)

1900
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,740
- It's all in your hair.
- Right?

1901
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,810
Is there a lot?

1902
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,310
Did you know I'd show up?

1903
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,380
A little.

1904
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,620
Who do you think was my second choice?

1905
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,620
Your second choice?

1906
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,960
The new girl.

1907
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,530
- Really?
- How did you know?

1908
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,030
I guessed.

1909
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,160
Why did you choose the new girl?

1910
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,160
Out of curiosity?

1911
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,700
No.

1912
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,300
She seemed like the only choice.

1913
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,870
- He delivers punches.
- My heart is tingling.

1914
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,110
(Wiggling)

1915
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,280
My heart was pounding
as I walked up the steps.

1916
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,390
I was worried it might not be you.

1917
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1918
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:29,620
I tried hard not to let it show.

1919
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:35,030
(He couldn't hide his dimples.)

1920
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,330
In what way? Like you didn't care?

1921
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,330
Like I knew it'd be you.

1922
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,340
- What did you do today?
- Today?

1923
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:49,040
I had lunch with Ji Min.

1924
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,080
I see.

1925
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,680
What about you?

1926
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:54,610
(What did she call me?)

1927
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,480
- What was that?
- Wait, you're not older than me.

1928
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,390
(They clap at her adorable mistake.)

1929
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,190
- Anyone good-looking is considered older.
- Oh, no!

1930
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,720
- That's right.
- If you're good-looking, you're older.

1931
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,430
I'm not older than you.

1932
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,760
Sorry.

1933
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,500
- What about you?
- Me?

1934
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,000
I had lunch with Ha Neul.

1935
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,870
Did you have a good time at lunch?

1936
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,170
- At lunch?
- Yes.

1937
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,240
It was quite short.

1938
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:24,180
Only about an hour, I think.

1939
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,410
She didn't answer his question.

1940
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,180
- She didn't give him a direct answer.
- She said something else.

1941
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,590
- I asked if it was fun.
- Was it fun? It was.

1942
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,990
(Clearing her throat)

1943
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,430
It's snowing beautifully today.

1944
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,130
Tell me about it. It's so pretty.

1945
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,400
It's really pretty.

1946
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,470
The snow is gently falling down.

1947
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,840
Now,

1948
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,180
I'll get to see your cute emojis.

1949
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,510
I know.

1950
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,190
I bet you're cold.

1951
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:09,790
I am, but the day's warmer
than the other days we've had.

1952
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,160
- It's usually warmer on snowy days.
- Exactly.

1953
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,500
(A Market in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

1954
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:19,330
- Isn't this place great?
- It's pretty.

1955
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,040
I love it here.

1956
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,110
(A fusion Korean restaurant
in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

1957
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,680
- Head inside.
- Is this the place?

1958
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,750
Here.

1959
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:43,860
(He sits next to her.)

1960
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,260
You're sitting next to me.

1961
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:48,830
We're a couple, aren't we?

1962
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,430
(Switching to couple mode)

1963
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:52,770
- We're a couple on a date.
- We are.

1964
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,870
- This place is pretty.
- I know.

1965
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,110
It's cozy.

1966
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:05,450
(Reading the menu)

1967
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,850
Shrimp stuffed shiitake mushrooms
sound delicious.

1968
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:10,920
Let's have this, then.

1969
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,150
- Doesn't it sound good?
- It does.

1970
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:13,820
I'd like that too.

1971
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,360
Don't you want any side dishes?

1972
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,690
- What?
- Side dishes.

1973
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,130
- No way.
- They look like an actual couple.

1974
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,330
Look how close they are.

1975
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,630
Will that be enough?

1976
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,270
I'm hungry.
Which of the two will be better?

1977
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:27,970
- Spring rolls.
- Should we order that?

1978
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:29,900
Yes, spring rolls sound good.

1979
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,440
(They quickly decide on the menu.)

1980
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:33,810
I'll hang your coat for you.

1981
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:37,640
Thanks.

1982
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,250
(Sang Yun hangs Je Yeon's coat for her.)

1983
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,520
What's this? It's cute.

1984
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:50,260
It's very Christmassy.

1985
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,320
I know.

1986
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,260
I can't believe you're sitting next to me.

1987
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,360
She can't stop smiling.

1988
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,400
Sitting next to you, I feel warm.

1989
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,570
My gosh.

1990
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,500
(Together, they sip their water.)

1991
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,740
They must both be nervous.

1992
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,010
(Turning)

1993
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,040
(Turning)

1994
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,420
(Sliding)

1995
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,480
I slid my hand here,
but the cup wasn't there.

1996
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:20,320
- Sang Yun is also...
- He's nervous too.

1997
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,390
Thank you.

1998
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,460
(Clinking)

1999
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,730
It's nice.

2000
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,870
- It'll pair well with the food.
- I know.

2001
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:35,100
Thanks.

2002
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,900
They look like an actual couple.

2003
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,170
He just happens to be left-handed.

2004
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,240
How is it?

2005
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,510
It's good.

2006
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:46,110
I asked in a way
that forced you to say it was good.

2007
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:48,480
Isn't it good?

2008
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,180
I love these.

2009
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,720
- Shiitake mushrooms?
- Yes.

2010
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:56,690
It's hot.

2011
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,500
Why am I smiling at this scene?

2012
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,160
- I know.
- My heart's tingling like never before.

2013
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,300
I know.

2014
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:07,470
- But...
- Yes?

2015
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,370
Ha Neul told me...

2016
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:11,670
that you're a chatterbox.

2017
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,880
Did she say I'm a chatterbox?

2018
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,310
You have no idea.

2019
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,980
- Is that so?
- Absolutely.

2020
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,080
When will you show me this side of yours?

2021
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:25,380
When we get a bit closer.

2022
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:28,650
You're speaking to me
much more comfortably now.

2023
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,590
- I know. We were able...
- Right?

2024
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,090
to speak more casually and naturally.

2025
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,130
But it hasn't been that long.

2026
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,700
Didn't we agree
to speak casually yesterday?

2027
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,760
- Right? Yesterday.
- Yes, yesterday.

2028
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,970
I agree that you have a superpower.

2029
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,000
You easily adjusted to the dynamic.

2030
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:44,970
You know,

2031
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,510
I thought you were
going to text me yesterday.

2032
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,940
As a reply to your text?

2033
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,680
You should've come to ask me about it.

2034
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,480
You should've come to ask me about it.

2035
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,620
- Should I have come to you?
- She's taking the initiative.

2036
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:59,520
How should I have asked about it?
"Did you pick me?"

2037
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,590
I'll do that the next time.

2038
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,000
How has your dating life been?

2039
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:14,530
- Have you had long relationships?
- He's speaking casually too.

2040
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,240
I've had my share
of long-term relationships.

2041
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,350
However, what people perceive
as "long" can be subjective.

2042
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,650
Over a year seems like a long time.

2043
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,720
Over a year?

2044
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,950
Then, I've been in long relationships.

2045
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,160
What about you?

2046
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,160
Me?

2047
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,590
I've also...

2048
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:43,160
been in long relationships.

2049
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,900
What was the reason behind the breakups?

2050
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,540
I don't think there was
a single common reason.

2051
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,910
I'm glad as long as that's not the case.

2052
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,310
Really?

2053
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,380
There's this, though.

2054
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:02,620
I find it difficult to be around people
who are overly emotional.

2055
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,920
People who get upset easily?

2056
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,350
That's on the cuter side.

2057
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:11,490
- Do you find that adorable?
- Yes.

2058
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:14,690
What if he's upset that you didn't call
while you were in court?

2059
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Then...

2060
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,400
What if he's upset that
you take on too many trials?

2061
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,870
That's cute.

2062
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,340
As for me,

2063
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:28,710
I like someone I can debate with.

2064
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,880
Even if it hurts their pride,

2065
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:35,450
I want someone
who can admit their mistakes.

2066
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:39,250
I can't say
I can perfectly do that myself,

2067
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,150
but I try to talk it out.

2068
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,460
Aside from that, I tend...

2069
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,830
to fully trust people.

2070
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:53,870
From the beginning,
or once you've built some trust?

2071
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:57,370
I prefer going out with someone
after establishing some trust.

2072
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:00,570
In short, you go on casual dates
for quite a while?

2073
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:06,110
I'm the type to get to know the other
for an extended period of time.

2074
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:11,180
Getting to know someone
in a short time isn't easy.

2075
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,420
True.

2076
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:15,620
We're the same.

2077
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,520
- Are you like that too?
- Yes.

2078
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,520
The two are a good match.

2079
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,660
Once we start dating,
don't we get attached?

2080
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,160
Isn't that right?

2081
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,660
- I try to teach...
- Well, I do.

2082
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:25,260
my partner everything about myself.

2083
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:26,900
You try to teach them?

2084
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,070
Me too. When I date and spend time...

2085
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:34,010
with a guy, I get really attached to him.

2086
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,440
I'm the type to devote myself to him.

2087
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:41,980
I should've joined from the beginning.

2088
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,650
Right. You came too late.

2089
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:51,760
No. We still have ten days left.

2090
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,560
We've got tomorrow and the day after.

2091
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,860
From Monday to Saturday.

2092
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,960
But...

2093
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:01,800
I've got nothing to teach you,
so I'm troubled.

2094
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:03,770
No, you have.

2095
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,170
You need to teach me how to make coffee.

2096
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,950
Didn't you say so back then?

2097
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,350
- No.
- "I'll teach you."

2098
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,250
No, I...

2099
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,920
- I'll teach you.
- Okay.

2100
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,090
(Laughing)

2101
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,320
(Sang Yun taught her himself.)

2102
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,320
This isn't...

2103
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,730
the machine I usually use.

2104
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,490
Cooking too.

2105
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,060
You were great at it.

2106
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:33,670
- It was amazing.
- I can only imitate.

2107
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:36,000
- But it was really good.
- I'll make it again.

2108
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,140
- Just ask.
- Really?

2109
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,010
What would you like?

2110
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:43,040
It's all on YouTube.

2111
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,010
But I can't guarantee the taste.

2112
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,520
What should we do tomorrow?

2113
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,850
We can go to Seoul Land.

2114
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:56,190
Yes. I forgot about Seoul Land.

2115
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:59,490
Does Everland still have its zoo?

2116
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:01,060
I'm not sure.

2117
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,530
- Do you like those places?
- It's been ages.

2118
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,660
I do.

2119
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,470
I'm getting excited.

2120
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,800
I am.

2121
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:17,410
(Thinking)

2122
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:18,610
She's not saying anything.

2123
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:28,520
She thought about it.

2124
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:30,890
Do you know how to skate?

2125
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,230
- Do I look like I'll be good at it?
- What?

2126
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:34,430
- Do I look like I'll be good at it?
- Yes.

2127
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,630
Why?

2128
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,200
The next location is a skating rink.

2129
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:46,410
Really?

2130
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,780
How did you know?

2131
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,350
What do you want to do
during the contract relationship?

2132
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,550
I want to skate.

2133
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,690
On second thought,
I bet I'll be bad at it.

2134
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,060
What if we fall down?

2135
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,990
Right?

2136
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,430
(The ice rink Je Yeon wanted to visit)

2137
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,330
- It was warm for a minute.
- Nice.

2138
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,800
It must be pretty with the snow.

2139
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,070
- It's beautiful.
- Right?

2140
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,340
It's like...

2141
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,780
- This place is gorgeous.
- I agree.

2142
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,080
It's really nice.

2143
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,580
Just the two of us here
makes it even more insane.

2144
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,680
- Will we be okay?
- Be careful of your ankles.

2145
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:33,550
I'm scared too.

2146
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,520
- I'm scared.
- Same here.

2147
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:36,890
Oh, no.

2148
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:38,760
- The two look youthful.
- Gosh.

2149
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:41,130
Let's go really slowly.

2150
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,460
Very slowly.

2151
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,760
The snow has piled up. It's real snow.

2152
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:45,930
Right?

2153
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,200
- A heart.
- There's a heart.

2154
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,110
(The ice rink welcomes the two.)

2155
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:56,580
(They enter into their own little world.)

2156
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,880
- Let's ride while holding onto the sides.
- Okay.

2157
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:03,020
Hold on. It's super slippery.

2158
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,680
They'll hold hands without a doubt.

2159
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,020
It's over.

2160
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:08,350
(Staring)

2161
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:09,690
I'm so scared right now.

2162
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,520
First,

2163
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,730
- let's take baby steps.
- Okay.

2164
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,860
I saw others push outward.

2165
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,500
- Like this.
- Yes.

2166
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,030
- By the way, you're good at skating.
- I'm not.

2167
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,370
You can stand.

2168
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:25,440
I can't without holding onto the side.

2169
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,870
- Come here.
- What?

2170
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:29,910
Come here.

2171
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:30,980
- Let go of it?
- Yes.

2172
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,510
(Touching)

2173
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:33,650
They'll definitely hold hands.

2174
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,480
- Really?
- Just a finger?

2175
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,520
If I fall down...

2176
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:39,320
- Seriously.
- How thoughtful of him.

2177
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,750
Hold his hand tightly, or you'll get hurt.

2178
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:43,320
(486 million reasons to hold hands)

2179
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,360
As expected from the dad.

2180
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,430
(Laughing)

2181
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,330
This is too scary.

2182
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:58,370
(Into their little world
while holding each other's fingers)

2183
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:59,540
Sorry, Ji Min.

2184
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,310
Push to the side.

2185
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,440
- The side?
- Yes.

2186
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,540
- Like this?
- Yes.

2187
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,950
I can somewhat move forward.

2188
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,380
Wait.

2189
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:15,350
- We've got the hang of it.
- Compared to earlier.

2190
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,260
You're better at skating than I am.

2191
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,530
Really?

2192
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,830
(A little bit at a time,)

2193
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:29,800
(the two skate forward.)

2194
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,640
You're a better skater than I am.

2195
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,410
- I'll hold your hand.
- What?

2196
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,280
We've come quite far.

2197
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,010
You're right.
All that matters is moving forward.

2198
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,650
- It's really beautiful.
- How pretty.

2199
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,090
This is no joke.

2200
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:50,360
How can it be this beautiful? Seriously.

2201
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,890
- I'm going to show off.
- This is gorgeous.

2202
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:56,930
(The most beautiful moment...)

2203
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:58,200
It's like a painting.

2204
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,530
(is being captured.)

2205
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:02,130
It can't get any prettier than this.

2206
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:08,340
I'm skating much better than before.

2207
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,610
- Me too.
- Right?

2208
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:11,580
(Relying on each other)

2209
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,580
Nice.

2210
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,250
- Nothing can beat such an experience.
- No.

2211
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,790
- Exactly.
- Such memories.

2212
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,990
And the atmosphere
makes it all the more memorable.

2213
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:27,560
This will be one amazing memory.

2214
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,630
Would such a moment come again?

2215
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:32,700
It's so beautiful.

2216
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:36,140
- Look at those people.
- What?

2217
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,200
You're right.

2218
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,280
Hi.

2219
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,180
It's snowing really beautifully.

2220
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,460
Oh, gosh.

2221
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,030
Since we're the only ones here,

2222
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,130
I want to write something
if we have something.

2223
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,700
- Let's do that.
- Right?

2224
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,000
What should we write?

2225
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,230
Write your initials.

2226
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:11,640
- Isn't it JY?
- It is.

2227
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,810
Wait.

2228
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,410
- Like this?
- My turn.

2229
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:16,640
(Sang Yun draws a heart.)

2230
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,640
Oh, my.

2231
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,180
Sang Yun drew a heart.

2232
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,210
- Cute.
- It looks nice.

2233
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:23,550
- It's adorable.
- Right?

2234
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:29,090
(Snapping)

2235
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:30,090
- What do you think?
- Did you take one?

2236
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,220
It came out nicely.

2237
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:33,260
- It's perfect.
- Yes.

2238
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,430
A date better than this
would be hard to plan.

2239
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,660
- Oh, no.
- It's pretty.

2240
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,300
The shadows.

2241
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,870
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon were here.)

2242
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,870
(The end of the show)

2243
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,470
- Isn't it...
- That's a profile picture.

2244
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:45,770
(Perfect messenger profile picture)

2245
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,410
How about a bet?
The first to reach that side wins.

2246
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,180
- The loser grants a wish?
- Okay.

2247
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,510
Don't I get one?

2248
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:53,850
- What? An advantage?
- Yes.

2249
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,250
Where?

2250
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,750
Go as much as you want.

2251
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:57,920
- Really?
- Yes.

2252
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,280
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2253
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:01,490
(Going far)

2254
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,550
She's skating quite far.

2255
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:07,230
How far are you going, big sister?

2256
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:11,030
- He called him big sister.
- "How far are you going, big sister?"

2257
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,430
(I'm getting lost in them.)

2258
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:14,830
How far are you going, big sister?

2259
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,070
To the other side.

2260
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:19,670
Stop. Start from there.

2261
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:21,010
From here? Okay.

2262
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,170
I think I'll win.

2263
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:24,010
For real? I don't think so.

2264
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:27,080
- Go?
- On your mark.

2265
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,080
Go.

2266
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,310
(Starting out of nowhere)

2267
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:30,480
Give me a minute.

2268
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,750
I'll win.

2269
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,090
No.

2270
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,390
Wait. Gosh.

2271
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,860
Be careful.

2272
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:44,330
(She has seized an opportunity.)

2273
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,530
I think I've gotten the hang of it.

2274
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:49,370
I won.

2275
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:51,640
I went easy on you.

2276
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,940
- That's cute.
- They're cute.

2277
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,670
- On your mark.
- Go.

2278
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,750
Go slowly.

2279
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,720
You're good.

2280
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,550
- Nice.
- Last match.

2281
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:09,520
It's a tie right now. The one to win...

2282
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,860
- Okay.
- this last match is the winner.

2283
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,820
What should I ask for?
I'll have you cook for me.

2284
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,230
- What?
- I'll ask you to cook for me.

2285
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,300
Cook for you?

2286
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,400
I'll start really close to the goal.

2287
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:22,630
This much?

2288
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:24,800
Go.

2289
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,540
I'll make you cook, no matter what.

2290
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:33,310
(Skating at full speed)

2291
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,180
I'll just treat you to food.

2292
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,750
- No. You have to cook.
- What?

2293
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,590
No.

2294
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:41,820
(Sang Yun won.)

2295
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,890
You must cook yourself.

2296
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:44,490
- Is that your wish?
- Yes.

2297
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,360
- Think again.
- No.

2298
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:51,100
- What?
- Tomorrow's box lunch.

2299
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:55,600
Box lunch?

2300
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:59,400
I need to go grocery shopping,
but the supermarket is closed.

2301
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,610
I can't buy any ingredients.
What a bummer.

2302
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,550
- You have to push to the side.
- Exactly.

2303
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:09,620
Like this.

2304
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:10,850
Push.

2305
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:12,480
- I might be good at it.
- What?

2306
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,890
(Je Yeon is now full of confidence.)

2307
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,720
- This is how you skate, right?
- Je Yeon looks really happy.

2308
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:16,860
You're really good.

2309
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,890
I can't go straight.

2310
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:22,690
- I keep turning.
- What was that just now?

2311
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:28,530
(The two meet at the center.)

2312
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:52,060
(Their date was like a scene
from a movie.)

2313
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:55,730
It's over.

2314
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:59,530
- That was intense.
- Spring is just around the corner.

2315
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:03,740
The weather will soon get warm,
but the two are in romantic December.

2316
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,740
(Even the weather was romantic.)

2317
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:06,570
That was satisfying.

2318
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:07,610
(Smiling)

2319
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,310
Have you switched from Ji Min and Je Yeon?

2320
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,810
- Me?
- To Sang Yun and Je Yeon?

2321
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,710
The very first breakfast.

2322
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:17,020
The very first ice rink.

2323
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:19,480
Professor. That's very impactful, right?

2324
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,590
- It's day one.
- Right.

2325
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:24,090
- There are two more days left.
- I know.

2326
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:25,520
The intensity of the attraction...

2327
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,160
It's stronger than with Woo Jae.

2328
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:28,390
- Right?
- Yes.

2329
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:31,930
We're seeing new sides of Je Yeon,

2330
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,430
which left us in shock.

2331
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:36,170
I'm curious. Sitting side by side...

2332
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,740
on a date must be quite meaningful.

2333
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,240
What do you think?

2334
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,380
I prefer...

2335
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:45,980
sitting side by side
when getting to know each other.

2336
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:50,780
But when going out,
I like sitting facing each other.

2337
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,750
- Right.
- You can talk while looking...

2338
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:55,520
in the same direction
without becoming self-conscious.

2339
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,220
On a fun topic, you turn to each other.

2340
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,890
That's what makes your heart flutter
and helps you grow closer.

2341
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:04,560
There were many light touches
throughout today's date.

2342
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,530
He touched her hair first.

2343
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,900
Then her shoulders.

2344
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,200
And lastly, her hand.
Those were the physical contacts.

2345
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,210
When someone isn't confident
in their feelings,

2346
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:16,540
they tend to infer them...

2347
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:19,010
- from their behavior.
- Totally.

2348
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:23,280
Sang Yun might realize
he has feelings for Je Yeon...

2349
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,590
from how he held her hand
without hesitation.

2350
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,320
This is how they held hands.

2351
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,290
Je Yeon would've missed my short finger.

2352
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,520
(No romance)

2353
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,830
- May I grab it?
- Sang Yun.

2354
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:35,530
- Here.
- His fingers were long.

2355
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:37,200
- Sang Yun's fingers were long.
- See?

2356
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,570
(Either way, it's a relief.)

2357
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:44,040
(The evening has become pitch black.)

2358
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,240
Who is it?

2359
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,240
- It's Ha Neul.
- Ha Neul.

2360
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,340
(Ha Neul is waiting
for her contract relationship partner.)

2361
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:55,710
I knew I'd get paired and have a date.

2362
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,550
How he walks...

2363
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,350
- No way.
- Is it Ji Min?

2364
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,990
(Two men...)

2365
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,420
(are heading
to the contract relationship place.)

2366
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,490
What?

2367
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,700
It made me excited.

2368
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:14,730
(Who is Ha Neul's partner?)

2369
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:18,770
(Is it Ji Min?)

2370
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:22,870
(Or Woo Jae?)

2371
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,280
- Ha Neul.
- It's Ji Min, right?

2372
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,280
- His voice.
- What? Woo Jae!

2373
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,720
(Ha Neul's partner is Shin Woo Jae.)

2374
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,150
- Who is it?
- What?

2375
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:36,320
This sure is interesting.

2376
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

2377
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,590
I knew it was you from your back.

2378
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:40,690
My back gave it away.

2379
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,930
- You must be cold.
- I'm freezing right now.

2380
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,500
(Ji Min's paired partner...)

2381
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,430
- It must be Ji Won.
- What?

2382
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:48,570
(is Moon Ji Won.)

2383
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,470
It's Ji Won.

2384
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,870
I see.

2385
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:56,780
- What?
- What were you doing?

2386
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:00,580
The two give off cousin vibes.

2387
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,920
(Three couples have been paired
as a result of last night's messages. )

2388
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,480
- "Those who weren't paired..."
- We must be...

2389
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,820
You're right.

2390
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,890
They were automatically matched.

2391
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:10,860
(Those who weren't paired were
automatically matched with a new partner.)

2392
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,120
They weren't paired.

2393
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,730
Three couples were paired.

2394
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:14,930
You're right.

2395
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,290
This was more than possible.

2396
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,660
I'm in your care.

2397
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,170
I'm in your care, Ms. Joo Ha Neul.

2398
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:21,500
I'm in your care.

2399
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:24,170
- Let's have fun.
- Let's have fun.

2400
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,000
- Let's get some good food.
- Yes.

2401
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,670
- And let's have loads of fun.
- Let's have fun.

2402
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,170
Let's take bridal classes.

2403
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,280
"Bridal classes?"

2404
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:32,510
(What's the date like...)

2405
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,350
"Four unpaired people."

2406
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:36,750
(for the four unpaired people like?)

2407
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,050
- This is far from what I imagined.
- Same here.

2408
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,720
The four are having comfortable dates.

2409
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:51,760
(Smiling)

2410
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,170
(Laughing)

2411
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:56,300
- You have no questions for me, right?
- Questions?

2412
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,470
I don't either.

2413
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:58,770
He said, "I don't either."

2414
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:00,370
Questions?

2415
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,440
Let's take it easy.

2416
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,210
Do you want
something in particular tomorrow?

2417
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:05,380
Something in particular?

2418
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,410
(Thinking)

2419
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:08,980
How about soju over sundaeguk?

2420
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,720
That's a good idea.

2421
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,250
Since you like tripe,

2422
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,450
- Let's go.
- shall we get that?

2423
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:15,750
- Tripe and soju or somaek.
- Okay.

2424
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,660
(They have decided on tomorrow's dinner
with great teamwork.)

2425
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,730
I'm happy to see you.

2426
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:23,230
(Despite not being paired,
they're happy to see each other.)

2427
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:25,430
- It might help them relieve some stress.
- Right?

2428
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:27,400
- All they need to do is have fun.
- Exactly.

2429
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:29,030
Here's what I thought.

2430
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:30,940
"Does Je Yeon even care about me?"

2431
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,410
I don't know.

2432
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,580
Observe her closely.

2433
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:40,310
Got it.

2434
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,710
- You're roommates, right?
- Yes.

2435
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:44,680
Become a spy.

2436
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:48,290
Before bed, ask Je Yeon how her day was.

2437
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:49,350
Should I brainwash her?

2438
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:50,490
Keep bringing me up.

2439
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:55,130
I'll go to your room
as if I'm coming to see you.

2440
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,860
On my way, I'll be like, "Hey, Ji Won."

2441
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:00,970
But you're right there.

2442
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:03,840
Aren't you upset?

2443
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,240
- Me?
- It's the weekend, so...

2444
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,840
Are you set on Woo Jae right now?

2445
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,040
- Me?
- Yes.

2446
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,180
That's right.

2447
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:11,480
Then you must not be upset.

2448
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:15,550
I hope Woo Jae hasn't been paired
with a new partner.

2449
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,680
- What if she steals him?
- I'm...

2450
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,880
worried about that too.

2451
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:20,250
Are you confident?

2452
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:23,190
I...

2453
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:26,220
will work hard if that happens.

2454
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:29,290
I won't just stay still.

2455
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:30,860
(Ji Won is fierce.)

2456
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,000
- Ji Won.
- How cute.

2457
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,970
(This is what I'm talking about.)

2458
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:35,370
I won't just stay still.

2459
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:37,240
What if she's really pretty?

2460
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,770
Like crazy pretty.

2461
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,610
(Upset)

2462
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,240
It'll make me sad.

2463
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,140
You're pretty too.

2464
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,810
- My self-esteem has been restored.
- You're really pretty.

2465
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:50,580
- My self-esteem...
- Above all, you're the tallest.

2466
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,150
Look down at her.

2467
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,520
Look down?

2468
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:56,960
Push her with your shoulder.

2469
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,490
- With my shoulder?
- Yes.

2470
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:01,060
(Ji Min comforts the anxious Ji Won.)

2471
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:03,630
You've always been the same.

2472
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,030
I have.

2473
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:06,830
- I agree.
- Yes.

2474
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:08,470
So how did it go today?

2475
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:12,600
(Thinking)

2476
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,240
It feels like we're getting closer.

2477
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,780
What made you feel that way?

2478
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:21,380
Je Yeon began to...

2479
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:23,750
express her feelings toward me.

2480
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,620
That's a positive sign.

2481
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,220
But then you never know.

2482
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:33,120
I have a feeling
Je Yeon will choose Sang Yun.

2483
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:36,160
Why? Why do you say that?

2484
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,760
I think Je Yeon...

2485
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,800
likes someone handsome.

2486
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:43,440
What do you mean? You're handsome too.

2487
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,500
- Be quiet.
- I mean it.

2488
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,870
You don't have to do that. Stop it.

2489
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,670
- I'm serious.
- Don't.

2490
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:50,110
- You are good-looking.
- Don't. You don't have to try.

2491
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:52,610
I opened her heart not with my looks,

2492
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,010
but by knocking on her heart.

2493
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:56,980
Whereas Sang Yun...

2494
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,120
stands out so much.

2495
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:01,290
Compared to other guys,

2496
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,750
she only met him recently.

2497
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,060
- She might be curious about him.
- Right.

2498
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:06,460
What are you going to do?

2499
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:08,360
- He's aware of it.
- Yes.

2500
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,260
(She finds the situation funny.)

2501
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,160
She's too popular.

2502
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,840
- Today, I will...
- It's snowing.

2503
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:23,170
(It's suddenly snowing.)

2504
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:26,780
Now, it's going to mean something to them.

2505
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,480
(Laughing)

2506
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,810
That's crazy.

2507
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,620
- It's small and cute.
- I know. It's so cute.

2508
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,120
It's just like you.

2509
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,860
Sorry.

2510
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:38,860
(Small)

2511
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:41,530
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

2512
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,130
I didn't expect you to come at all.

2513
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,100
Right?

2514
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:50,000
I didn't see it coming at all.

2515
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,600
"Did you write me?"

2516
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,170
"Did you write me?"

2517
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:56,170
I'm expecting Ji Won and Ji Min.

2518
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:57,640
Because...

2519
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,440
they probably didn't get paired.

2520
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:00,580
Ji Won and Ji Min?

2521
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:03,750
- They know.
- Yes.

2522
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:06,220
I can't wait to see Ji Min's face.

2523
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:08,950
What if they come in with arms
on each other's shoulders?

2524
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:12,620
Maybe.

2525
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:14,730
They're always fighting.

2526
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:17,960
- I hope Ha Neul meets someone nice.
- I agree.

2527
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:21,170
Ji Min didn't write Ha Neul's name at all.

2528
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,430
Right. He's always firm.

2529
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:26,600
Last time, he still wrote her name.

2530
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,370
But he didn't write her name this time.

2531
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:29,440
That's just who he is.

2532
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:31,840
- He won't get her hopes up.
- No.

2533
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:32,940
It's not that he's not getting
her hopes up,

2534
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,050
but he's on guard.

2535
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,150
- Right.
- Yes.

2536
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:36,580
That's also the best for Ha Neul.

2537
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,680
- It's neat.
- That's what I like about Ji Min.

2538
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:41,550
- Yes. That's cool.
- Ji Min once said...

2539
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:44,890
he wouldn't make that choice...

2540
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,190
because that's impolite.

2541
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:48,860
I think he's cool in that way.

2542
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:50,530
On the other hand, Ha Neul...

2543
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,400
didn't get Chan Hyeong's hopes up.

2544
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,030
- Right.
- It's the same.

2545
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:55,230
They're only into one person...

2546
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,700
- Yes.
- in the end. Right?

2547
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:57,700
- They're pure.
- Yes.

2548
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,900
(Only pure love on Heart Pairing)

2549
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:01,970
(The 1st night
of the 2nd contract relationship)

2550
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:04,210
(Ji Min and Ji Won who didn't get paired
return home first.)

2551
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,340
Oh, it's so cold.

2552
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,710
- Bear it.
- "Bear it."

2553
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,110
Oh, my gosh. "Bear it."

2554
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:10,180
(Quarreling)

2555
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,280
The snow is piling up. It's nice.

2556
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,790
(Exclaiming)

2557
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:17,420
They shouldn't put meaning to the snow.

2558
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:22,460
Do you want to grab soju?

2559
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:25,230
The genre suddenly changed.

2560
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:26,560
- Here.
- Sure.

2561
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,230
(Braised spicy chicken
on the no pairing date)

2562
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:29,870
Cheers.

2563
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,640
They're far apart.

2564
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,740
(Exclaiming)

2565
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:36,870
This is awesome.

2566
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:37,880
(Sipping)

2567
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,280
(Ji Min gives her the drumstick.)

2568
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,850
Thank you.

2569
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:43,980
Is there only one drumstick?

2570
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,380
There are two.

2571
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,120
The snow's piling up already.

2572
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,490
- It's piling up.
- We get to step on it first.

2573
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:52,690
- They're back.
- What if no one's back yet?

2574
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:54,590
They're back early
because they didn't get paired.

2575
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,830
The four of them can drink together.

2576
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,900
That might not be bad.

2577
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:01,930
It might give Ha Neul a chance.

2578
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:03,230
- You're right.
- Right?

2579
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,500
It's cold.

2580
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,570
- Wait. What?
- Who's here?

2581
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,740
Ji Min, and...

2582
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:11,810
Hey.

2583
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:16,580
(The no pairing couples see each other.)

2584
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,680
I was right.

2585
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,390
- Gosh.
- They didn't get paired.

2586
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:26,090
- Did you not get paired?
- No.

2587
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:27,430
- Did you not get paired?
- You didn't, did you?

2588
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,430
I guessed you two.

2589
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:32,000
- Really?
- We expected...

2590
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,100
Are you drinking?

2591
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,470
(Nodding)

2592
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:37,170
- Let's get changed 1st.
- Let me get changed 1st.

2593
01:55:37,170 --> 01:55:39,100
It's funny that I was right.

2594
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,440
They've become friends.

2595
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:43,410
It's a relief.

2596
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,280
It's better for you.

2597
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,850
I'll meet you in the kitchen
after getting changed.

2598
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,080
(Changing into nice clothes)

2599
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,480
- Oh, my.
- Ha Neul's putting on something nice.

2600
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,020
- Gosh.
- Yes.

2601
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:55,490
(Checking meticulously)

2602
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,160
Oh, my gosh.
Maybe she really wrote Sang Yun.

2603
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,260
I'm telling you she did.

2604
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:02,290
That proves I'm timid.

2605
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:03,530
I want to confirm it.

2606
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:05,330
That makes sense.

2607
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:06,960
It means I'm immature.

2608
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,870
- He's objective about himself.
- He's objective.

2609
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:09,970
But I think it makes sense.

2610
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,040
To be honest, Je Yeon...

2611
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:14,810
assured me for someone who doesn't.

2612
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:17,580
But it's never enough for me.

2613
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,950
I can't stop feeling anxious.

2614
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:23,880
It's not something I can control.

2615
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,320
I might as well just watch her.

2616
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:28,550
Are you just going to watch her?

2617
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,490
I'm not going to talk to her alone.

2618
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,090
Because then she'll feel bad...

2619
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:36,860
about her contract relationship.

2620
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,500
You have a point.

2621
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:41,230
So I don't want to
make her feel uncomfortable.

2622
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:43,940
- Right?
- Yes.

2623
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,240
Gosh.

2624
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:47,070
I should set her free
for the next three days.

2625
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:50,070
You shouldn't be obsessed
with Woo Jae for the next three days.

2626
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,140
- Right.
- But when he's obsessed...

2627
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:53,280
(Ji Min decided to watch...)

2628
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,710
(Je Yeon's contract relationship.)

2629
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:56,680
(Focusing)

2630
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:01,420
The look on Paul Kim's face at the end...

2631
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,590
- summarizes the episode.
- Yes.

2632
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:04,760
Don't film me.

2633
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,160
(It's fun to get a close-up on him.)

2634
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,460
It's kind of sad.

2635
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,190
Is it normal to feel heartbroken?

2636
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:10,930
- Yes, it's heartrending.
- Right.

2637
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:12,800
I guess it doesn't go...

2638
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,800
- It doesn't go as you wish.
- No, right?

2639
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:15,970
Because they keep running into each other.

2640
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:17,570
They keep running into each other.

2641
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,100
What's sad for Ji Min is that...

2642
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,910
there are still two more days left
in the contract relationship.

2643
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:23,010
Even a day feels so long.

2644
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:25,010
It breaks my heart.

2645
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:26,710
I have mixed feelings.

2646
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:27,980
Exactly.

2647
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,980
You happened to be here
when things are tangled.

2648
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,280
- Right. When it's so complicated.
- I feel complicated.

2649
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:36,190
Instead of rooting for just one couple,

2650
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,420
I'm suddenly supporting...

2651
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:41,490
Ha Neul and Ji Min.

2652
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,490
Ha Neul and Ji Min?

2653
01:57:42,490 --> 01:57:44,960
Her heart must be broken.
She must be so upset.

2654
01:57:45,730 --> 01:57:48,370
I want them to meet someone nice.

2655
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:49,770
Right.

2656
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:53,170
(The second contract relationship
is ripe.)

2657
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:55,740
(I think this means a spark.)

2658
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,310
(When I stand in front of you,)

2659
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,910
(I can't hide my feelings.)

2660
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:03,280
(Looking forward to
facing each other again...)

2661
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,250
(even after the 3 days
of relationship are over)

2662
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,880
(I'll travel in the country.)

2663
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,990
But that doesn't mean...

2664
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:09,090
(But that doesn't mean
I won't do anything.)

2665
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,060
(They're becoming alike.)

2666
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:15,690
(Sharing the minor daily routine
together...)

2667
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,460
(It felt like we were going out for real.)

2668
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:20,430
(Building unforgettable memories)

2669
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
(Are you the one I was looking for?)

2670
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,040
(During our contract relationship,)

2671
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:31,180
(did you want to go out with me for real?)

2672
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,410
(3 days)

2673
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:37,850
(Did we find the answer?)

2674
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,950
(The night arrives
with worries on their minds.)

2675
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:43,720
(I have something to give you.
Come to my room.)

2676
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:51,400
- What time is it?
- It's 2 a.m.

2677
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,900
Really? Okay.

2678
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,630
- It works well when I look cool.
- What?

2679
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:57,030
Do you want to give it to me tomorrow?

2680
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:58,370
- No.
- No?

2681
01:58:58,540 --> 01:58:59,740
I'll be too embarrassed
to say it tomorrow.

2682
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:04,380
I thought we communicated enough.

2683
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:08,650
I want to spend some time with Ji Min...

2684
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:09,780
and get to know him.

2685
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:13,050
I want to talk to Ji Min.

2686
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:14,320
- Why?
- About the contract relationship.

2687
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,820
- Yes?
- Ji Min.
