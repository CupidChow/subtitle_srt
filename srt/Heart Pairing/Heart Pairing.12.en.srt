1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,070
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,800
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,570
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,270
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,380
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,240
(Let's watch Heart Pairing.)

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,010
Last week,
the second contract relationship ended.

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,920
- Which couple impressed you the most?
- As for me,

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,120
- Sang Yun and Je Yeon.
- That's right.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,890
- Sang Yun and Je Yeon.
- Those two...

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,320
went camping, you know.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,490
On their way to the campsite
they were lovey-dovey.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,330
Also, was it a cabaret?

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,630
- It's a caravan.
- Caravan.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,100
- Caravan.
- A cabaret...

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,430
is something different.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,370
Were you talking about a cabaret?

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,540
- I'm sorry.
- A cabaret?

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,700
I was wondering,
"A cabaret is something different."

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,910
But it didn't sound strange at all.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,110
We understood what you meant.

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,380
In the caravan,
they looked very lovey-dovey.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,350
Sang Yun cooked doenjang stew for her,

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,920
and they talked.
That scene lingers in my mind.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,880
When they said something to each other,

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,550
- it made my heart flutter.
- Yes.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,990
- He had an impact.
- Right.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,990
But in the end,

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,560
- there were lingering feelings.
- A bit.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,830
- A bit?
- Yes, a bit.

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,490
- You felt sorry.
- Yes.

32
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,530
It the end, Sang Yun...

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,800
talked in a hesitant manner.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,860
(I felt sorry.)

35
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,400
Their skating date...

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,870
- and glamping date were so nice.
- They were perfect.

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,970
However, in the end,

38
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,570
when Je Yeon asked him
which moment he liked the most,

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,980
he avoided answering in detail.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,640
He sounded like
he was postponing his decision.

41
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,810
- And I felt Je Yeon was disappointed.
- I thought...

42
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,950
that he definitely liked
the time he spent with her,

43
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,290
but he might have needed some time...

44
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,720
- to think about what he really liked.
- However,

45
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,090
he could have said that
he liked everything.

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,730
In fact, he could say that he liked
everything if he did.

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,330
"When we were skating,"

48
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,130
"we held hands, and I liked it the most."
He could have said that.

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,830
- That's true.
- Je Yeon...

50
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,200
focused on Sang Yun...

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
when she was with him,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,370
but at the same time,

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,140
when she went back to the Pairing House,
she must have been confused.

54
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,770
- Right.
- That's what I thought.

55
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,480
Since the contract relationship is over,

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm so curious about
what will happen to them.

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,180
Also, Chang Hwan and Soo Ah.

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
They had a horseback riding date,
which was on her bucket list.

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,120
When the contract relationship was over,

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,990
Chang Hwan must have felt the sorriest.

61
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,560
- He did feel sorry, because...
- Yes.

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,260
- someone so nice appeared.
- Right.

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,360
- It was love at first sight for him.
- I saw...

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360
that Soo Ah's eyes showed
how much she concentrated...

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,270
when someone in front of her was talking.

66
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,630
That looked so nice.

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,600
She deserves to work in human resources.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,740
(The right person
for the human resources department)

69
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,240
- Her eyes see through you.
- With a hawk eye,

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,710
she'd watch every employee.

71
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
She's watching.

72
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,240
Since she was so focused,
Chang Hwan didn't know...

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
where he should look.

74
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,050
- He felt nervous and excited.
- I know.

75
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,220
I wonder what Soo Ah thinks.

76
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,620
- That's what matters.
- Meanwhile,

77
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,250
there was a couple
that just looked like a married couple.

78
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,020
They were like a newly married couple.

79
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,460
- Weren't they?
- They looked like a married couple.

80
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
- That's true.
- They're Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,490
- They're real.
- After watching them,

82
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,100
what she said to him
lingered in my mind so intensely.

83
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,030
"Chan Hyeong,
you can sleep some more after lunch."

84
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,370
- That's right.
- It was because...

85
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,840
Chan Hyeong was walking on eggshells...

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,770
- since he came back late that day.
- Right.

87
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,840
However,

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,040
when he came back,
a sumptuous meal was waiting for him.

89
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,950
- At that moment, I envied Chan Hyeong.
- I know.

90
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,780
Chan Hyeong even said,

91
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,110
"My mom would love you."

92
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,020
That means the game is over.

93
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,790
To me, it sounded like,

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,090
"You should meet her sometime."

95
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,190
His comment sounded...

96
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,420
- like their families would meet soon.
- Right.

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,990
Have you ever cooked a homemade meal
for someone like Chae Eun did?

98
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,060
That was what I was very careful about.

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
It's because I cook...

100
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,270
when I picture a future with someone...

101
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,840
to show off my skills.

102
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,270
And I prepare a nice meal.

103
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,140
- A nice meal.
- She says...

104
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,410
that she shows off her skills.

105
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,710
(Her sincerity is shown on the table.)

106
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,240
(Similar People Play...)

107
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,550
(Spot the Difference.)

108
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,950
(First day of the contract relationship)

109
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,180
(They are planning the weekend party.)

110
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,450
Next week,
everyone will focus on their own love...

111
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,490
"Love?" No. I mean,

112
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,490
everyone will focus on their feelings.

113
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,060
- You were talking about yourself, right?
- You said, "Love."

114
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,390
- That was obvious.
- That's possible.

115
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,690
So we'll have to focus on our decision.

116
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,200
It will be difficult for us
to interact actively...

117
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,730
when that time comes.

118
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,870
(When people are alike...)

119
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,570
(do they see things more clearly?)

120
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,670
- What a great idea.
- It's wonderful.

121
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,680
Let's give you some time,
so you can feel more comfortable here.

122
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,610
Hearing that makes me feel comfortable.

123
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,450
Really? Let's do that then.

124
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,810
Do you drink?

125
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,450
Then I felt Je Yeon
pay a lot of attention to Ji Min.

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,190
(Amicable)

127
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,390
- You need to take some rest.
- It's dessert time.

128
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,490
- We're having fun now.
- What?

129
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,660
Why, all of a sudden,

130
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,530
- do you look so tired?
- Do I?

131
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,400
- Do I look tired?
- Your eyes look heavy.

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,430
Really?

133
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,070
- Are you all right?
- What?

134
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,370
I'm fine.

135
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,340
- What do you want to have tomorrow?
- What shall we have?

136
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,740
(Sang Yun and Je Yeon are silent.)

137
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,410
We're going to have abomasum,
so how about...

138
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,080
- something spicy?
- All right.

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
What should we do?

140
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,650
For the seat arrangement, two of you
can sit there and we can sit here.

141
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,850
I could feel...

142
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,920
that whenever Ji Min said something...

143
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,120
- Are you coming down with a cold?
- Yes.

144
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,390
You shouldn't take medicine
after drinking.

145
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,930
Who has medicine?

146
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,460
(Springing to his feet)

147
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,130
Every time Ji Min said something
or made a move,

148
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,530
she paid a lot of attention,
and I could feel it.

149
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,340
My hair still looks fine, right?

150
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,340
- It's down.
- Is it?

151
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,850
I'll search for
a Daegu-style abomasum place.

152
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,050
(She can't help
but pay attention to one person.)

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,780
I'm curious too.

154
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,150
(Scratching)

155
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,490
My curls are loose.

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,790
It's because we got snowed on
so much earlier.

157
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,800
- We couldn't help it.
- Right.

158
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,930
Ji Won, do you want to sit here
to talk to Ji Min more comfortably?

159
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,340
It was beautiful. That's good enough.

160
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,340
- As I see it, we had the most fun.
- Yes.

161
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,070
I don't think other couples
had that much fun.

162
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,340
That's right.

163
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,350
Do you really like Daegu-styled abomasum?

164
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,410
Yes.

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
If you have a glass of somaek with it...

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,050
I think he's sweet and smart.

167
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,920
Really? I didn't know.

168
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
(Standing up suddenly)

169
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,790
Totally.

170
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,830
- I'll make way for you.
- I haven't thought of that.

171
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,300
(Turning)

172
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
(Turning his head again)

173
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,910
Ji Won, just a moment.

174
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,480
This kind usually has
5 to 6 percent of alcohol.

175
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,180
- Do you want to go to Suwon?
- No, I'm fine.

176
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,050
What do you want to bring from home?

177
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,880
Then do you want to drop by your home
in the morning?

178
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,490
We also had our first meal here.

179
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,820
- Did you?
- Yes, for the first time.

180
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,730
(Glancing)

181
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,170
I didn't know what happened
in the two weeks.

182
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,570
And it really felt that the two of them...

183
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,980
had a relationship.

184
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,880
So in the remaining days,
I was very conscious about that.

185
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,250
- I heard you've been to Italy.
- Right.

186
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,520
I envy it so much.

187
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,690
It was really beautiful there.

188
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,060
She keeps looking at me
like I'm a comedian.

189
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,460
What?

190
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,760
- A comedian?
- A comedian?

191
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,160
- She's a subscriber.
- I know.

192
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,370
She's waiting until you speak.

193
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,770
So many people
are from Gyeongsang Province.

194
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,170
I need to listen to her speak in a dialect
before this show ends.

195
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,480
Je Yeon can't speak in a dialect, right?

196
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,710
- I don't.
- Right, you can't.

197
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,010
You don't know how to speak in a dialect.

198
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,850
She spoke well in a dialect.

199
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,690
Cheers.

200
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,860
(Snowing heavily)

201
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,100
(A lot of snow has fallen on the terrace.)

202
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
(Startled)

203
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,510
It doesn't feel cold.

204
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,010
I want to take a picture here.

205
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,110
It's a European vibe.

206
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,310
Chang Hwan, please take a picture for me.

207
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,220
(Running)

208
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,020
It's nice. Cross your legs.

209
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,520
- Crossing my legs.
- Good.

210
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,890
All right.

211
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,630
You look nice. Right, left.

212
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,790
(The roommates get along very well.)

213
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,230
- All right.
- Make it vertical.

214
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,300
(Exclaiming)

215
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,200
I guess we seriously...

216
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,940
won't be able to forget this place.

217
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,970
This won't do. It's not this vibe.

218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,440
So nice.

219
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,510
(Je Yeon joins them.)

220
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,840
I feel so cold
that I need to cover myself.

221
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,440
I feel I have a slight tonsillitis.

222
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,580
It's cold.

223
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,550
- It feels nice.
- I want to have a glass of vin chaud.

224
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm the only one
who didn't bring a cell phone.

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
You can use my phone to take a photo,
if you want.

226
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,260
- This is nice.
- It snowed when we first met.

227
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,890
Did you add meaning to it?

228
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,760
When I walked up
and looked through the window,

229
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I saw her and thought, "Yes."

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,800
The one I wanted was there.

231
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
What?

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Now, it depends on me.

233
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,110
(Wanting to be nice
and to make a good impression)

234
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,780
On the ice rink, it felt like
we were in a real relationship.

235
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,180
I have pictures we took then.

236
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,520
I wasn't aware of it at all,

237
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,720
but we took selfies while holding hands.

238
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,230
My heart fluttered so much
that I wasn't even aware of it.

239
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,370
I was so happy,
and I can't express the feeling in words.

240
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,130
It really felt like a movie.

241
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,070
We took pictures together,

242
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,040
and I liked it since I felt
we were more comfortable.

243
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,180
Do you talk casually now?

244
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,610
- Yes, we do.
- Do you?

245
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,610
Yes.

246
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,920
- Je Yeon...
- Do you call her older sister?

247
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,090
I sometimes call her that.

248
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,450
Do you call her by her name too?

249
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,220
Why does my heart flutter?

250
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,060
(A bitter smile)

251
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,560
You sound like a real man.

252
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,730
Why does my heart race?

253
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,930
- This is no joke.
- That would be so funny.

254
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,700
Right?

255
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,340
Right.

256
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,070
What time did we start drinking?

257
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,570
Was it 7 p.m.?

258
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,440
I drank a lot from 7 p.m.

259
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,440
I feel so cold
that I need to cover myself.

260
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,650
I feel I have a slight tonsillitis.

261
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
(Staring)
It feels cold.

262
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,790
(The second night
of the contract relationship)

263
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,490
Does it mean that we can have
a second round of drinking?

264
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,230
They went out early in the morning.

265
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,030
(Hovering)

266
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,660
I can't drink in the living room.

267
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,060
I was thinking that.

268
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,730
Put the fruit in front of that.

269
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,130
(Glancing)

270
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,800
Why do I keep drinking? I need to stop.

271
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,240
The window on the left.

272
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,380
(Getting close)

273
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,650
She hovered around him so much.

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,380
I could clearly see that
she wanted to be around him.

275
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,150
Does your throat feel all right?

276
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,790
What? What about my throat?

277
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,590
- You said you had a sore throat.
- I feel better now.

278
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,460
I can drink now.
Why have your ears turned red?

279
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,630
I had a drink.

280
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,200
(Fixed gaze)

281
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,600
We have the paper towel downstairs too.

283
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,400
Downstairs? You mean the first floor?

284
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,870
The paper towel... I'll give it to you.

285
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,910
(Je Yeon's Pairing Book
mentioned hovering.)

286
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,580
From that moment on,

287
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
I had a lot on my mind.

288
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,780
Did you think that you wanted to
have a relationship?

289
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,390
(Thinking)

290
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,530
Yes.

291
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,100
I was happy.

292
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,140
To be honest, I wondered...

293
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,270
if I was pushing her.

294
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,910
What made you think so?

295
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,910
(What made you think so?)

296
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,910
I thought the situation...

297
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,250
could have made her say yes.

298
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,250
She looked so sweet.

299
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,960
With Ji Min, she laughed a lot...

300
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,460
and looked mischievous too.

301
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,460
I couldn't see...

302
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,930
those sides of her until the end.

303
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,500
So I felt very disappointed then.

304
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,670
I feel I spoke incoherently.

305
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,150
I wasn't ready,
so I had a mental breakdown.

306
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,380
I wanted to say...

307
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,580
something cool.

308
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,350
(The last contract relationship
ends at 5 p.m.)

309
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,760
If we play Truth or Dare,
I'll ask you this question.

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
What question?

311
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,830
With someone on your mind now,

312
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,200
would you like to go out
starting January 1?

313
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,530
(Amazed)

314
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,170
I'll tell you if we play Truth or Dare.

315
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,940
If I get a chance to ask that question,
I won't ask you.

316
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,270
You're annoying.

317
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,380
Are you going to use
the precious chance on me?

318
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
You'd ask Woo Jae too.

319
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,780
What matters now is how you feel.

320
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,950
- How I feel matters the most.
- Yes.

321
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,190
See how you feel when you're with Ji Min.

322
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,230
I feel like
I said everything I wanted to say.

323
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,360
So I feel...

324
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,930
Right. Your heart is filled.

325
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,770
- Yes.
- You have a sense of stability.

326
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,570
(Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun felt stability
for the first time on the show.)

327
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,900
We have less than a week left.

328
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,840
(For Soo Ah, the week
is more important than anyone else's.)

329
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,010
I got something.

330
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,180
- Did you get a text?
- Am I not supposed to say that?

331
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,520
- You can say that you got a text.
- It's okay to say that.

332
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,850
- Is it?
- As long as you don't say what it says.

333
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,990
(Soo Ah needs to get to know others
as it is her goal here.)

334
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,050
I know.

335
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,860
(A text message that tells her
to pick 2 people)

336
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,230
Tomorrow, if I can...

337
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,900
have dinner with you,

338
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,100
I'll go to a bossam place in Dangsan...

339
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,170
to have bossam with oysters
and cheonggukjang.

340
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,170
- Really?
- Yes.

341
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,940
Do you often go to that place?

342
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,580
- How did you find that place?
- That place is...

343
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,080
(7 days until the final choice)

344
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,780
(It's enough time for anything to happen.)

345
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,090
I can't predict anything.

346
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,420
Right.

347
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,520
(They come back to the Pairing House after
the last contract relationship ends.)

348
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,390
Here comes our deity.

349
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

350
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,900
We're going to cook by 7:30 p.m.

351
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,830
Really?
Honestly, that's enough time for me.

352
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,900
She's a good cook.

353
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,170
Then tell us what to do to help you.

354
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,570
Shall we grill the duck?

355
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,410
That will be good. And wash this for me.

356
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,040
- I'll do that.
- Thanks.

357
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,310
I cooked rice already.

358
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,850
The rice smells so good.

359
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,250
Are we going to cook something?

360
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,620
She's going to cook doenjang stew
with wild chives for us.

361
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
They're huddling in the kitchen
after a long time.

362
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,920
- It looks so nice.
- Right.

363
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,660
Please peel the potatoes.

364
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,060
Shall I peel three?

365
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,000
(Peeling potatoes
under the main chef's instructions)

366
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,640
This is fun.

367
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,040
(Absorbed in peeling potatoes)

368
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,970
(Laughing)

369
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,280
(Je Yeon stands next to Ji Min.)

370
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,410
(Humming)

371
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,680
She's watching Ji Min.

372
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,450
(Grinning)

373
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,350
- It looks fun, right?
- What?

374
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,020
- I'm peeling it and having fun.
- You're working hard.

375
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,700
(Looking closely)

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,100
This is a heart.

377
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,700
- It looks like that, right?
- You did a good job peeling it.

378
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
(Glancing)

379
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
He's watching them.

380
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,470
The potato smells so good
that I want to eat this.

381
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,040
Chae Eun, you didn't eat this.

382
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,210
(Sniffing)

383
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,180
- Does this potato smell?
- This is so...

384
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,380
(Conscious)

385
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,710
This is complicated.

386
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,180
Am I the only one who can smell it?

387
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,590
(Ji Min and Je Yeon are close,)

388
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,760
(and Sang Yun hovers before them.)

389
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,190
- My goodness.
- This is tough.

390
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,620
I guess I'm peeling
almost half of this potato away.

391
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,530
(Meanwhile, Soo Ah is checking her looks.)

392
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,130
- It's Soo Ah.
- Has she gotten close to other people?

393
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
(Walking fast)

394
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,930
Who is she going to?

395
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,240
Hi.

396
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,770
- May I come in?
- Of course.

397
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,640
Do you have a plan for dinner today?

398
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,180
- Dinner?
- Yes.

399
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,750
- Would you like to have...
- He's flustered.

400
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,680
dinner with me? Okay.

401
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,080
Yes. Together.

402
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,850
- I see. Okay.
- Is it all right with you?

403
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,020
- Yes, it's fine.
- All right.

404
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,290
- Yes.
- As expected.

405
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,120
- Now that she's here, she should do that.
- Yes.

406
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,820
A catfish needs to meet other people fast.

407
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,990
(Last night)

408
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,800
(This text is sent only to Soo Ah.)

409
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,530
(Select two people
you want to know better.)

410
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,670
Chan Hyeong,
and the other one is a secret.

411
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,470
- The other one?
- She selected Chan Hyeong.

412
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,770
I haven't decided on the other one yet.

413
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,870
Who is it?

414
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,410
So you didn't select two people yesterday.

415
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,140
I selected two,

416
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,610
but I'm not sure about the other one yet.

417
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,520
- Come and have dinner now.
- Do you want us to help?

418
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,780
- Are you done?
- What?

419
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,250
- Go and have dinner, Je Yeon.
- Soo Ah has an appointment.

420
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,420
What? Really?

421
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
- Yes.
- This was what it was about yesterday.

422
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,820
- Yes.
- Enjoy.

423
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,760
Then we don't need
ten bowls of rice today.

424
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,660
- Okay.
- Yes.

425
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,600
- Is it doenjang stew with wild chives?
- We need eight bowls of rice.

426
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,630
- It's 8.
- You can make it 8 bowls.

427
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,970
- Okay.
- Have fun. See you.

428
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,940
First, I selected Chan Hyeong...

429
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,880
and Ji Min.

430
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,920
(It was Ji Min.)

431
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,350
(An unexpected choice, Ji Min)

432
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
Ji Min.

433
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,720
(The night when everyone gathered)

434
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,960
(His eyes...)

435
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,490
(turn to someone.)

436
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,770
At that moment, I felt something.

437
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,700
I didn't think it would work out.

438
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,440
She figured it out then.

439
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,910
It seemed he already had someone in mind.

440
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,720
I actually wanted
to go on a date with Ji Min.

441
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,080
But truthfully, I think I was scared.

442
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,920
(Soo Ah changed her decision
in the end after much deliberation.)

443
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,420
Gosh, she sensed it in that split second?

444
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,960
That's why she didn't pick Ji Min.

445
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,460
So Soo Ah will be dining out tonight.

446
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,160
- What?
- With whom?

447
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,030
I think it's with Chan Hyeong.

448
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,100
- No way.
- It's the guy who's not here now.

449
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,300
- He's behind you.
- He's over there.

450
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,000
- He's here.
- Why is he still here?

451
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,440
- My gosh.
- "Why is he still here?"

452
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,910
What is it?

453
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,980
- Are you going out to eat?
- Yes. It turned out that way.

454
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,280
You won't be able
to eat doenjang stew with us.

455
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Right.

456
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,220
(A man suddenly goes quiet.)

457
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,280
Chang Hwan must have a lot
on his mind too.

458
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,350
Why do I feel like
I should walk on eggshells?

459
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,760
- But you've had her doenjang stew before.
- Enjoy.

460
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,290
- You've already had her doenjang stew.
- Right.

461
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,790
No. But this batch will be tastier.

462
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
- Vinegar and soy sauce.
- Let's eat now.

463
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,730
Let's eat. Why aren't we eating?

464
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,330
- Dark soy sauce.
- Isn't our meal ready?

465
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,770
Dark soy sauce? It's here too.

466
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,170
(Exhaling)

467
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,040
- This is a feast.
- Oh, no.

468
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,710
But that's the thing
with being on our show.

469
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,580
- He must accept situations like this.
- Right.

470
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,680
- Yes.
- There's nothing he can do.

471
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,550
- But he can't hide his facial expression.
- Right.

472
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
- That's beyond his control.
- Right?

473
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,120
Let's go to the table and eat, everyone.

474
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,220
(To some,
this meal will leave a bitter taste.)

475
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,590
- Are you good with this?
- Cheers.

476
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,490
- Good job.
- Thank you for the meal, Chae Eun.

477
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,660
- Thank you, Chae Eun.
- I'm going to enjoy this a lot.

478
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,300
The stew is really good.

479
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,700
- Seriously. She's so good at cooking.
- Yes.

480
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,300
I love it.

481
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,200
(Chae Eun nails it again with dinner.)

482
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,470
Did you have a good breakup today?

483
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,710
- Didn't we all break up today?
- Exactly.

484
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,610
Now, I'm getting used to
the process of breaking up.

485
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
(Glancing)

486
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,090
A horse riding stable with a good vibe
was my breakup spot.

487
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,520
Did you wear the equestrian outfit?

488
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,530
- I have pictures.
- Can we see them?

489
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,230
I wouldn't call it an equestrian outfit.

490
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,030
You know the hat?

491
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,170
- When did I do that?
- My gosh.

492
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,270
(He shows off the picture
he took with Soo Ah today.)

493
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,570
- You guys look cute.
- Can I see it too?

494
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
- You guys look cute.
- Seriously.

495
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,610
- That's a nice picture.
- You guys look cute.

496
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,710
- You guys look cute.
- Gosh.

497
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,310
- How cute.
- You guys really look cute.

498
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,240
You guys look like a married couple.

499
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,110
- You guys make a good couple.
- We had fun.

500
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,480
Right. They did.

501
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,580
Do you know what Soo Ah
and Chang Hwan are having tonight?

502
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,690
You don't know?

503
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,620
I wonder how he feels now.

504
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,390
(A vegan restaurant in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

505
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,530
It feels surreal to be here.

506
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,570
- It feels surreal to eat...
- Yes.

507
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,600
- with another guy.
- Right?

508
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,100
I wonder if Chan Hyeong will take
an interest in her all of a sudden.

509
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,310
Did I surprise you
when I came to your room earlier?

510
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,170
I was surprised. I didn't know why...

511
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,210
I mean, everyone was cooking dinner.

512
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,580
(She secretly asked him out on a date
while preparing for dinner.)

513
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,150
I didn't intend it,
but I ended up getting tastier food.

514
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm also having delicious food
thanks to you.

515
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,490
He really didn't see it coming.

516
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,290
- Please dig in.
- Okay.

517
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,030
Should we scoop up the food?
Or can we just share the plate?

518
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,160
- I'm fine with it.
- Do you prefer to scoop it up?

519
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,430
- Same here. Then let's just eat.
- In that case,

520
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,430
I'll eat straight from the plate.

521
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,460
I can tell
Chan Hyeong is slightly nervous.

522
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,870
There are other guys in the house.

523
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,040
But you chose me to have dinner with.

524
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,180
- Is there a reason behind that?
- The reason?

525
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,740
(Hesitant)

526
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,810
I'm curious.

527
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,150
First of all,
you seemed like a serious type.

528
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,220
That was your first impression.

529
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,050
- I looked like a serious type?
- A serious type.

530
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,490
And you were careful when you spoke.

531
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,560
You didn't talk much when we first met.

532
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,060
But...

533
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,960
it didn't seem like you were quiet
because you weren't the chatty type.

534
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,430
Soo Ah is quite sharp.

535
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,140
And you have a clean-cut look.

536
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,740
I like this kind of neat appearance...

537
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,440
- in guys too.
- I see.

538
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,580
- The people in the house...
- I liked that.

539
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,610
- I mean, the guys in the house...
- The guys?

540
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,780
- They're all handsome.
- Yes. So...

541
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,790
I felt a bit threatened in the beginning.

542
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,420
I did feel that way.

543
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,060
I thought you were a catch.

544
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,200
You don't have to feel threatened by them.

545
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,830
- Thank you.
- What a sweet thing to say.

546
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,830
(Shy)

547
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,840
- Okay.
- Chan Hyeong has a soft spot...

548
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,540
- for compliments. Did she figure it out?
- Yes.

549
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,610
- This is a natural process.
- What?

550
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,170
(It's something Soo Ah must go through.)

551
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,680
That's something
we're expected to do here.

552
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,140
- At least here.
- Right.

553
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,710
So we talked about that today.

554
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,880
What?

555
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,520
Soo Ah and I talked about it.

556
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,790
You told her to meet with other guys?

557
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,450
- She ought to meet with other guys.
- I see. To meet with other guys?

558
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,390
- I wouldn't want her...
- Of course.

559
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,090
to have any disappointment or regret.

560
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,890
I'm sure that's how we all think.

561
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,500
She must talk to everyone
to get to know them.

562
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,760
That way, she can decide to come back
or have a change of heart.

563
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,770
That's up to her.

564
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,500
But in my opinion, it's not cool to end it
without not knowing what it could've been.

565
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,040
Right.

566
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,970
Even so, it doesn't feel great.

567
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,310
He's honest.

568
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,840
- I saw a flicker of madness in your eyes.
- Right.

569
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,080
- I just saw a laser beam.
- Right.

570
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,280
- It doesn't feel great.
- Just now.

571
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,050
It doesn't feel great.

572
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,790
I'm sure it's the same with everyone.

573
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,960
But she's entitled to go on a date
since she's new.

574
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,160
Your boyfriend is a popular guy.

575
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,330
- He's popular?
- Yes.

576
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,500
But we broke up.
So there's nothing I can do.

577
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,970
- She's so chill about it.
- She's so chill.

578
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,770
When she was cooking doenjang stew,
she was dazed.

579
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,570
There was no focus in her eyes.

580
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
(She's caught.)

581
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,040
- She was cooking for him.
- It felt like my spirit was elsewhere.

582
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,980
By the way, given the nature of the show,
time is so limited.

583
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
- So this is bound to happen.
- Right.

584
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,880
We have to be efficient with time.

585
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,190
(That's true.)

586
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,920
She can go on one more date.

587
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,920
She had to pick two people.

588
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,560
- Well, if it happens, then it happens.
- Are you denying your reality?

589
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,030
What if he ends up crying in his room?

590
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,260
(Fidgeting)

591
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,270
Poor Chang Hwan.

592
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,870
Did you have a specific age in mind
for marriage?

593
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,710
I always wanted...

594
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,410
to get married before I turned 30.

595
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
But now that I'm in my 30s,
I feel more at ease.

596
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,580
Here's why.

597
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,780
I would live with him
for the rest of my life.

598
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,620
- Right.
- I didn't want to pick someone...

599
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,260
to marry under time pressure.

600
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,920
- That's very important.
- Right.

601
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,830
Have you mostly had
long-term relationships?

602
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes,
once I decided to be in a relationship.

603
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,600
But I rarely decide to start one.

604
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,370
- So...
- You rarely decide to start one?

605
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,240
Right.
I like the idea of feelings growing...

606
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,740
over the course of a relationship.

607
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,580
But I need to have some feelings
before I decide to be in a relationship.

608
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,810
I must have feelings for him
to start a relationship.

609
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,580
She's careful.

610
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,620
Then do you think you were the one...

611
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
with bigger feelings
in your relationships so far?

612
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,690
Or do you think
your exes had bigger feelings for you?

613
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
So far, I really think it was mutual.

614
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,060
- You had a lot of good times then.
- Yes.

615
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,030
(Chuckling)

616
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,700
But I don't think there was a time...

617
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
their feelings weren't
fully reciprocated by me.

618
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,170
I mean, you were always so careful...

619
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,880
- before starting any relationship. Right?
- Yes.

620
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,910
Right.

621
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,950
Which one do you prefer?

622
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,450
- I'm curious too.
- Well,

623
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,950
a big part of me would want to be
with someone I have strong feelings for.

624
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,060
- Someone you have strong feelings for?
- Yes.

625
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,990
I think that makes me happier.

626
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,000
Right.

627
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,900
Yes.

628
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,740
- I think that varies with people.
- Yes.

629
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,910
Given my personality,
since I was here with other people,

630
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,740
I thought that I should talk
to everyone at least once.

631
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,950
- That's just me.
- Yes.

632
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,350
But some people are...

633
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,580
only interested in one person.

634
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,050
Right.

635
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,450
- Then I didn't see any reason to pursue.
- They're fixated.

636
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,150
- Where do you think you fall?
- Right.

637
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,690
Me?

638
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,590
I like to get to know everyone first.

639
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,730
And then I would suddenly catch myself
developing feelings for someone.

640
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,900
- Right. That's possible.
- She's so honest.

641
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,400
And once I become interested in someone,

642
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,530
- I don't want...
- That's it, right?

643
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,630
to get to know other people afterward.

644
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,140
- So it's until you become interested.
- Yes, until then.

645
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,670
- I have a good understanding of my type.
- Really?

646
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,680
(Nodding)

647
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,780
(Where are Soo Ah's feelings going?)

648
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
This is hard.

649
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,020
Soo Ah is the last one to join the show.

650
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,320
So she has the benefit of going
on two dates with men of her choice.

651
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,920
She used her first date on Chan Hyeong.

652
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,890
Soo Ah must have a sense of urgency too.

653
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,530
But I had no idea that
she was interested in Ji Min.

654
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,000
I think she was attracted to Ji Min
based on first impressions.

655
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,470
- Right. I agree.
- Soo Ah was attracted to him?

656
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,930
- I agree. He was her first choice.
- Yes.

657
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,130
- It was a strong first impression.
- But...

658
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,540
(Their dinner is over.)

659
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,110
- It's over.
- What?

660
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,750
- He's so cute.
- "It's over."

661
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,780
- What did you do? Did you have fun?
- What?

662
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,290
(He asks her questions
he has been holding back for 3 days.)

663
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,060
Where's everyone?

664
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,490
I don't know. They're all...

665
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,390
I thought they were all over there,
but no one's there.

666
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,160
Are they all here? They're sleeping.

667
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,900
- We're not sleeping. What is it?
- Chang Hwan is sleeping.

668
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,400
- I'm not sleeping.
- He can't.

669
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,830
Are we having a get-together?

670
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,600
- No. Not yet.
- I'm bored.

671
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,740
I can hang out here then.

672
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Come in.

673
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,380
My gosh. This is a big bed.

674
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,880
- Your beds are bigger.
- I've never been in here.

675
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,150
- Really?
- That's kind of funny.

676
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,920
- Right.
- They're hanging out in the room now.

677
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,050
Our room is dirty, right?

678
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,120
No.

679
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,960
(Intrigued)

680
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,660
(Playing with her hair)

681
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,330
Everyone has a day off tomorrow.

682
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,460
- So everyone is relaxed.
- Yes.

683
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Everyone except for you.

684
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What was that?

685
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,070
(Chuckling)

686
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,270
It's nice that you guys came over
to our room now that we're close.

687
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,180
- It feels like we're bonding.
- You guys are...

688
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,750
- the 1st ones to come to our room. Yes.
- We're the 1st ones.

689
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,150
You're our first guests.

690
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,350
- Really?
- You're our first female guests.

691
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,250
- You went to their room a lot, right?
- Whose room?

692
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,390
Chan Hyeong and Woo Jae's room, right?
I bet you went there a few times.

693
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,790
- I've never been to their room.
- Never.

694
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,030
Their room is tiny,
so we would try not to go.

695
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,530
That means we didn't get zero votes...

696
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,830
when it comes to picking rooms.

697
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,170
There's a vote on our rooms now?

698
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,800
Our rooms are going to be voted on?

699
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
Should we text that?

700
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,170
(Grinning)

701
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,870
(Glancing)

702
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,280
(Gazing)

703
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,510
So our room didn't get zero votes.

704
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,610
(Staring afar)

705
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,220
We want to check out your room.

706
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,150
Come over to our room then.

707
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
But we have to be careful about
entering women's rooms.

708
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,030
I mean, it's fine to barge into...

709
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,100
the guys' rooms, but we have to be
more cautious with women's rooms.

710
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,630
Right. Men entering women's room...

711
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Hey, don't look over there.

712
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,140
(They hid a pile of dirty laundry.)

713
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
No. That will be bad.

714
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,910
(The ladies uncovered a secret
about the guys' room.)

715
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,010
Who usually does laundry for you guys?

716
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,350
- Do you take turns?
- We just...

717
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,850
- Or whoever sees the pile?
- Yes.

718
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,550
Do you know how he does laundry?

719
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,780
Socks, T-shirts, towels, and scarves.

720
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,850
- He washes them in one load.
- Even the scarves?

721
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,420
He put a scarf in the load today.

722
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,360
(Embarrassed)

723
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,290
But he washed everything in one load
and ran the dryer too.

724
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,590
Yes. They came out nice and clean.

725
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,360
When I was putting in the laundry,
I saw a scarf.

726
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,530
Here's how I do it.

727
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,870
I put everything in there...

728
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,070
and say this to the washer and dryer.
"You must endure it."

729
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,240
(A new way of doing laundry
for this manly guy)

730
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,100
- "You must endure it."
- You're toughening them up.

731
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,110
Yes.

732
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,510
That was my first time
hearing your accent.

733
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,140
- Really?
- Yes.

734
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,010
- Did you speak with an accent just now?
- Really?

735
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,450
(My dialect is exposed.)

736
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,750
(A woman from Busan, A man from Pohang)

737
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,020
Is that your Seoul dialect?

738
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,720
Probably.

739
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,090
(Je Yeon with the Seoul accent
will suffer to no end.)

740
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,920
- This is the mouth shape for "really."
- "Really?"

741
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,020
- "Really?"
- He's teasing her.

742
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,990
"Really?"

743
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,330
You don't open your eyes.

744
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,730
"Really?"

745
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,830
"Really? You're teasing me again."

746
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,070
Don't I sound just like her? "Really?"

747
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,970
"Really? You're teasing me again."

748
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,140
(She can't breathe.)

749
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,680
When I move,
come to my housewarming party.

750
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,150
- A housewarming party?
- Yes.

751
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,210
- Having ten people over might be hard.
- Won't that be hard?

752
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,550
- Why?
- So...

753
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,920
Coming to my house
after saying in this mansion...

754
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,550
(Pretty soon, they start conversing
only with each other.)

755
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,960
Invite whoever is available then.

756
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,690
You must come.

757
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,490
(Nodding)

758
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,390
That will be fun.

759
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,860
It will be so much fun.

760
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,830
Both of you look prettier
with your hair tucked behind your ears.

761
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,770
- You look prettier with your hair tucked.
- Yes.

762
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,840
- Do you call that an updo?
- Like this?

763
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,970
- Yes.
- She's so cute.

764
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,500
- It's... Yes. A ponytail.
- A ponytail.

765
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,870
Not exactly. It's like a top knot bun.

766
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
Should I tie my hair up?

767
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,580
I didn't tie my hair here.
I didn't even tie it in a low bun.

768
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,780
- You look prettier with your hair up.
- I didn't tie it up either.

769
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,510
I think you'll look good with your hair up
or the updo... What do you call that?

770
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,550
I once had my hair in a top knot bun.

771
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,350
- I didn't see it.
- You look good with any hairstyle.

772
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,790
It was that day.

773
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,920
It was when we went wild.

774
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,290
- Right.
- That's why I don't remember it.

775
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,130
(Only the three of them remained
in the house that night.)

776
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,930
She did.

777
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,670
(Disappointed)

778
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,030
This must be tough on Ha Neul.

779
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,700
I know this is sudden.

780
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,010
- But can the four of us take a selfie?
- Yes.

781
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,550
I was envious of Chang Hwan
and Soo Ah's selfie from earlier.

782
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,380
- Let's take it.
- Let's take it.

783
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,780
Should I get closer?

784
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,150
- One.
- He definitely has a sentimental side.

785
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,420
He's Type F.

786
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
(A selfie to celebrate having
their first guests in their room)

787
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,560
Thank you.

788
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,900
This helps me keep going when I'm at work.

789
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,700
When I look at pictures like this,
it gives me strength.

790
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,870
I like it.

791
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
All that's left in the end
would be pictures.

792
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,410
It seems Ha Neul has a lot on her mind.

793
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,950
You ended up with guys
you wanted to be paired up with, right?

794
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,550
- You were paired up with guys you wanted.
- Yes.

795
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,350
I think I'm done getting to know everyone.

796
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,520
- Really?
- I feel that way.

797
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,190
But there's someone
I still want to get to know more.

798
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,590
Really?

799
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,790
You've never...

800
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,030
She didn't have a chance.

801
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,600
I wouldn't say we never talked.

802
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,830
We just didn't talk much.

803
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,370
We didn't talk
after we came back to Seoul.

804
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,470
(Hesitant)

805
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,240
Actually, I felt something similar...

806
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,710
about someone.

807
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,280
Really? Recently?

808
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,880
- While living in the house together.
- I see. So you want...

809
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,280
So you want to talk to him at least once?

810
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,850
No, I want more than just a talk.

811
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,250
I want to go on a date with him...

812
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,460
- to spend more time together.
- I see.

813
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,420
- Right.
- I suddenly felt that way.

814
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,760
I don't know whether or not
I'm romantically attracted to him.

815
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,400
- I'm just curious about him.
- Okay.

816
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,730
- Has he been on your mind?
- Yes.

817
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,900
He's on my mind.

818
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,000
Who is it?

819
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,270
It's Sang Yun.

820
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,740
- Really?
- Yes.

821
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,070
He's the type of person
people can't stop thinking about.

822
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,170
Why do you think that is?

823
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,610
One big reason is that he's reserved.

824
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,110
It's his image
that leaves an impression on people.

825
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,210
- You guys never went on a date?
- We did.

826
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,780
But when we were on our date,

827
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,650
- I didn't feel anything.
- I see.

828
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,390
- When you got the beef slice hot pot?
- The beef slice hot pot.

829
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,820
After spending an hour at the restaurant,

830
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,760
I thought to myself that
I would never be attracted to him.

831
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,290
But when we were spending time
as a group...

832
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,290
Do you think he's a good guy?

833
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,660
He seems like a sweet guy.

834
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,900
- He must have irresistible charms.
- He's sweeter than I thought.

835
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,230
When I was next to him,

836
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,200
I noticed that
he was attentive to people around him.

837
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,310
He's the type who doesn't need to look
to figure out what people need.

838
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,840
He just grabbed things and gave it to me.

839
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,110
When I looked for something,
he grabbed it and gave it to me...

840
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,110
- Really?
- without making a big deal.
That's it.

841
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,880
- Gosh, she's definitely enjoying that.
- My gosh.

842
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,150
- That's...
- Chae Eun is cute.

843
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,150
- You really didn't eat?
- I had a feeling we'd order a lot.

844
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,050
I don't think this is enough for Chae Eun.

845
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,450
We really didn't eat.

846
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,220
Let me bring it closer to you.

847
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,360
It's okay.

848
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,890
Don't mind us. Just eat.

849
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,160
(Chae Eun appreciated
Sang Yun's sweet gesture.)

850
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,800
Sang Yun makes
a lot of gestures like that.

851
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,530
(Rummaging)

852
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,300
- Do you want to borrow my phone?
- Yes.

853
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,740
(He noticed even
the smallest movement right away.)

854
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,740
- You do look alike sitting side by side.
- I like it when it's subtle like that.

855
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,740
I don't think I paid attention to that.

856
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,250
Because you were
somewhat interested in him,

857
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,120
- you must have felt that.
- That's true.

858
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,650
- That's true.
- I'm going over what he did...

859
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,190
- one more time in my head.
- Yes.

860
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,890
- It means I'm somewhat interested in him.
- You're somewhat interested in him.

861
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,230
I'm not interested in him.

862
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,590
- So I wouldn't care what he does.
- That's right.

863
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,090
- Even if he gave you a mirror,
- Right.

864
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,960
- it wouldn't make you think about him.
- Right.

865
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,470
I don't know
whether or not this is a romantic feeling.

866
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,770
- I really don't know.
- Right.

867
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,470
(She finds herself remembering
Sang Yun's sweet gestures.)

868
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,570
Is it because he used to be a pitcher?

869
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,640
- He's observing everyone.
- I see.

870
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,880
- Because he used to be a pitcher?
- Yes.

871
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,240
- That's possible.
- It could be possible.

872
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,550
That's a good tip for our male viewers.

873
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,050
It's such a small gesture, but...

874
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,980
We're running out of time here.
So trying to get to know someone...

875
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,490
or paying more attention to someone...

876
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,260
would mean
we're investing our valuable time in them.

877
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,520
Right.

878
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,760
But she can't talk to Ji Min.

879
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,860
I should ask him out on a date too.

880
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,800
Who's your guy?

881
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,570
The person that makes me nervous
and keeps me on my toes would be Ji Min.

882
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,440
When it's just the two of us,
Ji Min is a sweet guy.

883
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,240
- He's sweet?
- Yes. But...

884
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,170
in a group setting, he's distant.

885
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,240
In my opinion,

886
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,450
I think he's interested in Je Yeon.

887
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,610
- That's possible.
- Yes.

888
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,850
Because his feelings for Je Yeon
are so strong,

889
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,690
it makes me wonder
if he's drawing a line between us.

890
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,190
I actually think this would be a good time
for you to make a move.

891
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,930
- Hi.
- Hi.

892
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,130
Did you eat something?

893
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,630
I had an apple.

894
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,370
- Is the peanut butter yours?
- It's mine.

895
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,930
- It's tasty. I had some.
- It's good, right?

896
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,440
Eat a lot.

897
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,910
Why does she keep waving her hand
as she walks away?

898
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,810
- Ji Min...
- Go talk to him.

899
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,680
- I'll go and talk to him now. Wait here.
- Okay.

900
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,550
- Are you sleepy?
- I'm not going to sleep.

901
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,650
(After getting a pep talk,
Ha Neul finally goes to him.)

902
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,550
What do I say?
Should I ask him to grab a meal with me?

903
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,160
Yes. I don't think
he's doing anything tomorrow.

904
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,430
Wait, he's going to work tomorrow.

905
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,300
Have dinner after work.

906
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,960
(At that time,
Je Yeon goes down to the 1st floor.)

907
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,000
- Oh, no.
- Are they both going to Ji Min?

908
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,540
- Where are you going, Je Yeon?
- What?

909
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,570
Where are you going?

910
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,910
I wanted to pop down
to the first floor for a bit.

911
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,610
No way.

912
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,420
I'm going to talk to Ji Min.

913
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,080
- About what?
- To ask him out on a date.

914
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,520
- Really?
- Yes.

915
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,820
Because we didn't go on a date here.

916
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,430
Is he sleeping?

917
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,860
- She found courage for the first time.
- There you go.

918
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,300
- She's making her move first.
- She's...

919
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,900
- She decided to make her move first.
- Yes.

920
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,630
Ha Neul told Je Yeon
about her intention first.

921
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,100
- Come in.
- Come in.

922
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,370
- Ji Min.
- I don't look presentable.

923
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,810
- What?
- What is it?

924
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,470
- You can't come out now?
- What?

925
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,540
- What?
- You can't come out?

926
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,110
- I'll put on a hat and go out.
- Okay.

927
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,810
(Peeking)

928
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,350
- What is it? Me?
- What are you doing on Monday after work?

929
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,990
- After work?
- On Monday.

930
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,490
- Ha Neul ought to try things too.
- Nothing.

931
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,790
Do you want to grab a meal together?

932
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,260
I see. Sure.

933
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,890
(Je Yeon heard Ha Neul
ask him out on a date.)

934
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,590
- Are we meeting at 8 p.m. then?
- Yes.

935
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,360
To be honest,

936
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,930
when we met in Italy,

937
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,240
there was someone
that grabbed my attention.

938
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,040
Someone did get my attention.

939
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,140
We went on a date
on our last day in Italy.

940
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,240
Back then,
I found myself getting quite nervous...

941
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,110
for some reason.

942
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,750
But we had a great time together.

943
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,520
It left a strong impression on me too.

944
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,350
So I felt that we were bonding a lot
during the date.

945
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,890
I liked that.

946
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,890
But when we came back to Seoul,

947
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,990
it felt like there was a wall.

948
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,060
Then I realized that
this was what frustration felt like.

949
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,830
I didn't know,
but that was how I mainly felt.

950
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,300
(What did Je Yeon think after hearing
Ha Neul's heartfelt confession?)

951
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,970
She felt that
there was something going on.

952
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,370
Would you like to go with me?

953
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,110
- I need your help with something.
- Of course.

954
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,380
(They went upstairs before
the conversation ended.)

955
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,920
You arrive home around 8 p.m. after work?

956
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,090
Yes. It would be around that time.

957
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,190
(Je Yeon goes down to the 1st floor
10 minutes later.)

958
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,590
It's suddenly getting complicated.

959
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,590
(Knocking)

960
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,330
What is it?

961
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,660
- Ji Min isn't here?
- I'm here.

962
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,130
- Why did you come now?
- What?

963
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,300
Why did you come now?

964
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,340
(Why did Je Yeon come to Ji Min's room?)

965
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,010
I have something to give you,
so come to my room tonight.

966
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,810
- You have something to give me?
- Yes.

967
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,780
I see. Ji Min told her to come.

968
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,380
- I choose this. This is the prettiest.
- Okay.

969
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,790
- They look like Je Yeon and you.
- This is me. Right?

970
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,790
(He bought a postcard for Je Yeon.)

971
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,360
(He wrote each letter sincerely.)

972
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,560
He's writing a letter.

973
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,190
(With his sincere heart)

974
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,030
Ji Min has sincerity.

975
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,930
(Even after coming home)

976
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,800
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

977
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,910
- Should I leave this on Je Yeon's bed?
- You want to go and leave it there?

978
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,970
- Should I leave it there?
- She might not notice it.

979
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,480
- Is that so? I'll just give it to her.
- Yes.

980
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,780
- Ji Min.
- What is it?

981
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,250
Do it like this. Listen.

982
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
"Ji Won, don't you have my Pairing Book?"

983
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,820
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

984
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
(The helper is proud.)

985
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,820
Another postcard?

986
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,920
Take it and read it.

987
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,890
- I wanted to give you that.
- Is that so? Okay.

988
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,660
I wanted to give it to you
while I was looking cool.

989
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,070
Do you want to give this to me
tomorrow then?

990
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,500
I'll be too shy
to say this again tomorrow.

991
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,240
- Okay.
- Good night.

992
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,740
- Good night.
- Bye.

993
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,940
- Bye.
- Bye.

994
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,710
She must think he's so cute.

995
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:15,620
(Je Yeon reads the postcard
in her room with the lights off.)

996
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,190
(He even rewrote the postcard
to express his feelings well.)

997
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,290
That's so pretty.

998
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:28,330
(He wrote his sincere heart
in the letter.)

999
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,000
(Focused)

1000
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,300
I don't know
who you wrote the postcard to.

1001
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,870
But will you tell me who it is?

1002
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,910
No.

1003
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,680
You wrote it to Woo Jae.

1004
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,210
- No.
- You did.

1005
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
I knew I was right.

1006
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,780
(Laughing)

1007
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,620
You're right. What about you?

1008
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,760
Me? I wrote it to Ha Neul.

1009
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,060
(Everyone freezes.)

1010
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,430
He wrote it to Ha Neul?

1011
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,800
(She can't understand him.)

1012
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,470
- What about Je Yeon?
- That can't be true.

1013
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,300
I don't understand
why he wrote it to Ha Neul.

1014
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Me too.

1015
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,640
On the last day...

1016
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,640
Because you made me upset.

1017
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,810
I made you upset on the last day?

1018
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,580
Well,
I can't say you made me upset, though.

1019
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,020
You didn't know how I felt about you.

1020
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,920
So I was doing everything on my own.

1021
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,390
What upset me was the present.

1022
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,560
(I see.)

1023
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
What is it?

1024
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,090
I had no idea.

1025
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,130
My goodness.

1026
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,870
I didn't think
I had a bright future with her.

1027
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,270
But you can't cut off someone
from your heart right away.

1028
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,370
I think if someone is out of my sight...

1029
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,740
and I cut off the things
I would do with her,

1030
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,810
she will leave my mind.

1031
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,650
So it was a way to do that too.

1032
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,880
I wanted to control my feelings...

1033
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,020
by writing a postcard to another person.

1034
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,950
And about the day Ha Neul gifted me.

1035
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,520
It was to express gratitude
for presenting me with a great day.

1036
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,060
After that...
I'm not sure if you remember this.

1037
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,230
I went to your room.

1038
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,740
Then, I saw you getting out of bed.

1039
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,340
That's when I regretted it.

1040
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,640
"Gosh. I've made a mistake."

1041
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,810
So I regretted it.

1042
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,980
I see.

1043
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,690
Before I had to go somewhere,

1044
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,990
I visited Je Yeon and Ha Neul's room.

1045
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,790
(Before going out,)

1046
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,530
(Ji Min visited
Je Yeon and Ha Neul's room.)

1047
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,570
(Hovering)

1048
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,080
Je Yeon was lying in her bed,

1049
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,940
and she got up with messy hair.

1050
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,380
She didn't have to, but she got up.

1051
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,650
Because I was interested in her,

1052
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,250
everything meant something to me.

1053
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,950
If she were tired,
she could've been in bed, lying down.

1054
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,690
But when I went in,
I'm not sure if she wanted to talk,

1055
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,790
but she got up.

1056
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,930
"It doesn't seem like
she has no interest in me at all."

1057
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,460
That's what I was thinking.

1058
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,000
And she looked so pretty when she got up.

1059
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,630
(Tired and messy)

1060
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,440
I thought it was a bed commercial.

1061
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,470
(To Ji Min,
it looked like a bed commercial.)

1062
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,310
Ji Min is falling for her again.

1063
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,840
(That day, Ji Min fell for Je Yeon.)

1064
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,850
(Is he enjoying this view?)

1065
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,120
(When they got back to Seoul,)

1066
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,650
(Ji Min kept looking at Je Yeon.)

1067
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,750
Hi.

1068
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,620
Hi.

1069
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,360
(After reading the postcard,)

1070
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,700
(Je Yeon looked out the window
for a while.)

1071
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,210
(What is she thinking about?)

1072
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,740
I'm so curious about how it will end.

1073
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,380
(The night felt longer than usual.)

1074
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,620
(The residents received a text message.)

1075
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,290
(A music box has arrived from Italy.)

1076
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,460
"The courtyard with the tree?"

1077
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,420
- It can't be.
- The postcards!

1078
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,890
Gosh, the postcards?

1079
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:17,930
(On their last night in Italy)

1080
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,800
(The residents wrote down
their sincere hearts in the postcards...)

1081
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,170
Gosh, that will cause a stir.

1082
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,200
(and put them in the music boxes.)

1083
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,610
(The music boxes
arrived at the Pairing House.)

1084
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,610
What do we do?

1085
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,150
(It has been a while.)

1086
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,490
(They are going to see
what they felt back then.)

1087
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,230
(Smiling)

1088
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,700
(Today, you'll meet the person
who wrote the postcard to you.)

1089
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,240
(Who wrote a postcard to me?)

1090
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,280
(How did we change after that?)

1091
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,840
- Gosh, this is unbelievable.
- My goodness.

1092
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,610
The postcards they wrote in Italy arrived.

1093
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,880
It's going to cause a stir.

1094
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,650
- Chang Hwan and Ji Won.
- Ji Won.

1095
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,390
Maybe, the misunderstandings between them
might be resolved with this.

1096
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,090
- It's going to be complicated.
- I know.

1097
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,220
It's like getting a letter
from your first love.

1098
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,230
It would be something like that.

1099
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,330
(They're in trouble.)

1100
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,330
(It's a new day.)

1101
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,670
(Woo Jae is getting ready to go out.)

1102
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,540
(A bakery cafe in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul)

1103
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,010
(He's waiting for someone alone.)

1104
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,150
(This morning)

1105
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,450
(A music box has arrived from Italy.)

1106
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,980
(Today, you'll meet the person
who wrote the postcard to you.)

1107
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,250
Gosh, who will it be?

1108
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,790
- It's from Italy, so it must be Je Yeon.
- It must be Je Yeon.

1109
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,960
(Fiddling with the postcard)

1110
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,060
Back then,
I wrote it after thinking so hard.

1111
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I thought how I felt in Italy would go on
even after we came back.

1112
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,080
(The person who took his heart in Italy)

1113
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,110
It's still the same.

1114
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,220
To me,
the one I had feelings for in Italy was...

1115
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,630
It was Je Yeon.

1116
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,630
Je Yeon was the one in my heart
when we were in Italy.

1117
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

1118
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

1119
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,370
(They were shy when they first met.)

1120
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,110
(They've been together since then.)

1121
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,780
It's Je Yeon.

1122
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,380
(Woo Jae's postcard pairing partner
is Je Yeon.)

1123
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,110
- You look bright today.
- What?

1124
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,250
You look bright today.

1125
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,620
- Of course.
- Yes.

1126
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,290
The two wrote to each other.

1127
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,320
- So they were paired.
- They were paired.

1128
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
I guess they can only meet
if they are paired.

1129
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,060
I wonder what it would feel like.

1130
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,330
- I know.
- If that happened to me...

1131
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,530
I think it would feel like
meeting your ex.

1132
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,700
(Would it feel like meeting your ex?)

1133
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,460
(Glancing)

1134
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,900
(Looking away)

1135
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,440
- They feel awkward.
- Right.

1136
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,110
Did you expect this?

1137
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,510
A little bit.

1138
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,840
Did you expect this?

1139
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,350
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

1140
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
How have you been?

1141
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,190
Gosh, it's so funny.

1142
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,920
(It feels different from
when they were in Italy.)

1143
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,030
It's been a while since we met outside.

1144
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,560
- Right. It's been a while.
- Yes. It's been a while.

1145
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,300
If you had talked to me a lot
for the past four weeks,

1146
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,900
you would've been talking
with the accent a lot.

1147
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,470
Am I not using my accent?

1148
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,840
- You do a bit, but...
- I do have a little, right?

1149
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,740
But still...

1150
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,710
You know, I had my first
contract relationship with Ji Min,

1151
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,880
- and the second one with Sang Yun.
- Oh, right.

1152
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
And both of them are...

1153
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,920
- from Gyeongsang Province.
- Right.

1154
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,950
Right. You already...

1155
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,660
You must've talked with an accent
when you were with Sang Yun.

1156
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,720
- Right.
- Of course.

1157
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,760
I gave up.

1158
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,290
- You did? Don't give up.
- I gave up.

1159
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,100
Say, "iced Americano."

1160
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,860
IA.

1161
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,330
(She was careful
not to have an accent in Italy.)

1162
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,540
- It's all right.
- Are you sure?

1163
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:26,070
(A lot of time has passed.)

1164
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,910
This morning,

1165
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,580
I heard the song...

1166
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,720
from the music box
after such a long time...

1167
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
Right.

1168
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,060
I started reminiscing.
I had forgotten about it.

1169
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,290
I thought, "Oh, I wrote these."

1170
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,960
I also read it again,

1171
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,800
and it reminded me of those days.

1172
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,670
- Right.
- Right.

1173
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,970
I don't know if you feel the way I did,

1174
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,740
but the whole time in Italy,

1175
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,010
I spent all the moments with you.

1176
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,810
(Nodding)

1177
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,920
That was poetic.

1178
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,350
So, when I think of Italy,

1179
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
I think of you, Je Yeon.

1180
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,060
(They were always together in Italy.)

1181
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,690
That's beautiful.

1182
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,030
I thought about you
when I opened the music box.

1183
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,870
- Right.
- It reminded me of you.

1184
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,930
- It did.
- Right?

1185
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Yes.

1186
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,310
He was the first one that Je Yeon was...

1187
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,670
- interested in.
- Right.

1188
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,150
On the last day,

1189
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,450
everything was...

1190
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,580
beautiful, you know.

1191
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,690
Yes,
I think that was the most beautiful part.

1192
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,960
- Right.
- There weren't too many people,

1193
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,590
and the streets were pretty.

1194
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,590
- Right.
- I remember saying,

1195
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,860
"I feel like the main character
in a movie."

1196
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,040
It feels like a dream to me.

1197
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,950
I think those emotions were reflected
in the postcard.

1198
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,120
- This was on our last day, after all.
- Right.

1199
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
Yes.

1200
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,180
Shouldn't we...

1201
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,550
- exchange our postcards?
- We should.

1202
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,550
It's time.

1203
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,330
(They finally exchange...)

1204
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,590
(their postcards.)

1205
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,930
I'll read it.

1206
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,200
(They take their time to read about
the memories of that day.)

1207
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,140
(Going back to their emotions in the past)

1208
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,340
(To Woo Jae. Thanks to you,)

1209
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,510
(I won't be able to forget
this trip to Italy.)

1210
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,510
This was written by Je Yeon.

1211
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,550
(Thank you for being considerate.)

1212
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,750
(I hope we can take time
to get to know...)

1213
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,020
(each other's true selves
when we return to Korea.)

1214
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,050
(From Je Yeon.)

1215
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,690
I was thankful for the most part.

1216
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,590
From the first conversation we had
until the end.

1217
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,800
He's always been considerate,

1218
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,430
and I could tell that he had cared for me.

1219
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,300
He was very nice.

1220
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,170
(To Je Yeon.
It took us quite some time...)

1221
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,970
(to feel comfortable around each other
as we were both shy,)

1222
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,680
(but I never found our dates
uncomfortable or tiring.)

1223
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,210
(I think you and I have
the same energy level.)

1224
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,120
(Also, I was glad that I could...)

1225
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,850
(talk to you the most in Florence.)

1226
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,350
(I hope we can share happy moments
when we're in Seoul. From Woo Jae.)

1227
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,490
They both mentioned future possibilities
in Seoul at the time.

1228
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,290
Je Yeon takes up most of my memories...

1229
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,160
in Italy.

1230
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,500
She was the first one I met,

1231
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,370
and she was the one I spent time with...

1232
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,970
at such a gorgeous place.

1233
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,710
You could say that all my time in Italy...

1234
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,680
was with Je Yeon.

1235
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,250
I really enjoyed our conversations,

1236
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,620
and they made me excited.

1237
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,250
And she...

1238
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,590
(Can I hold you?)

1239
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,420
held onto my arm

1240
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,490
We walked down really slowly too.

1241
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
My heart...

1242
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,070
fluttered at that moment.

1243
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,300
I tried to deliver those emotions...

1244
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,270
in the postcard.

1245
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,610
The moment of writing it comes back to you
when you read it.

1246
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,680
Yes.

1247
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,350
It made my heart flutter.

1248
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,990
It feels weird reading your honorifics.

1249
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,050
- Right?
- It's so strange.

1250
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,320
- You seem to like tildes.
- What?

1251
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,330
- Tildes. The character.
- Oh, tildes.

1252
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,100
Don't you use it often in text messages?

1253
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
I do.

1254
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,860
(Good night. Good luck tomorrow.)

1255
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,670
- Every time I saw a tilde, I thought,
- That's funny.

1256
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,640
- "It sounds like Je Yeon."
- Did you?

1257
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,610
How did you feel while you were back here?

1258
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,280
Everything, including the background,
is different...

1259
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,320
from Italy.

1260
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,020
(Squirming)

1261
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,560
Well,

1262
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,760
the emotions you feel
when you're traveling...

1263
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,900
and the emotions you feel
in your daily life in Korea...

1264
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,770
- They're different, right?
- They were very different,

1265
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,140
- Right.
- I guess.

1266
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,400
- I think you're right.
- Yes.

1267
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,970
That means a lot.

1268
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,340
All you can talk about
when you're on a trip...

1269
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,080
are tourist spots and food.

1270
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,520
You know, those things.

1271
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,220
It's limited.

1272
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,120
But in Korea,
rather than talking about that,

1273
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,360
I got to talk more about my everyday life.

1274
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,690
Right.

1275
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:49,460
I felt different in Italy...

1276
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,930
and in Korea.

1277
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,840
Yes.

1278
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,370
I realized that we may have
different futures in mind...

1279
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,840
regarding our everyday life.

1280
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,140
Woo Jae can be...

1281
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,780
relaxed.

1282
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,620
It seemed he had few desires.

1283
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,920
That's true.

1284
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,850
But...

1285
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,160
the way I treat life...

1286
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,290
could be a bit different.

1287
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,360
So, it would have been tougher...

1288
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,530
to make up for that in our everyday life.

1289
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,210
I used to think that we were more similar,

1290
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,110
but I realized that we might not be.

1291
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,540
Do you think...

1292
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,180
you've found...

1293
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,820
a sense of direction now?

1294
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,380
Direction?

1295
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,050
Have you almost found it?

1296
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,890
I've thought about it a lot,

1297
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,560
and I've been trying
to be honest with my feelings.

1298
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,030
Spending time with that mindset,

1299
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,630
I believe I came to find...

1300
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,800
a sense of direction as well.

1301
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,550
I have a lot to thank him for,

1302
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,950
so I hoped that he'd be happy with Ji Won.

1303
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,060
Thanks to you,
I have such good memories of Italy.

1304
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,830
So do I.

1305
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:31,900
The memories of that time...

1306
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,570
mean a lot to me and are beautiful...

1307
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,410
because I got to spend it with you.

1308
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,780
"Thank you for being considerate."

1309
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,050
- Don't read it out loud.
- Okay.

1310
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,020
I won't.

1311
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,360
But so were you.
You were very considerate.

1312
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,530
- I felt that you were being thoughtful.
- Did you?

1313
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,860
So,

1314
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,900
I was also thankful.

1315
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,930
- Really?
- Yes.

1316
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,670
Doesn't it feel like this postcard
came from a faraway land?

1317
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,410
- It did come from a faraway land.
- It hasn't even been that long.

1318
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,410
That's true.

1319
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,910
- It's a trip down memory lane.
- It is.

1320
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,710
- I'm Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae?

1321
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,750
- Woo Jae.
- Yes.

1322
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,650
(The moment they first heard
each other's names)

1323
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,380
- It gets better as I chew it.
- Yes.

1324
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,650
- You eat better, now that you're outside.
- I do.

1325
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,390
(The moments they shared,
getting to know each other)

1326
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,260
How do you speak so well when we're alone?

1327
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:33,860
I think...

1328
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,230
I feel the most comfortable...

1329
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,800
when the other person
matches my energy level.

1330
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,100
I remember.

1331
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,540
(It will only be a beautiful memory now.)

1332
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,640
My memories of Italy...

1333
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,040
seem...

1334
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,080
- beautiful.
- Yes.

1335
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,980
- That's how I'll remember it.
- Same.

1336
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,620
- I don't think I'll be able to forget it.
- Me neither.

1337
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,690
- Forever.
- Yes.

1338
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,890
Thank you so much.

1339
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:08,700
(Their memories
are now held in two postcards.)

1340
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,970
- It's a distant memory now.
- It is.

1341
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:13,970
Right.

1342
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,700
I'm sorry to say this, but in retrospect,

1343
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,570
she was way more attracted to Woo Jae
than to Ji Min.

1344
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,080
- Yes.
- Yes, way more.

1345
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,480
- Her look when Woo Jae entered.
- Exactly.

1346
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,980
I'll never forget that.

1347
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,380
I think there's a fantastical element...

1348
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:28,380
- that comes from a trip.
- Yes.

1349
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,090
It tends to beautify the other person.

1350
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,290
It does.

1351
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,560
But Woo Jae and Je Yeon in Italy...

1352
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,130
looked like they were in a movie.

1353
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,190
Indeed.

1354
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,700
And there's a saying
that I wrote on my refrigerator.

1355
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,570
"Love in real life
shouldn't be like a movie."

1356
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,370
"It should feel more like a journal."

1357
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,700
I had read it from a book and written it.

1358
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,840
So when I'm falling in love,
and it feels like I'm in a movie,

1359
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,240
I hope that time passes...

1360
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,740
so that the journal-like days
can come soon.

1361
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,710
(You're right.)

1362
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,720
(A bakery cafe in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul)

1363
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,320
(Chang Hwan is waiting for someone.)

1364
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,490
(Who is he waiting for?)

1365
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,530
I think we have similar lifestyles.

1366
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,800
I'm very curious.

1367
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,500
(The person he spent time with
back in Italy)

1368
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,570
- Did you know it was me?
- Well...

1369
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,040
- A little?
- A little.

1370
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,240
- They were such a good match.
- Yes, without any prejudices.

1371
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,720
(Chang Hwan's postcard...)

1372
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,890
(was for Ji Won.)

1373
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,690
(Was Ji Won's postcard
for Chang Hwan too?)

1374
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,770
Oh, my gosh!

1375
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,170
Chang Hwan.

1376
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,840
- Goodness. Hi.
- Goodness.

1377
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,070
Take a seat.

1378
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,510
Sit.

1379
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,110
Do you want to take off your coat?

1380
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,780
I'll hang it behind you.

1381
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,790
They do need to clear things up.

1382
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,190
- Right.
- They grew apart...

1383
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,920
- so suddenly.
- Right.

1384
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,260
- It's nice to see you.
- It is.

1385
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,600
- It's been so long since we last met.
- Right.

1386
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,800
- It feels different.
- I know.

1387
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,140
Meeting you again
after we've gotten closer,

1388
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,370
- it feels different.
- Right.

1389
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,740
(Glancing)

1390
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,370
- This is right next to my house.
- Is it?

1391
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,180
I always come here on a bicycle.

1392
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:36,880
This is a hanok village.

1393
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,710
- I know. It was beautiful.
- Yes.

1394
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:43,020
I saw that mountain as soon as I got here,
and it was fabulous.

1395
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,590
- That one? That's Mount Bukhan.
- Is it?

1396
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,590
(They exchange small talk.)

1397
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,460
The postcard...

1398
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,660
- The postcard?
- Yes.

1399
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,790
Should we exchange them?

1400
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,430
But I'm regretting it.

1401
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,200
- Why?
- It's supposed to be...

1402
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,300
a serious postcard,

1403
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,940
- but I'm afraid I made it too playful.
- Really?

1404
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,540
- Here.
- This is my postcard.

1405
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,640
Thank you.

1406
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,770
I wonder how they felt when they wrote it.

1407
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,310
Did you draw this?

1408
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,720
Yes. I traced it.

1409
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,280
(No way.)

1410
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,420
What is it?

1411
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,790
- Oh, the fish-shaped buns!
- The fish-shaped buns.

1412
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,460
- I traced the image,
- Yes.

1413
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,060
but it got weirder as I added things,
so I stopped.

1414
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,990
(He copied the drawing
of fish-shaped buns...)

1415
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,060
(from Ji Won's Pairing Book.)

1416
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,100
But you drew it so well.

1417
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,000
I was going like this,
but it got stranger.

1418
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,840
So, I decided to stop.

1419
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,670
- I wanted to color it, but...
- No, I recognized it instantly.

1420
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,110
I noticed I was ruining it.

1421
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,240
This is so nice.

1422
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,410
We never got to try these.

1423
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,420
I know.

1424
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,720
(From Chang Hwan. I wish
we can get to know each other...)

1425
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,960
(by eating fish-shaped buns,
pork belly, and tripe.)

1426
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,590
He wrote that?

1427
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,690
(The promise they failed to keep)

1428
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,090
(Eating fish-shaped buns,
pork belly, and tripe)

1429
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,030
You guys should eat them after this date.

1430
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,170
This breaks my heart the most.

1431
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,300
- It's heartbreaking.
- They couldn't eat the buns...

1432
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,340
right after the introductions.

1433
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,810
(It's sad, but it's the truth.)

1434
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,040
This is so sad.

1435
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:17,980
Were you...

1436
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,650
expecting anyone?

1437
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,850
Yes. I was...

1438
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,460
I did have a feeling...

1439
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,960
on my way here.

1440
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,460
But I was thrilled...

1441
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,070
by the thought
of finally being able to talk to you.

1442
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,700
So, I was delighted when I came here.

1443
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,600
- Really?
- Yes. I mean it.

1444
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,670
That's good.

1445
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,810
So, I...

1446
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:53,210
actually told the other men...

1447
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,550
and one of the guys...

1448
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,790
I became friends with,

1449
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,890
- about it.
- Okay.

1450
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,520
That I wanted to talk to you.

1451
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,890
- Really?
- Yes.

1452
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,890
And...

1453
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,430
it wasn't like...

1454
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,560
- anything happened to us...
- Right.

1455
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,300
- or like we fought.
- Right.

1456
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,000
But...

1457
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,070
things were different
in Korea and in Florence.

1458
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,200
- So...
- Right.

1459
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,070
I wondered what you were thinking,

1460
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,810
so I wanted to hear your honest thoughts.

1461
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,750
- He wanted to hear them?
- Tell him.

1462
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,920
But I...

1463
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,520
When I returned to Korea...

1464
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,930
and revealed my age and job,

1465
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,700
I noticed that you were
keeping a distance from me.

1466
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,760
You know.

1467
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,970
I thought,
"Does he want nothing to do with me?"

1468
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,810
(That night, Ji Won didn't get
a text message from Chang Hwan.)

1469
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,980
But I believe part of the reason...

1470
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,510
was that he saw her reaction.

1471
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,250
- Chang Hwan saw it.
- Yes, they felt it...

1472
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,450
simultaneously.

1473
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,420
We revealed our ages and jobs...

1474
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,660
- on the first day, right?
- Yes.

1475
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,560
I was surprised, to be honest.

1476
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,790
But I'm sure you were even more surprised.

1477
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,590
- Right.
- I'm sure.

1478
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,160
You must have thought, "What?"

1479
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,470
I'm sure you were surprised.
I perfectly understand.

1480
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,540
But...

1481
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,270
- to tell you the truth...
- Yes?

1482
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,780
I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable
by being with me.

1483
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,980
So, he'd rather distance himself.

1484
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,500
You looked...

1485
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,170
- so beautiful, nice, and pure, but...
- Yes.

1486
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,040
It was sad on the one hand, and...

1487
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,740
He's about to cry. Oh, no.

1488
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,110
His feelings for her were genuine.

1489
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:08,280
(He's at a loss for words
as he's getting emotional.)

1490
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,120
He behaved that way
because he truly liked her.

1491
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,320
Right.

1492
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,330
I was born...

1493
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,630
in 1999.

1494
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,500
I had so much on my mind,
and I had mixed feelings.

1495
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,400
I was pretty shocked too.

1496
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,440
I couldn't decide...

1497
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,980
whether to talk to her right away...

1498
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,650
or wait another day
to talk to her naturally.

1499
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,950
Right.

1500
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,190
But as time passed,

1501
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,660
her misunderstanding must have grown.

1502
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,760
This is tricky.

1503
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:56,230
(The misunderstanding grew bigger
as they were hesitating.)

1504
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,330
It would have been nicer...

1505
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:02,240
if I had talked to her, albeit briefly,
over a cup of tea or something.

1506
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,380
I felt bad...

1507
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,650
for not telling her sooner.

1508
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,620
You said that you noticed that
I've been distancing myself...

1509
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,860
ever since we revealed our ages and jobs.

1510
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,190
I'm sure everyone thought...

1511
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,130
that I was keeping a distance.

1512
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,360
All the male participants...

1513
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,700
are competent, considerate,
and well-mannered.

1514
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,470
We all know that.

1515
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,040
I wanted to stop thinking about that,

1516
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,040
but it had to be a competition,
even though we lived together.

1517
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,310
I was conflicted for the 1st 2 days.

1518
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,510
I wouldn't say I was tormented.

1519
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,050
I just had a lot to process.

1520
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,280
And that's how time passed.

1521
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:54,360
Naturally,
you grew feelings for someone else.

1522
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,790
And...

1523
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,890
I was struggling.

1524
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,000
For about 2 to 3 days...

1525
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,000
after I moved into the house,

1526
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,070
I spent my days by myself,

1527
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,740
pondering about what to do.

1528
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,880
He was lost.

1529
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,920
I was overwhelmed
by my thoughts and confusion.

1530
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,150
So,

1531
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,660
I missed that timing.

1532
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,090
And it led to her...

1533
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,660
having to go on a date
with someone else...

1534
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,630
as it was the weekend.

1535
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:39,570
(In the meantime,
another man was standing next to Ji Won.)

1536
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,270
It was almost a month ago,

1537
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,070
- and it's still haunting him.
- As if it were yesterday.

1538
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,870
- He must have suffered so much.
- Right.

1539
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,070
(It's heartbreaking.)

1540
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,510
The air was different
when you two were together.

1541
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,640
It was very different.

1542
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,310
He's been keeping an eye on her.

1543
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,850
I knew...

1544
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,080
that Woo Jae has always been...

1545
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,550
thoughtful and dependent.

1546
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,660
But he's become more thoughtful.

1547
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,490
And the same thing happened to you.

1548
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,430
You seemed to have...

1549
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,630
How should I put it? You seemed to have...

1550
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,300
loosened up a lot.
I mean that in a good way.

1551
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:15,700
From the way you walked and behaved,

1552
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,710
I could tell that you were carefree.

1553
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:24,310
It looked like
you had let go of the pressure.

1554
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,650
So, when I...

1555
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,320
watched the two of you together,

1556
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,190
it gave me an odd, yet happy sensation.

1557
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,030
That sounds fun.

1558
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,960
(Chang Hwan has been watching her
from a step away.)

1559
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,330
I've been dying...

1560
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,140
to tell you this.

1561
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,910
Right.

1562
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:59,010
I'm thankful just for telling me...

1563
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,220
how you feel.

1564
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,790
I didn't realize
how much I could regret...

1565
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,890
missing what we could have been.

1566
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,700
I think I felt that
for the first time in my life.

1567
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,700
It was like...

1568
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:23,070
I knew that she was a good person,
but I had to give up on her.

1569
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,240
That's close to how I felt.

1570
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,670
He really liked her.

1571
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,740
In Italy,

1572
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,610
we treated each other
as the person that we were.

1573
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,880
We spent a lot of time together.

1574
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,380
I really liked...

1575
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,020
our time together.

1576
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,930
I was happy to get to know
who you truly were.

1577
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,530
And you were a good person.

1578
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,700
Thank you.

1579
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,470
(To Chang Hwan.
I was happy to get to know you...)

1580
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,670
(as a person,
regardless of your age and occupation.)

1581
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,300
(I'd like to talk with you more
about other things in Seoul.)

1582
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,370
To us,

1583
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,540
it became a good memory.

1584
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,580
I agree.

1585
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,180
Even if I go back in time, back then,

1586
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,950
I made the right choice.

1587
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:14,560
I did my best,
and I have no doubt about it.

1588
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,120
I really...

1589
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,490
wanted to talk a lot...

1590
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,260
with the person I was interested in.

1591
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,100
That's what I felt back then.

1592
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,910
(In Italy)

1593
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:36,710
(the person that they wanted
to spend time with)

1594
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:37,750
That sounds good.

1595
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,980
I will keep it forever.

1596
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,820
It will be an unforgettable memory...

1597
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,020
- that I feel proud of.
- Seriously.

1598
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,960
Let's eat this together.

1599
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,960
Of course.
(I wish we can get to know each other...)

1600
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,990
(by eating fish-shaped buns,
pork belly, and tripe.)

1601
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,330
It's in the movie "About Time."

1602
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:53,590
- Which one?
- "About Time."

1603
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,200
- A photo here would come out well.
- It's pretty.

1604
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,000
Do you want one of my gloves?

1605
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,140
- It's cute. It looks like a hat.
- Right.

1606
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,280
How about going this way?

1607
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,250
- How about back there?
- That sounds good.

1608
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:17,050
(Their time together in Italy
became a beautiful memory.)

1609
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,050
(Is it going to end like this?)

1610
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,090
- It's heartbreaking.
- Chang Hwan liked her a lot.

1611
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,160
He liked her a lot,
and she meant a lot to him.

1612
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,530
The moment when they revealed
their age and occupation...

1613
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:29,360
- was very damaging for him.
- Yes.

1614
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,070
In reality,
they were both equally surprised.

1615
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,500
For Ji Won, it felt...

1616
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,070
- like he had suddenly disappeared.
- Exactly.

1617
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,470
In some ways, they're very similar.

1618
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,810
That's why they were in parallel
without crossing paths.

1619
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:46,150
In the end,
their relationship ended without hassle...

1620
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,410
because of Chang Hwan's behavior.

1621
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,050
- Right.
- I think...

1622
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,320
it was possible because he cared...

1623
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,820
- Definitely.
- deeply for Ji Won.

1624
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,820
It happened...

1625
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,190
- because he cared deeply for her.
- That's why it turned out like this.

1626
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,390
Exactly.

1627
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,890
I'm sure many people rooted
for Chang Hwan and Ji Won.

1628
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,100
That includes me.

1629
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,370
(Looking around)

1630
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,810
- What are you doing?
- Hi.

1631
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,540
How is the house so clean?

1632
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,780
The air feels very clean.
Did you clean up?

1633
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,180
The weather didn't seem nice today,

1634
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,680
so I left the air purifier on
before going out.

1635
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,880
Despite how spacious it is,

1636
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,420
the air purifier functioned very well.

1637
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,290
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1638
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,790
The design is also very pretty.

1639
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,960
(Thanks to it,
it became pleasant in the house.)

1640
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,730
(The evening when everyone got off work)

1641
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:37,430
(Walking somewhere)

1642
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,000
She looks so beautiful.

1643
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,170
(Ha Neul is walking somewhere.)

1644
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,070
(This morning)

1645
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,810
(Smiling brightly)

1646
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,650
(Ha Neul reads the postcard
that she wrote in Italy.)

1647
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,250
- She wrote to Chan Hyeong.
- To Chan Hyeong.

1648
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:01,920
(And the person who sent her the postcard)

1649
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:07,390
(She's going to meet
her postcard pairing partner.)

1650
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,800
(Will it be someone
that she's hoping for?)

1651
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,200
Ji Min.

1652
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:17,370
- Hi.
- Aren't you cold?

1653
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,380
- Hi. No.
- Did it take you a long time?

1654
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,740
(Ha Neul's postcard pairing partner
is Ji Min.)

1655
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,280
Did you come here right after work?

1656
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,280
Yes.

1657
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,280
(A wine bar in Seongdong-gu, Seoul)

1658
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,720
What would you like to eat?

1659
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,520
I need some meat.

1660
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,350
- Let's get an order of grilled ribs.
- Okay.

1661
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,760
- How about some pasta?
- Okay.

1662
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,590
Is there only aglio e olio?

1663
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,230
Shall we get aglio e olio?

1664
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,790
- Yes, I like it.
- Me too.

1665
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,060
I can order more since I'm hungry,

1666
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,330
but let's order 2 1st.

1667
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,330
Okay.

1668
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,830
What would you like to drink?

1669
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,000
Do you want red or white wine?

1670
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,170
You like white wine, don't you?

1671
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,010
Yes, let's get white wine.

1672
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,310
Can we please order?

1673
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,320
- Did you expect us to get paired?
- No.

1674
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,490
You looked like you were expecting it
as you came in.

1675
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:07,650
- Here's a hand warmer.
- I mean...

1676
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,790
Thank you.

1677
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,820
This is unexpected.

1678
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,030
I talked to other people
before coming here.

1679
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,630
- It's because...
- So you knew, right?

1680
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,260
I found out this morning.

1681
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,330
This morning?

1682
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,530
I didn't expect you
to write me the postcard.

1683
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,570
Why not?

1684
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,540
You thought that
you'd be home alone tonight?

1685
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,540
Well, yes.

1686
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,080
Even if...

1687
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,180
we had not been paired,
we could've come out for dinner.

1688
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,280
Right.

1689
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,750
Surprisingly,

1690
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,250
- it overlapped with our dinner date.
- Right.

1691
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,420
(Knocking)

1692
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,820
- Yes?
- Yes?

1693
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,360
Ji Min.

1694
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,230
- Let's eat together.
- Okay.

1695
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,960
I had a dinner date with you tonight,

1696
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,930
so I was thinking only about that.

1697
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,370
But today, the postcard...

1698
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,500
- Was it written on there?
- I was told that the person...

1699
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,040
who wrote me the postcard
was on her way here.

1700
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,410
(This morning)

1701
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,880
(Ji Min also read the postcard.)

1702
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,050
He looks flustered.

1703
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:08,750
(Ji Min also read the postcard.)

1704
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,250
So you must've been expecting me a little.

1705
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,890
There was something you did
in Florence on Friday.

1706
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,390
It was intense.

1707
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,600
I'll make you feel more energized.

1708
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:26,030
Don't think of me as your female friend.

1709
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,570
(Feeling dizzy)

1710
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:30,440
If you didn't write me the postcard
after what you did,

1711
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,540
it'd make you strange.

1712
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,110
- What?
- You're strange already.

1713
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,580
Why am I strange?

1714
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,380
To be honest, I was expecting you.

1715
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,380
I didn't expect it to be you at all.

1716
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,590
If the others hadn't told me,

1717
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,750
I wouldn't have expected it.

1718
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,320
I said,
"What? Ji Min sent me the postcard?"

1719
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,320
- Right.
- Yes.

1720
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:54,960
I was 100 percent sure that
you didn't write to me.

1721
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,630
Ji Min is only interested in Je Yeon.

1722
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,730
- Right.
- Right.

1723
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,500
To whom did you think I wrote?

1724
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,570
To Je Yeon.

1725
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,140
That's understandable.

1726
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:05,110
Was I into her since Italy?

1727
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,110
Yes, that's why I told you then.

1728
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,480
Did you tell me not to care
only about Je Yeon?

1729
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,550
Right.

1730
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,780
He remembers everything.

1731
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,850
Please don't make me jealous.

1732
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,320
But...

1733
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,090
And?

1734
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,660
Did I take care of Je Yeon a lot?

1735
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,360
You disagree?

1736
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,130
I'm curious about how you feel.

1737
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,500
- About what?
- Excuse me.

1738
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1739
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,800
Enjoy.

1740
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,070
Ji Min looks slightly nervous.

1741
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,910
What did we say?

1742
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,710
You're not trying to be evasive, are you?

1743
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,710
No.

1744
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,450
I'm curious about how you feel.

1745
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,580
- How I feel?
- Yes.

1746
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,020
You know how I feel.

1747
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,120
I do.

1748
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:58,930
So am I right?

1749
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,890
Do you want to verify it?

1750
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,300
Yes.

1751
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,730
It's because...

1752
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,440
You're the only one
I didn't get to talk to in Seoul.

1753
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,940
Right. She was disappointed by that.

1754
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,380
- Since we came back from Florence?
- Yes.

1755
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,050
I thought that we had
a great time together...

1756
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,320
on our last day in Florence.

1757
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,490
Back in Seoul, I felt a huge wall...

1758
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,520
between you and me.

1759
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,660
I felt that there was a wall.

1760
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,100
So I felt slightly uncomfortable...

1761
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,230
around you.

1762
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,100
- Knock, knock.
- Yes?

1763
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,370
Let's go.

1764
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,470
(Flinching)

1765
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,370
Oh, no.

1766
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:50,880
We had such a good time on our last day.

1767
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,780
I wondered a lot about
why I felt uncomfortable around you here.

1768
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,050
So I thought that you were...

1769
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,650
drawing a line between us.

1770
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,360
At the steak house,

1771
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,130
did you say that I was aloof?

1772
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,660
- Right.
- That too.

1773
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,830
I was being honest.

1774
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,000
You're so aloof.

1775
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,400
I am?

1776
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,340
(Ha Neul was expressing
her hurt feelings.)

1777
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,710
She expressed her feelings a lot.

1778
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:20,710
Why would I be aloof to you?

1779
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,940
I thought that you were being aloof...

1780
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:27,610
in order to draw a line between us.

1781
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,720
That's not true at all.

1782
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,690
As you know, when we came back to Seoul,

1783
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,190
I spent a lot of time with Je Yeon.

1784
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,490
That's what happened.

1785
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:43,860
I didn't draw a line
or build a wall between us.

1786
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,930
Why would I? You're a good person.

1787
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,400
I'll be honest.

1788
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,570
I had a good time with you that day.

1789
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,740
I was very grateful to you too.

1790
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,050
I was revisiting Florence after ten years.

1791
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,810
Back then, it felt like I was leaving
with an unpleasant memory.

1792
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:04,120
(After his date with Je Yeon,)

1793
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,690
(Ji Min had a lot on his mind.)

1794
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,160
I was very grateful to you...

1795
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,630
for ending my trip pleasantly.

1796
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,000
That's how I felt, to be honest.

1797
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,230
(He expresses his gratitude
that he didn't have a chance to share.)

1798
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1799
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,370
- It looks really good.
- It looks delicious.

1800
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,140
I wonder how they will talk to each other.

1801
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,140
Enjoy your food.

1802
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,710
Let's eat. I'm very hungry.

1803
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,450
How is it? Is it good?

1804
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,090
Among beef cuts,

1805
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,790
I like ribs
even more than sirloin or tenderloin.

1806
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,290
This restaurant has experience.

1807
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,160
It's delicious.

1808
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,700
I think I'm gaining weight on the show.

1809
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,670
- Did I gain weight?
- No.

1810
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,800
You look better than before.

1811
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,240
(Flustered)

1812
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:03,880
(Ha Neul's flirting came out of nowhere.)

1813
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:10,080
(What's on Ji Min's mind right now?)

1814
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,320
You're on my mind a lot.

1815
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,190
- What?
- You're on my mind a lot.

1816
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,320
- Why?
- I thought...

1817
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,960
that I had shown my interest in you a lot.

1818
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,000
Was it...

1819
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,600
the day after we returned to Seoul?

1820
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,070
I suggested picking you up.

1821
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,840
- I know.
- I was showing my interest in you.

1822
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:34,140
(She mustered up the courage
to suggest a carpool date.)

1823
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,780
Tomorrow...

1824
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,780
I was planning to work late tomorrow.

1825
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,750
Goodness, that must sting her a little.

1826
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,280
I didn't think...

1827
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,720
you recognized my feelings,
so I felt a bit hurt.

1828
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:53,090
This is so difficult.

1829
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,300
I understand how Ji Min feels.

1830
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,470
I will be honest with you.

1831
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,370
Yes, tell her honestly.

1832
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,050
Of course, I noticed that
you were being attentive to me.

1833
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,380
I know that.

1834
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,280
Until now,

1835
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:20,320
all my attention was on Je Yeon.

1836
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,490
Now...

1837
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:30,430
I was struggling a lot,
trying to hold myself together.

1838
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,470
So I didn't have the capacity...

1839
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:36,600
to notice your feelings.

1840
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,070
I didn't have the time.

1841
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,810
I know. It seemed difficult for you.

1842
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:49,220
It's hard to understand. It's complicated.

1843
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,990
It's not just complicated, Ji Min.

1844
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,420
When you suggested going out for dinner,
it made things complicated too.

1845
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,290
Do you prefer that I don't ask?

1846
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,700
That's not what I mean.

1847
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,540
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

1848
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,810
I keep wanting to see you happy.

1849
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,040
- So it's complicated.
- He's honest.

1850
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,320
I knew that you were having a hard time.

1851
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,490
I also knew that
you felt a mix of emotions.

1852
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,060
- How did you know?
- Because I think about you.

1853
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,130
Ha Neul feels it too.

1854
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:36,330
(During the 2nd contract relationship)

1855
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,970
(Ji Min had a lot on his mind.)

1856
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:40,470
I had a really great time,

1857
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,340
but Ji Min seemed...

1858
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:43,970
Did he look bitter?

1859
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,240
- Can you tell?
- Yes.

1860
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:52,080
Other people may think...

1861
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,650
that you're a fun person, but...

1862
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,220
(Wincing)

1863
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,520
Don't say that.

1864
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:01,720
- Why not?
- It's hard to deal with.

1865
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,590
Should I stay quiet?

1866
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,230
No, that's not what I mean.

1867
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:11,530
I just thought that you were
turning away from my true feelings.

1868
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,500
I wasn't turning away from them.
I know how you feel,

1869
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,070
but I just didn't have the capacity.

1870
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,210
You're a bad boy.

1871
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:26,180
Aren't you a bad boy?

1872
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,020
So I was disappointed in you.

1873
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,550
I see.

1874
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,490
You've hurt me plenty of times.

1875
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,230
I can talk about them all night long.

1876
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,000
Shall we talk all night?

1877
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,030
Gosh, you're really...

1878
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,000
However,

1879
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,940
I didn't want this.

1880
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,040
You're busy getting to know the person
you're interested in.

1881
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,310
So I didn't want to...

1882
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,180
confuse you either.

1883
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,090
I thought that once you've sorted out
your feelings,

1884
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,020
you'd be willing to talk with me.

1885
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,660
(She waited quietly for the day
to talk to him face-to-face.)

1886
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,990
That's what was on my mind.
You didn't know, did you?

1887
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,300
You knew, didn't you?

1888
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,100
You knew, didn't you?

1889
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:20,800
Ha Neul needed to have
this conversation at this point.

1890
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,500
Thank you for telling me that.

1891
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,670
I can see...

1892
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,880
that you struggled too.

1893
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,080
Do you understand how I feel now?

1894
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,790
This is so difficult.

1895
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:42,190
Ji Min probably sees himself
in Ha Neul right now.

1896
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,060
You seemed quite overwhelmed.

1897
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,030
Yes, I'm a little pathetic.

1898
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,700
No, you're not.

1899
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,760
You're just honest with your feelings.

1900
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,970
Shall we read the postcards?

1901
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,540
- Ha Neul, I feel very embarrassed.
- Me too.

1902
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:03,040
Did you write a long message?

1903
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,710
In my case, yes.

1904
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,910
What did they write?

1905
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,550
Gosh, it's very long.

1906
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,450
You wrote in honorifics.

1907
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:19,230
I remember how it was back then.

1908
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,090
She must feel nostalgic.

1909
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,730
(To Ha Neul. Thank you very much...)

1910
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,100
It must be a special memory for them.

1911
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:26,830
It would be unforgettable.

1912
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,870
(for making me relive my memories
of Florence from 10 years ago.)

1913
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:28,970
(I never imagined myself reliving it.)

1914
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,100
(Let's spend the rest
of the time well together.)

1915
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,600
Did you see my drawing of the sky?

1916
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:33,310
- You drew the sky too.
- Yes.

1917
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,410
(To Ji Min. Hello,
it's quite embarrassing to write to you.)

1918
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:35,580
(It was my first time in Italy.)

1919
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,680
(The last romantic night here
will be unforgettable.)

1920
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,850
I was very grateful for the day...

1921
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:44,120
Ha Neul spent with me. It was like a gift.

1922
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:45,850
(Thanks to you, Italy was amazing.)

1923
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,690
(Thank you for making me feel this way.
It's been a long time.)

1924
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:48,820
(Let's get to know each other more.)

1925
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,020
(Let's go to an izakaya together!)

1926
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:52,360
We should go to an izakaya.

1927
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,300
(Gazing silently)

1928
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,530
Your handwriting is very pretty.

1929
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,700
I'm grateful that we wrote to each other.

1930
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,270
It also led us to have this conversation.

1931
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,310
A weight has been lifted,
now that I've seen you.

1932
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:15,650
A weight has been lifted?

1933
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,080
- A little.
- Why a little?

1934
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,250
I don't feel completely relieved.

1935
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,420
What can we do
to make you feel completely relieved?

1936
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:23,690
I don't think it's possible.

1937
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,930
- Can I help you in any way?
- No.

1938
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,730
You do what you want.

1939
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,360
I'll do what I want.

1940
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:33,030
No... Okay.

1941
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,000
Don't get angry.

1942
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,640
Ha Neul needed to go through this.

1943
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,270
Right. She didn't get a chance before.

1944
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,910
(Gazing)

1945
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,650
Goodness.

1946
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,550
What's wrong?

1947
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,480
I didn't do anything.

1948
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,120
Shall we go?

1949
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,020
Since you asked me out,
this will be on me.

1950
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,260
No, this is on me.

1951
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,430
- It's on me.
- It's on me.

1952
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:01,430
I'd feel better if I treated you.

1953
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:03,130
I'd feel better if I paid.

1954
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,630
I'll treat you.

1955
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,070
- Are you wearing a skirt?
- Yes.

1956
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:11,100
It's cold.

1957
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,910
I told you I knew that I'd see you today.

1958
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,140
Gosh.

1959
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,180
Goodness.

1960
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,580
Gosh.

1961
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,080
- What a bummer.
- Why?

1962
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,820
I didn't get much time with you.

1963
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,050
Oh, my.

1964
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:28,760
But we had fun.

1965
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,490
- It's still sad.
- I'll treat you next time.

1966
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:32,890
- You treated me this time.
- It's sad.

1967
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,460
I wish we could stay longer.

1968
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,130
- I can't help but feel sad.
- What?

1969
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,500
I can't help but feel sad.

1970
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:42,540
I can't help but feel sad.

1971
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,540
Let's go.

1972
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:51,640
(Ji Min and Ha Neul's
postcard pairing date is over.)

1973
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,050
Love is so difficult.

1974
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,720
I didn't expect Ji Min and Ha Neul
to be paired with the postcards.

1975
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,520
Right. I didn't even imagine it.

1976
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,390
I don't think, back in Italy,

1977
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,360
Ji Min thought that he had a chance.

1978
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,820
Because of Woo Jae and Je Yeon?

1979
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,160
- Woo Jae...
- I see.

1980
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,800
Woo Jae's presence was too strong.

1981
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,400
From our perspective,
Ji Min and Ha Neul are similar.

1982
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,930
They're devoted to only one person.

1983
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,970
He sees some resemblance of him in her.

1984
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:20,210
I can see why he felt grateful to her
for liking him.

1985
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,710
- Right.
- He probably felt...

1986
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:25,210
insignificant himself.

1987
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,080
It was a chance for Ha Neul...

1988
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,480
- to get it off her chest.
- Yes,

1989
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,050
but I don't think she'll stop liking him.

1990
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,020
Ha Neul always keeps the possibility open.

1991
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,020
Yes.

1992
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,990
I really wonder...

1993
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,720
- if she moved on from him.
- I don't think so.

1994
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,290
She told him, "Do what you want."

1995
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,860
"I'll do what I want."

1996
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,490
- That sounds a little...
- Right.

1997
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,600
I want to send a video message to Ha Neul.

1998
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,830
Ha Neul,
I'll look for someone nice for you.

1999
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,130
I'll find someone for you.

2000
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,870
- Seriously.
- By the way,

2001
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:53,210
I'm afraid that the ending will be sad.

2002
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:54,870
- It's unfortunate.
- Yes.

2003
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:58,410
I've been a ballad singer for 35 years.

2004
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,680
- It's already been 35 years?
- Yes, 35 years.

2005
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,520
- A song with a sad ending...
- Does it last long?

2006
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,950
No, it becomes a hit.

2007
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,750
(It becomes a hit.)

2008
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,920
Yes,
a lot of people take an interest in it.

2009
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,960
It's not over until it's over.

2010
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,530
This is very difficult.

2011
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:16,730
(This morning)

2012
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,600
(He carefully checks the postcard
inside the music box.)

2013
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,340
(Chan Hyeong wrote to Ha Neul.)

2014
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,510
That's his music box.

2015
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,610
(Chan Hyeong wrote to Ha Neul.)

2016
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,610
(The last day in Italy)

2017
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:32,610
Where did you go?

2018
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:34,010
We should tell them that.

2019
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:37,620
(A strange vibe developed between them.)

2020
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,520
You see,

2021
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:42,420
I thought we'd be more like siblings,

2022
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,520
but that wasn't the case.

2023
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,090
Chan Hyeong must've been flustered.

2024
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,230
(After a single date,
she sent her postcard to someone else.)

2025
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:58,200
(Chan Hyeong didn't receive a postcard
from Ha Neul.)

2026
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,910
- The weather's warmer today.
- He's going out with Chae Eun.

2027
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,220
- Right?
- Yes.

2028
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,020
- It's warmer today.
- That's a relief.

2029
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,250
(During their first date in Korea)

2030
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:16,420
- I absolutely love sundaeguk.
- Really?

2031
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,960
I know a place
that serves the best sundaeguk.

2032
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,660
They serve sundae with large intestines.

2033
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,160
Why don't we go there for lunch?

2034
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:26,900
(They agreed to have sundaeguk.)

2035
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:29,240
- She meant it.
- This place...

2036
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,940
- looks authentic.
- What if you fall in love with it?

2037
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,410
Are they heading to that restaurant?

2038
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:36,040
(They arrive
at Chae Eun's favorite sundaeguk place.)

2039
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,010
- This will be a hearty meal for you.
- Tell me about it.

2040
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,220
- Before you head to the office.
- This will be a good meal.

2041
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,280
I've been excited about this place.

2042
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,220
- But...
- You keep telling me not to be, but...

2043
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,490
Of all the restaurants I mentioned,

2044
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,860
you seemed fixated on this place.

2045
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,860
- Totally.
- You've been asking me...

2046
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,160
- to take you to eat sundaeguk.
- Right.

2047
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:56,260
- We'd like to order.
- Sure. Go ahead.

2048
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,000
- We'll have two of the sundae combo.
- Sure.

2049
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,400
(They order the sundae combo.)

2050
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,040
It must be less bustling
since it's past lunch hour.

2051
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,240
It's already 1 p.m.

2052
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,270
Do you walk here from the office?

2053
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,370
Yes, by foot.

2054
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,910
- Doesn't it take a while to get here?
- About ten minutes?

2055
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:15,720
You must walk here
with your colleagues to eat.

2056
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,850
I think
I normally have sundaeguk and rice...

2057
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:21,290
- or sandwich for lunch.
- Really?

2058
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:24,020
Let's eat at the place
near my office next time.

2059
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,090
The one near your office?

2060
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,890
January sounds nice.

2061
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,390
It's really good.

2062
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,500
(January sounds nice.)

2063
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,870
They're making plans for the future.
The future.

2064
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,130
(Proud)

2065
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
Do you eat side dishes
made with garlic scape?

2066
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,910
- I eat just about anything.
- Really?

2067
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,610
(He cuts the radish kimchi.)

2068
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,250
You can sit over here.

2069
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,750
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

2070
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,250
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

2071
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:54,950
- There.
- No way.

2072
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,490
- You can eat right away.
- Sure.

2073
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:58,860
(Involuntary exclamations
escape his lips.)

2074
01:30:58,860 --> 01:30:59,930
No way.

2075
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,990
(Involuntary exclamations
escape his lips.)

2076
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,560
This is great. I love this.

2077
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:05,530
Check that out.

2078
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,070
This is what I'll have first.

2079
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:08,700
Here.

2080
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,600
The large intestines are good,

2081
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,070
but so are the other parts.

2082
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:15,170
- Sundae. Cheers.
- Cheers.

2083
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:20,010
(They enjoy their first sundae
at the same time.)

2084
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,320
It's really good.

2085
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,650
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

2086
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,250
It tastes good with the ssamjang too.

2087
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,090
I should try one with that.

2088
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:35,130
(As recommended by Chae Eun,
he adds a heap of ssamjang.)

2089
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:36,760
I'd walk ten minutes to eat this.

2090
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,930
- Right?
- Yes.

2091
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,770
(Smiling)

2092
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,040
- It's really good.
- Right?

2093
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,440
I bet you haven't had
anything like this before.

2094
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,410
- It's tender and chewy.
- Right.

2095
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,110
- It's chewy.
- This is so good.

2096
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:54,050
It was stuffed with clotted blood.

2097
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,580
This isn't your ordinary sundae.
It's a delicacy.

2098
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,480
(She's cute.)

2099
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,860
We always have delicious things
on our dates.

2100
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:06,030
We went on our first date last Tuesday,

2101
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,260
and we've been having...

2102
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:08,930
- meals together often since then.
- That's right.

2103
01:32:08,930 --> 01:32:10,230
I've gained some weight.

2104
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,870
I've been eating more, you see.

2105
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:15,070
- I normally had small portions.
- That's good.

2106
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,270
This is really good, though.

2107
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,510
At first, I didn't think...

2108
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,410
you'd eat this kind of food.

2109
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:26,880
- Really?
- Yes.

2110
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
Men love women who like to eat.

2111
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,080
This is what I love.

2112
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:34,590
A lot of women
don't like this kind of food.

2113
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:38,220
I bet you normally had
Western cuisine on your dates.

2114
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,430
When we first met,

2115
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,930
you seemed like someone who liked dessert.

2116
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,870
You made that thing with Chang Hwan.

2117
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,830
- The cake?
- Seeing you eat it all by yourself...

2118
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:51,070
- I'll enjoy it.
- I'll enjoy it.

2119
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,540
She doesn't joke around
when it comes to food.

2120
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,780
(She kept on eating cake.)

2121
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,640
- I can't believe we ate a whole cake.
- Exactly.

2122
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,950
I probably had two-thirds of it.

2123
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,950
I like that the cream isn't too heavy.

2124
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,650
- I've never seen you eat this way.
- Tell me about it.

2125
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,920
You must really like cake.

2126
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,590
I can eat a whole cake by myself.

2127
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:10,420
- Really?
- Even one of that size?

2128
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,260
I would too if it's good.

2129
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:15,730
The fact that
you're fond of this kind of food...

2130
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,260
Men find that charming.

2131
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,430
To me, it's...

2132
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,400
I love this kind of food,

2133
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:25,040
but I can't enjoy it on dates...

2134
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,840
if she isn't fond of it.

2135
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,710
(Proud)

2136
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,240
It's so good that I want to take my time.

2137
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:33,650
- Right?
- Yes.

2138
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:35,750
I want to take my time eating this.

2139
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,780
Do you think you'll come back here?

2140
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,220
- Yes. I mean it.
- Right?

2141
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,190
How do I get here, though?

2142
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,460
They should come together.

2143
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:45,990
I'm sure you can find enough time
during your lunch break...

2144
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:48,030
to come here for a meal.

2145
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,730
But I don't want to eat alone.

2146
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:52,030
Call me, then.

2147
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,470
(Call me, then.)

2148
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,530
I'd like that.

2149
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,740
- Chan Hyeong was waiting for that.
- She finally said it.

2150
01:33:58,740 --> 01:33:59,910
Exactly.

2151
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,310
I'd like that.

2152
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,580
I'd probably come here often.

2153
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,550
Chan Hyeong must've fallen for Chae Eun.

2154
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,050
- I have something for you.
- What?

2155
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:14,850
You likely have a good idea of what it is.

2156
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,560
(She carefully takes out a postcard.)

2157
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,590
- A postcard?
- A postcard?

2158
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:20,830
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

2159
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,360
- Can I accept this?
- Yes.

2160
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,460
Really?

2161
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,100
- I wrote it three weeks ago.
- Really?

2162
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,100
She's giving him what she wrote in Italy.

2163
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,710
(Chae Eun only spent a short time
in Italy.)

2164
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:34,910
That's right.

2165
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,310
- She wasn't paired up with anyone,
- Of course.

2166
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:37,580
so it wasn't delivered.

2167
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,750
But she's now giving it to him in person.

2168
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:43,520
(Chae Eun wrote to Chan Hyeong,
who accompanied her briefly in Italy.)

2169
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:49,390
You wrote, "Merry Christmas in advance,"
but it's now Christmas.

2170
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,660
There's even a drawing.

2171
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,160
- Check out the drawing.
- I know.

2172
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,430
That's the highlight.

2173
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,030
Socks and mugs.

2174
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,030
Socks and mugs
in front of the Christmas tree.

2175
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:01,630
We had dinner...

2176
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:04,540
- at the place with Christmas decorations.
- Of course.

2177
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,570
Exactly.

2178
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,980
Why don't we take one each?

2179
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,480
- I'd like that.
- Good.

2180
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,880
(They shared the gifts
they had bought for one another.)

2181
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,750
It was highly unexpected.

2182
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,480
That's why I felt bad.

2183
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,320
I should make up for it.

2184
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,760
- "I should make up for it!"
- "I should make up for it!"

2185
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,990
Feeling bad like that...

2186
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:27,130
leads to a good life together.

2187
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,130
- Does it lead to a good life together?
- Yes.

2188
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,400
They'll have a life together
instead of just becoming a couple?

2189
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,000
Feeling bad about something...

2190
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,500
can lead to a lifetime of happiness.

2191
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,900
- That's great.
- Absolutely.

2192
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:36,970
I should make sure one feels bad.

2193
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:39,040
- That sounds like a solid foundation.
- You must feel bad.

2194
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,210
- Make someone feel really bad.
- Got it.

2195
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,680
Okay. Thanks for the amazing advice.

2196
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,480
This couple...

2197
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:47,510
doesn't get into deep talks
about relationships.

2198
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:49,450
They don't discuss
any deep emotional stuff.

2199
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,980
It's about food...

2200
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,550
or how good the food is.

2201
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,090
That's all they talk about.

2202
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:56,260
But why do I feel like
they really like each other?

2203
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,420
(Curious)

2204
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,420
Neither of them...

2205
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,590
shows the other
how emotionally exhausted they are.

2206
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:03,230
- That's right.
- Although they're emotionally exhausted.

2207
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:05,970
- They have the makings of a good couple.
- Right.

2208
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,330
They don't have fragile hearts.

2209
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,470
She didn't say,

2210
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:10,140
- "I bet you didn't write me one."
- That's right.

2211
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,670
Instead, she just handed it over,

2212
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:12,710
saying she should give him this.

2213
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,640
- That was nice.
- She's not petty.

2214
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,880
I haven't seen you in a while.

2215
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,880
(Someone who looks exactly like Chae Eun)

2216
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,920
I have an older twin sister.

2217
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,190
- Identical?
- No, fraternal.

2218
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:28,920
- They look a lot like each other.
- We do...

2219
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,060
- look alike.
- Fraternal, right?

2220
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,790
Yes. Together, in middle school.

2221
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:34,260
- Did you swap when one was tired?
- Did she take your place?

2222
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:35,830
(Laughing)

2223
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:39,300
My sister works
at another foreign company.

2224
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,370
What on earth?

2225
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,840
They look identical!

2226
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,870
You seem happy.

2227
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:49,310
Who's Chae Eun?

2228
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:51,310
Are there any decent guys there?

2229
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:54,310
I joined the group later than the rest,

2230
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:57,420
which gave me the chance
to ask someone out on a date.

2231
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:00,620
I enjoyed the time I spent...

2232
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,220
with Chan Hyeong in Italy.

2233
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,960
I wanted to get to know him better...

2234
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,190
and talk to him more.

2235
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:11,030
That's why I wanted to ask him out
on a date.

2236
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,270
(I see.)

2237
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:16,740
So you got curious about
this Chan Hyeong...

2238
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:21,010
- after your date in Italy?
- Yes.

2239
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,680
But after I came back to Korea,
I got sick...

2240
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,840
and had to be quarantined.

2241
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,080
I had a fever, so the date didn't happen.

2242
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,250
But he brought me a humidifier
for my room.

2243
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,320
(Goodness)

2244
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,520
I was so grateful for that.

2245
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:39,430
I bet he won you over completely...

2246
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,290
- with that gesture.
- He did.

2247
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:42,430
I was touched.

2248
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:44,660
I didn't care about
who he was at the time.

2249
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:47,570
I was just touched by his thoughtfulness.

2250
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,200
- We like similar things.
- I see.

2251
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,740
We bought Lego and played with it
while ordering hamburgers to eat in.

2252
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:57,280
We enjoyed casual dates like that.

2253
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,180
I felt like myself again.

2254
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:00,950
It calmed me down,

2255
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:02,310
and I was at ease.

2256
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:04,650
- When you were with him?
- Yes, with Chan Hyeong.

2257
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,290
(I see.)

2258
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:08,220
When I'm with him, everything is easy.

2259
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,920
We shared stories about ourselves...

2260
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,460
and our lives.

2261
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,360
What we value in life...

2262
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:15,190
and how we view marriage.

2263
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:17,100
We talked a lot about things like that.

2264
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,630
We have a lot in common.

2265
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:23,770
When it comes to a spouse,
I think it's best to find someone...

2266
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,210
who shares your values and views.

2267
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:28,010
They're even discussing marriage.

2268
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:32,850
You're in the final moments now.

2269
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,380
The show is coming to an end.

2270
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:37,950
What if Chan Hyeong doesn't show up?

2271
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:40,350
Is there anyone else you're interested in?

2272
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:41,820
That's an important question.

2273
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,860
(Pondering)

2274
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,660
- My next choice?
- Yes.

2275
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,560
You know who it is. It's Sang Yun

2276
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,830
Sang Yun?

2277
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,130
It's like this with Sang Yun.

2278
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:54,330
I keep wondering
why he's being so nice to me.

2279
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,400
He's on your mind, then.

2280
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,200
But we're the same age.

2281
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,210
And he's hilarious.

2282
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:05,140
The residents got together...

2283
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,950
for a house party,

2284
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,880
and he ended up sitting next to me.

2285
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:11,920
There's something caring about him.

2286
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,160
He's someone I thought of as a friend.

2287
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,990
- But when someone's nice to you,
- Of course.

2288
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:20,930
- you can't help but take notice.
- I know.

2289
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,360
You're suddenly left wondering
why he's being so nice to me.

2290
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,070
"What was that about?
Why was he nice to me?" Like that.

2291
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:30,770
Who do you want the chance
to get to know better?

2292
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,440
Well...

2293
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,280
Chan Hyeong.

2294
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,250
Chae Eun's made her choice.

2295
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,520
(It seems that way.)

2296
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,650
In my case,

2297
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:48,290
I thought about it realistically
and wondered if I could...

2298
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:49,790
continue this relationship.

2299
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,520
That's important to me.

2300
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:53,490
Chan Hyeong and me?

2301
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,960
To be realistic,

2302
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:59,160
what stands out to me the most
is that we really click.

2303
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,230
- Your lifestyles are quite similar.
- That's right.

2304
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:02,630
And that's my realistic point of view.

2305
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:06,070
I'm at an age
where I should be thinking about marriage,

2306
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:09,940
not chasing dreams and fantasies.

2307
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:13,780
Dating someone just because...

2308
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:16,150
my heart skipped a beat momentarily?

2309
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,150
That seems impractical to me.

2310
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,790
We value the same things...

2311
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:24,020
and can enjoy dates without anyone
having to go the extra mile.

2312
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,090
We're in similar situations...

2313
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:27,990
and understand each other.

2314
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,260
That's important to me.

2315
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,100
I think it's safe
to express your feelings one last time.

2316
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:33,870
It'll be over soon.

2317
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,700
- You're right.
- I know.

2318
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,100
- I think Chae Eun has her answer.
- Right.

2319
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,510
She's mindful of Sang Yun,

2320
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:44,210
but that isn't enough to change her mind.

2321
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,610
- Because she's thinking about marriage.
- Yes, realistically speaking.

2322
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:49,950
(A night filled with sparkling lights)

2323
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:55,290
(Soo Ah is waiting for someone.)

2324
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:58,890
(Someone approaches her from afar.)

2325
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,260
(Nervous)

2326
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:05,730
(Last night)

2327
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:08,170
- Sang Yun.
- Yes, Sang Yun.

2328
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:10,140
- Hello.
- Goodness.

2329
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,910
Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow?

2330
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:14,670
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

2331
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:16,710
- At what time?
- At 8 p.m.

2332
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,140
At 8 p.m.?

2333
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,010
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right.

2334
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,380
- What was that?
- "What was that?"

2335
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,420
He doesn't know what hit him.

2336
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:30,920
(Soo Ah chooses Sang Yun
with her date ticket.)

2337
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:35,030
(Soo Ah's Pairing Book)

2338
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,460
- I'm curious about these two.
- I know.

2339
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:40,830
(Their unexpected date begins.)

2340
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:43,500
She entered his room
and told him to meet her at 8 p.m.

2341
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,900
He doesn't have the time
to prepare for his date with Soo Ah.

2342
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,410
It was highly unexpected.

2343
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,180
I wonder how he'll be on this date.

2344
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,280
- Hi.
- Hello.

2345
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,550
- It's freezing, isn't it?
- It is.

2346
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,950
Thank you.

2347
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,550
Thanks.

2348
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,960
(Parched)

2349
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,030
It's only been a few days for you.

2350
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,230
How has it been?

2351
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:13,600
It's been good.

2352
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:16,600
- Really?
- No, I'm still nervous.

2353
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:18,470
Of course.

2354
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,170
I'm more comfortable with everyone
than I was on the first day.

2355
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:24,910
You must have a great personality.

2356
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,910
My personality? Absolutely.

2357
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,850
Gosh, really?

2358
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,750
What's your favorite dish?

2359
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,090
That's a tough question.

2360
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:39,490
Let's say you can only eat that one dish.

2361
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,900
Someone will pay you 1 million dollars
if you eat only that for 5 years.

2362
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,670
This is me tormenting an INTJ.

2363
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:49,700
(Naturally, a
game of This or That begins.)

2364
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,470
- Meat.
- Meat?

2365
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,610
You can only have one kind. Pork or beef?

2366
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:54,970
- Pork.
- Pork?

2367
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:57,310
- Wait.
- You're giving it a lot of thought.

2368
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:02,010
How was your conversation
with Chan Hyeong yesterday?

2369
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:03,520
With Chan Hyeong?

2370
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,690
He's who I thought he'd be.

2371
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:08,420
A reliable gentleman.

2372
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:09,820
(I see.)

2373
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,160
However,

2374
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,990
that was it for me.

2375
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,430
Really?

2376
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,460
No way.

2377
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:19,030
Him being a good person...

2378
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:21,200
is different from him being someone...

2379
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,870
I'm attracted to.

2380
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:25,370
How has your love life been?

2381
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:28,210
Who do you see as your ideal man?

2382
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:32,110
I prefer men
with a more rugged appearance...

2383
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,210
over those with softer features.

2384
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,480
I'm not that attracted to them.

2385
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,320
So, not the pretty boys?

2386
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,780
No, not them.

2387
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,190
(I'm not into pretty boys.)

2388
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:43,220
- I see.
- Sang Yun's showing interest in her.

2389
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,390
Anyway,

2390
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:47,430
when I first came to live at the house,

2391
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,300
I thought that you...

2392
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:53,130
were on the prettier side.

2393
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,640
"He's prettier than I am.
How can a guy be that pretty?"

2394
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,170
But the more we talked,

2395
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,380
the more I saw that
you were down-to-earth...

2396
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,640
and had a boyish charm.

2397
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:06,910
That left a good impression.

2398
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,710
I liked the way you smiled.

2399
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:10,520
He's someone who's been on her mind.

2400
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,990
Is that why you chose to spend
your valuable date ticket on me?

2401
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:15,920
Of course.

2402
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,390
- This looks good.
- It looks good.

2403
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:21,760
It's pretty.

2404
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,960
I should take a photo of this.

2405
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,830
- Should I take one for you?
- What?

2406
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:27,130
I could take one and send it to you.

2407
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,500
- I'm good at taking photos.
- I bet you're good at that.

2408
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,800
It's your job to be in photos, right?

2409
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,910
So, yes.

2410
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:35,410
I'm not a food, but...

2411
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,040
- You're not a food?
- What is he saying?

2412
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,080
Sorry about that.

2413
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,710
I actually find...

2414
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:45,720
your random jokes...

2415
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,420
pretty funny.

2416
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,490
Soo Ah's open about her feelings.

2417
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,860
- I'm touched. I...
- I think they're funny.

2418
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:55,530
Being told I'm funny
is the best compliment I could receive.

2419
01:44:56,230 --> 01:45:00,730
(They ended their date on a high note,
exchanging compliments.)

2420
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:07,470
- I think I was nervous.
- Of course.

2421
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:08,470
- Today?
- Yes.

2422
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:09,810
- Why?
- I don't know.

2423
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:11,540
Of course. She seemed that way.

2424
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,580
It looked as though
our Soo Ah was expressing her feelings.

2425
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:16,480
- That's right.
- "Our" Soo Ah?

2426
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,580
It hit me when she said
she had been nervous.

2427
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:21,150
She's attracted to him.

2428
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:23,720
He's someone who's on her mind.

2429
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,790
- That's right.
- She's like this.

2430
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:27,930
She makes others
feel comfortable around her,

2431
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:29,700
yet she knows how to stir things up.

2432
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,160
- That's right.
- She keeps others on their toes.

2433
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,770
With each question,
she observes how the guy responds.

2434
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:35,570
- Exactly.
- But I don't think Sang Yun...

2435
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:37,640
has space in his heart
to consider Soo Ah too.

2436
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:39,870
We never know what will happen, though.

2437
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:44,080
(Chang Hwan returns home.)

2438
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,710
(He picks up a pen and paper,)

2439
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,710
(then goes somewhere private.)

2440
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:49,820
A pen and paper? What for?

2441
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:51,950
Woo Jae and Ji Won.

2442
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:53,520
It's like they're an official couple.

2443
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,520
Who's there?

2444
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:57,920
Hi.

2445
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,030
- Hi, Chang Hwan.
- Hey.

2446
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:02,260
Chang Hwan, what are you up to?

2447
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:03,630
Are you writing a letter?

2448
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,130
He's writing a letter.

2449
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,210
Is everyone back or not?

2450
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:16,540
I know it wasn't easy
with the weather being cold.

2451
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:18,840
I didn't exactly have a hard time.

2452
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,080
- Was it a long day for you?
- I had a blast.

2453
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:24,280
- Did you have a hard time?
- You should go upstairs and get changed.

2454
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:25,820
I had fun.

2455
01:46:34,490 --> 01:46:36,130
(Sighing)

2456
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,760
(Ji Min's head is spinning
after his date with Ha Neul.)

2457
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,500
- It was an emotional day.
- Of course.

2458
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,500
It's quiet for some reason.

2459
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,670
(Sang Yun and Soo Ah
are the last to return.)

2460
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

2461
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,370
- Everyone's back.
- Hi.

2462
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:51,480
Hi, guys.

2463
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,210
- Did you have something delicious?
- What did you eat?

2464
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,210
- Pasta.
- Pasta?

2465
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:57,050
- What did you have?
- Is it...

2466
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:58,380
- What is it?
- With Chan Hyeong?

2467
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,950
Just the two of you?

2468
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,490
Hey.

2469
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,120
- What did you have?
- Us?

2470
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,690
- Pasta and salad.
- Let's go here.

2471
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,430
Where?

2472
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:10,860
Near where I work.

2473
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:13,570
Did you go to where she was?
You went to her.

2474
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:14,700
- What do you mean?
- Near her office.

2475
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,230
- He's bothered by it.
- Apgujeong Rodeo.

2476
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,740
Apgujeong?

2477
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,110
It must've been a long day for you.

2478
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,470
What did you do today?

2479
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:24,210
I looked after my cat...

2480
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,110
and gave it a pat.

2481
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,380
(Ji Min joins them in the kitchen.)

2482
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,420
- I'm still clueless.
- Same here.

2483
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,250
The text... Hey.

2484
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,990
- Hi.
- Did you have a good time?

2485
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,190
- Yes.
- Did it remind you of the memories...

2486
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:37,820
you shared in Italy?

2487
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,390
I thought it was because
Ha Neul asked me to dinner yesterday,

2488
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:42,690
but there were postcards involved.

2489
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,200
We exchanged postcards.

2490
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,400
That's right.

2491
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:49,170
Did you grab a bite to eat?

2492
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,140
- We ate.
- Look at Je Yeon.

2493
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,570
- She caught on.
- We only had tea.

2494
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:55,640
I wasn't chosen by anyone.

2495
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,340
We got off work around the same time.

2496
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,450
It turned out to be a date
among other things.

2497
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:02,750
I guess.

2498
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,650
It ended at 8 p.m.

2499
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:05,850
What did you have?

2500
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,390
Aglio e olio pasta.

2501
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,550
Was it better than mine?

2502
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:11,960
- Absolutely not.
- Thanks for saying that.

2503
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,960
We also had grilled ribs.

2504
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:16,490
We went to a beautiful place in Seongsu.

2505
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,600
- Seongsu?
- Yes.

2506
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,730
It was a beautiful restaurant.

2507
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,270
I saved the place.

2508
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:23,000
Was it good? Was the food also good?

2509
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,640
- Yes. The food was good too.
- Share with me later.

2510
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:26,970
- I will. The place was really pretty.
- Oh, my.

2511
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,840
- She's looking at him.
- It was cold but pretty.

2512
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,010
Isn't there a lot of traffic in Seongsu
around that time?

2513
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,310
Yes. But I passed out in the taxi
and couldn't tell.

2514
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:34,980
(She simply plays with her hair
in the unexpected situation.)

2515
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,320
Today must've been tiring.
You even went to bed late last night.

2516
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:39,120
That taxi must have cost
around 100 dollars.

2517
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:41,390
- I still slept about 5 to 6 hours.
- Around 100 dollars?

2518
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:42,390
Taking detours.

2519
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:44,760
The taxi was 50 dollars.

2520
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,230
- Why is everyone standing?
- We're gathering.

2521
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:51,130
I heard everyone was gathering
on the first floor.

2522
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,630
- Did everyone just get here?
- We were at home all day long.

2523
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:55,070
- It was just the two of us.
- Yes.

2524
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,300
- You two? What did you do?
- Yes.

2525
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:57,970
We had a meal.

2526
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:59,200
- What was the menu?
- A meal kit.

2527
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,470
- "A meal kit?"
- We had spaghetti.

2528
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:03,010
- Hi.
- Je Yeon.

2529
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,980
- I'm back.
- Really...

2530
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:06,480
I heard you went to a really pretty place.

2531
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,850
- She's very social.
- I did.

2532
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:09,550
- Who's very social?
- Ha Neul.

2533
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:11,580
She always hugs people.

2534
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,180
You're right.

2535
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,050
(Ha Neul is happy after the date...)

2536
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:16,790
(while Je Yeon seems lost in thought.)

2537
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:18,820
- Je Yeon is bothered.
- She must have a lot on her mind.

2538
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,030
- A limited edition?
- Yes!

2539
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,690
I'm so happy.

2540
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:24,060
How sweet of you.

2541
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,600
- Thank you.
- A limited edition?

2542
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,300
- Je Yeon had strong feelings for Ji Min.
- Right?

2543
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:30,670
Little did I expect her...

2544
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:32,440
- to react that way.
- Me neither.

2545
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,210
"My head understands the situation,"

2546
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,440
"but why am I feeling this way?"

2547
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,140
"What is with this feeling?"

2548
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:38,580
That means she likes Ji Min.

2549
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,250
- Yes. That's why...
- Exactly.

2550
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:42,380
I think this can be a wake-up call
for Je Yeon.

2551
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:46,380
Or it can be a turning point
where Ji Min figures out...

2552
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,220
how to overcome this situation.

2553
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,990
But it's clear that
Je Yeon was taken aback.

2554
01:49:50,990 --> 01:49:52,690
- It was unforeseen.
- Exactly.

2555
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:56,590
(Chang Hwan drops by his room
without anyone knowing.)

2556
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,960
What is he taking?

2557
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:03,740
What are you taking with you? Seriously.

2558
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:05,000
The postcard you gave me.

2559
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:06,770
- Right now?
- Yes.

2560
01:50:06,770 --> 01:50:07,940
- Is it today?
- Yes.

2561
01:50:08,210 --> 01:50:10,980
What's this? Did he also buy
a postcard for Chang Hwan?

2562
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:15,280
(He heads straight to Soo Ah.)

2563
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,610
Can you come to the room?

2564
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,720
Can you come to the room?

2565
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:20,990
- What? Right now?
- Yes.

2566
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,390
- What about this room?
- Looks good.

2567
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:24,290
This room is pretty.

2568
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,360
What's up?

2569
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:28,060
It's nothing serious.

2570
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:30,400
Well...

2571
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,360
What was it again?

2572
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,530
It's a Christmas postcard.

2573
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,370
And that.

2574
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:38,600
The drawing style...

2575
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,410
- is similar to that of the pairing book.
- I see.

2576
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,140
- Can I look at it now?
- No.

2577
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:44,840
Look at it later.

2578
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,980
- How come?
- Do it later.

2579
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:47,380
- It's nothing special.
- What?

2580
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:48,510
No. Look at it later.

2581
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:51,920
Are you going to look at it? Fine.

2582
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,650
I'll turn around for a minute.

2583
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,720
The drawing style will make sense
once you see it.

2584
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:58,860
It's a cute drawing style.

2585
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,260
- Did you draw a legless chair?
- No.

2586
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:05,200
I'm talking about your pairing book.

2587
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:07,100
- My book?
- The gift from the kid.

2588
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:10,400
Why not have a look at that alone?
The drawing style.

2589
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:12,970
(Surprised)

2590
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:15,670
It's like a kid drew it.

2591
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,810
- That sort of vibe.
- It's cute.

2592
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,580
(Chang Hwan wrote on the postcard
for Soo Ah as soon as he got home.)

2593
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:22,680
That's devotion right there.

2594
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:26,050
(Hello. A postcard out of nowhere
is a surprise, right?)

2595
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:28,350
(Whether You Are Alone or Not
on Christmas, Be Happy)

2596
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,490
He wrote on it.

2597
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,090
I'm leaving.

2598
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,730
- He's cute.
- Where are you going?

2599
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:38,730
I'm just embarrassed.

2600
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:40,500
Shall we go over there together?

2601
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,140
I have a flight scheduled for tomorrow.

2602
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,640
- Leave after 30 minutes.
- Okay.

2603
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:48,840
(Rummaging)

2604
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:54,350
(With the postcard he wrote in Italy,)

2605
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:58,820
(Chan Hyeong leaves the room.)

2606
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:00,590
I have to give it to her.

2607
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:06,790
(Glancing)

2608
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:09,730
It's for Ha Neul.

2609
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,900
Chan Hyeong wrote it to Ha Neul.

2610
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,800
- Ha Neul. Come here for a second.
- A long time ago, when I was little.

2611
01:52:23,210 --> 01:52:24,340
I have something for you.

2612
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:26,440
This is too embarrassing.

2613
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,480
- Take a seat.
- Yes, sir.

2614
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:33,350
As I must give it to you.

2615
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:35,290
This is adorable.

2616
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:37,590
- Thank you.
- It's the postcard.

2617
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,590
- I've given it to you.
- Why is it so long?

2618
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:41,060
- The one he wrote in Italy?
- Yes.

2619
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,030
So he had to give it to her.

2620
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:45,230
- It says, "Dear Ha Neul."
- Of course.

2621
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,500
I must be polite.

2622
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,800
(Smiling)

2623
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:53,270
(Embarrassed)

2624
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:02,380
(Chan Hyeong wrote the postcard
for Ha Neul in Italy.)

2625
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:05,580
(I hope to spend a memorable time
by sharing our daily lives and thoughts.)

2626
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,820
(I, too, want to show you who I am more.)

2627
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,890
(See you again soon! From Chan Hyeong)

2628
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,790
Here, you wrote, "From Chan Hyeong."

2629
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,130
(Embarrassed)

2630
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:18,800
Thank you.

2631
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,130
That's how it is.

2632
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,870
Reading this brought back many memories.

2633
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:28,870
- Don't you agree?
- I do.

2634
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,180
- We...
- Back then,

2635
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,180
we visited a lot of great places.

2636
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:35,080
The spot where you can see
Florence and the hills.

2637
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:36,610
I remember.

2638
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,120
- It was gorgeous.
- The moon and the sunset...

2639
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,150
- were beautiful.
- They were together.

2640
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:40,820
It was so pretty.

2641
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:49,730
(The two made many memories together
while enjoying the beautiful scenery.)

2642
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:51,500
You were getting them. You knew.

2643
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:55,130
This is very touching. It's...

2644
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:57,600
"See you again soon." We met again soon,

2645
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,400
- and our books were paired.
- Right.

2646
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:01,810
It was so awkward back then, right?

2647
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:04,440
Stuff like that
leaves a strong impression.

2648
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,180
(Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul were...)

2649
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,480
(each other's first date
when they returned to Korea.)

2650
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,420
It's their chance to talk about
how they felt about each other...

2651
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,980
in the beginning.

2652
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:15,250
Many moments passed without them
opening up to each other.

2653
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,720
Either way, we got to interact a lot.

2654
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:19,720
True.

2655
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,230
But we barely had the chance last week.

2656
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:24,760
- Last week and the week before.
- Because you're too popular.

2657
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:28,770
You had to meet this person
and then that person.

2658
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:32,100
It was to make a decision
I wouldn't regret.

2659
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:34,940
You did spend a lot of time with me.

2660
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:35,940
Right.

2661
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,780
I knew you also had to spend time
with the others.

2662
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:39,840
I see.

2663
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:44,320
That’s why I stayed away from you,
not wanting to get in your way.

2664
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,180
I wanted you to focus on that person.

2665
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:49,120
Only then...
I thought you'd be bothered by me.

2666
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:52,020
I was unconsciously concerned about you.

2667
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,830
I imagined you'd be too.

2668
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,060
Yes, you're right.

2669
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:56,930
So you were being thoughtful.

2670
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:58,930
How was it?

2671
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,670
I put in a lot of effort.

2672
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,000
I felt it was a shame...

2673
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,370
for things to pass by like this.

2674
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,040
- Me too.
- Right?

2675
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,770
Do you think you were able
to sort your feelings out...

2676
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:10,840
while living together?

2677
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:12,880
(Thinking)

2678
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:16,250
I must be the type
who needs quite a bit of time for that.

2679
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,150
It could be because I'm very careful.

2680
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:22,390
I got to know the others.

2681
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:25,760
It's helping me make up my mind.

2682
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:28,330
- Is your scale tipping more to one guy?
- Yes.

2683
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,600
After meeting Ji Min today, my feelings...

2684
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,100
I've had dates with everyone now.

2685
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,870
- It seems like it.
- Yes.

2686
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:35,870
I see.

2687
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,340
I've always wanted to have
an honest conversation with you.

2688
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:43,510
Thanks for creating this opportunity.

2689
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,110
Of course. I had to give that to you.

2690
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,310
And...

2691
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,150
I did my best writing it.

2692
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:53,420
I can tell you gave it your all.

2693
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,850
(Grateful)

2694
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,430
(They recall the memories in Italy
through the postcard.)

2695
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,430
- Let's relax upstairs.
- Let's go.

2696
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:11,740
(How will the residents' feelings change?)

2697
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:14,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

2698
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:15,470
It's been a while.

2699
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:23,720
(Chang Hwan came to work out
for the first time in a while.)

2700
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:26,280
(Exercising hard)

2701
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:30,360
Let's go.

2702
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:34,190
(After working out, he visits the trending
hyperbaric oxygen therapy center.)

2703
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,930
- I often stop by...
- Yes?

2704
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:37,600
when I'm tired after working out.

2705
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:40,130
It's also good for the skin,

2706
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,900
so many women come too.

2707
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,500
Please lie down comfortably.

2708
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:52,810
(Lying down and relaxing comfortably)

2709
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:54,210
It's refreshing.

2710
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,650
(A day to recharge and focus on health)

2711
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:58,380
You know the DNA test we took last time?

2712
01:56:58,650 --> 01:57:00,120
The results are out.

2713
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,390
- Really? Let's have a look.
- Okay.

2714
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,590
- My results are long.
- Same here.

2715
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,720
What does yours say?

2716
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,760
(Check your DNA test result.)

2717
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,730
It says I don’t have much of an appetite.

2718
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:12,760
The results have all sorts of stuff.

2719
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,170
Right? Isn't it interesting?

2720
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:18,740
(Christmas Eve)

2721
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,370
(They leave for the East Sea.)

2722
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:23,670
(My real self that only comes out
when I'm with you)

2723
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:27,510
(Someone who clicks with me perfectly
like a miracle)

2724
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:29,150
I'm so happy to be here with you.

2725
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:31,680
The moments I shared with you...

2726
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:33,120
were the most heart-fluttering.

2727
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,890
- Who do you want to go with?
- Me?

2728
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:35,920
You.

2729
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:40,220
There's no reason for me not to like you.

2730
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:43,430
The sky looks like a rainbow right now.

2731
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,630
It's so pretty.

2732
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:46,860
I don't want to go back.

2733
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,300
Be honest with me.

2734
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,570
I thought it shouldn't end like this.

2735
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:54,370
I had to do something to make progress.

2736
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:59,980
That day, I had the feeling that
I had made up my mind.

2737
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:04,780
Ji Min must know how I feel
better than I do.

2738
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,050
But why won't he give it
even a single thought?

2739
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,020
What did you two do?

2740
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:11,260
We rode the Ferris wheel.

2741
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,030
- It must've been beautiful.
- Yes.

2742
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:15,930
- Please excuse me first.
- I bet it was nice.

2743
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,800
I want Ji Min to acknowledge my feelings,
even just a little.

2744
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:25,470
There's someone
I've been focused on all this time.

2745
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:28,410
I'd better focus on my initial decision.

2746
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:33,010
What should I do? I don't have a clue.

2747
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,450
I'm about to lose it.

2748
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:41,920
You seemed upset.

2749
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,250
I'm exhausted.

2750
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:44,920
Why?
