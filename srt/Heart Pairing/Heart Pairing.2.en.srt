1
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,000
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,940
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,570
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,680
Heart Pairing starts now.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,880
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,450
People went crazy
after Heart Pairing was aired last week.

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,620
The show started in Italy.

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,620
Just like its huge scale,

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,090
the show attracted huge attention.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,190
(Huge response)

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,290
It's global.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,460
And today,

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,930
cute, bright, and sweet...

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,400
(That's me.)

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
Mimi.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,800
I thought you were talking about me.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,300
(Laughing)

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,370
Another cute, bright, and sweet person,

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,100
Kim Ji Min, is here.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,910
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,910
(Welcome to the show.)

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,440
As a big fan of "Heart Signal,"

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,240
- Right.
- I'm joining this show.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,580
Thank you for inviting me.

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,980
- I really enjoyed the first episode.
- I mean,

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,950
Ji Min, you already have a partner.

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,320
It's true that I have a partner,

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,020
but I'm not married yet.

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,620
You don't know what will happen?

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,160
Well, someday...

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,120
- Although you're paired now...
- Although I'm paired now...

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,390
- How was the 1st episode?
- In the 1st episode,

34
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,700
I saw Je Yeon being very quiet.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,700
I thought that
she was a hidden master of dating.

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,700
- I have the same opinion.
- Yes.

37
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,070
This is what it felt like.
"I'll do nothing."

38
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,340
- "Do what you can do."
- "You can go ahead."

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,940
She will show her strength
on a 1-on-1 date.

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,440
We need to see how she is
when she's with a man.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,810
She might reveal unexpected charms.

42
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,680
- Right.
- That was my prediction.

43
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,450
I like Ha Neul's character.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,350
She smiles all the time.

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,950
She lightens the atmosphere.

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,720
(Like this?)

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
(Is this right?)

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
Not something this unnatural.

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,690
(Please be more natural next time.)

50
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,830
I think...

51
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,430
- Ha Neul lightened the mood all along.
- That's right.

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,200
I like that kind of people.

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,930
So Ha Neul remained in my memory.

54
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,870
Ji Min looked at Je Yeon...

55
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,740
for a moment,
as if he was thinking she was so cute.

56
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,170
Such scenes were shown twice.

57
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,640
- Right.
- That impressed me.

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,580
Je Yeon...

59
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,110
When Woo Jae entered...

60
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,980
during their first encounter,

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,820
- they...
- She couldn't hide it.

62
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,790
Yes, their first encounter was...

63
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,390
(How her heart fluttered during the
first encounter was vividly conveyed.)

64
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,720
- It was like a movie.
- It felt warm.

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,360
- It was shot beautifully too.
- Today,

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,360
since Heart Pairing is a sweet TV show,

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
we prepared something sweet.

68
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,600
- Marshmallow.
- We have snacks.

69
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,230
- This is good.
- Can I have it now?

70
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,130
- Really?
- It looks nice.

71
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,540
(Taking a big bite)

72
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,600
(It suits their tastes.)

73
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,810
It tastes really good.

74
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,010
- It's good.
- Recharge your sugar levels.

75
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,140
I think it will be very nice
to have this with a loved one.

76
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,250
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

77
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,450
(Italy)

78
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,550
(Morning of day 2)

79
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,690
(Taking a picture)

80
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,620
(After taking a picture of the sunrise,)

81
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,960
How come the grass is so green like this?

82
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
- It looks like a soccer field.
- It's December.

83
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,630
(they take a morning walk.)

84
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,760
(Glancing)

85
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,430
Did you take a walk?

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,030
Did you take a rest?

87
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,140
I had one more cup of tea.

88
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,740
Why is this here?

89
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
There's one more.

90
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
No way.

91
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,610
(A new music box)

92
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,680
- Right.
- Right, it's today.

93
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,980
It means a catfish.

94
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,580
- We have one more already.
- Is it today?

95
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,880
- I guess so.
- It wasn't here yesterday, right?

96
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,250
- It wasn't. We all took all six of them.
- That's right.

97
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,990
Did you see
that we got one more music box?

98
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,020
- Really? Where?
- Yes.

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,290
It's in the room we first met.

100
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,190
It's true.

101
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,190
This is...

102
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,900
- something we can't help.
- I guess so.

103
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
A catfish will appear.

104
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,430
- It's before they meet the catfish.
- Yes.

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,900
We need to go grocery shopping.

106
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,270
We can go there
when we go grocery shopping.

107
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,910
- Yes.
- Take it with you.

108
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,180
There are 6 of them for 6 of us.

109
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,880
(They take umbrellas
to go grocery shopping.)

110
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,180
They're going out, at last.

111
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,620
Grocery shopping.

112
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,520
Would you like to sit in the front?

113
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,350
Who shares the same car is very important.

114
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,450
That's important.

115
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,760
Who sits next to whom matters too.

116
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,330
- Would you like to sit in the front?
- Okay.

117
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Where shall we go first?

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,870
Shall we get the ingredients first?

119
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,000
- All right.
- Let's get the important things first.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,070
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

121
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,970
They're the only paired couple
on the first day.

122
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,270
(Woo Jae, Je Yeon, and Ji Min
will get bread and seafood.)

123
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,140
- That's a grape farm.
- The three are together.

124
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,640
- Here?
- All of those.

125
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,080
(Tuscan wine farm in Italy)

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,510
It looks so beautiful.

127
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
That house too.

128
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,550
- It's beautiful.
- It's amazing.

129
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,150
Gosh.

130
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,420
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

131
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,690
- I was surprised.
- I'm fine.

132
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm sorry.

133
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,200
You get flustered
when something like that happens abroad.

134
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,900
I feel sorry.

135
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,170
- For us?
- Yes.

136
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,330
- Why?
- We don't care. Don't worry.

137
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,540
Anyway,
it's my first time driving in Europe.

138
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
I somehow feel sorry.

139
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,050
- Did you get an international license?
- No, I didn't.

140
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,210
Then you can't drive here.

141
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,120
I lost my driver's license
when I lost my wallet,

142
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,620
so I couldn't apply
for an international driver's license.

143
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,250
I have
an international driver's license now.

144
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,590
Do you have it with you now?

145
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,520
- Yes.
- You have a competent one next to you.

146
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,790
Shall I drive?

147
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,990
She's cute.

148
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,460
Are you okay?

149
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes. Are you a paper driver?

150
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,970
No, I recently got the license.

151
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,730
- You recently got it.
- So I'm not a paper driver.

152
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,470
Now I need to practice,
and I find driving so fun.

153
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,670
It was fun when I took
the driver's license test.

154
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,940
I want to be a good driver soon.

155
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,510
Ji Min constantly looks at
Je Yeon's facial expressions.

156
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,810
It's a narrow road.

157
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,280
It's a tough road to drive on.

158
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,120
Shall I zoom in?

159
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,320
- I think it's good.
- Yes.

160
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,660
(Focused on the GPS)

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,830
(Blinking)

162
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,600
(Blinking again)

163
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,400
No one is speaking.

164
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,070
(Glancing)

165
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,940
I imagine the other car...

166
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,410
filled with noises.

167
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,210
I like it here.

168
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,110
- You sound like you want to be there.
- No, I like it here.

169
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,620
Is it because she's here?

170
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,980
(100 percent sure)

171
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,020
(Smiling)

172
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,020
We're almost there.
We have two minutes left.

173
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,260
The street is lovely with small shops.

174
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,670
There are so many charming shops.

175
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,770
I think the bakery will be pretty too.

176
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,170
It makes me realize I'm traveling.

177
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,880
(Grassina is a peaceful rural village.
It's a 20-minute drive from Florence.)

178
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,110
(It's well known for
its olive farms and vineyards.)

179
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,910
It feels like I'm in Italy.

180
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,180
- It's nice to be outside.
- It feels so good.

181
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,520
It's beautiful.

182
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,450
We need to check the store's name.

183
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,350
(Looking around)

184
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,820
- I think it's there. Am I right?
- It's there. You're right.

185
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,990
(Forno Fior di Pane dal opened in 1996.
A place for traditional Tuscan flatbread)

186
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,190
I think this is the place.

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,230
(Freshly-baked bread in this morning)

188
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,000
- Good morning. Go ahead.
- Good morning.

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,140
- Guanciale, please.
- Okay.

191
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,210
Two.

192
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,240
I'll get two, please.

193
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,910
He just spoke Italian.
It wasn't English, right?

194
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,380
- It was Italian.
- Italian.

195
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,580
- That makes him look cool.
- Right.

196
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
I'll get two, please.

197
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,420
- Two?
- That's cool.

198
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,490
Do you need one more?

199
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,920
(Surprised)

200
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,690
Do you know Italian?

201
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,160
- I don't know.
- It's Italian.

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,230
- You can speak Italian.
- Just a bit.

203
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,560
- You suddenly look so reliable.
- That's true.

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
No, I can speak only a bit of Italian.

205
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,170
- You're so competent.
- No.

206
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,070
- You can cook,
- What kind of person are you?

207
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,740
and you speak Italian well.

208
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,070
(At a tollgate, 30 minutes earlier)

209
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,980
Sorry, we didn't receive the biglietto.

210
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,880
How do you know
the Italian word for a ticket?

211
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,180
- Do you mean biglietto?
- Yes.

212
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,680
- It was written there.
- Really?

213
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
(Fluent)

214
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,420
- Do you have classic bread?
- This is it.

215
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,160
- I'm flustered.
- What's going on?

216
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,790
How many do we need?

217
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,960
We can get one each.

218
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,830
Okay.

219
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,730
- You speak almost like a local.
- No, I really don't.

220
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,140
I can't imagine what your occupation is.

221
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,040
(Woo Jae orders and pays in Italian.)

222
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,710
- How do you say, "Thank you?"
- Is it "grazie?"

223
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,080
- Grazie?
- Grazie?

224
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,280
- Grazie.
- Grazie mille.

225
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,520
What did you just say?

226
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,050
How about "ciao?"

227
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,190
- Ciao.
- You can say, "Ciao," too.

228
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,590
- It's fascinating.
- I know.

229
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,730
- Je Yeon looks like she fell for him.
- Yes.

230
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,600
He's not just saying words.

231
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,330
- He spoke the language so naturally.
- Right.

232
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,170
Je Yeon looks happy now.

233
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,570
I knew Woo Jae was a nice guy.

234
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,200
He became a leader naturally.

235
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,340
- Right.
- Woo Jae is a leader.

236
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,540
- Shall I hold the umbrella?
- It's okay.

237
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,580
(In a row)

238
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,150
If we find a nice spot on our way,

239
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,420
let's take pictures.

240
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,320
Sure. That will be nice.

241
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,630
Here we are.

242
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,490
Is it here?

243
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,600
They sell jamon and such here.

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,900
It's jamon. Right.

245
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,930
(Vitality of lunchtime)

246
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,730
It's nice to be outside...

247
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,140
- after staying inside all along.
- Right.

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,670
- I want to stay outside all day.
- I know.

249
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,210
- Is it your first time in Europe?
- That's right.

250
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,310
- Really?
- Yes.

251
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,840
I only traveled to nearby places.

252
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,080
You must be very impressed now.

253
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
That's right.

254
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,150
Now...

255
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,720
Today, you look brighter than yesterday.

256
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,960
- I guess it's because I'm outside.
- I guess so.

257
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
You look very happy.

258
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,460
(Embarrassed)

259
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,730
I haven't seen your teeth until today.

260
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,530
- Really? I was like that?
- Yes. I haven't seen them at all.

261
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,730
Two of you didn't have
a lot of chance to talk.

262
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,770
We didn't have it at all.

263
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,840
If we hadn't changed the team
and had proceeded like yesterday,

264
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,470
you two could have been distant.

265
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,010
Team E. If we were divided
into Team E and Team I.

266
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,340
We have one month to stay together,
though.

267
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,650
(Nodding)

268
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,750
(Glancing)

269
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,420
- What was that?
- Something's going on.

270
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,590
(The recommended dishes are served.)

271
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,760
- This is the beef.
- The beef.

272
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
It looks like
a nice combination with cheese.

273
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,690
We made a good choice.

274
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,060
- It was a good recommendation.
- It was.

275
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,300
- Is it good?
- It tastes good.

276
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,170
I can hear it while you're talking.

277
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,140
I think your hometown
is in Gyeongsang Province.

278
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,970
- Really?
- Am I right?

279
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,340
I don't sound like I'm from Seoul?

280
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,980
(Unexpected playfulness)

281
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,110
She's cute.

282
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,520
(Flustered)

283
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,620
I guess not.

284
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,520
In the middle of your talk...

285
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,420
Right. That was accurate.

286
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,790
I'm sure you're from Gyeongsang Province.

287
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,090
Aren't you from Gyeongsang Province too,
Je Yeon?

288
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
- Me?
- Yes.

289
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,630
Why do you say so?

290
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,260
I felt it a couple of times.

291
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,330
Really?

292
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,070
She's cute.

293
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,700
So both of you
are from Gyeongsang Province.

294
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,740
- Right? Where are you from?
- Yes.

295
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm from Busan.

296
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,680
- Are you from Busan?
- Yes.

297
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,980
- Really?
- Yes.

298
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,910
- You're from Busan.
- Woo Jae is from Busan too.

299
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,750
I found something in common between you.

300
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm from Gyeongsang Province too.

301
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,890
- No way.
- I'm from Pohang.

302
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,390
- Really?
- Really?

303
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,430
But you don't sound like
you have a dialect.

304
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,700
- The two of you might not recognize it.
- I see.

305
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,730
It's been quite a while
since I lived in Seoul.

306
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,100
- It's been long for me.
- It's been long for me too.

307
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,370
"It's been long."

308
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,170
(Grinning)

309
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,240
May I go to the bathroom?

310
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,780
- Of course. You can go first.
- Okay.

311
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,420
(Awkward)

312
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,260
How are you going to find that plaza?

313
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,300
Are we in Florence now?

314
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes, it said Florence when we were coming.

315
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,170
I want to visit the place
I've been to before.

316
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
- The place he's been before.
- That plaza.

317
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,150
I wonder if I'm right.
The name of that place is...

318
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,580
- You said you were there 10 years ago.
- Yes, 10 years ago.

319
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,450
I guess it's been about that much.

320
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,860
I loved that place so much back then.

321
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
If I can visit there again,

322
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,360
it will remind me of old memories.

323
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,370
Don't you have pictures
you took at that time?

324
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,870
They're on my cell phone.

325
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
I'll show you if I get the chance.

326
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,220
It's been so long.

327
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,390
If you like Florence,

328
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
you'll really love it there.

329
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,700
That plaza?

330
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,330
You'll really love it.

331
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,610
If I find that place,

332
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,540
- will you come with me?
- Okay.

333
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
You said it was beautiful in the evening.

334
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,010
The weather will be fine
on Thursday and Friday.

335
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,080
Is that so?

336
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,120
If that's fine with you.

337
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,290
If there's a chance again.

338
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,760
You're back.

339
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,190
Let's go.

340
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,640
It's beautiful.

341
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,470
I want to live in a house like this.

342
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,070
I guess it feels cold in those houses.

343
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,680
- You sounded like a Type T.
- Did I?

344
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,940
I'm totally a Type F.

345
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,950
I like to look at the sky and the sunset.

346
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,450
That will make me an F too.
I like to look at the sky and all.

347
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,790
People don't lean...

348
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,690
to one side entirely.

349
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,990
(Where are Chan Hyeong,
Ha Neul, and Ji Won headed?)

350
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,690
This is a butcher shop too.

351
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,720
- It's here.
- I think this is the place.

352
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,430
- This is the place.
- It's open.

353
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,260
It's open.

354
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,360
Shall we go inside?

355
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
(Macelleria Stiaccin is a butcher shop
and a restaurant that opened in 1912.)

356
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Hello.

357
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,600
We'd like to buy some meat.

358
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,470
And we want the slice...

359
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,040
- Chan Hyeong can speak English too.
- thinner. Yes.

360
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,570
(Sharpening)

361
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,670
It's a butcher shop and a restaurant.

362
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,740
The butcher shop has a nice vibe.

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,050
I think that is too thin.

364
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,080
How about this?

365
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,750
- It's too thin, right?
- It's too thin. Yes.

366
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,420
We want it bigger.

367
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
(Sharpening)

368
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,460
Today, let's make up for the meat.

369
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,200
- It looks good.
- I need to make up for yesterday.

370
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,830
By the way, the meat here...

371
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,370
has no marbling at all.

372
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,700
It's lean meat.

373
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,910
- Okay?
- Okay.

374
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,910
(They succeed in purchasing local meat.)

375
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,310
(The grocery shopping finishes
at a dessert cafe.)

376
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,510
They have coffee too.

377
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Pick whatever you want.

378
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,580
You're happy.

379
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,150
Chan Hyeong really has a good character.

380
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,350
You smiled broadly.

381
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
This one.

382
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,490
(Shining)

383
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,060
(It became sunny.)

384
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,430
The sun is shining now.

385
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,230
The weather is getting so nice.

386
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,300
When I eat this kind of food,

387
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,800
I can't digest it well.

388
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,270
I brought some enzyme.
Would you like to have it?

389
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,670
- Can I have one too?
- Yes.

390
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,010
- She feels embarrassed to have it alone.
- I carry enough with me.

391
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,810
- Shall I have water after this?
- Drink water with it.

392
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,210
It smells very nice.

393
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,220
(Eating)

394
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,190
It will be fun if we take a group photo
after we get closer.

395
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,220
That will be great.

396
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,720
It seems that
such different kinds of people...

397
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,190
have gathered here.

398
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,530
All the men are very different too.

399
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,830
I know.

400
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,360
And if there's a new resident coming,

401
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,830
- he will also be different from us.
- Right.

402
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,830
- I find that quite interesting too.
- I know.

403
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,840
Right.

404
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,570
You already look excited.

405
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,770
She's so cute.

406
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,340
So funny.

407
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,250
I think you're very responsive to others.

408
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,280
- You think so?
- Yes.

409
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,250
I mean it.
You kept saying it was so funny.

410
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,590
- You just kept saying that all the time.
- You really mean it, right?

411
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Of course.

412
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,960
Actually, I laugh a lot.

413
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,630
- That's a good thing.
- Right.

414
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,230
So funny.

415
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,560
I just said that again.

416
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,030
I think I'm going to be conscious about it
from now on.

417
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,500
- Please don't be.
- Right.

418
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,870
I think it's a good thing.

419
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,770
It makes people really happy.

420
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,940
If other people say that I'm funny
even when I don't think so...

421
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,580
Then, I would feel so happy about it.

422
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,250
(Kind)

423
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,950
Ha Neul likes it so much.

424
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,350
The two go well together.

425
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
This is amazing.

426
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,490
(They ran into the sunset by chance.)

427
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,490
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

428
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,130
- This is so amazing.
- I love it.

429
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,170
This is... Seriously.

430
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,200
(Glancing)

431
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,940
- I didn't expect to see this.
- I know.

432
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,370
(It's even better
since it wasn't expected.)

433
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,170
(The second day is almost over.)

434
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,350
- What?
- What's going on?

435
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,910
My goodness.

436
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,920
(Skillful)

437
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,980
Is he the catfish?

438
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,240
My goodness.

439
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,540
- He seems so manly.
- I know.

440
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,980
(The fourth male resident has arrived.)

441
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,350
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

442
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,890
He's not Italian, right?

443
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,120
- He looks Italian.
- Right.

444
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
- He looks quite exotic.
- He looks exotic.

445
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,830
(The other six residents are back.)

446
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,730
- They will meet the catfish now.
- We're back.

447
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,370
They don't know about him yet, right?

448
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,740
It's cold as it's raining.

449
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,840
- Right?
- Yes.

450
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,870
(Looking around)

451
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,610
The music boxes are gone.

452
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,910
The music boxes are gone.
They disappeared.

453
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,450
I think... You know that
there's another room, right?

454
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,580
Gosh. He knew it right away.

455
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,390
I think someone could be there.

456
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,990
- Let's go upstairs then.
- That's possible.

457
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,890
Ladies, you can go first.

458
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,290
You guys can go first.

459
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,300
- Hello.
- He's surprised.

460
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,510
Hello.

461
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,540
- Hello.
- He looks manly.

462
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,740
- Nice to meet you.
- Right.

463
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
(Bowing)

465
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,110
Hello.

466
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,150
Hello.

467
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,280
It became tense right away.

468
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
(Wary)

469
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

470
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,590
- Shall we sit over here?
- Over here?

471
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,990
- We can sit here, and...
- We will...

472
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,970
- He looks quite exotic.
- He looks exotic.

473
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,740
- What's up with Je Yeon?
- Let's sit over there.

474
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,500
- Okay. We'll go over there.
- Like this.

475
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,140
Then... Shall we sit...

476
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,340
- You can sit comfortably.
- Is there an arrangement?

477
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,380
- I will sit over here.
- Here.

478
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,650
(Nervous)

479
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,550
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

480
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

481
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,190
So...

482
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,100
(He's the fourth male resident.)

483
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,540
- My goodness.
- We already have a catfish.

484
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,770
(The catfish is here already.)

485
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,510
The catfish looks quite impressive.

486
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,510
Yes.

487
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,140
First of all, I liked his beard.

488
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,310
- He looks Italian.
- Right.

489
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,280
He looked quite manly.

490
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,920
My name is Chang Hwan.

491
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
- Chang Hwan.
- Yes.

492
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,990
- It's Chang Hwan.
- Okay.

493
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,560
Could you tell me your names
going this way?

494
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,390
Okay. I'm Woo Jae.

495
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,390
Woo Jae.

496
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,890
- It's Chan Hyeong.
- Chan Hyeong.

497
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,130
Woo Jae and Chan Hyeong.

498
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,200
- I'm Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

499
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
I'm Ha Neul.

500
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
- Ha Neul?
- Yes.

501
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,500
- As in sky?
- Yes. Sky in Korean.

502
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,270
Okay.

503
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm Ji Won.

504
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,980
- Ji Won.
- Yes.

505
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,040
You're Ji Won.

506
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,080
I see.

507
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,580
I'm Je Yeon.

508
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,650
Je?

509
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,160
Yeon.

510
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,720
- Je Yeon.
- Yes.

511
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,590
Ha Neul.

512
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,730
Ji Won.

513
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,560
- Je Yeon.
- Yeon.

514
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,830
- Right.
- That's all I need to know.

515
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,830
Goodness.
He says that's all he needs to know.

516
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,500
That's all I need.

517
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,370
My gosh.

518
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,480
I'll get to know them eventually.

519
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,810
Okay. Thank you.

520
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,690
So did you guys go out together today?

521
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,690
In teams, we went grocery shopping, and...

522
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,690
You went grocery shopping?

523
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,490
Then, the dinner...

524
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,960
- We need to prepare dinner now.
- We will...

525
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,730
- So you got them for dinner?
- Right.

526
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,370
It's not easy to lead the conversation
as soon as you join them.

527
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,870
Well, I...

528
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,740
I went grocery shopping too.

529
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,170
You did?

530
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,110
You know,
steak is famous here in Florence.

531
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,710
Did you try it?

532
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,580
Yesterday...

533
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,420
(Thinking hard)

534
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,690
(Did we have Florentine steak yesterday?)

535
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
(He can't eat it because it's too tough.)

536
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,890
We had it...

537
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,630
intermittently?

538
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,760
- Intermittently?
- Right.

539
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,260
- Intermittently.
- Intermittently. It was cold too.

540
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,400
That was funny.

541
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,430
Well, I know how to cook Florentine steak.

542
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,640
I see.

543
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,900
So let's try it together.

544
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,510
- So he was the main chef.
- He's so trustworthy.

545
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,370
(Expectant)

546
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,140
Ji Won, Je Yeon... Okay.

547
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,180
Shall we go now?

548
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,850
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

549
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,250
Nice to meet you again.

550
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,520
(The Florentine Steak)

551
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,890
It was so impressive.

552
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,960
I've never seen anyone like him before.

553
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,230
- Right?
- Never in my life.

554
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,730
Same here.

555
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,660
It felt like he came out of a movie.

556
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,700
Right.

557
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
- Do I look tired again?
- You look fine now.

558
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,440
It feels like you're awakened now.

559
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,070
Chang Hwan, the others will get back
after putting their coats away.

560
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,740
- Sure. I was going to do that too.
- Okay.

561
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,510
(Glancing)

562
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,950
(Chang Hwan prepares steak.)

563
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,190
Check out his shoulders.

564
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,860
- He has such a small face.
- He's such a tough guy.

565
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,560
(He has a small face and broad shoulders.)

566
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,060
All right.

567
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,860
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

568
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,970
You've come a long way.

569
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,670
I think...

570
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,570
you'll be really good at it.

571
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Well...

572
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,740
Since it's not my kitchen...

573
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,910
"My kitchen?"

574
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,610
- If you thought of anything else,
- I see.

575
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,110
such as pasta,

576
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,850
I will...

577
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,620
Well, I didn't think of anything, but...

578
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,490
Then what did you have in mind?

579
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,390
(Conscious)

580
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,560
Ji Min was going to make gambas.

581
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,470
- Well, I was going to do it,
- He was going to do it.

582
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,930
- but if you could guide us,
- Okay.

583
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,100
- we can all assist you.
- Right.

584
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,740
But all we have is steak,

585
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,070
so you could cook pasta if you need one.

586
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,910
- We did buy some meat.
- I see.

587
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,280
Right. We also have meat.
Would you like to take a look?

588
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,980
- The wine he bought...
- I got...

589
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,180
the finest cut, so...

590
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,780
- It can't be better than that.
- Really?

591
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,290
Impressive.

592
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,820
For now.

593
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,290
(Bursting into laughter)

594
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,990
- He rejected him right away.
- Yes.

595
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,460
- "I have the finest cut."
- "It's the finest one."

596
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,660
Chan Hyeong's eyes changed
for a moment there.

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,210
Make yourselves comfortable.

598
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,610
That's a thick cut.

599
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,110
Are you being punished?

600
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,450
The steak we got yesterday
was thinner than that, right?

601
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,820
- Gosh.
- It was, wasn't it?

602
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
It was thinner than that.

603
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
They all came to watch.

604
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,090
(Olive oil)

605
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,030
He's a sexy cook.

606
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,940
(Amazed)

607
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,480
- How would he cook it on a frying pan?
- I wonder.

608
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,950
I'll cover it with olive oil.

609
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,720
It doesn't go on a frying pan.

610
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,920
I see.

611
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,260
(Flustered)

612
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,360
- The glove is ripped.
- It is.

613
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,330
- It's too small.
- Goodness.

614
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,430
They all get ripped.

615
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,300
(A man with large hands)

616
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,910
- Do we have a knife?
- Yes.

617
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,580
- It's on the wall.
- Over here.

618
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,980
This will do.

619
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,420
- Ji Min feels threatened by the catfish.
- Yes.

620
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,690
(Chang Hwan makes cuts
all over the steak.)

621
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,360
Oh, you need to make some cuts.

622
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,670
I have to cut the fascia.

623
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,200
We're learning.

624
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,770
(Searing the sides)

625
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,740
He does it differently.
He starts from the sides.

626
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,140
He put it vertically.

627
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,410
(Impressed)

628
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,280
(Grabbing)

629
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,920
(The Florentine steak is on the pan.)

630
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,030
- We should put the meat back in.
- Right.

631
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,130
- Or...
- Did we get thin cuts?

632
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,760
Yes. We got thin ones this time.

633
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,330
- It's not too big.
- To cook it more easily.

634
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,230
- We should put it back as is.
- I will.

635
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,670
(This afternoon,
before entering the Pairing House)

636
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,510
He's so cool.

637
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,680
He's charming.

638
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,010
(He bought the finest cut
in the thickness he wanted.)

639
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,990
- We're going to cook it tomorrow.
- Okay.

640
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,360
Big.

641
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,070
(Chan Hyeong also bought some beef.)

642
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,330
That looks too thin.

643
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,600
It smells good.

644
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,040
(He lost his chance
due to Chang Hwan's appearance.)

645
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,110
- Is this...
- Wait.

646
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,570
The war of nerves between men.

647
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,020
(Gazing)

648
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,060
(Chang Hwan starts cooking in earnest.)

649
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,230
What do you want us to do?

650
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,160
- Right. If you tell us...
- Well,

651
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,200
this takes a while because it's thick.

652
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,030
So, you can take it easy.

653
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,300
- Still, we should all...
- I'll ask you if I need help.

654
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,470
We should still work together.

655
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,840
No, make yourselves comfortable.
I mean it.

656
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,770
- It's going to take a while.
- I should put the cheese here.

657
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,710
Good. Let's stack them.

658
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,310
Should we keep it in the refrigerator?

659
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,080
- We can leave it at room temperature.
- Okay.

660
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,380
We...

661
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,980
We actually tried all of them
when we bought them.

662
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,680
- I don't know what to do.
- Me neither.

663
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,720
- Ask for us if you need our help.
- Sure.

664
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,960
It actually takes a long time.

665
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,630
- It's like "Culinary Class Wars."
- Exactly.

666
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,890
- Should we wait in the living room?
- He's dressed like one.

667
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,870
(Everyone but Chang Hwan
is in the living room.)

668
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,870
- I wish I could help,
- I know.

669
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,740
- but I might get in the way.
- I wish I could.

670
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,410
- It looks like he has a plan.
- Right.

671
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,470
(Thinking)

672
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,380
Was his name Chang Wan?

673
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,580
- Chang Hwan.
- Chang Hwan?

674
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,910
- Yes.
- Chang Hwan.

675
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,520
When the new resident came,

676
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,250
I was planning to
check the women's faces...

677
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,790
- before going upstairs.
- Same here.

678
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,860
- I thought it'd be fun.
- Right.

679
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,490
I was curious about how you'd react.

680
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,370
But I was too drawn by him...

681
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,830
that I never got to see the women's faces.

682
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,600
And he said this earlier.

683
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,010
If I remember correctly,

684
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,340
he said, "But this isn't my kitchen."

685
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,250
He made it so obvious that he's a chef.

686
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,410
I think he made a slip of the tongue.

687
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,150
But it looks like it.

688
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,880
- Even if he hadn't said that,
- Right.

689
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,020
he would have looked like a chef.

690
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,150
The fact that he can pick
his own cut of steak is...

691
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,290
- Right.
- Yes.

692
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,790
It was of such different quality
from ours.

693
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,060
The quality, right?

694
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,560
He was too impressive.

695
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,030
(Nodding)

696
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,370
(While they're trying to make guesses
about Chang Hwan...)

697
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,420
He added thyme to his steak.

698
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,090
He did.

699
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,750
- He's a good cook.
- He knows what to do.

700
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,160
A man who does all the cooking.

701
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,800
It must be delicious.

702
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,670
(Excited)

703
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,670
I'll go...

704
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,680
and see how he's doing.

705
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,180
I don't want to gang up on him.

706
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,210
Maybe just the two of us should go.

707
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,410
- Just two.
- Okay.

708
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,260
How does it look? Is it going well?

709
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,060
Yes, it's better than I expected.

710
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,670
I hope it tastes good.

711
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,740
- It looks delicious.
- It already looks good.

712
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,740
- Do you want some water?
- Yes, I'll have a glass of water.

713
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,810
Thank you.

714
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,020
Ha Neul is certainly more sociable.

715
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,080
She's friendly.

716
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,020
Can I help you with anything?

717
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,420
It's cold.

718
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,800
Do you need a pair of tongs?

719
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,470
Yes, just one. Thanks.

720
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,920
- We have such a reliable chef.
- I know.

721
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,330
- His job might be unexpected, though.
- Right.

722
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,130
He looks like a total chef now,

723
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,860
- He might just be a good cook.
- but he might be a good cook...

724
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,100
- who's a millionaire.
- A millionaire?

725
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,170
- A millionaire who cooks as a hobby.
- Exactly.

726
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,240
(The Florentine steak is
almost ready to be served.)

727
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,420
(He plates it nicely.)

728
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,960
Some olive oil.

729
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,030
(He finishes it
with only olive oil and salt.)

730
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,460
That looks like a proper Italian dish now.

731
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,500
- How should I make it look pretty?
- Put it on top.

732
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
(Thick T-bone steak, Cooked rare,
Olive oil and salt)

733
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,570
Okay.

734
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,330
It's incredible, isn't it?

735
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,770
(The Florentine steak is ready.)

736
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
This is...

737
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,410
pretty hot.

738
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,880
- Don't touch it yet. Just the meat.
- Okay.

739
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,750
(Amazed)

740
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,650
It didn't even take him that long
to cook it.

741
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,320
- I know, right?
- He did it so quickly.

742
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,150
Let's wait.

743
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,290
I'm quite flustered.

744
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,360
- That's...
- It's amazing, right?

745
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,760
(Flustered)

746
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,960
(Her heart flutters.)

747
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,800
(He prepares the next dish immediately.)

748
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,460
- By the way...
- He's so good.

749
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,470
Right?

750
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,300
He's an expert.

751
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,700
(Peeking)

752
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,870
It's gotten cold.

753
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,210
It's gotten too cold.

754
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,940
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

755
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,750
- It's a bit cold,
- That's fine.

756
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,880
so start eating right away.

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,250
- Thank you for the food.
- We really appreciate it.

758
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,720
- I have a question about something else.
- Okay.

759
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,990
Don't the catfish participants
on other dating shows...

760
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,230
just rest?

761
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,230
They normally take a step back
and observe.

762
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,560
Yes, they observe.

763
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,030
But he stepped forward...

764
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,100
- to cook a steak...
- Maybe, he's a steak-eating YouTuber.

765
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,670
These men are pretty jealous.

766
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,070
This isn't jealousy.

767
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,040
Are men who cook well...

768
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,170
attractive to women?

769
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,380
- They are.
- Really?

770
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,240
I'd be so thankful.

771
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,950
- You also brought wine.
- Yes.

772
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,120
(Tough)

773
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,320
He just pulled it out.

774
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,520
(Flustered)

775
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,890
How about I pour you one?

776
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,890
(Glancing)

777
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,360
(Standing up)

778
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,890
(Glancing)

779
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

780
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,500
I've become something of a host.

781
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,300
(Gazing)

782
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,040
- The men will...
- We'll pour ours.

783
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,940
- We'll pour our own glasses.
- We got it.

784
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,880
- It might make him feel bad.
- You guys understand.

785
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,980
That's funny.

786
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,510
(Gazing)

787
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,620
(Staring)

788
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,170
- Do you like it?
- It's delicious.

789
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,270
(Looking)

790
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,910
I think it's a different cut.

791
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,980
Right? It looks tastier.

792
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,660
- You can have two.
- Okay.

793
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,360
- It's a bit rare.
- No, it's perfect.

794
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,230
(Recharging her soul)

795
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,370
(Peeking)

796
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,010
(Eating)

797
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,710
- That's the rare part.
- Yes, it's red.

798
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,210
- The first one?
- Yes.

799
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,220
(Staring)

800
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,750
I'll just have one.

801
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,920
Do you want one?

802
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,890
I'll also take one.

803
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,860
- Do you want some more?
- I have a huge piece.

804
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,700
But you're staring at the steak.

805
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,970
No, this is really good.

806
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,500
(Pleased)

807
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,670
- Take some.
- Sure.

808
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
It's good.

809
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,220
(Exclaiming)

810
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,420
It's tasty.

811
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,190
He's an expert.

812
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,250
It's so good.

813
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,120
The color looks unusual.

814
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,430
It is an unusual color, right?

815
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,670
Barolo suits the palate...

816
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,870
of most Koreans.

817
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,370
He even knows his wine.

818
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,310
Most people would like it
if they got it as a gift.

819
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,440
(Nodding)

820
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,280
I don't know too much about wine, though.

821
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,610
But this one suits my taste.

822
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,980
And it's a special day,

823
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,990
so I went to a nice store...

824
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,320
and got the finest bottle.

825
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,420
(Impressed)

826
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,990
I brought a few.

827
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,500
We should clink our glasses.

828
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,370
Have you gotten a chance
to look around the area?

829
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,170
I like to travel,

830
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,410
so I have come to Florence before.

831
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,980
But I haven't been to this part
of Tuscany.

832
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,150
Why is Ji Won touching her hair so often?
It worries me.

833
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,350
- She is.
- I heard the sunset was beautiful.

834
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,380
- It is.
- It is.

835
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,190
But I don't know much about Florence
as I just went by the region.

836
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,660
I'd like to get to know the place
while I'm here.

837
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,290
(Staring)

838
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,990
Do you usually eat breakfast?

839
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,100
I try to eat a day's worth of protein.

840
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,230
(Nodding)

841
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,870
That's my goal.

842
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,270
I think we can top it up
only if you drink it more.

843
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,710
(Laughing)

844
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Have some more.

845
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,980
(When Night Fell, the Mafia...)

846
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,180
(The residents gathered in the Sunset Room
after dinner.)

847
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,950
Was this the one that he bought?

848
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,950
- Yes.
- Yes.

849
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,860
The chef... I mean, not the chef.

850
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,320
- I meant Chang Hwan.
- We did.

851
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,430
- We bought it.
- I see.

852
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,290
- We also bought some stuff.
- I see.

853
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,830
We didn't come empty-handed.

854
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,560
(Chuckling)

855
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,130
We also bought this white wine.

856
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,300
- Right.
- You guys are sensitive.

857
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,740
Don't we already know his job?
He's a chef.

858
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,640
- Are you really a chef?
- He is.

859
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,780
- He wouldn't have made it so obvious.
- I appreciate...

860
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
your kind words.

861
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,350
(Glancing)

862
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,650
He seems like an international lawyer
who deals with the mafia.

863
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,290
That's wildly specific.

864
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,620
It just popped into my head.

865
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,690
That's funny.

866
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,030
- Like the show "Vincenzo."
- Yes, that exact show occurred to me.

867
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,460
That means he was nearby.

868
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,600
He must have been in Sicily.

869
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
(Looking)

870
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,500
(Curious)

871
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,470
None of you have guessed...

872
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,540
my job correctly.

873
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,250
That's interesting. Not one?

874
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,310
Are you jobless?

875
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,680
Jobless? That's not a bad guess.

876
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,750
I like the sound of that.

877
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,820
- That'd be great.
- I like that.

878
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,620
Maybe he's a millionaire.

879
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,120
- Maybe he is.
- And he cooks as a hobby.

880
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,430
I think he has an unusual job.

881
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
He must. Or...

882
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,300
it's not a job that comes up
in day-to-day conversations.

883
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,700
This is interesting.

884
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,370
- Goodness.
- They must be dying to know.

885
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,980
All right. The catfish has appeared.

886
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,680
He gives off a strong masculine energy.

887
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,750
A catfish that suits the expectations
of Heart Pairing.

888
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,750
- Yes.
- True.

889
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,420
I was impressed by
how he bought the steak.

890
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,360
- He got a pretty thick cut too.
- Right.

891
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
That felt so masculine to me.

892
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,060
He put that thick cut of meat
on a frying pan,

893
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
- and he looked so manly.
- Yes.

894
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,230
I'm going to grow a beard
and cook a steak once I get home.

895
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,840
(You're funny.)

896
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,340
I am curious about his job.

897
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,640
(I still hope he's a food YouTuber.)

898
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,170
I mean, Ji Min keeps provoking him.

899
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,980
I wonder if he's jobless or not.

900
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,080
Yes.

901
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,680
- He's unemployed or...
- Either unemployed or an heir.

902
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,320
I can't wait to find out who he is.

903
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,790
(It's the third morning...)

904
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,220
(at the Pairing House.)

905
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,930
(Contemplating)

906
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,360
Oh, no.

907
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,070
I like someone with
an upward curve of the lips.

908
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,800
That goes up like this.

909
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,800
It's hard to explain in words.

910
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,070
He's suddenly smiling.

911
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,570
He's working hard.

912
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,650
(Eyeing carefully)

913
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,550
Someone who seems upright and decent.

914
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,550
(Twitching his lips)

915
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,550
- That's right.
- You seem to like those who are decorous.

916
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,330
(A morning that has him thinking)

917
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,390
- Hello.
- Hi.

918
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,830
- Did you sleep well?
- What about you?

919
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,130
- It was my first night, so...
- Wasn't it cold?

920
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,170
Is there anything you want to do today?

921
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,840
- He's proactive.
- Maybe you want to go somewhere.

922
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,900
That's it.

923
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,240
What comes to mind
when I think of Italy is...

924
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,270
- What is it?
- Gelato.

925
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,340
- Right, gelato.
- We should at least get some of that.

926
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,280
- Chang Hwan strikes up a conversation.
- What do you say?

927
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,650
Do you want to see the city?

928
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,720
- The city? I'd love that.
- It'd be nice to walk around.

929
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,050
We can see the Florence Cathedral.

930
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,120
(Second outing in Italy)

931
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,730
Are they all going together?

932
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,430
(With excitement in their hearts,
they finish getting ready.)

933
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,730
(Je Yeon waits for Woo Jae.)

934
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,040
(He sees her.)

935
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,010
- That suits you.
- Really?

936
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,340
- It does.
- He complimented her.

937
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
- And the pants?
- "That suits you."

938
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,580
- That as well.
- Really?

939
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
- What about my top?
- That suits you too.

940
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,610
Thanks.

941
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,250
Are you kidding me with this weather?

942
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,920
- It's pretty.
- Even the weather is nice.

943
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,990
(Nice weather)

944
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,420
- This is so nice.
- No way.

945
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,060
Everyone looks amazing.

946
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,220
This is crazy.

947
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,930
We should take
a lot of photos of each other.

948
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,460
You're right.

949
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,900
Drive safely.

950
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,430
Okay. Safe driving.

951
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,840
It's so pretty.

952
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,140
(They're off on their first outing
to Florence.)

953
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,940
It's even prettier
with the weather being this nice.

954
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,010
Right?

955
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,980
It wasn't like this yesterday.

956
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,050
- I know.
- Right.

957
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,420
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

958
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,580
Woo Jae and Ji Won.

959
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,920
- It's close by.
- We'll be there soon.

960
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,720
The road's pretty as well.

961
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,390
- Doesn't this scenery excite you?
- It does.

962
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,860
They look good together as well.

963
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,960
Woo Jae chose Ji Won
in the first episode, right?

964
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,030
- This is stunning.
- I agree.

965
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,900
- Is that what we're crossing?
- Yes, over there.

966
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,970
- It'll be incredible.
- Right?

967
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,400
- Right.
- But it's not the golden bridge.

968
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,340
Look how dreamy this is.

969
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,810
This sure is incredible.

970
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,980
Even this place is stunning.

971
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,510
All the guys are tall and handsome.

972
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,850
- I feel like a fool.
- What do you want to do?

973
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,620
Have coffee?

974
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,450
I have been craving iced Americano.

975
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,450
It's a puppy.

976
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,790
- How adorable.
- How adorable.

977
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,890
- I haven't seen...
- I know.

978
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,890
such a small one in a while.

979
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,360
Je Yeon, put on your coat.

980
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
- This?
- Yes.

981
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,660
Maybe a bit later.

982
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,900
- It'll be exhausting.
- Really?

983
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,930
Ji Min...

984
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,100
You'll catch a cold.

985
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,430
He's looking out for her.

986
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,970
Ji Min's not one to hide his feelings.

987
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,670
That's cute.

988
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,910
Won't it be amusing to live on a bridge?

989
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,440
It's adorable to see them walk
in a straight line.

990
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,510
Is this all right?

991
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,150
That's so cool.

992
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
I'm jealous.

993
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,790
That's the kind of life I dream of living.

994
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,390
- Why?
- You know...

995
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,790
(Peaceful)

996
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,190
A peaceful life.

997
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,870
- Should I take one of you like that?
- What? Gosh, no.

998
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,970
I still can't muster up that much courage.

999
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,000
- Is it too soon?
- I'm afraid so.

1000
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,870
Woo Jae's been talking a lot
to Je Yeon today.

1001
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,940
That's true.

1002
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,510
(The road they walk together)

1003
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,550
Where are we headed?

1004
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,280
The plaza I enjoyed
when I was here ten years ago.

1005
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,490
- Are you going alone?
- What?

1006
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,090
I haven't thought about it yet.

1007
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,120
- Really?
- Yes.

1008
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,660
- Can I join you?
- Sounds good.

1009
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,190
- "Can I join you?"
- That's great.

1010
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,960
Around sunset.

1011
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,630
I wanted to look at the sky.

1012
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,900
- Are you two going together, then?
- Yes.

1013
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,170
You should head out first.

1014
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,170
- Shall we?
- Sure.

1015
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,270
- Right.
- Sure thing.

1016
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,340
Have fun.

1017
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,270
- Bye.
- See you later.

1018
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,810
(Ji Won and Ji Min head out first.)

1019
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,750
(Staring)

1020
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,280
- Goodness.
- Have a good time.

1021
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,520
Use this too.

1022
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,260
Have it all.

1023
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,430
Didn't Ji Min seem bitter when he left?

1024
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,330
Yes, he glanced at Je Yeon.

1025
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,400
- Right.
- Right.

1026
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,300
But Ji Won must've been thrilled.

1027
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,970
- Right.
- Of course, she was excited.

1028
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,740
- You probably have your hopes up.
- I don't.

1029
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,940
It'll probably be good
no matter where we are.

1030
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,370
You haven't been to Italy before?

1031
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,110
This is my first time in Europe.

1032
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,540
- Really?
- Yes.

1033
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,980
That's why everything fascinates me.

1034
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,310
It's her first time in Europe.

1035
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,280
(It's her first time in Europe,
and everything fascinates her.)

1036
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,720
This is my favorite country to visit.

1037
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,550
So you're at a place you love.

1038
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,690
And that's because of this place.

1039
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,390
I'm looking forward to it even more now.

1040
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,930
It's great in Florence
no matter where we are.

1041
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,000
- Is that tea?
- I think it's chocolate.

1042
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,340
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

1043
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,440
- Shall we head inside?
- Sounds good.

1044
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,840
(A sweet dessert shop
with a Christmas vibe)

1045
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,970
I thought you weren't fond
of these things.

1046
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,310
I wouldn't say that exactly.

1047
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,180
Why don't we buy a few for fun?

1048
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,310
Sounds good.

1049
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,820
The color I want...

1050
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,220
What would be tasty?

1051
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,690
What is he up to with his phone?

1052
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,290
- Did you bring your wallet?
- I did.

1053
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,060
- Can I keep my card in there?
- Sure.

1054
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,400
- Goodness.
- This is what I should use all day.

1055
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,030
- Right.
- He thought they'd be staying together.

1056
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,500
I... Hold on.

1057
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,040
Ha Neul has my credit card.

1058
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,740
We can charge it on mine.

1059
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,940
Talk about an embarrassing moment.

1060
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,110
- This is embarrassing.
- Don't be.

1061
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,150
This is grabbing my attention.

1062
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,510
- I'm getting this.
- I thought about getting that too.

1063
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,450
- Right?
- We should have this.

1064
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,050
- Maybe not.
- These will do.

1065
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,750
- Why?
- This seems better.

1066
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,850
I'll have this instead.

1067
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,060
- We can't share this.
- I'll buy this, then.

1068
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,590
We can. Let's have half each.

1069
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,590
- How?
- Would that be weird?

1070
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,190
Kind of. Have this, then.

1071
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,490
- Got it.
- We'll both have this.

1072
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,600
This means I can't even get you coffee.

1073
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,830
That's fine. It'll be on me today.

1074
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,570
- You can treat me next time.
- Sure.

1075
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,970
- Does that sound good?
- Okay.

1076
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,700
- That's nice.
- I like how you think.

1077
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,510
Did his being embarrassed
help him out in this case?

1078
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,210
Well, because of it...

1079
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,940
- Something happened.
- That became a fun story for them.

1080
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,180
This could lead to Ji Min...

1081
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,280
- Right.
- treating her some other day.

1082
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,950
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1083
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,020
I'll take that.

1084
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,320
- I'll enjoy it.
- Sure.

1085
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,590
It'd be nice to have with coffee.

1086
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,730
Sounds nice.

1087
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,930
Ji Won's fine with everything.

1088
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,760
We'll take a turn up there.

1089
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,500
- Ji Won's quite tall.
- She's like a model.

1090
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,400
- Ji Min's on the taller side too.
- Are you cold?

1091
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,370
It's a little chilly,
so let's hurry inside.

1092
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,170
We can stay for that coffee.

1093
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,870
I'd like that.

1094
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,270
- Since you're cold.
- Right. Sounds good.

1095
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,340
- It's this place.
- Is this it?

1096
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,750
There's a busker.

1097
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,950
Hold on. Is this right?

1098
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,250
I think it'll definitely
be prettier at night.

1099
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,950
Yes, I think this is it.

1100
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,490
(The plaza Ji Min cherishes)

1101
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,400
(Today, he walks it with Ji Won.)

1102
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,960
Right here.

1103
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,570
- Look.
- I see.

1104
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,600
(While looking around,
they shortly arrive at the cafe.)

1105
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,770
This is the place.

1106
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,310
This must be the Florence Cathedral.

1107
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,040
It's beautiful.

1108
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,480
(Snapping)

1109
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,580
What would be a pretty angle?

1110
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,580
I found it.

1111
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,450
(Close)

1112
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,150
- What's that?
- Why am I so bad at this?

1113
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,660
- No way.
- Yours are better than mine.

1114
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1115
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm proud to hear that.

1116
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,360
(A gentle gaze)

1117
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,670
(Remembering this very moment)

1118
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,070
(First outing in Florence)

1119
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,770
It's safe to say I take worse photos.

1120
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,670
(First outing in Florence,
Ji Min's favorite)

1121
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,740
(While they were taking photos,
their coffee was brewed.)

1122
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,040
I have a feeling this will be good.

1123
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,650
(Taking a sip)

1124
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
(Exclaiming)

1125
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,650
- That's cute.
- How adorable.

1126
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,120
It's delicious.

1127
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,960
(Deeply touched)

1128
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,290
- My body's now relaxed.
- My body melted.

1129
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,200
Ji Min's adorable.

1130
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,460
- It warms you right up.
- My body just melted.

1131
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,630
(It warms you right up.)

1132
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,870
It's really good.

1133
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,140
What's your go-to coffee?

1134
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,870
- Latte or Americano.
- I see.

1135
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,380
I like vanilla lattes.

1136
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,750
Vanilla latte. That was in the book.

1137
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,210
(I've been holding back on having
vanilla latte, which is my favorite.)

1138
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1139
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,320
- It might not be me.
- Then...

1140
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,990
He failed to play it cool.

1141
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,490
Does that mean...

1142
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,760
- This is Ji Min.
- This is Ji Min.

1143
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,230
Ji Min is Mr. Brown.

1144
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,260
If he would invite me,
the book was enough...

1145
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,230
- to get me to his wedding.
- How so?

1146
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,430
There were...

1147
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,870
a lot of things in here
that Korean men could relate to.

1148
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,570
- Which part exactly?
- It was extremely realistic.

1149
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,840
One of the songs
he wants to play for his partner...

1150
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,550
is "Forgetful" by Yoon Jong Shin.

1151
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,610
He's a fan of my songs.

1152
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,250
He must've experienced a painful love.

1153
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,750
Your heart aches,
listening to "Forgetful."

1154
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,090
- You should attend his wedding.
- Of course.

1155
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,960
What color was that book?

1156
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,160
I remember the answer, but...

1157
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,900
That's cute.

1158
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,200
What was the question?

1159
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,330
Maybe I'm wrong.

1160
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,270
Why am I confused about this?

1161
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,170
- It's all jumbled.
- Same here.

1162
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,440
- Right.
- I'm confused too.

1163
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,970
- But he got caught.
- Goodness.

1164
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,310
That's adorable.

1165
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,350
I'll let you know some other time.

1166
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,580
- Exactly.
- I have a feeling...

1167
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,650
- this might go somewhere.
- Right.

1168
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,720
(Ji Min was able to avert a crisis.)

1169
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,390
(Gazing)

1170
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,430
There is no fine dust here.

1171
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,600
Tell me about it.

1172
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,030
Why haven't you traveled to Europe?

1173
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,530
I...

1174
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,870
I fantasized about Europe.

1175
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,210
- In what way?
- Well,

1176
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,170
Europe seemed...

1177
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,810
- A honeymoon destination?
- Not like that.

1178
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,250
How should I put it?

1179
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,650
I wanted to go to Europe...

1180
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,650
with someone I liked enough
to think about marrying.

1181
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,850
How should I say this?

1182
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,820
- But you're here now.
- I know.

1183
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,320
Traveling to Europe means a lot to her,
then.

1184
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,090
- And we just met.
- I know.

1185
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,790
That was Europe for me,

1186
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,730
so I traveled to other countries first...

1187
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,900
and put off coming here.

1188
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,870
But this time around,
an opportunity presented itself.

1189
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,140
(Traveling to Europe
is more meaningful to Ji Won.)

1190
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,200
(A new guest)

1191
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,840
- Check it out.
- How can it be that big?

1192
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,270
I hate pigeons.

1193
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,680
- I hate pigeons too.
- I loathe them.

1194
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,740
Same here. They give me the creeps.

1195
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,680
- In Korea...
- I hope it doesn't come here.

1196
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,450
- Korean pigeons are fearless.
- I know.

1197
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,150
But that one...

1198
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,420
No, please don't.

1199
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,120
That looks even more fearless.

1200
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,960
You need to let me know if it approaches.

1201
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,960
You might be better off not knowing.
Don't you agree?

1202
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,130
She's teasing him.

1203
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,930
(Cooing)

1204
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,200
(Now, it joined their table.)

1205
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, dear.

1206
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,040
Have you traveled a lot alone?

1207
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,340
(Pigeon attack!)

1208
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,740
Please don't.

1209
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,680
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1210
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,320
I thought it was going to
launch itself at me.

1211
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,650
Ji Won laughs a lot...

1212
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,120
- to what others say.
- I know.

1213
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,320
Shall we head inside?

1214
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,860
Sounds good.

1215
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,460
I like this moment they're sharing.

1216
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,230
I like Ji Min more,
now that I know more about him.

1217
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,100
- He has a clumsy side.
- Right.

1218
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,700
I was worried it might come in.

1219
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,030
- That would've been hilarious.
- Imagine it sitting here.

1220
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,440
I would've fainted.

1221
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,770
I'm not embarrassed to admit that.

1222
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,110
I'm fragile, you see.

1223
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,380
- I like that. They went...
- You're allowed to with pigeons.

1224
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,410
from sitting across each other...

1225
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,580
to sitting in a way they can share a view.

1226
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,450
I bet you studied engineering.

1227
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,850
No.

1228
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,650
I think Ji Won has fallen for him a bit.

1229
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,220
You did.

1230
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,420
It's a little... No.

1231
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,260
- Little but no?
- Right.

1232
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,960
That's funny.

1233
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,360
I wasn't expecting that.

1234
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,300
What did you guess as my profession?

1235
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,370
- A trader.
- A trader.

1236
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,500
What about me?

1237
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,210
- An art teacher.
- An art teacher?

1238
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,070
But now I know it's not what you do.

1239
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,310
It's not?

1240
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,750
You seem to simply work at an office.

1241
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,680
Although I can't tell
which department you're in.

1242
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,720
Also...

1243
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,960
(Sighing)

1244
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,230
What does that expression imply?

1245
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
Right, Je Yeon.

1246
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,300
- Her name's hard to remember.
- I know.

1247
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,240
The names, Ji Won and Ha Neul,

1248
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,140
- are familiar to me.
- Right.

1249
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,370
But Je Yeon doesn't roll off the tongue.

1250
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,640
I tried hard to memorize her name.

1251
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,180
However...

1252
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,050
Anyway, Je Yeon seems like...

1253
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,550
she works in an office.

1254
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,050
I don't think she does anything unique.

1255
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,190
- Stop talking about Je Yeon.
- He keeps talking about Je Yeon.

1256
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,090
I bet she has a placid life.

1257
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,160
- Why would he bring her up?
- That's enough.

1258
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,330
Stop right there.

1259
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,930
- That's possible.
- That's the feeling I got.

1260
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,840
What now?

1261
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,010
(Gazing)

1262
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,350
(Silence falls upon them
after their talk about Je Yeon.)

1263
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,350
By the way,

1264
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,350
aren't things less awkward now
between the women?

1265
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,590
It's kind of hard to
drop the honorifics...

1266
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,060
- since we don't know our age.
- Yes, that's true.

1267
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,500
I'm going to keep on using honorifics.

1268
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,300
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

1269
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,800
No reason.

1270
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,800
Are you drawing a line?

1271
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,300
I'm just...

1272
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,470
not going to.

1273
00:53:58,770 --> 00:53:59,970
Seriously?

1274
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,510
Of course, I'm joking.

1275
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,920
You could actually be way older than me.

1276
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,650
Do I seem old to you?

1277
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,950
That's not what I meant.

1278
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,590
I could be four years younger than you.

1279
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,160
What would you do?

1280
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,390
What else?

1281
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,460
You'll address me as someone older.

1282
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,660
You seem like a prankster.

1283
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,830
- Me?
- Yes.

1284
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,230
You're right.

1285
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,700
Ji Won has a great smile.

1286
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,400
- She sure does.
- Right.

1287
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,210
To be continued.

1288
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,650
As you know,

1289
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,550
this is our third day.

1290
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,350
Because of that,

1291
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,390
although it's been short...

1292
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,390
How is it for you?

1293
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,760
What do you mean?

1294
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,430
Are you glad you came here?

1295
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,600
- Did someone catch my attention?
- Yes.

1296
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,140
- I think someone did.
- Really?

1297
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,670
- What about you?
- Me?

1298
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,610
- Someone caught my attention too.
- Really?

1299
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,940
If there hadn't been,

1300
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,950
I would've gone to bed earlier.

1301
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,280
Earlier?

1302
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,420
Who did you text?

1303
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,550
- Me?
- Yes.

1304
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,860
- I...
- Ji Won's bolder than I thought.

1305
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,120
(Curious)

1306
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,830
I haven't been able
to get closer to anyone,

1307
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,400
so I sent the text,

1308
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,400
- figuring what she'd be like.
- You guessed?

1309
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,740
She had this vibe that I liked.

1310
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,370
You didn't inform us
of that vibe yesterday.

1311
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,640
How should I put it?

1312
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,640
First of all,
I dislike people who make light of things.

1313
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,410
Is that so?

1314
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,190
Are you sending messages?

1315
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,390
Messages?

1316
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,720
- What made you choose?
- Me?

1317
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
(Curious)

1318
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,430
I need to get to know someone...

1319
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:04,060
before I can get interested in him.

1320
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,700
Is it someone you spoke the most with?

1321
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,940
- The one who had the most conversation...
- On the first day...

1322
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,410
(Hesitating)

1323
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,550
(On the first night)

1324
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,280
(Ji Won sent a text to Ji Min.)

1325
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,820
It was someone I was attracted to.

1326
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,920
Was it someone with a pretty smile?

1327
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,490
Isn't that what you said yesterday?

1328
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,890
Right.

1329
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,760
Someone with a large mouth.

1330
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,000
It's more like someone
with a beautiful smile.

1331
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,670
- Soft and warm.
- Soft and warm?

1332
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,800
Soft and warm?

1333
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,770
It's more like...

1334
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,510
He looks like a nice person.
I don't know. I felt something from him.

1335
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,080
Nice?

1336
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,410
As soon as I heard that, I could guess...

1337
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,780
whom you would choose.

1338
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,690
To me, Chan Hyeong is...

1339
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,320
the warmest and the nicest.

1340
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,820
I didn't say that he was soft and warm.

1341
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,960
I mean, someone who's kind.

1342
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,660
Someone who probably took the high road?

1343
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,070
That's not the impression I got.

1344
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,870
- I mean...
- He might be drawing the line.

1345
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:14,970
- Right.
- Gosh.

1346
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,540
Don't do that to Ji Won.

1347
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,070
I mean...

1348
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,810
How should I put it?

1349
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,820
(She tries to hint at something.)

1350
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,980
She looks disappointed.

1351
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,220
He looks like someone very considerate.

1352
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,120
That's the impression I got from him.

1353
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,930
Do I look considerate?

1354
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,330
(Nodding)

1355
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,330
- You're forcing it.
- But everyone...

1356
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,570
Everyone looks very kind.

1357
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,130
The way you reacted was...

1358
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,170
the same as when
Ha Neul suggested going jogging.

1359
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,940
(On the first day,
Ha Neul suggested going jogging with her.)

1360
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,340
(Nodding)

1361
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,040
Will you work out with me?

1362
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,650
- Your nodding seemed a little forced.
- That's it.

1363
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,680
(Reenacting)

1364
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,480
(Embarrassed)

1365
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,490
That's not true.

1366
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,390
- Someone who looks considerate.
- He seems to draw a line.

1367
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,900
Why doesn't he recognize a gem like her?

1368
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,900
- We find Ji Won very charming.
- Yes.

1369
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,470
It's obvious that Ji Won likes Ji Min.

1370
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,470
Now that it's evening, it will get colder.

1371
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,140
I get cold easily.

1372
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,510
Is it hard to sightsee right now?

1373
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,610
Right now?

1374
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,550
It's starting to get hard.

1375
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,020
- This place looks beautiful.
- Florence Cathedral.

1376
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,250
Actually, this is a photo spot.

1377
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,760
We already took photos up there.

1378
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,590
(Indifferent)

1379
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,430
- Are you not interested?
- Yes.

1380
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,430
Right?

1381
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,460
You're so easygoing.

1382
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,670
To be honest, I love streets like this.

1383
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,130
- Me too, but it's so cold.
- Are you cold?

1384
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,400
My eyes are tearing up.

1385
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,470
Both my eyes and nose are runny.

1386
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,440
My nose isn't runny yet.

1387
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,080
You just sniffled.

1388
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,810
They make a great couple.

1389
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,780
- My tears.
- Your tears are coming out of your nose.

1390
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,050
Everyone likes making fun of me.

1391
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,250
No way.

1392
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,520
By the way, it doesn't feel awkward.

1393
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,620
- Between us?
- Yes.

1394
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,000
- It could feel uncomfortable.
- Of course.

1395
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,260
I don't feel uncomfortable.

1396
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,430
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't feel uncomfortable either.

1397
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,370
Sometimes,
feeling uncomfortable is necessary.

1398
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,280
- Really?
- With the opposite sex.

1399
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,050
Are you drawing a line?

1400
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,380
That's not what I meant.

1401
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,580
- It's true.
- You're lying.

1402
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,050
- It's not what I meant.
- Oh, no.

1403
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,750
I won't go to your wedding.

1404
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,960
Feeling uncomfortable
could be a type of tension.

1405
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,330
Here's what I meant.

1406
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,830
Although we met for the first time,

1407
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,730
it's neither very awkward
nor uncomfortable.

1408
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,460
Sometimes, it can be suffocating.

1409
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,530
Right.

1410
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,400
This is this place.

1411
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
(They arrive at the next destination
while talking.)

1412
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,870
(Impressed)

1413
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,840
They look so cute.

1414
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,640
(Be careful.)

1415
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,520
(They arrive at the pizza restaurant
that Ji Won wanted to try.)

1416
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,590
Thank you.

1417
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,990
There's a brazier.

1418
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,660
- Right.
- It's oven pizza.

1419
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,600
She looks pretty.

1420
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,700
She has a face
that girls would also notice.

1421
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,070
(Looking around)

1422
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:34,000
Ji Min is also handsome and charming.

1423
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,470
I'm so hungry.

1424
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,980
Thank you.

1425
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,780
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

1426
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,050
- I'll get the Margherita pizza.
- Let's start with that.

1427
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,820
Why don't we get 1 pasta
and 1 Margherita pizza...

1428
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,050
so we can share them?

1429
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,320
- That sounds good.
- Is there any pasta?

1430
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,690
It's on this page.

1431
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,690
Do you want to try carbonara?

1432
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,560
- That sounds good.
- Are you okay with it?

1433
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,060
- Let's try it.
- Great.

1434
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,530
(Peeking)

1435
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,940
Isn't it rude to raise our hand
and call the waiter?

1436
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,200
- That's what I heard in Europe.
- I'll give him a look.

1437
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,810
Try it with your look.

1438
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,670
- Are you ready?
- He's here.

1439
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,310
- Yes, we're ready.
- Okay.

1440
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,350
One Margherita and one carbonara.

1441
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,350
- It sounds delicious.
- They're cute together.

1442
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,880
(Laughing)

1443
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,150
(Excited)

1444
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,620
(Meanwhile,
the pizza is being baked in the brazier.)

1445
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,660
It looks delicious.

1446
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,830
It's more delicious after being so hungry.

1447
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,960
Of course. One bite could be enough
to make you feel better.

1448
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:37,230
I only had breakfast that you made.

1449
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,530
- You must be hungry.
- I don't like baguettes.

1450
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,770
I prefer to eat soft bread.

1451
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:45,970
Otherwise, my teeth hurt.

1452
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,370
This is good.

1453
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,740
I didn't like it very much.

1454
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,610
I prefer fish-shaped bun.

1455
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,080
I love fish-shaped bun.

1456
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,620
Do you live near a fish-shaped bun stall?

1457
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,050
Yes.

1458
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,580
What type of fish-shaped bun do you like?

1459
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,120
If I have to choose between the two,
I'd pick red bean.

1460
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,190
- Red bean?
- Yes.

1461
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,220
Do you prefer chou?

1462
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,860
Yes.

1463
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,760
You like what children like.

1464
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,760
(That's unfair.)

1465
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,960
You should respect my preference.

1466
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,830
Then I can eat the entire red bean bun.

1467
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,500
- She's flirting.
- After buying two?

1468
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,140
(Their orders are served.)

1469
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,810
Thank you.

1470
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,480
Is that pizza?

1471
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,710
Carbonara was a pizza too.

1472
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,320
(Two pizzas are served.)

1473
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,790
We ordered two pizzas.

1474
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,250
Thank you.

1475
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
Why is carbonara a pizza?

1476
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,390
(A culture shock)

1477
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,360
- It's unbelievable.
- This is better.

1478
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,960
- I thought that it was pasta.
- I didn't know about carbonara pizza.

1479
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,360
We should check next time.

1480
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,470
Both of them are understanding.

1481
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,570
(It's fun cutting Italian pizzas.)

1482
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,140
It's fun to cut it ourselves.

1483
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,280
(Humming)

1484
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,710
It must be so delicious.

1485
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:00,110
It's not tasty only because I'm hungry.

1486
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,850
- Objectively speaking, it's delicious.
- Yes.

1487
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,890
You can't find pizza like this in Korea.

1488
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,860
Never.

1489
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,530
(Filling his mouth)

1490
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,930
What do you think?

1491
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,430
- This is better.
- Really?

1492
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,570
- The look on her face is so cute.
- It's delicious.

1493
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,370
It seems better than pasta,
although I haven't tried it.

1494
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,410
When I came to Europe for the first time,

1495
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:35,320
I wanted to try carbonara, and I did.

1496
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,490
- It was too salty.
- Right.

1497
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,190
It might be better as pizza.

1498
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,390
(It's nice.)

1499
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,160
- How cute.
- How cute.

1500
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,030
The look in Ji Won's eyes
says that she likes him.

1501
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,230
She's also confident.

1502
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,400
(Their night in Italy gets deeper.)

1503
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,340
I wonder what the others are doing.

1504
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Yes.

1505
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,140
I wonder how they split up into groups.

1506
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,650
Right.

1507
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,750
How do you feel?

1508
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,790
We only have a few more days in Italy.

1509
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:19,130
Is there anyone else you want to talk to
while we're in Italy?

1510
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,960
He's right in front of her.

1511
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,660
Excluding today,
we only have two days left.

1512
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,700
You're right.

1513
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,100
We have two days left,

1514
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,100
and one day, we have to stay as a group.

1515
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,670
Okay, I'd say Je Yeon.

1516
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:33,910
- I see.
- Yes.

1517
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,780
(Bummed out)

1518
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:40,980
I got it.

1519
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,750
She said, "I got it."

1520
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,590
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1521
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,820
He didn't have to bring up Je Yeon.

1522
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,020
- Right.
- For me...

1523
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,860
Woo Jae seems to know a lot about Italy.

1524
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,430
Because he looks kind?

1525
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,500
- Everyone looks kind.
- Because he looks...

1526
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,540
- kinder than others?
- "Kinder than others?"

1527
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:05,910
Yes.

1528
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,140
She must be so disappointed.

1529
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,580
We'll have time again tomorrow.

1530
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
Tomorrow?

1531
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,320
Is there anything you want to do?

1532
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,090
What are you doing tomorrow?

1533
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,160
What I want to do?

1534
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,060
(Staring)

1535
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,260
Instead of going to the suburb
like yesterday,

1536
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,370
I prefer places...

1537
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,700
where you can see
many architectural buildings.

1538
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,270
I'd like to walk around.

1539
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,640
When it gets tiring, I'd go into a cafe...

1540
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,870
or a restaurant.

1541
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,640
That would be fun.

1542
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,780
Like today?

1543
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,220
Like today but dressed more warmly.

1544
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,850
That's a good idea.

1545
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,990
That's what I hope for.

1546
01:05:58,930 --> 01:05:59,960
That's great.

1547
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,500
(With more time,
will her feelings be noticed?)

1548
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,400
I can't understand Ji Min at all.

1549
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:10,170
Since my first meeting
with the production crew,

1550
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,740
whoever wrote the brown Pairing Book...

1551
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,910
- Mr. Brown?
- Mr. Brown.

1552
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,680
If I got invited to his wedding, I'd go.

1553
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,310
I was rooting for him that much.

1554
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,250
Actually, I thought that...

1555
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,480
it could mean that he's a good person.

1556
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,190
If he enjoyed being popular,

1557
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,490
he wouldn't have had to do that.

1558
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,560
In a way,

1559
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,830
he likes her as a person.

1560
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,060
He wants the best for her.

1561
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,460
(Thinking)

1562
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,770
It sounds hollow,
but maybe it's because he's nice.

1563
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,800
That's what I thought.

1564
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,770
Leading someone on is the worst.

1565
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:45,770
(I see.)

1566
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:49,140
Making the other person give up quickly.

1567
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,880
Such honesty could shine.

1568
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,110
Do you think that's what Ji Min is doing?

1569
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,780
That's what I think.

1570
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,820
Let's be honest.

1571
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,250
"Who are you to draw the line already?"

1572
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,650
- That's how I would feel.
- Right.

1573
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,460
- They're getting to know each other.
- She never said...

1574
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,520
that she had feelings for him.

1575
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,560
They don't even know
what everyone does for a living.

1576
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,630
- Right.
- Right.

1577
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,900
Without knowing that...

1578
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,830
- It can be better to keep it open.
- Right.

1579
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,730
It's better to take time
and get to know each other.

1580
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,770
In other words,

1581
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:17,640
Ji Min is much more interested
in Je Yeon than we think.

1582
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,070
More than we think.

1583
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,610
- Shall we go to the Duomo first?
- Okay.

1584
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,710
There's a place called
Piazzale Michelangelo.

1585
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,050
It's very beautiful there.

1586
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,980
- Let's go there too if we can.
- That sounds good.

1587
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,280
Woo Jae and Je Yeon are on a date.

1588
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,850
It's this way.

1589
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,120
It's not so far away.

1590
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:38,530
Great.

1591
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,060
Okay.

1592
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,190
(Anticipating)

1593
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,560
I should look up some pizza restaurants.

1594
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,030
Woo Jae is charming.

1595
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,270
(Surprised)

1596
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,540
- Shall we go here?
- Yes.

1597
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,070
You're a Type J.

1598
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,240
- The judging type.
- The judging type.

1599
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,910
- It's nice.
- I like it.

1600
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,840
How do I capture the screen?

1601
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,980
- I can tell that she likes him.
- For now...

1602
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,780
(Je Yeon captures the screen.)

1603
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,880
Capture it first.

1604
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,950
Next, I'll look up cafes.

1605
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,360
(They want to do a lot today.)

1606
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,160
A car is coming.

1607
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,060
(Striding)

1608
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,200
It's Christmas season.

1609
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,700
- Most places...
- There is decoration...

1610
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,540
on every street.

1611
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,270
A Christmas market would be so pretty.

1612
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,310
Yes.

1613
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,680
It's open for about a month.

1614
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,180
Florence is known...

1615
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,880
for its leather.

1616
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,950
- Leather?
- Yes.

1617
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,320
Leather is famous here.

1618
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,220
There will be a lot of places like this.

1619
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,250
Really?

1620
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,790
Leather markets are very famous.

1621
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,190
- He knows everything.
- It's high quality.

1622
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,230
Really?

1623
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,130
He's good now.

1624
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

1625
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

1626
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,230
Hi.

1627
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,800
Je Yeon loves it.

1628
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,840
I couldn't take any photos yesterday.

1629
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,070
It's huge.

1630
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,240
When taking photos in Europe,
the sky should be in the background.

1631
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,680
Bubbles?

1632
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,580
- Gosh.
- They're pretty.

1633
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,580
(At that time,)

1634
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:12,690
(bubbles fly in the wind.)

1635
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,120
- The child looks cute.
- Yes.

1636
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:17,820
Is that a merry-go-round?

1637
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,430
What's that?

1638
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,100
- Or is it for Christmas?
- It's for Christmas.

1639
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,770
No one is riding it.

1640
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,130
I guess you can't get on it.

1641
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,870
- You can see that it's possible.
- Is it?

1642
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,640
I didn't know Je Yeon was that talkative.

1643
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,640
(You're right.)

1644
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,340
- They're so lovey-dovey.
- I agree.

1645
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,840
No one is riding it.

1646
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,210
I guess you can't get on it.

1647
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,710
- You can see that it's possible.
- Is it?

1648
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,910
- There's a child with her dad.
- I see.

1649
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,250
- Do you want to ride it?
- Yes.

1650
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,550
- Really?
- You don't?

1651
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,450
- Gosh, the look in her eyes.
- Are you confident?

1652
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,850
- What?
- Are you confident?

1653
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:47,750
Are you confident about that?

1654
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,520
It'd be strange if he didn't like...

1655
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,720
- the look in her eyes.
- Do you want to go?

1656
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,590
Are you going to make me ride it alone?

1657
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,700
I'd like that.

1658
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,230
I can take photos of you.

1659
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,530
- Shall we just watch?
- Let's just look.

1660
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,570
Okay.

1661
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,770
It'd be better
if many people were riding it.

1662
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,210
That's not the case.

1663
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,110
- The child looks cute.
- Yes.

1664
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:14,780
(Touching)

1665
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:23,090
(It feels like
they became children again.)

1666
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,390
(Approaching)

1667
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,860
- What do you think?
- What?

1668
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,560
What do you think? Does it look okay?

1669
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,930
It'd look better in the evening.

1670
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:34,430
- At night? With lights.
- With lights.

1671
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,700
(Approaching)

1672
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,440
The photo looks hazy.

1673
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,810
(The unfamiliar view
makes their hearts flutter.)

1674
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,380
- Suddenly, I want to go to Europe.
- Me too.

1675
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,980
(Be careful.)

1676
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,320
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1677
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:53,690
(One step closer)

1678
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,320
- Do your feet hurt?
- No.

1679
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,390
- Are they okay?
- Yes.

1680
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,760
- These feel comfortable.
- Your boots?

1681
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,900
- Yes.
- I'm glad.

1682
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,100
Are your feet okay?

1683
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,630
I'm completely fine.
These shoes are comfortable too.

1684
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,130
This couple looks so pretty.

1685
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,470
- Do you walk a lot?
- Yes.

1686
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,140
After getting off work,
I enjoy walking like this.

1687
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,480
During lunch break, with a cup of coffee,

1688
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,850
I take a short walk.

1689
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,180
Do you like to walk?

1690
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,720
I like it too. I walk a lot.

1691
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,720
I see.

1692
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,020
I think it's this way.

1693
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,460
- Here?
- Yes.

1694
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,570
We just need to walk a little farther.

1695
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,670
Just a little farther.

1696
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,770
- Goodness. Over there.
- Oh, my.

1697
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,170
- Incredible. It's Florence Cathedral.
- That...

1698
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,140
I can't believe it.

1699
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,280
- I've...
- Yes?

1700
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,510
- seen that a lot in photos.
- Right?

1701
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,350
Seeing it in person...

1702
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,620
- Isn't it huge?
- Yes, it is.

1703
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,490
You can walk up to the top.

1704
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,090
- That top?
- Yes.

1705
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,220
- It's a long way up.
- Really?

1706
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,590
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

1707
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,630
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1708
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:07,330
The two look great together.

1709
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,660
The scenery is beautiful.

1710
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,130
And so is the couple.

1711
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,400
What?

1712
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,600
(Amazed)

1713
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,670
How gorgeous.

1714
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,410
- It's so cool.
- I feel like this deserves a photo.

1715
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,540
Let's take one.

1716
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,210
Should I take one for you?

1717
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,210
- No.
- She must be shy.

1718
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,920
Should I take one for you?

1719
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,320
- What is it?
- I feel the same way about it.

1720
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,630
(They arrived at the coffee shop
Woo Jae found.)

1721
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,370
(Impressed)

1722
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,000
- It's good. Yes.
- Is it?

1723
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,640
I think it's blueberry jam.

1724
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,210
(Eating)

1725
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,810
- Is it good?
- Look at her eyes.

1726
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,680
(What's with that look?)

1727
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,250
Already?

1728
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,820
That expression is like she's in love.

1729
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,690
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1730
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,890
- What do you think?
- It's good.

1731
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,660
(Eating)

1732
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,460
(Eating again)

1733
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,130
(Another bite)

1734
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,400
Are you a big eater?

1735
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,100
I've always eaten a lot.

1736
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,400
- You do eat a lot.
- Right?

1737
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,670
- More than I expected.
- Yes.

1738
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,770
(During tea time on the first day)

1739
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,980
(Eating)

1740
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,510
It's good.

1741
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,850
(Glancing)

1742
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,410
You have a good appetite.

1743
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,220
I was hungry.

1744
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,520
Oh, gosh.

1745
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:43,890
(Today as well,
Woo Jae has a good appetite.)

1746
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,630
(Laughing)

1747
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,030
She must've watched him a lot.

1748
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,200
Je Yeon looks a lot brighter
and more relaxed.

1749
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,770
- A lot more than ever.
- Right?

1750
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,570
Am I still green?

1751
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,740
(Flustered)

1752
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,510
I think I've given you many clues.

1753
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:06,110
Did you really read it 3 to 4 times?

1754
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,920
He's wrong.

1755
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,750
Give me a minute.

1756
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,830
(Actually, Woo Jae is...)

1757
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,600
The green is Je Yeon's.

1758
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,730
- What?
- They're tired.

1759
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,940
I'm 100 percent sure.

1760
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,000
(Earlier, when waiting for the elevator)

1761
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,310
- I'm sure.
- How come?

1762
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,610
- I'm completely sure.
- How come?

1763
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:36,440
(Convinced the Green Pairing Book
is Je Yeon's)

1764
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,140
It's so cute.

1765
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,280
My thoughts started to get jumbled up.

1766
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,950
Honestly, I can't remember
the book's content either.

1767
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,350
(Surprised)

1768
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,860
"Number 13,
my flirting skill that only I know."

1769
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,330
"Hanging around the other party."

1770
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,360
- It was Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

1771
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,530
In Episode One.

1772
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,700
She hung around him.

1773
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,630
- The light blue is Je Yeon's.
- Yes.

1774
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:03,000
If the light blue book is
indeed Je Yeon's,

1775
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,970
the monthly income she wishes to earn...

1776
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,510
with her husband is over 15,000 dollars.

1777
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,910
- "Over 15,000 dollars?"
- Okay.

1778
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,180
That means Je Yeon herself
earns a good income.

1779
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,210
If so, I feel like Je Yeon might be a pro.

1780
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,320
- I'm dying to know their jobs.
- Me too.

1781
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,620
(What could she be?)

1782
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,720
My thoughts started to get jumbled up.

1783
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,590
Honestly, I can't remember
the book's content either.

1784
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,360
Then, let's talk about the book...

1785
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,660
- Later?
- Yes.

1786
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,300
Because...

1787
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,940
I was quite certain.
But you sound as if it might not be you.

1788
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,640
- I'm confused now.
- Is that so?

1789
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,080
You could be right.

1790
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,180
Enough.

1791
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,350
"Enough."

1792
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,480
If I turn out to be wrong,

1793
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:54,050
the situation will become funny.

1794
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,760
I was too certain about it.

1795
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,270
You're probably right.

1796
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,500
She's very thoughtful.

1797
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,970
I'm 100 percent sure...

1798
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,440
she's green.

1799
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,740
I'm confident.

1800
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,110
- Green, blue.
- Green. Blue.

1801
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,650
Why do you think I'm green?

1802
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,750
- She must want to know the reason.
- Well...

1803
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,690
It's the simple and down-to-earth vibe.

1804
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,930
The actual Ms. Green must be taken aback.

1805
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:41,870
(In a way,)

1806
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:46,040
(wouldn't he wish that
I were the owner of the green book?)

1807
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,610
There's a lot of sparkly things.

1808
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,880
The jewelry pieces are very fancy.

1809
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,350
Yes, they're fancy.

1810
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,580
- How pretty.
- Do you wear fancy pieces?

1811
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,690
"Fancy pieces?" I do.

1812
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,160
- But my earring holes have closed up,
- Yes?

1813
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,360
so I mainly wear necklaces.

1814
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,900
- Mainly necklaces and no earrings?
- That's right.

1815
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

1816
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,400
(Feeling shy)

1817
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,170
Let's go over there.

1818
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,510
- Shall we look from here?
- Yes.

1819
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,710
The two suit each other really well.

1820
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,410
It's pretty.

1821
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,210
- Cool, isn't it?
- Yes. It's really cool.

1822
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:29,950
The scenery is amazing.

1823
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,750
Earlier,
you wanted to ride the canoe here.

1824
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,650
- That was the life you wanted to live.
- Yes.

1825
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,860
It's just that the person looked relaxed.

1826
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:43,930
In life,
materialistic things like money...

1827
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,130
are surely important to live.

1828
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,940
But rather than being bound to them...

1829
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,370
Do you want to lead a free and quiet life?

1830
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,670
That's what I prefer.

1831
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,640
- That must be important to him.
- He's modest.

1832
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,380
Was there anything you wanted
to buy or do in Italy?

1833
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,950
- Like shopping.
- Shopping?

1834
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,120
Italy is known for its luxury products.

1835
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,450
Luxury products?

1836
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:07,690
I can't think of...

1837
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,920
- Anything?
- anything.

1838
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,490
- Do you like luxury products?
- Luxury products?

1839
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,860
- Luxury brands.
- No.

1840
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,360
- Not really?
- No, not really.

1841
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:19,970
Me too, if I'm being honest.

1842
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,470
I don't really like them.

1843
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,740
- You don't?
- I don't think I do.

1844
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,180
In order to become Ms. Green.

1845
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,320
(Nodding)

1846
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,750
In my later years,

1847
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,520
I want to live a peaceful life.

1848
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,890
What about you, Je Yeon?

1849
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,530
Same here.

1850
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,300
Is that so?

1851
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:02,110
(Are their feelings
coming to an understanding?)

1852
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,920
This place.

1853
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,390
(The second place Woo Jae found
is a pizza place.)

1854
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,620
It'll be so cool if he orders in Italian.

1855
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,960
Should we head farther inside?
We can sit here.

1856
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,540
(Kneading)

1857
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:32,370
We can see them make pizza.

1858
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,570
You're right.

1859
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,010
(Proceeding with the dough first)

1860
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,780
(Plump)

1861
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,820
The wood-fired oven is over there.

1862
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,320
It's cooked inside a wood-fired oven.

1863
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,290
The dough must be thin.

1864
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:53,560
It seems like it.

1865
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,760
Should we order Margherita pizza?

1866
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,660
- Or are you craving something else?
- Let's get Margherita.

1867
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,700
- Are you okay with it?
- Yes.

1868
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,400
Lasagna or ragu?

1869
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,170
Are you fine with both being tomato-based?

1870
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,510
There's also carbonara and cacio e pepe.

1871
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,510
- Carbonara.
- Carbonara?

1872
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,380
She looks cuter
with her hair tucked behind her ears.

1873
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,650
It won't be too much, right?

1874
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,920
Ordering a carbonara and a lasagna
won't be too much, right?

1875
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,990
- Diet Coke?
- Diet Coke, please.

1876
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,260
Would you like to order?

1877
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,490
- One margherita pizza.
- Yes.

1878
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,630
- Perfect.
- How cool.

1879
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,700
One spaghetti.

1880
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,870
- Only pizza can be ordered right now.
- Is that so?

1881
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,240
How about two types of pizzas?

1882
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,440
- What a bummer.
- I know, right?

1883
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,570
- But why only pizza?
- Exactly.

1884
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,480
(Impressed)

1885
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,550
Nice, isn't it?

1886
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,980
- We can watch them.
- This is a nice spot.

1887
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,520
- Can I take a video?
- Sure.

1888
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:54,990
I asked if I could take a video.

1889
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:57,160
(Surprised)

1890
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,530
(Interesting moments should be recorded.)

1891
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,670
That's his favorite type of pizza.

1892
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,900
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1893
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,770
What is that? Sausages?

1894
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,800
Yes, sausages.

1895
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,510
It's Italian sausages.

1896
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,740
(Understood)

1897
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,980
That's Margherita.

1898
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:22,780
It looks good.

1899
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,790
Before it's put into the wood-fired oven,

1900
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,890
the dough is stretched out.

1901
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:29,760
They have a wood-fired oven.

1902
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,260
Many will order pizza
while watching the show today.

1903
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,660
It looks good.

1904
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,870
How long will it take?

1905
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,070
I'm not sure.

1906
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,710
Maybe around ten minutes?

1907
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,110
(Golden brown)

1908
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,280
It looks delicious.

1909
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:02,250
(Two freshly baked pizzas)

1910
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,320
(They look amazing.)

1911
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,690
(Topping it off with some olive oil)

1912
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,260
Please cut it for us.

1913
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,800
- Do you want it cut?
- Yes.

1914
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,830
He's quite good at Italian.

1915
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,870
(Being cut as requested by Woo Jae)

1916
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:17,940
It looks appetizing.

1917
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,970
She's adorable.

1918
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,810
- Margherita.
- Yes.

1919
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,480
- Just a second. I'll bring the diet Coke.
- Okay.

1920
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,510
- Oh, gosh. They look really good.
- Goodness.

1921
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:32,850
It looks good.

1922
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,190
Should I switch the plates?

1923
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,460
No. We can pass a piece to each other.

1924
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,100
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1925
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,280
It's good.

1926
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,580
- Isn't it good?
- It is. It's really good.

1927
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,650
It's delicious.

1928
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:09,620
- It's moist.
- Yes, and soft.

1929
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,130
You haven't had a proper piece
of this yet, have you?

1930
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,160
The sausage.

1931
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,300
When you try this,
make sure to savor it well.

1932
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,930
- Why?
- It's that good.

1933
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,240
I find this sausage better than...

1934
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,240
that of Germany.

1935
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1936
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,480
(She immediately eats a piece.)

1937
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,610
The way she eats is so pretty.

1938
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,280
Isn't it good?

1939
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,180
The more I chew it, the more tasty it is.

1940
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,590
(Feeling proud)

1941
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:40,620
He's happy.

1942
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:43,060
(They Click, and They Don't.)

1943
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,390
What pizza do you like in Korea?

1944
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,330
Margherita even in Korea.

1945
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,430
Me too.

1946
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,670
Do...

1947
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,040
you eat Hawaiian pizza or not?

1948
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,200
- The one with pineapples?
- Yes.

1949
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,970
- You don't like it, do you?
- I'd rather not eat it.

1950
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,440
- I don't like it.
- Really?

1951
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,010
(Hesitating)

1952
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,380
I kind of...

1953
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,350
like Hawaiian pizza.

1954
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,860
(So he likes Hawaiian pizza.)

1955
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,460
He sounded determined. What now?

1956
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:18,520
Woo Jae was stern about it.

1957
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,860
"I like it."

1958
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,790
(How interesting.)

1959
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,660
I like Hawaiian pizza.

1960
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,100
- Really? The ones with pineapples?
- Yes.

1961
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,100
Six out of ten times,

1962
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,710
I eat Hawaiian pizza.

1963
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,480
To me, Hawaiian pizza is a bit...

1964
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,210
- You don't eat it much, right?
- No.

1965
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,320
Which season do you like the most?

1966
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,390
I prefer spring and autumn.

1967
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,620
It's not too cold or hot.

1968
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,260
What about you?

1969
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,630
If I had to choose one, it'd be spring.

1970
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,960
Spring? Why?

1971
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,900
(Thinking)

1972
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,210
Which month is your birthday in?

1973
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,340
- Sorry?
- Your birthday.

1974
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,540
May.

1975
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,610
- May? Me too.
- Yes.

1976
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,810
- May?
- May.

1977
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,920
- It's in spring.
- That's why I like spring the most.

1978
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,450
Because my birthday is in May.

1979
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,160
May when?

1980
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,820
- The 19th.
- The 19th?

1981
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,630
Mine's on the 11th.

1982
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,000
Those are the warmest days.

1983
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:31,830
- Yours is earlier.
- It's similar.

1984
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,170
Yes. May in Korea is beautiful.

1985
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,400
It's when the weather is amazing.

1986
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,800
- In May.
- True.

1987
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,510
You can't help but think
good things will happen.

1988
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,480
Is that why you like green the most?

1989
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,550
- Maybe not?
- But she's not Ms. Green.

1990
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,910
Goodness.

1991
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,280
Okay. I'll stop.

1992
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,650
- But I do like green.
- I see.

1993
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,290
I like green too.

1994
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,090
The drawing was very nice.

1995
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,330
- By whom?
- Mr. Blue.

1996
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,760
- Is that so?
- Blue is Woo Jae.

1997
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,400
- Is blue Woo Jae?
- Was it nice?

1998
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:07,500
Yes. You haven't seen it yet, have you?

1999
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,300
No.

2000
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,870
You must be curious.

2001
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,470
How was Ms. Green's drawing?

2002
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:16,140
- It was cute.
- Was it?

2003
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,250
I want to see Ms. Green's drawing.

2004
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,820
She's bothered by it.

2005
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:24,150
She's not Ms. Green.

2006
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,590
- Green is...
- Ji Won.

2007
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,790
- Really?
- Green is...

2008
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:30,920
(Revealing it to the panelists)

2009
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,730
- I was right.
- Green is Ji Won.

2010
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,630
The women haven't seen
each other's book, right?

2011
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,900
Yesterday, I...

2012
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,240
thought you were an office worker.

2013
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:46,710
- Me?
- Yes.

2014
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,980
But I could be wrong.

2015
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,650
Why did you think so?

2016
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,450
It's just a hunch...

2017
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,320
- A hunch?
- that you might be in the art industry.

2018
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,380
Art industry?

2019
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,620
That could be cool.

2020
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,660
- You're digging in outside.
- I am, aren't I?

2021
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,200
(Laughing)

2022
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,470
(How is it?)

2023
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,840
Thank you.

2024
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,440
I'm too full to get up.

2025
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,180
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

2026
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,210
If it's not cold,

2027
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,510
- I can take you to the place I mentioned.
- The hill?

2028
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,910
But it'll be super cold there.

2029
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,620
It looks like this.

2030
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,520
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

2031
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
(Fidgeting)

2032
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,590
You get this kind of view.

2033
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,330
You can see the night view
of the city at a glance.

2034
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:40,330
I see.

2035
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:44,400
That's why there are so many people
sitting on the steps.

2036
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,930
They drink beer while admiring the view.

2037
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,100
- It must be beautiful on a snowy day.
- Yes.

2038
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,410
- My gosh.
- So beautiful.

2039
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,750
(It's time for them to go back.)

2040
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,110
(Their short visit in the city
due to the short winter day...)

2041
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,480
(brings a sense of disappointment.)

2042
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,390
It's more beautiful at night, right?

2043
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,760
I bet it's more beautiful.

2044
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,320
- Yes. With the lights on and everything.
- Right.

2045
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,200
I think this will be a memorable day.

2046
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,160
- It will be very memorable.
- Yes.

2047
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,500
Florence.

2048
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,580
Gosh, that's a gelato shop.

2049
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,110
Just like that?

2050
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,950
- I saw people eating gelato...
- Yes.

2051
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:37,450
on the street earlier.

2052
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,720
It was from this shop.

2053
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:41,790
- Should we have one?
- Do you want to try it?

2054
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,360
Do you want to try it?

2055
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,800
(Humming)

2056
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,930
- It's so refreshing.
- Is that good?

2057
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,970
- Right?
- Yes.

2058
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,670
I see people coming.

2059
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:02,840
(A street band shows up.)

2060
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,880
What's going on?

2061
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,780
(Chuckling)

2062
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,830
- They seem happy.
- Yes.

2063
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:31,800
(A warm night falls over Florence.)

2064
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,410
That's Piazzale Michelangelo.

2065
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:40,450
- Where?
- Over there.

2066
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,210
- There?
- People look at the city from there.

2067
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,280
I see.

2068
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,820
They look great together.

2069
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:47,350
Watching them together feels natural.

2070
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,590
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

2071
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,360
Not yet?

2072
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,030
My goodness.

2073
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,140
It'd look great
if we took a picture here together.

2074
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,740
(It'd look great
if we took a picture here together.)

2075
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:22,050
(Je Yeon and Woo Jae,
Together in Florence)

2076
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,390
It's enjoyable to watch them together.

2077
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,990
(What kind of couple would that be?)

2078
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,730
When it's just Je Yeon and Woo Jae,

2079
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,130
- she expresses herself a lot.
- Yes.

2080
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,030
She makes it obvious that she likes him.
She smiles a lot too.

2081
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,270
When she's with the group,
she doesn't do anything.

2082
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,930
- She doesn't talk to...
- She rarely talks too.

2083
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,200
other people.

2084
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,040
I think Je Yeon is happy
as long as she's with Woo Jae.

2085
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,570
- She just loves being with him.
- She's just happy.

2086
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:44,780
She likes him even if Woo Jae isn't funny
like a comedian and doesn't entertain her.

2087
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,110
On the other hand,
Woo Jae is just getting to know her.

2088
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,050
Personally,
the entertainment aspect isn't important.

2089
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:52,280
- Is that so?
- So...

2090
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,950
it's so important for me
not to feel drained by the person.

2091
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:58,960
There were times
people I found quite fun to be with...

2092
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,630
weren't considered fun by others.

2093
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,800
- I see.
- I think...

2094
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:07,230
Woo Jae can match
her energy level or pace.

2095
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:10,000
He must be the type of guy
she's attracted to.

2096
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,970
- This is nice.
- This place...

2097
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:14,670
looks like a home.

2098
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,170
- Right. This place is great.
- How beautiful.

2099
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:19,850
(Chang Hwan, Chan Hyeong, and Ha Neul
enter a cozy restaurant.)

2100
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:24,750
I see salmon.
I also saw lamb on the front page.

2101
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,390
Lamb is on the menu too.

2102
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,390
- Didn't you say you liked lamb?
- I did.

2103
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,860
Let's ask for a lamb chop.

2104
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,290
(Laughing)

2105
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:33,660
(The morning of the day before)

2106
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,060
What's your favorite kind of meat?

2107
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:36,460
- Lamb chops.
- Lamb chops?

2108
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,500
I like having lamb chops with mint jelly.

2109
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,530
I see.

2110
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:40,570
- With mint jelly?
- Yes.

2111
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,970
Chan Hyeong remembers a lot about her.

2112
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:45,670
He's glancing at her.

2113
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:48,840
Do you want to try the lamb chop?

2114
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:51,280
- Sounds good.
- One lamb chop.

2115
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,950
I see lasagna too.

2116
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,350
Sounds good.

2117
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,050
That's perfect.

2118
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,920
(Smiling)

2119
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,550
I see carbonara.

2120
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,490
- Carbonara sounds good.
- You said we should try carbonara.

2121
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,460
- Yes. As a side dish.
- We can order a carbonara...

2122
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,660
- and lasagna.
- Should we order a lasagna too?

2123
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,790
He seems quite attentive to her.

2124
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:08,930
- Great. Shall we order?
- Okay.

2125
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,530
(Chang Hwan steps aside for a moment
after ordering.)

2126
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,530
- I'm going to use the restroom.
- Sure.

2127
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,330
(Chang Hwan steps aside for a moment
after ordering.)

2128
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:16,600
I wonder what they'll talk about.

2129
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,570
(Awkward)

2130
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,610
I don't know how my hair looks right now.

2131
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,480
- It looks totally fine.
- Does it look the same?

2132
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,880
- Does it look the same?
- You can just fix it here.

2133
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,950
(Gentle)

2134
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,780
Does it look the same?

2135
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,090
- How nice.
- That's...

2136
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,550
Look at him smile.

2137
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,460
But I rarely wear my bangs down like this.

2138
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,590
- You look great with your bangs down.
- So...

2139
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,630
- Really?
- Yes.

2140
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:41,430
- You look like a puppy.
- Thank you.

2141
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,060
Exactly. I don't like that.

2142
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,030
- You don't like that? Why not?
- I want to look manly...

2143
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,000
- rather than cute.
- But not all puppies...

2144
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,430
- are cute.
- That's right.

2145
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,070
I'd rather be cute then.

2146
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:53,510
- Wait. That doesn't feel right.
- He's shy,

2147
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,970
which isn't like him.

2148
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,310
They make a cute couple.

2149
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,610
Do you usually wear your hair
the same way?

2150
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,080
Right. My hair is usually straight.

2151
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,550
Actually, I often tie my hair up.

2152
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:08,720
I tie it up in a ponytail.

2153
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,220
- I also style my hair in a top bun.
- Really? I bet you look great in it.

2154
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,390
Or a low bun too.

2155
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,830
You haven't tied your hair up here, right?

2156
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,430
- I tied my hair on the first day.
- After getting here.

2157
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,000
- On the first day when we were cooking.
- Oh, no.

2158
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,830
We cooked together.

2159
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,700
She did tie her hair.

2160
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,870
(Ha Neul and Chan Hyeong cooked together
on the first day of moving in.)

2161
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,080
(Ha Neul tied her hair.)

2162
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,380
When men hear that kind of thing
from women they like,

2163
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,910
they get flustered and startled.

2164
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:35,950
That's right.

2165
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,420
Yes, you tied your hair then.

2166
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,050
- That crossed my mind too.
- "I see."

2167
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,990
- "Oh, right."
- "Right."

2168
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,620
"Yes, you did tie your hair then."

2169
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,190
Yes, you tied your hair then.

2170
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,190
- You don't remember.
- You did. No, I just remembered.

2171
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,690
- You don't remember.
- I remember it now.

2172
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,730
You did.

2173
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,730
- You don't remember it.
- You tied your hair.

2174
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,330
She should ask him to describe the style.

2175
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,970
- What kind of style was it?
- Oh, no.

2176
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,100
It was a beautiful hairstyle.

2177
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,140
(Sweating)

2178
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,140
- I think you tied it well.
- Ha Neul seems to be enjoying this.

2179
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,510
You're so funny. You don't remember it,
but you're pretending that you do.

2180
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,280
- No.
- He's growing on her.

2181
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,740
- I'm disappointed.
- That was a good answer.

2182
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,050
(Feeling bad)

2183
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,880
How disappointing.

2184
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,850
- She's teasing him.
- They're cute.

2185
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,520
I'll remember it from now on.

2186
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:18,560
There's something about Ha Neul.
She makes people feel comfortable.

2187
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,330
- Yes.
- It's not awkward with her.

2188
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,460
- She makes them feel at ease.
- Yes.

2189
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,130
Chan Hyeong might end up...

2190
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,230
falling for Ha Neul to no end.

2191
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:26,670
(Just like the sky)

2192
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,100
(As they enjoy each other's company
and chat,)

2193
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,600
(their food is served.)

2194
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,770
- I think we'll be able to finish them.
- Yes.

2195
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,310
- Right? This is good.
- We ordered the right number of dishes.

2196
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:36,340
Right.

2197
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,410
- That looks good.
- Everything looks so tasty.

2198
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:40,910
Great.

2199
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:42,380
(Slicing)

2200
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:45,180
Since you like your meat rare,
let me serve you first.

2201
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,520
- Nice.
- Here you go.

2202
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:49,320
- Thank you.
- Do you order your meat rare...

2203
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,620
- even in Korea?
- Yes.

2204
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,990
- Which one do you want?
- Do you order your meat rare?

2205
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:53,960
- I like my meat medium rare.
- Then this piece is perfect for you.

2206
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,990
- Thank you.
- This is the perfect doneness for me.

2207
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:59,930
Thank you. Enjoy your food.

2208
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:01,670
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy. Eat a lot.

2209
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,570
(Humming)

2210
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,980
- It's tasty.
- She said it was tasty...

2211
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,640
- while looking at Chan Hyeong.
- This is great.

2212
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,450
Right. This is tasty.

2213
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,050
How was everyone's first impression...

2214
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:17,720
when you arrived yesterday?

2215
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,550
- You want me to go over everyone?
- Yes.

2216
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:24,690
Ji Min said I might be the oldest one...

2217
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,260
- What do you mean?
- among women.

2218
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,690
- I doubt it.
- My goodness.

2219
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,800
Really?

2220
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:35,330
(Feeling shy for some reason)

2221
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:37,970
No way.

2222
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:42,140
He must feel bothered by Chang Hwan.

2223
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:49,480
Chan Hyeong seems to be on alert
around Chang Hwan. Right?

2224
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,980
- He was quite flustered.
- Yes, he seemed very flustered.

2225
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,720
I think Chang Hwan likes Ha Neul.

2226
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:55,920
Chan Hyeong also likes her.

2227
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,290
Gosh, this is beautiful.

2228
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:03,460
This is the typical Christmas season
in Europe.

2229
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,530
- I love Christmas.
- Really?

2230
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:06,700
- Yes.
- Yes, you said that yesterday.

2231
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,900
This street already feels like
Christmas is here.

2232
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,900
Do you have any Christmas dreams?

2233
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,840
I loved watching "Home Alone."

2234
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,810
- I love that Christmas vibe.
- "Home Alone."

2235
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,710
- That's a nice feeling.
- The warm feeling.

2236
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,880
- Right.
- I see.

2237
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,480
I love having hot chocolate.

2238
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:23,080
- With a lot of marshmallows.
- I see.

2239
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,950
I wonder if I'll be able to
come back here.

2240
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:29,550
Seriously. I think this is a place...

2241
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,820
- I would love to return to in the future.
- Right?

2242
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,960
- Totally.
- How beautiful.

2243
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,760
In the future,
we might even come back here together.

2244
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:37,830
If we do, that will be so nostalgic.

2245
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:38,930
Right.

2246
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,830
"Remember? We went there before."

2247
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,900
- Right. Yes.
- We'd be speaking causally then.

2248
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,970
- My gosh.
- How beautiful.

2249
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,640
It's a great place to fall in love.

2250
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,940
(As they dream of becoming closer
to one another...)

2251
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,410
- The environment plays a huge role.
- Right.

2252
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,490
There's traffic.

2253
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,190
(Glancing)

2254
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,760
- Do you drive with your left hand?
- Yes.

2255
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,030
Leaving my right hand to be free.

2256
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:12,560
He's cute.

2257
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,900
- Why is that?
- To hold hands.

2258
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,230
There's a reason for that.

2259
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,040
Why is that?

2260
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:21,170
Well,

2261
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,370
situations call for it.

2262
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,340
- It looks as if they're already dating.
- Why is that?

2263
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,550
- I think she asked him that for a reason.
- Right.

2264
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:30,480
- Chan Hyeong is so charming.
- Yes.

2265
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,520
(Brimming with charms)

2266
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:35,720
- I guess you had to use your hand a lot.
- No.

2267
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,060
So far, there wasn't any case for that.

2268
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,620
I was preparing for the future.

2269
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,330
- So cute.
- That answer was smooth.

2270
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,930
The more you get to know him,
the more charming he is.

2271
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,960
(Smiling)

2272
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:50,340
I'm going to ask everyone
what they did in the city.

2273
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,470
(Thinking)

2274
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,240
I'll listen to how much
Ji Min enjoyed his day.

2275
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:58,240
- She keeps mentioning him.
- I wonder how it was with them.

2276
01:37:58,340 --> 01:37:59,580
I'm fascinated.

2277
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:02,380
You know what? Even yesterday,

2278
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,420
- Ji Won...
- Yes?

2279
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,120
I think she went to him...

2280
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,920
- and asked him to play the music.
- I see. Yes.

2281
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,860
I think...

2282
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,930
she is... You know.

2283
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,560
- What do you mean?
- I think she's interested...

2284
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,130
- So Ji Won is interested in Ji Min.
- in him.

2285
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:21,570
And I think Ji Min genuinely
wanted to go to the plaza.

2286
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,170
"I must go there."

2287
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:25,970
- Ha Neul's face is slightly stiffening.
- So...

2288
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,910
I think you guys can get going first.

2289
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,310
- Shall we?
- Yes.

2290
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:30,980
- Bye.
- See you later.

2291
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,980
(In no time,)

2292
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:39,620
(the three of them get closer
to the house.)

2293
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,020
Here's what I think.

2294
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:44,090
It does seem Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul...

2295
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,930
have gotten to know one another well
and bonded.

2296
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,530
But they sort of ended up...

2297
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:50,460
becoming good friends.

2298
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,200
But I can tell from Chan Hyeong's eyes
that he likes her.

2299
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,070
- He definitely likes her.
- Right?

2300
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:58,970
He clearly likes her.
She doesn't mind that he likes her.

2301
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:01,910
But her feeling isn't that strong.
That's what I think.

2302
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:03,640
It seems that way to me.

2303
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:08,080
(Their day in Florence has ended.)

2304
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,660
That was fast.

2305
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,860
I'm comfortable in this outfit.

2306
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,430
I'll change after I take a shower.

2307
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:22,530
Look at your feet.

2308
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,960
I should hide them.

2309
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,970
You're also barefoot. No?

2310
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:29,300
- I'm also barefoot.
- Right?

2311
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,170
- She sat next to him.
- Wait.

2312
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,070
- Do you like beer?
- That's a signal.

2313
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,340
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

2314
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,080
(Smiling)

2315
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,010
- My gosh. What's going on?
- Oh, my.

2316
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:43,150
- Look. There are so many empty seats.
- What is this?

2317
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:46,790
I usually go for a beer.

2318
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:48,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2319
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:50,220
- My gosh.
- Beer...

2320
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,190
- Do you get drunk on beer?
- Gosh, she's facing him now.

2321
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,530
Probably.
If I drink a lot of it, won't I get drunk?

2322
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:55,630
Is she making herself comfortable there?

2323
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:57,860
Beer doesn't make you tipsy?

2324
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,530
- I see. Beer does nothing for you?
- No. It's not that.

2325
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:01,970
Beer makes me full.

2326
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:03,840
But here's the thing about beer.

2327
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,640
People can drink beer nonstop
while talking.

2328
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,970
The two of them click well when they talk.

2329
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:09,040
(She's in a comfortable position
as she faces him.)

2330
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,340
- Right.
- They're getting into the vibe.

2331
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,410
That's why beer feels
more like a beverage than alcohol.

2332
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,320
- Your tolerance for alcohol must be high.
- No.

2333
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,820
That's not true. Seriously.

2334
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,360
- It was nice that Chang Hwan joined us.
- Yes.

2335
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:27,460
A ladybug?

2336
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,260
- Aren't you scared?
- It's been a while since I saw one.

2337
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,700
- Am I scared of a ladybug?
- Yes.

2338
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,630
I used to love bugs when I was a kid.

2339
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,530
When you were a little kid,
did you live in a single-family home?

2340
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,530
Yes.

2341
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:41,510
You're telling me everything.

2342
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,880
Wait. Did I write that in the book?

2343
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,740
- That's why I brought it up.
- I see.

2344
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,050
I see.

2345
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,580
- The blue one.
- Yes, the blue one.

2346
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,850
The blue one. Yes.

2347
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,950
- The blue book mentioned the house.
- Yes.

2348
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:54,790
- Yes, it was in a certain town.
- Right.

2349
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,320
She figured it out.

2350
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,120
- They figured out each other's color.
- That's why she asked him that.

2351
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,660
I thought the writing was excellent.

2352
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,830
Whose writing?

2353
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,500
- They figured out each other's color.
- Me?

2354
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,830
What do you think is my color?
How could you be sure?

2355
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:10,340
You know,
everyone has their writing style.

2356
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:11,740
There's an energy...

2357
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,770
you can feel from the writing style.

2358
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:15,710
- They've gotten quite close.
- Just...

2359
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,910
Right. It was just different.

2360
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,450
There was a book in a bright color.

2361
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,110
It was so bright...

2362
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,480
that it was colorless.

2363
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:24,980
Who could that be?

2364
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,290
Who could that be? I have no idea.

2365
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:30,050
(The blue book is in Ha Neul's hands.)

2366
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,290
She's reading the blue book.

2367
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,330
(The white book is
in Chan Hyeong's hands.)

2368
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:35,630
They're reading each other's book.

2369
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,600
(They chose each other's Pairing Book.)

2370
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,760
They chose each other's Pairing Book.

2371
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,570
Ha Neul is great at drawing.

2372
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:44,740
- Hey, you're back.
- Yes, we're back.

2373
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:51,880
- Here's to another great day.
- Cheers.

2374
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,650
(They get together
before ending their third night.)

2375
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:02,050
What did you two talk about nonstop?

2376
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,620
We talked a lot. Didn't we?

2377
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:05,860
(Glancing)

2378
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:08,230
She started to tease me too.

2379
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,800
She said my reaction was entertaining,
so she started to tease me.

2380
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,900
We just followed
our stream of consciousness.

2381
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,800
- We talked about what we liked.
- Chang Hwan seems interested in Ji Won.

2382
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:22,540
I'm most curious
about the day these two had.

2383
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,510
Did you two talk?

2384
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,080
- Us?
- Yes.

2385
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,350
Did you guys talk to each other?

2386
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:31,780
Of course.

2387
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,520
Do you think you can count
how many exchanges you had?

2388
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,920
That's possible.

2389
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,120
- That's possible?
- What? What's going on?

2390
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,730
We...

2391
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,090
kept talking without a break.

2392
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:47,000
(Nodding)

2393
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,170
What did you two talk about?

2394
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,800
Ji Min. My gosh.

2395
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,640
What did we talk about?

2396
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,740
(Thinking)

2397
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:58,980
We looked for places to go.

2398
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:01,650
Right. We looked for places to go. And...

2399
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:04,280
But I think we've gotten close
after today.

2400
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,480
- In what way do you feel close to her?
- My goodness.

2401
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,990
She's shyer when she's in a group.

2402
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:12,820
Since we're in a group
and have to stay inside,

2403
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,530
she's a bit shy for now.

2404
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:17,030
But once we were out,
she was actually more talkative.

2405
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,260
Right.

2406
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,100
Je Yeon, I'm kind of disappointed...

2407
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,870
because you sound different.

2408
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,370
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

2409
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,100
Well, he tried to draw attention from her.

2410
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,170
- Right.
- Isn't that a nice method?

2411
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:29,070
I'm okay with his approach.

2412
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:31,410
Je Yeon, I'm kind of disappointed...

2413
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:33,180
because you sound different.

2414
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:35,910
(Glancing)

2415
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:39,580
(Flustered)

2416
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,920
- Do I?
- You seem happier.

2417
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,590
It felt like, "I like it this way."

2418
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,090
- Just kidding.
- Oh, no.

2419
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,160
- I was only joking.
- You sounded like you meant it.

2420
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:58,900
I'm sorry.

2421
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,270
For ruining the mood.

2422
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,640
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

2423
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,240
Cheers.

2424
01:44:06,610 --> 01:44:12,950
(What was Ji Min's intention
with his joke?)

2425
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:21,690
(Do you see paired couples?)

2426
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:26,600
(Mission 2: Guess the results
of tonight's pairing now.)

2427
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,170
Today, it's a team mission.

2428
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:30,400
The number of paired couples...

2429
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,800
who messaged each other.

2430
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:36,410
And their names.

2431
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:38,640
We have to discuss and guess them.

2432
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:39,980
(Let's get it today.)

2433
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,350
For Chang Hwan to receive any votes,

2434
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:44,950
- he didn't have much time.
- He couldn't appeal himself.

2435
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,620
I'd say Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.

2436
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,220
- Me too. Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.
- Right.

2437
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,520
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul are certain.

2438
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,520
I think Je Yeon texted Woo Jae.

2439
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,200
I think Je Yeon is firm.

2440
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,300
(Je Yeon is firm about Woo Jae.)

2441
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,570
- But I'm not sure about Woo Jae.
- Right.

2442
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:03,170
I think we missed something important.

2443
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,170
(What's that?)

2444
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:07,110
Because Ji Min was curious about Je Yeon,

2445
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:09,870
he kept asking questions.

2446
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,880
- And Woo Jae was a little upset.
- Right.

2447
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:15,910
And he argued Je Yeon didn't talk much...

2448
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,220
in front of everyone,

2449
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,580
but she talked a lot...

2450
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,680
- when they were alone.
- Right.

2451
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,350
It wasn't quite like him to show off.

2452
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:26,090
Was that because Ji Min provoked him?

2453
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,790
So he might have texted Je Yeon.

2454
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,790
I agree.

2455
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:31,530
I believe in the power of Florence.

2456
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,730
Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2457
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,630
They enjoyed that moment.

2458
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:37,600
That makes sense. Woo Jae and Je Yeon.

2459
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:42,110
And Ji Min made it official...

2460
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:43,440
- that he liked Je Yeon.
- Right.

2461
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,340
- He pretty much declared it.
- He announced it.

2462
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,310
Ji Min pointed Je Yeon out.

2463
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:52,180
- Right.
- If he hadn't done that,

2464
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:53,680
- Ji Won would've been firm.
- I agree.

2465
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,220
He was drawing a line.

2466
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,320
- It would've hurt her pride.
- Totally.

2467
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,490
Especially in front of Ji Won.

2468
01:45:57,490 --> 01:46:00,320
From a man's perspective,
he's not interested in Ji Won at all.

2469
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,690
- Right.
- So Ji Won was...

2470
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:02,790
very offended.

2471
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:04,460
Poor Ji Won.

2472
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,800
- He treated her like a friend.
- Yes.

2473
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,730
When it's obvious that she's into him.

2474
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:12,870
I doubt that Ji Won texted Ji Min
this time.

2475
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:14,910
- I agree.
- Not this time.

2476
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:17,140
But then she wouldn't suddenly text...

2477
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:20,710
Woo Jae or Chang Hwan or Chan Hyeong.

2478
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:24,080
She might say, "I still like you."

2479
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,280
Oh, I don't know.

2480
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,620
I expect Ji Won to text Ji Min.

2481
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:28,990
- Two couples?
- Okay.

2482
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:30,020
- Two couples.
- Done.

2483
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,720
The rest would have crossed.

2484
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:36,860
First, let's check Chang Hwan.

2485
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,000
(Ha Neul who approached him first?)

2486
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,300
Chang Hwan?

2487
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:44,500
(Who did...)

2488
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,540
(Chang Hwan choose?)

2489
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,110
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2490
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,880
(Chang Hwan chose Ha Neul.)

2491
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,080
Ha Neul.

2492
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,950
Chang Hwan likes Ha Neul.

2493
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,420
We were most certain about...

2494
01:46:58,580 --> 01:46:59,720
Chan Hyeong's heart. What about him?

2495
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,750
(Revealing Chan Hyeong's result)

2496
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:03,750
(Does he still like Ha Neul?)

2497
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,320
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2498
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,330
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

2499
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:09,590
I knew it.

2500
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:11,400
It'd be weird for him
to choose anyone else.

2501
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,830
- Right. That'd be weird.
- Okay.

2502
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:14,330
Let's check Ha Neul.

2503
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,470
- Chan Hyeong.
- Chan Hyeong.

2504
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:17,200
Who did Ha Neul choose?

2505
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:21,740
(Sometimes, she eyed Ji Min.)

2506
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:25,240
(She made long eye contact
with Chan Hyeong.)

2507
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,980
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2508
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:29,980
(Ha Neul chose Chan Hyeong.)

2509
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,380
She chose Chan Hyeong.

2510
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,780
Let's check Ji Won's heart.

2511
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,820
Is it still the same?

2512
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,690
(Ji Won appealed to Ji Min with passion.)

2513
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:42,530
(How did her heart change after the date?)

2514
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:45,360
She still had a good time with Ji Min.

2515
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,800
She might have texted Ji Min.

2516
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:49,070
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2517
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:52,040
(Ji Won chose Ji Min.)

2518
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,610
- She's firm.
- She's cool.

2519
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,710
- Next is Ji Min.
- Yes.

2520
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:58,840
- We're getting worried.
- Yes.

2521
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:00,380
My gosh.

2522
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:02,710
He made it clear that he liked Je Yeon.

2523
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:03,780
Yes.

2524
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:10,150
(Ji Min watched Je Yeon
with his unique eyes.)

2525
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:14,960
(Did he hide his gaze behind his smile?)

2526
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:16,290
Je Yeon.

2527
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:19,130
(Looking forward
to seeing Ji Min's choice)

2528
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:20,700
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2529
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,130
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2530
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:25,340
- See?
- He's firm.

2531
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,340
- His heart won't change.
- We confirmed it once again.

2532
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,340
He's straightforward.

2533
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:30,580
I feel bad for Ji Won.

2534
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,240
- He made it so obvious.
- Oh, Ji Won.

2535
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,680
But in a way, Ji Min drew a line today.

2536
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,880
(He drew a clear line.)

2537
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,050
So he could argue...

2538
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:40,280
that he's firm.

2539
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:42,220
This is getting serious.

2540
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,690
We're narrowing it down.

2541
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,290
Let's check Je Yeon's heart.

2542
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:47,630
- Je Yeon.
- Who did Je Yeon choose?

2543
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:48,730
(Who did she choose?)

2544
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,960
(She had a good time
on a date with Woo Jae.)

2545
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:58,100
(Did she express her heart
to the man she got along with?)

2546
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,800
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2547
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,840
(Jae Yeon chose Woo Jae.)

2548
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:05,640
- Mamma mia.
- She's firm.

2549
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,910
This is the last one. This will...

2550
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:10,110
Lastly, it's Woo Jae. He...

2551
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:13,150
- He must choose Je Yeon.
- He must choose Je Yeon, so we can...

2552
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,420
Je Yeon.

2553
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:18,160
(He can't stop looking at her.)

2554
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,620
(Did he take a step closer to Je Yeon?)

2555
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:21,260
It'd be nice.

2556
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:23,660
(Nervous)

2557
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,900
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous.

2558
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:27,160
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2559
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:30,270
(Woo Jae chose Je Yeon.)

2560
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:32,170
(Woo Jae and Je Yeon paired.)

2561
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:33,370
- I knew it.
- We were right.

2562
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,470
(They succeeded in predicting.)

2563
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:36,410
- I had a good hunch, right?
- Good job.

2564
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:38,010
- I knew it.
- Mamma mia.

2565
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:40,910
Two couples paired.

2566
01:49:40,910 --> 01:49:42,250
Ji Won.

2567
01:49:43,150 --> 01:49:45,320
Woo Jae and Je Yeon finally paired.

2568
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:48,790
Woo Jae switched from Ji Won to Je Yeon.

2569
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:52,560
- I think it's a signal for a new start.
- That he's starting to like her?

2570
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,820
Maybe.

2571
01:49:54,160 --> 01:50:00,130
(Woo Jae, Je Yeon)

2572
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:06,070
(Chan Hyeong, Ha Neul)

2573
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,570
I think we need that time.

2574
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,470
(We need to spend time paired up.)

2575
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:16,010
(There are 4 men and 3 women.)

2576
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:22,990
(Men start moving.)

2577
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,420
(You have fair hands.)

2578
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:28,530
- I have long fingers.
- Let me see.

2579
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:30,700
(Be bold.)

2580
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:35,970
(Tell the person you want
before you leave.)

2581
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:39,070
(If you're going to do it,)

2582
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:40,770
(do it now.)

2583
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,710
I was told to choose on my own.

2584
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:43,740
Is she inside?

2585
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:44,940
(Striding)

2586
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:46,740
(Let me talk to her.)

2587
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,610
(Do you have plans?)

2588
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:53,780
Do you want to travel with me today?

2589
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:03,390
It's the first time for both of us.

2590
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,500
That's why I like it.

2591
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,430
I like to make eye contact when I talk.

2592
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:07,770
Me too.

2593
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:11,940
What's your type?

2594
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,210
Anything you want to say or tell me?

2595
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:17,210
I dreamed of it since I was young.

2596
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:18,740
- Are their occupations revealed?
- Are they revealing their occupations?

2597
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,980
Oh, my gosh.

2598
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,950
For real?
